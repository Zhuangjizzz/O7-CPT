The diode is the most basic electronic device. In fact, its invention, over a century ago, is credited with ushering in the era of electronics. Like the resistor, the diode comes with two terminals; however, unlike the bidirectional resistor, the diode carries current only in one direction. For a qualitative understanding of how this can happen, think of the early diodes, which were of the vacuum-tube type. A vacuum diode had an incandescent filament called a cathode, acting as a copious source of free electrons, and a plate called an anode, to control current flow. Applying a positive voltage to the anode relative to the cathode would attract the negatively charged electrons and thus sustain electron flow from cathode to anode. Conversely, applying a negative voltage to the anode would repel the electrons and thus inhibit electron flow. By a hydraulic analogy, the diode can be visualized as a one-way valve.

The vacuum-tube diode was invented by John A. Fleming in 1904. Just two years later, in 1906, Greenleaf W. Pickard invented an alternative diode type by forming a point contact to a slab of silicon, thus creating the first solid-state electronic device. However, it took half a century for the semiconductor industry to become a commercial reality, so the first half of the twentieth century was dominated by vacuum-tube electronics.

Nowadays diodes are made of semiconductor materials, with dramatic advantages over their vacuum-tube counterparts in terms of miniaturization, reliability, power consumption and cost. Specifically, the most common diode today is the silicon $p n$ junction, though other types of materials and junctions are also in use. The $p n$ junction plays a central role in microelectronics in that not only does it provide the diode function at the basis of the above applications, but it is also at the basis of the bipolar junction transistor (BJT), the junction field-effect transistor (JFET), and other semiconductor devices such as the silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR). The $p n$ junction is also present in the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET), the device most widely used in today's microelectronics products. Furthermore, in its reverse-biased form, the pn junction is used to isolate from each other different devices coexisting on the same semiconductor chip.

The student who comes from prerequisite courses in linear circuits will immediately find that diodes, like the transistors to follow, are highly nonlinear devices. Mercifully, a number of techniques have been developed for the analysis of nonlinear devices that draw quite heavily from those covered by linear-circuits courses. Far from being a waste of time, the analytical tools learned in circuits courses will also be put to heavy use in the study of electronics. Specifically, Ohm's Law, Kirchhoff's Laws (KVL and KCL), the Voltage/Current Divider Rules, Thévenin's/Norton's Theorems, and the Superposition Principle will continue to be our precious analytical tools as we venture into the exciting realm of electronic devices and systems.

CHAPTER HIGHLIGHTS

The chapter begins with the ideal diode, a concept designed to develop a basic feel for diode behavior as well as introduce the student to nonlinear circuit analysis techniques, the backbone of all subsequent electronics. The applications covered are diode rectifiers, diode logic gates, voltage clamps, piecewise-linear function generators, peak detectors, dc restorers, and voltage multipliers.

Next, we review the basic operational amplifier principles of prerequisite circuits courses because diodes (and later, transistors) offer a fertile application ground for op amps. The first diode-op-amp application to be considered is full-wave rectification, but others will follow as we proceed.

As mentioned, today diodes are made of semiconductors, so the next objective is the study of basic $p n$ junction theory. After a review of the semiconductor basics normally covered in prerequisite physics courses, the chapter develops an intuitive discussion of the $p n$ junction, highlighting those practical aspects (rules of thumb) that form the working knowledge of the electronics engineer in the modern industrial milieu. Whether the student will pursue a career as an IC designer, or a product, process, or reliability engineer, or as a test or applications engineer, the pn junction will
always resurface in a variety of situations, so it is only appropriate that we address it in some depth. All the student needs to remember from basic physics is Gauss's Theorem as well as the relationship between electric field and potential,

$$
\frac{d E}{d x}=\frac{\rho(x)}{\varepsilon_{s i}} \quad E=-\frac{d v(x)}{d x}
$$

The outcome of $p n$ junction theory is the concept of a real-life diode, a device that in spite of its departure from the ideal diode is still analyzed via suitable linearizing techniques. This introduces the student to the large-signal model as well as the small-signal model for the diode, models that will be expanded further in the following chapters when we study transistors.

The last part of the chapter applies the above models to the study of a number of widely used practical circuits such as rectifiers, voltage references, basic nonlinear op amp circuits, and dc power supplies. The Appendix discusses the parameters intervening in the diode model used by SPICE.

Most likely the chapter covers more material than feasible in a typical junior course. But, the instructor can easily skip selected topics, such as the sections on semiconductor theory, especially if these topics are covered in alternative courses. I have written this chapter with the aim to have all (or almost all) pertinent diode material in one place.

## 1.1 THE IDEAL DIODE

The diode is a two-terminal device designed to conduct current in one direction only. Unlike the resistor, which conducts in either direction, the diode carries current only from the terminal called anode $(A)$ to the terminal called cathode $(C)$. Its circuit symbol, shown in Fig. 1.1a, uses an arrowhead to signify this directionality. The voltage across the diode is defined as positive at the anode and negative at the cathode, thus conforming to the passive sign convention of other popular devices such as resistors.

FIGURE 1.2 Valve analogy of a diode: (a) forward operation and (b) reverse operation.

When invited to draw current in the direction of its arrowhead ( $i>0$ ), also called the forward ( F ) direction, a diode will eagerly conduct the given current by acting as a short circuit $(v=0)$. In this case the diode is said to be forward biased, or also to be on (ON). However, if we try to force current in the opposite direction, also called the reverse $(\mathrm{R})$ direction, the diode will stubbornly oppose current flow by acting as an open circuit $(i=0)$. The diode is now said to be reverse biased, or also to be cut off $(\mathrm{CO})$. When cut off the diode will sustain whatever voltage $(v<0)$ is imposed by the surrounding circuitry.

Figure $1.1 b$ shows the $i-v$ characteristic of the diode, which we express mathematically as

$$
\begin{align*}
v=0 & \text { for } i>0  \tag{1.1a}\\
i=0 & \text { for } v<0 \tag{1.1b}
\end{align*}
$$

Also shown next to the curves are the diode models (a short circuit and an open circuit) corresponding to the two modes of operation. A device with the characteristic shown is referred to as an ideal diode. As we shall see, practical diodes will only approximate these idealized curves.

A diode can be likened to a water valve according to the analogy of Fig. 1.2. The valve hinges at the top and has a stopper at the bottom. Forcing electric current to a load via a diode is like pumping water to a tank via a pipe equipped with a valve. If pump pressure is applied in the forward direction, the valve will open and allow water to flow as in Fig. 1.2a. However, if pressure is applied in the reverse direction as in Fig. 1.2b, the valve will close and inhibit water flow. To develop a feel for diode operation, let us consider our first circuit example.

EXAMPLE 1.1 (a) In the circuit of Fig. 1.3 let $R_{1}=1 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ and $R_{2}=2 \mathrm{k} \Omega$. If $v_{S}=3 \mathrm{~V}$, find $i_{S}$ so that $D$ draws 1 mA . Show the final circuit.
(b) If $i_{S}=3 \mathrm{~mA}$, find $v_{S}$ so that $D$ drops 2 V . Show the circuit.
(c) If $i_{S}=2 \mathrm{~mA}$ and $v_{S}=6 \mathrm{~V}$, find $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ so that $D$ operates at the origin of the $i-v$ plane, where $v=0$ and $i=0$.

FIGURE 1.3 Circuit of Example 1.1.

### Solution

(a) In conduction $D$ acts as a short-circuit, so $v_{A}=v_{C}$. By Ohm's law and KVL, $v_{A}=v_{C}=(2 \mathrm{k} \Omega) \times(1 \mathrm{~mA})+(3 \mathrm{~V})=5 \mathrm{~V}$, causing the $1-\mathrm{k} \Omega$ resistance to draw $(5 \mathrm{~V}) /(1 \mathrm{k} \Omega)=5 \mathrm{~mA}$, flowing downward. KCL gives $i_{S}=(1 \mathrm{~mA})+$ $(5 \mathrm{~mA})=6 \mathrm{~mA}$, so the situation is as in Fig. 1.4a.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d2e70fdf64cb0b15173bg-005.jpg?height=340&width=1198&top_left_y=1005&top_left_x=368)

FIGURE 1.4 Circuit solutions to Example 1.1.
(b) In cutoff $D$ acts as an open circuit, so the $2-\mathrm{k} \Omega$ resistance drops 0 V . By Ohm's law, $v_{A}=3 \times 1=3 \mathrm{~V}$. By KVL, the voltage at the cathode is $v_{C}=v_{A}+2=3+2=5 \mathrm{~V}$, so $v_{S}=v_{C}=5 \mathrm{~V}$ as shown in Fig. 1.4b.
(c) $i=0 \Rightarrow v_{C}=v_{S}=6 \mathrm{~V} ; v=0 \Rightarrow v_{A}=v_{C}=6 \mathrm{~V}$ and $R_{1}=v_{A} / i_{S}=6 / 2=$ $3 \mathrm{k} \Omega$. As long as $D$ is cut off, the value of $R_{2}$ is irrelevant. $R_{2}$ has an impact only when $D$ is on.

### Finding the Operating Mode of a Diode

Even though it consists of two straight segments, the diode characteristic is nonlinear. (In fact, it is said to be piecewise linear.) Yet, as demonstrated by Example 1.1, we can still apply the analytical techniques learned in linear-circuits courses because at any given time the diode operates only in one of its two possible modes (either ON or CO), where it admits a model (open or short circuit) that is indeed linear. Thus, to carry out our analysis, we only need to determine which of the two modes the diode happens to be operating in at a given time.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d2e70fdf64cb0b15173bg-006.jpg?height=407&width=1491&top_left_y=333&top_left_x=288)

There are many situations in which the diode is embedded in a linear circuit, indicating that we can simplify our analysis significantly if we replace the surrounding circuitry with its Thévenin equivalent. After doing so we end up with the basic situation of Fig. 1.5a, where $v_{O C}$ is the open-circuit voltage that the external circuit would sustain between the nodes corresponding to the anode and the cathode, but with the diode removed. (Note that the polarity of $v_{O C}$ is defined positive at the point of connection to the anode!) Moreover, $R_{e q}$ is the external circuit's equivalent resistance as seen by the diode. Shown in Fig. $1.5 b$ and $1.5 c$ is the $i-v$ characteristic of the diode as well as that of the surrounding circuit, the latter being referred to as the load line. As we know from basic circuit theory, the load line is a straight line intercepting the $v$-axis at $v=v_{O C}$, and having a slope of $-1 / R_{e q}$. The circuit's operating point lies at the intersection of the diode curve and the load line, where the diode and the surrounding circuit share the same voltage and current. It is apparent that

- If $v_{O C}>0$, the operating point $\left(Q_{F}\right)$ lies on the ON segment, where the diode is forward biased and thus acts as a short circuit to yield

$$
\begin{equation*}
v=0 \quad i=\frac{v_{O C}}{R_{e q}}(>0) \tag{1.2a}
\end{equation*}
$$

- Conversely, if $v_{O C}<0$, the operating point $\left(Q_{R}\right)$ lies on the CO segment, where the diode is reverse biased and thus acts as an open circuit to yield

$$
\begin{equation*}
i=0 \quad v=v_{O C}(<0) \tag{1.2b}
\end{equation*}
$$

Let us illustrate via an actual example.

EXAMPLE 1.2 (a) Find $v$ and $i$ in the circuit of Fig. $1.6 a$ if $v_{S}=12 \mathrm{~V}, R_{1}=10 \mathrm{k} \Omega, R_{2}=30 \mathrm{k} \Omega$, and $R_{3}=R_{4}=15 \mathrm{k} \Omega$.
(b) Repeat, but with $R_{2}$ lowered from $30 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ to $2.0 \mathrm{k} \Omega$.
(c) What happens if we reverse the diode's direction in part (a)? In part (b)?
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d2e70fdf64cb0b15173bg-007.jpg?height=449&width=1569&top_left_y=283&top_left_x=316)

FIGURE 1.6 (a) Circuit of Example 1.2. (b), (c) Subcircuits to find the Thévenin's equivalent of the network surrounding the diode. Note that the diode has been removed.

### Solution

(a) Removing the diode yields the subcircuit of Fig. $1.6 b$, where the voltage divider rule gives

$$
v_{O C}=\left(\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}-\frac{R_{4}}{R_{3}+R_{4}}\right) v_{S}
$$

Substituting the given component values gives $v_{O C}=9-6=3 \mathrm{~V}$. Since $v_{O C}>0$, the diode will be on, acting as a short circuit with $v=0$. To find $i$, we need $R_{e q}$. To this end, we suppress the voltage source to obtain the subcircuit of Fig. 1.6c. By inspection,

$$
R_{e q}=\left(R_{1} / / R_{2}\right)+\left(R_{3} / / R_{4}\right)
$$

Substituting the given component values gives $R_{e q}=15 \mathrm{k} \Omega$. Consequently, by Eq. $(1.2 a), i=3 / 15=0.2 \mathrm{~mA}$. The situation is shown in Fig. $1.7 a$, where the student is encouraged to find all other voltages and currents in the circuit as a check.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d2e70fdf64cb0b15173bg-007.jpg?height=415&width=1182&top_left_y=1395&top_left_x=377)

FIGURE 1.7 Circuit of Example 1.2a, where the diode is on, and Example 1.1b, where the diode is off.
(b) With $R_{2}$ lowered to $2.0 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ we get $v_{O C}=2-6=-4 \mathrm{~V}$. Since we now have $v_{O C}<0$, the diode is off, acting as an open circuit with $i=0$. The situation is depicted in Fig. 1.7b.
(c) Reversing the diode direction so that the anode is now at the right and the cathode is at the left will cause the diode to be off in part (a) and on in part ( $b$ ). Thus, in part ( $a$ ) the diode current is zero, and the diode voltage is -3 V . In part (b) we get $R_{e q}=(10 / / 2)+(15 / / 15)=55 / 6 \mathrm{k} \Omega, v=0 \mathrm{~V}$, and $i=4 /(55 / 6)=24 / 55 \mathrm{~mA}$, now flowing toward the left.

### Cut-and-Try Approach

If the diode is part of a nonlinear circuit, as in the case of multiple-diode circuits, it is generally not possible to perform a Thévenin's reduction of the surrounding circuitry. However, knowing that the diode must be either on or off, we can use intuition to make an educated assumption, and then check that our results are consistent with our assumption, changing the assumption if needed, until we obtain consistent results. A two-diode circuit provides a classic example of the cut-and-try approach.

EXAMPLE 1.3 (a) The circuit of Fig. $1.8 a$ is powered by a dual $\pm 6-\mathrm{V}$ dc power supply system, which we show in concise form (that is, without drawing the actual dc voltage sources) in order to reduce cluttering in the circuit diagram. Find the current $I_{D}$ and voltage $V_{D}$ for each diode.
(b) Repeat, but with the resistances interchanged with each other.

FIGURE 1.8 (a) Circuit of Example 13.a. (b) The circuit after it has been solved.

### Solution

(a) Knowing that each diode has to be either in conduction (ON) or cut off $(\mathrm{CO})$, we have four possibilities: $\left(D_{1}, D_{2}\right)=(\mathrm{CO}, \mathrm{CO}),(\mathrm{CO}, \mathrm{ON}),(\mathrm{ON}, \mathrm{CO})$, (ON, ON). However, considering that the $+6-\mathrm{V}$ source tends to source current to both anodes, and that the $-6-\mathrm{V}$ source tends to sink current from $D_{2}$ 's cathode, it seems reasonable to assume that both diodes be on, or $\left(D_{1}, D_{2}\right)=$ (ON, ON). Thus, replacing each diode with a short circuit, we end up with the situation of Fig. 1.5b, where the diode voltages are

$$
V_{D_{1}}=V_{D_{2}}=0 \mathrm{~V}
$$

Moreover, applying first Ohm's law and then KCL we have

$$
I_{D_{2}}=I_{3 \mathrm{k} \Omega}=\frac{0-(-6)}{3}=2 \mathrm{~mA} \quad I_{D_{1}}=I_{1 \mathrm{k} \Omega}-I_{D_{2}}=\frac{6-0}{1}-2=4 \mathrm{~mA}
$$

Both diodes carry current in the forward direction, so our results are consistent with our initial assumption, and we are done.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d2e70fdf64cb0b15173bg-009.jpg?height=554&width=1211&top_left_y=321&top_left_x=420)

FIGURE 1.9 (a) Circuit of Example 1.3b. (b) First attempt (wrong), and (c) second attempt (successful).
(b) Swapping the resistances results in the circuit of Fig. 1.9a. We may again assume the state $\left(D_{1}, D_{2}\right)=(\mathrm{ON}, \mathrm{ON})$ and refer to the circuit of Fig. $1.9 b$ for our calculations. By Ohm's law, $I_{3 \mathrm{k} \Omega}=6 / 3=2 \mathrm{~mA}$ and $I_{1 \mathrm{k} \Omega}=[0-(-6)] / 1=6 \mathrm{~mA}$. Then, to satisfy KCL, $D_{1}$ would have to supply 4 mA flowing upward, that is, in the reverse direction. But this is impossible, indicating that the assumption $\left(D_{1}, D_{2}\right)=(\mathrm{ON}, \mathrm{ON})$ was wrong. Yet, we note that $D_{2}$ must be ON because the negative supply draws current from its cathode. The only plausible assumption is thus $\left(D_{1}, D_{2}\right)=(\mathrm{CO}, \mathrm{ON})$, as shown in Fig. 1.9c. We now have

$$
I_{D_{1}}=0 \quad I_{D_{2}}=\frac{6-(-6)}{3+1}=3 \mathrm{~mA}
$$

By KVL, the voltage at the node common to the anodes is $6-(3 \times 3)=-3 \mathrm{~V}$, indicating that $D_{1}$ is indeed reverse biased, as assumed at the onset of our second try. So, $V_{D_{1}}=-3 \mathrm{~V}$, and $V_{D_{2}}=0$.

### Exercise 1.1

Find $I_{D}$ and $V_{D}$ for each diode in the circuit of Fig. $1.9 a$ if (a) the direction of $D_{1}$ is reversed while $D_{2}$ is as shown; (b) the direction of $D_{2}$ is reversed while $D_{1}$ is as shown; $(c)$ the direction of each diode in Fig. 1.9a is reversed.
Ans. (a) $I_{D_{1}}=4 \mathrm{~mA}, V_{D_{1}}=0, I_{D_{2}}=6 \mathrm{~mA}, V_{D_{2}}=0$; (b) $I_{D_{1}}=2 \mathrm{~mA}, V_{D_{1}}=0$, $I_{D_{2}}=0, V_{D_{2}}=-6 \mathrm{~V}$; (c) $I_{D_{1}}=I_{D_{2}}=0, V_{D_{1}}=-6 \mathrm{~V}, V_{D_{2}}=-12 \mathrm{~V}$.

### Concluding Observations

Even though the diode is the simplest electronic element, it offers a glimpse into important features that are common to other more complex electronic devices, such as transistors to be studied later.

- The diode is a classic example of a nonlinear circuit element.
- Strictly speaking, the analysis techniques learned in linear-circuits courses cannot be applied to nonlinear elements. However, every attempt should be made to
approximate the $i-v$ characteristics with piecewise linear segments, for then we can create separate linear models for the device, one for each region of operation.
- Once we know which region the device finds itself operating in at a given moment, we can apply familiar linear-analysis techniques to investigate its behavior over that particular region.

Quite often a cut-and-try approach may be required in order to determine the actual region of operation. This approach involves the following steps:

- Start out by making an educated assumption about the region of operation of each nonlinear device.
- Replace each device with the linear model pertaining to that region, and proceed with a linear analysis of the resulting circuit.
- Check that the results are consistent with your initial assumption. If they are, we are finished. If they aren't, we need to change our initial assumption until consistent results are obtained.

We shall encounter plenty of examples as we proceed. Lastly, it must be said that computer simulation, such as PSpice, is a powerful tool not only to corroborate any assumptions that we make, but also to provide refinements and details that a piecewise linear approximation of necessity often misses.

### 1.2 BASIC DIODE APPLICATIONS

Having introduced the fundamentals of diode behavior and diode circuit analysis, we are now ready to examine some of the most common diode applications.

### Rectifiers

Figure $1.10 a$ depicts one of the most popular diode applications, namely, signal rectification. During the positive alternations of $v_{I}$ the diode is on and the circuit gives $v_{O}=v_{I}$ (see Fig. 1.10b). During the negative alternations of $v_{I}$ the diode is cut off, and the circuit gives $v_{O}=0 \mathrm{~V}$ (see Fig. 1.10c). Figure 1.11a shows the response $v_{O}$ to a sinusoidal input $v_{I}$. We say that the circuit passes on to the load $R$ only the positive portions of the input waveform, while the negative portions are inhibited. We observe that while $v_{I}$ alternates in polarity and averages out to zero, $v_{O}$ is unipolar and thus exhibits a nonzero average, or a nonzero dc component. For this reason the circuit is referred to as rectifier. Its behavior can be visualized also via the voltage

transfer curve (VTC), representing the plot of $v_{O}$ versus $v_{I}$. This curve, expressed mathematically as

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
v_{O}=v_{I} & \text { for } v_{I}>0 \\
v_{O}=0 & \text { for } v_{I}<0 \tag{1.3b}
\end{array}
$$

is shown in Fig. 1.11b. Needless to say, the presence of the diode results in a nonlinear VTC. The student can easily verify that reversing the diode interconnection in Fig. 1.10a results in a rectifier that passes only the negative portions of the input waveform.

Since it passes only half the input wave, the circuit of Fig. 1.10a is called a halfwave rectifier. By contrast, a full-wave rectifier passes both halves of the input wave, one unchanged and the other inverted. Also called absolute-value circuit, it is implemented using the four-diode arrangement of Fig. 1.12a, known as a diode bridge. To understand its operation, consider first the case $v_{I}>0$, then the case $v_{I}<0$.

- For $v_{I}>0$ we expect the input source $v_{I}$ to source current to $D_{1}$ 's anode and to sink current from $D_{4}$ 's cathode, causing both diodes to be on, as depicted in Fig. 1.12b. Under these circumstances we have $v_{O}=v_{I}(>0)$. Moreover, we note that both $D_{2}$ and $D_{3}$ are reverse biased by the amount $v_{0}$, as also shown in Fig. 1.12b. The current loop is thus source $\rightarrow D_{1} \rightarrow R \rightarrow D_{4} \rightarrow$ source.

FIGURE 1.13 Illustrating full-wave rectification via (a) the input/output waveforms and (b) the VTC.

- For $v_{I}<0$ we expect the input source $v_{I}$ to sink current from $D_{3}$ 's cathode and to source current to $D_{2}$ 's anode, causing both diodes to be on, as depicted in Fig. 1.12c. We now have $v_{O}=-v_{I}$, or $v_{O}>0$ because $v_{I}<0$. Moreover, both $D_{1}$ and $D_{4}$ are now reverse biased, as also shown in Fig. 1.12c. The current loop is now source $\rightarrow$ $D_{2} \rightarrow R \rightarrow D_{3} \rightarrow$ source. We observe that the current through $R$ flows toward the right in both cases, confirming the absolute-value function mentioned earlier.
Figure $1.13 a$ shows the response $v_{O}$ to a sinusoidal input $v_{I}$, while Fig. $1.13 b$ shows the VTC, which we express concisely as

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{O}=\left|v_{I}\right| \tag{1.4}
\end{equation*}
$$

Rectifier circuits find application in power electronics, communications, and instrumentation.

Assuming $v_{S}$ is an ac source with a $24-\mathrm{V}$ peak amplitude obtained from the household ac power via a step-down transformer, sketch and label $v_{S}$ as well as the battery current $i$.
(b) Find the fraction of each ac cycle during which the battery receives current.

### Solution

(a) It is apparent that as long as $\left|v_{S}\right| \leq 12 \mathrm{~V}$, all diodes are cut off and $i=0$. However, as soon as $v_{S}$ rises above $12 \mathrm{~V}, D_{1}$ and $D_{4}$ go on, thus establishing the current loop

$$
\text { source } \rightarrow R \rightarrow D_{1} \rightarrow \text { battery } \rightarrow D_{4} \rightarrow \text { source }
$$

Conversely, when $v_{S}$ drops below $-12 \mathrm{~V}, D_{2}$ and $D_{3}$ go on, thus establishing the current loop

$$
\text { source } \rightarrow D_{2} \rightarrow \text { battery } \rightarrow D_{3} \rightarrow R \rightarrow \text { source }
$$

FIGURE 1.14 (a) Simple battery charger, and (b) voltage and current waveforms.
In either case, we have

$$
i=0 \quad \text { for } \quad\left|v_{S}\right| \leq 12 \mathrm{~V} \quad i=\frac{v_{S}-12 \mathrm{~V}}{R} \quad \text { for } \quad\left|v_{S}\right|>12 \mathrm{~V}
$$

The peak value of the current is $(24-12) / 12=1 \mathrm{~A}$. The waveforms are shown in Fig. 1.14b.
(b) During the first cycle, $i$ starts to flow into the battery at the instant $t_{1}$ such that

$$
24 \sin \frac{2 \pi t_{1}}{T}=12
$$

or $t_{1}=T / 12$, and stops conducting at $t_{2}=T / 2-T / 12$. Consequently, the conduction interval is $T_{\mathrm{ON}}=t_{2}-t_{1}=T / 3$, or $T_{\mathrm{ON}}=(2 / 3)(T / 2)$, where $T / 2$ is the period of the current waveform. In summary, the battery receives current during $2 / 3$ of the time.

### Diode Logic Gates

Figures $1.15 a$ and $1.16 a$ show how diodes can be used to implement elementary functions of the logic type, which are at the basis of digital systems. The inputs $A$ and $B$ and the output $Y$ are binary-valued voltages that can be either low $(L)$, such as 0 V , or high $(H)$, such as the power-supply voltage $V_{S}$ (typically, 5 V$)$. Circuit behavior is best understood by examining the rows of the accompanying tables, one at a time.

- As long as both inputs $A$ and $B$ are low $(0 \mathrm{~V})$ in Fig. $1.15 a$, both diodes are off, so all voltages and currents are zero, and $Y$ is low. However, if we drive at least one input high ( 5 V ), we will be sourcing current to the anode of the corresponding diode, turning it on and thus pulling $Y$ also high, as illustrated in Fig. 1.15b. We summarize by saying that $Y$ is high if $A$ or $B$ or both are high. This logic function, aptly called the OR function, is identified by the logic-gate symbol next to the circuit itself, in Fig. 1.15a. The table of Fig. $1.15 b$ summarizes its behavior and is called the truth table.
- As long as at least one input is low $(0 \mathrm{~V})$ in Fig. 1.16a, the corresponding diode will be on as we are sinking current from its cathode. So, $Y$ is also low. Only if both $A$ and $B$ are high will both diodes be cut off, causing the current through $R$ to drop to zero. With zero current, the voltage drop across $R$ is also zero, and we say that $R$ pulls $Y$ to $V_{S}$, or high, as illustrated in Fig. 1.16b. This state of affairs is summarized by saying that $Y$ is high if $A$ and $B$ are high. This logic function, aptly called the AND function, is identified by the logic-gate symbol next to the circuit itself, in Fig. 1.16 $a$. The table of Fig. $1.16 b$ summarizes its behavior and is called the truth table.

Each gate can readily be expanded to handle more than just two inputs by interconnecting additional diodes, as needed. The above gates, though certainly useful, are not sufficient to build a complete digital system because we also need, among others, the inversion function. This requires a transistor, as we shall study in the next two chapters.

### Voltage Clamps

The unidirectional-switch behavior of the diode can be exploited to establish prescribed limits for certain voltages in a circuit. Such a situation arises, for instance, in connection with the inputs to integrated circuits (ICs), which must be kept within limits as recommended in the data sheets in order to prevent the IC from malfunctioning or, even worse, from undergoing permanent damage. As a rule, the input voltages to an IC should never be allowed to exceed its power-supply voltages.

Figure 1.17 a illustrates the situation for a single-supply IC, such as a CMOS digital circuit or a single-supply op amp. However, the principle can readily be generalized to multiple-supply systems, such as dual-supply op amps. With reference to Fig. $1.17 a$, we readily see that as long as the external input $v_{I}$ lies within the range $0 \leq v_{I} \leq V_{S}$, both diodes are off, so the signal right at the IC's input pin is $v_{I C} \cong v_{I}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d2e70fdf64cb0b15173bg-015.jpg?height=501&width=1064&top_left_y=337&top_left_x=328)

FIGURE 1.17 (a) Using diode clamps to limit the input voltage range of an IC.
(b) Waveforms.
(assuming the IC draws negligible input current, which is indeed the case with CMOS logic circuits as well as op amps.) However, should $v_{I}$ exceed the supply voltage $V_{S}$, either because of an oversight by the user or because of interference noise superimposed upon $v_{I}$ itself, $D_{1}$ will go on, thus establishing a short between $v_{I C}$ and $V_{S}$. We say that $D_{1}$ clamps $v_{I C}$ at $V_{S}$. By similar reasoning, should $v_{I}$ drop below ground potential, $D_{2}$ will clamp $v_{I C}$ at 0 V . As depicted in Fig. $1.17 b$, the diodes protect the IC against possible input overdrive situations by limiting the input-pin voltage within the range

$$
0 \leq v_{I C} \leq V_{S}
$$

For this reason, a diode clamp is also referred to as a limiter, and since it clips the portions of the input waveform falling outside the allowed range, it is also called a clipper.

The need for protection against input overdrives is so important and so common that many ICs come already equipped with internal diode-clamping networks to relieve the user from this worry. In this respect it is worth mentioning the MOSFET as a device particularly sensitive to input overvoltages when handled by humans. Since its gate terminal is the plate of an extremely tiny capacitor, any electrostatic charge that may have accumulated on the body of the user will be transferred to this capacitor during manual contact, thus leading to potentially high voltages (as per $V=Q / C$ ) that are likely to destroy the capacitor's dielectric. However, in the presence of suitable diode clamps, the body of the handler will discharge through one of the diodes, saving the device from assured destruction.

### Exercise 1.2

In the circuit of Fig. 1.17 let $R=10 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ and $V_{S}=5 \mathrm{~V}$. Assuming the IC draws no current at its input terminal, find the current through $R$ (magnitude and direction) for the following values of $v_{I}:(a)=1 \mathrm{~V},(b) 8 \mathrm{~V},(c)-2 \mathrm{~V},(d) 4.5 \mathrm{~V}$. (e) If it is found that $R$ draws 0.25 mA flowing toward the right, what do you conclude about $v_{I}$ ? ( $f$ ) What if $R$ draws 0.5 mA flowing toward the left? $(g)$ What if the current through $R$ is zero?
Ans. (a) 0 mA ; (b) $0.3 \mathrm{~mA}(\rightarrow)$; (c) $0.2 \mathrm{~mA}(\leftarrow)$; (d) 0 mA ; (e) $v_{I}=7.5 \mathrm{~V}$; (f) $v_{I}=-5 \mathrm{~V}$; (g) $0 \leq v_{I} \leq 5 \mathrm{~V}$.

### Piecewise-Linear Function Generators

The nonlinear characteristic of the diode can be exploited on purpose to create piecewise-linear approximations to nonlinear functions. A popular application example is the conversion of a triangular wave to a sinewave. Figure $1.18 a$ shows a simple example of a piecewise-linear function generator. We make the following observations:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d2e70fdf64cb0b15173bg-016.jpg?height=517&width=517&top_left_y=655&top_left_x=548)

(b)

FIGURE 1.18 (a) Piecewise-linear function generator example, and (b) its VTC.

- With both diodes off, the three $10-\mathrm{kV}$ resistors partition the $12-\mathrm{V}$ supply voltage into three equal voltage drops, thus giving 4 V and 8 V , respectively. This is illustrated in Fig. 1.19a, where we observe that both diodes are off as long as the input is kept within the range $4 \mathrm{~V}<v_{I}<8 \mathrm{~V}$. Since no current flows through the $20-\mathrm{k} \Omega$ resistor, the latter drops 0 V , so the circuit gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{O}=v_{I} \quad \text { for } 4 \mathrm{~V}<v_{I}<8 \mathrm{~V} \tag{1.5a}
\end{equation*}
$$

FIGURE 1.20 Illustrating the waveshaping effect of the piecewise-linear circuit of Fig. 1.18a.

- If we lower $v_{I}$ below $4 \mathrm{~V}, D_{2}$ goes on while $D_{1}$ remains off, resulting in the situation of Fig. 1.19b. By KCL we have

$$
\frac{12-v_{O}}{10+10}=\frac{v_{O}-v_{I}}{20}+\frac{v_{O}}{10}
$$

which is readily solved for $v_{O}$ to give

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{O}=0.25 v_{I}+3 \mathrm{~V} \quad \text { for } v_{I}<4 \mathrm{~V} \tag{1.5b}
\end{equation*}
$$

- If we raise $v_{I}$ above $8 \mathrm{~V}, D_{1}$ goes on while $D_{2}$ remains off, resulting in the situation of Fig. 1.19c. Applying again KCL, we get

$$
\frac{v_{I}-v_{O}}{20}+\frac{12-v_{O}}{10}=\frac{v_{O}}{10+10}
$$

which is readily solved for $v_{O}$ to give

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{O}=0.25 v_{I}+6 \mathrm{~V} \quad \text { for } v_{I}>8 \mathrm{~V} \tag{1.5c}
\end{equation*}
$$

Figure $1.18 b$ shows the circuit's VTC. Clearly, we have three separate regions of operation. Within each region, the VTC is a straight segment whose analytical expression is obtained by drawing the corresponding equivalent circuit, as per Fig. 1.19, and subjecting it to elementary linear analysis techniques. This is typical of diode circuits.

Figure 1.20 shows the waveshaping effect of the circuit of Fig. 1.18 upon a triangular wave. Here, the aim is to compress the top and the bottom of the triangle to approximate a sine. Clearly, the present example provides a rather crude approximation, but it is not hard to imagine that we can improve it by using additional segments. This is normally accomplished with $p n$ junction diodes. As we shall see, the characteristic of the $p n$ diode has a rounded knee which helps ensure a smoother transition from one segment to the next of the VTC.

### Peak Detectors

Additional interesting applications arise if a diode $D$ is partnered by a capacitor $C$. As our first example we consider the circuit of Fig. 1.21a, known as a peak detector. To understand its operation, refer to the waveforms of Fig. 1.21b, where $C$ is assumed initially discharged. As $v_{I}$ swings positive, current will be sourced to the anode, forcing $D$ to conduct and thus to charge up $C$. Since $D$ acts as a short circuit, $v_{O}$ simply follows $v_{I}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d2e70fdf64cb0b15173bg-018.jpg?height=442&width=1038&top_left_y=329&top_left_x=568)

FIGURE 1.21 (a) Peak detector, and (b) illustrative waveforms.
Once $v_{I}$ peaks out, the anode will start swinging negative relative to the cathode, turning $D$ off and thus leaving $C$ to hold the previously acquired voltage, whose value coincides with that of the previous input peak. This memory action by $C$ will persist until $v_{I}$ rises again to a new, higher peak. When this happens, $D$ will go on again, charging up $C$ to this new peak.

It is apparent that the diode's directionality causes the capacitor voltage to experience only increases, this being the reason why the circuit shown is said to be a positive peak detector. Reversing the diode interconnection in the circuit will cause the capacitor voltage to experience only decreases, thus yielding a negative peak detector. Peak detectors are at the basis of demodulators in the detection of audio signals in amplitude-modulation (AM) radio receivers.

### The Clamped Capacitor or Dc Restorer

In the circuit of Fig. $1.22 a$ the diode provides a clamping function that prevents $v_{O}$ from ever going negative. To understand circuit operation, refer to the waveforms of Fig. $1.22 b$, where the input is a sine wave alternating between $+V_{m}$ and $-V_{m}$, and $C$ is assumed initially discharged. During the initial positive alternation of $v_{I}$ we simply have $v_{O}=v_{I}$ as the voltage across $C$ is zero and the diode is off. However, as $v_{I}$ goes below 0 V for the first time, the input source will sink current from $D$ 's cathode via $C$, thus turning $D$ on and forcing $C$ to charge. As $v_{I}$ reaches its negative peak of $-V_{m}$ at $t=t_{2}$,
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d2e70fdf64cb0b15173bg-018.jpg?height=300&width=375&top_left_y=1901&top_left_x=571)

(b)

FIGURE 1.22 (a) Clamped capacitor, and (b) illustrative waveforms.
$C$ will have acquired a voltage equal to $V_{m}$, positive at the right plate. After $t=t_{2}$, the diode will never conduct again, and $C$ will retain the voltage acquired last, thus giving

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{O}=v_{I}+V_{m} \tag{1.6}
\end{equation*}
$$

for $t \geq t_{2}$. While $v_{I}$ alternates between $-V_{m}$ and $+V_{m}$, and thus averages out to zero, $v_{O}$ ends up alternating between 0 and $+2 V_{m}$ because of the voltage offset provided by $C$. Consequently, $v_{O}$ averages out to $+V_{m}$, and because of this nonzero dc component at its output, the circuit is also referred to as a dc restorer.

### Voltage Multipliers and PSpice Simulation

An interesting property of the clamped-capacitor circuit of Fig. $1.22 a$ is that it provides a positive output peak that is twice that of the input. This indicates that if we feed the output of the clamped capacitor circuit to a peak detector, we can synthesize a dc voltage of value $+2 V_{m}$, that is, of twice the amplitude of the input! To better understand the behavior of this composite circuit, we simulate it via PSpice. Aptly called a voltage doubler, the circuit is shown in Fig. 1.23 for the case of a 1-kHz, 10-V sinusoidal input. The circuit utilizes pseudo-ideal diodes, whose PSpice models have been created by editing one of the already existing diode models available in PSpice's library, and then setting the parameters $I_{s}$ and $n$ to the values shown in the table (more on this in Appendix 1A).

The various waveforms are displayed in Fig. 1.24, where we observe that after a transient situation lasting less than ten cycles, the output settles to the dc value

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{2} \rightarrow 2 V_{m} \tag{1.7}
\end{equation*}
$$

or $v_{2}=20 \mathrm{~V}$ in the present example. The reason it takes several cycles to attain the desired steady-state situation is that $C_{1}$ is being loaded by $C_{2}$. If the circuit were implemented with $C_{1} \gg C_{2}$, steady state would be achieved essentially at the second positive peak of $v_{I}$. However, with equal capacitors, which is how the circuit is usually implemented, the charge accumulated by $C_{1}$ at each positive peak of $v_{I}$ redistributes equally between $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$, causing a reduction in $v_{1}$ which, though significant at the first peak of $v_{l}$, becomes progressively less relevant with each subsequent peak. One can prove (see Exercise 1.3), that the values attained by $v_{2}$ at each peak of $v_{I}$ are $5 \mathrm{~V}, 12.5 \mathrm{~V}, 16.25 \mathrm{~V}, 18.125 \mathrm{~V}$. . . .

FIGURE 1.24 Waveforms for the PSpice circuit of Fig. 1.23.

### Exercise 1.3

Denoting the value of $v_{2}$ following the $k$-th peak of $v_{I}$ as $v_{2}(k)$, use the charge conservation principle to show that $v_{2}(k)$ is related to the value $v_{2}(k-1)$ following the previous peak as

$$
v_{2}(k)=0.5 v_{2}(k-1)+10 \mathrm{~V}
$$

$k=2,3,4 \ldots$, and $v_{2}(1)=5 \mathrm{~V}$. At which peak of $v_{I}$ does $v_{2}$ come within about $10 \%$ of 20 V ? $1 \%$ of 20 V ?

Ans. For $10 \%, k=3$. For $1 \%, k=6$.
The principle at the basis of the voltage doubler can be generalized to achieve higher voltage-multiplication factors. Figure 1.25 shows a voltage quadrupler, whose waveforms are displayed in Fig. 1.26. We see again that after a transient situation lasting a certain number of cycles the output $v_{4}$ eventually settles to the dc value

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{4} \rightarrow 4 V_{m} \tag{1.8}
\end{equation*}
$$

or $v_{4}=40 \mathrm{~V}$ in the present example. The reader is encouraged to trace through each waveform in detail to develop a feel for the workings of this clever circuit.

Voltage multipliers find application in integrated circuits, where it is desired to synthesize specific voltages to bias different on-chip circuits, starting out with a single supply voltage such as that provided by a rechargeable battery.

## 1.3 OPERATIONAL AMPLIFIERS AND DIODE APPLICATIONS

As we move along we shall find that the range of applications for diodes and, later, for transistors can be expanded significantly if we team up these devices with the operational amplifier, or op amp for short. Recall from prerequisite circuit courses that an op amp is a high-gain voltage amplifier that accepts two inputs, called the inverting input $v_{N}$ and the noninverting input $v_{P}$, and yields an output $v_{O}$ such that

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{O}=a\left(v_{P}-v_{N}\right) \tag{1.9}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $a$ (in $\mathrm{V} / \mathrm{V}$ ) is the voltage gain (see Fig. 1.27a). In order to function, an op amp needs to be powered. Figure $1.27 a$ shows dual power supplies of $\pm V_{S}$, but a single supply is also common. (To reduce cluttering, it is customary to omit showing the supplies explicitly.) Physically, an op amp cannot swing $v_{O}$ above $+V_{S}$ or below $-V_{S}$. Overdriving it will simply cause $v_{O}$ to saturate at some voltage $V_{O H}$ in the vicinity of $+V_{S}$ or at some voltage $V_{O L}$ in the vicinity of $-V_{S}$, so Eq. (1.9) holds only so long as we confine $v_{O}$ within the range $V_{O L}<v_{O}<V_{O H}$, aptly called the linear output range. Figure $1.27 b$ shows the op amp's voltage transfer curve (VTC).

As we move along we shall find that the higher the voltage gain $a$, the better (as an example, the venerable 741 op amp has $a=200,000 \mathrm{~V} / \mathrm{V}$, also expressed as
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d2e70fdf64cb0b15173bg-021.jpg?height=393&width=1203&top_left_y=1780&top_left_x=320)

FIGURE 1.27 (a) Op amp symbol and labels. (b) The gain $a$ is the slope of the voltage transfer curve (VTC). (c) The input voltage of an ideal op amp approaches 0 V . Moreover, it draws no input currents.
$a=0.2 \mathrm{~V} / \mu \mathrm{V})$. Due to the sheer size of its gain, an op amp needs only a vanishingly small difference $v_{P}-v_{N}$ at the input to sustain a given voltage $v_{O}$ at the output (as an example, to sustain 1 V at the output, a 741 needs only $5 \mu \mathrm{~V}$ at the input!). Rewriting Eq. (1.9) as $\left(v_{P}-v_{N}\right)=v_{O} / a$, we get, in the ideal op amp limit of an infinitely high gain,

$$
\lim _{a \rightarrow \infty}\left(v_{P}-v_{N}\right)=\lim _{a \rightarrow \infty} \frac{v_{O}}{a}=0
$$

Op amps are designed to operate with negative feedback, an arrangement that allows the amplifier to influence its inverting input $v_{N}$ via an external network called the feedback network. With this viewpoint in mind, we express the above relation as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\lim _{a \rightarrow \infty} v_{N}=v_{P} \tag{1.10}
\end{equation*}
$$

which forms the basis of the important rule that engineers use to analyze op amp circuits:
Op Amp Rule: When given the ability to influence its own input $v_{N}$ via negative feedback, an ideal op amp will output whatever voltage $v_{O}$ and current $i_{O}$ it takes to force $v_{N}$ to track $v_{p}$. Moreover, the op amp will do this without drawing any current at either input pin (see Fig. 1.27c).

Let us put to use this rule to review the most popular op amp circuits.

### Basic Op Amp Circuits

The most popular op amp circuits are the noninverting amplifier, the inverting amplifier, the summing amplifier, and the voltage buffer.

- The Noninverting Amplifier: In the circuit of Fig. $1.28 a$ the op amp influences $v_{N}$ via the voltage divider made up of $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ to give

$$
v_{N}=\frac{R_{1}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} v_{O}=\frac{v_{O}}{1+R_{2} / R_{1}}
$$

By the op amp rule we have $v_{N}=v_{P}\left(=v_{I}\right)$. Consequently, replacing $v_{N}$ with $v_{I}$ in the above expression and solving for the ratio $v_{O} / v_{I}$ gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
A=\frac{v_{O}}{v_{I}}=1+\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}} \tag{1.11}
\end{equation*}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d2e70fdf64cb0b15173bg-022.jpg?height=434&width=1144&top_left_y=1773&top_left_x=574)

FIGURE 1.28 (a) Noninverting and (b) inverting op amp configurations.
where $A$ represents the gain of the entire circuit (not to be confused with the gain $a(\rightarrow \infty)$ of the basic op amp). Since $v_{O}$ has the same polarity as $v_{I}$ the circuit is referred to as noninverting amplifier.

- The Inverting Amplifier: In the circuit of Fig. $1.28 b$ the op amp influences $v_{N}$ via the feedback resistance $R_{2}$, and since the op amp rule implies $v_{N}=v_{P}=0$, we refer to node $v_{N}$ as a virtual ground. Any current injected by $v_{I}$ via $R_{1}$ is removed by $v_{O}$ via $R_{2}$, or $i_{1}=i_{2}$. Using Ohm's law,

$$
\frac{v_{I}-0}{R_{1}}=\frac{0-v_{O}}{R_{2}}
$$

Solving again for the ratio $v_{O} / v_{I}$ gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
A=\frac{v_{O}}{v_{I}}=-\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}} \tag{1.12}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since the polarity of $v_{O}$ is opposite to that of $v_{I}$ the circuit is called an inverting amplifier.

- The Summing Amplifier: By the op amp rule, the inverting-input node in Fig. 1.29 is at virtual ground. This node is called a summing junction because it sums the currents coming from the input sources $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ and diverts this sum to the output node $v_{O}$ to give

$$
\frac{v_{1}-0}{R_{1}}+\frac{v_{2}-0}{R_{2}}=\frac{0-v_{0}}{R_{3}}
$$

Solving for $v_{o}$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{O}=-\left(\frac{R_{3}}{R_{1}} v_{1}+\frac{R_{3}}{R_{2}} v_{2}\right) \tag{1.13}
\end{equation*}
$$

If $R_{1}=R_{2}$, the circuit gives $v_{O}=-\left(R_{3} / R_{1}\right)\left(v_{1}+v_{2}\right)$ and is aptly called a summing amplifier.

- The Voltage Buffer: Letting $R_{2}=0$ and $R_{1}=\infty$ in the circuit of Fig. $1.28 a$ turns it into a unity-gain amplifier $(A=1 \mathrm{~V} / \mathrm{V})$. Its main application is as a voltage buffer to eliminate inter-stage loading. As an example, consider Fig. 1.30a, where a signal

FIGURE 1.30 Using a unity-gain voltage buffer to eliminate loading (current polarities shown for $v_{1}>0$ ).
source $v_{1}$ with internal resistance $R_{1}$ is to be fed to a load $R_{2}$. If we connect the source to the load via a plain wire, $R_{2}$ will form a voltage divider with $R_{1}$, giving $v_{2}=$ $v_{1} /\left(1+R_{1} / R_{2}\right)$. Clearly $v_{2}$ is less than $v_{1}$, a situation referred to as loading and stemming from the fact that $R_{2}$ draws current via $R_{1}$, so there is voltage loss across $R_{1}$.

However, if we couple the source to the load via a buffer as in Fig. 1.30b, there will be no voltage drop across $R_{1}$ because the op amp is designed to draw no input currents. Consequently the buffer eliminates loading to give $v_{2}=v_{1}$. Of course $R_{2}$ does draw current, but this is supplied by the op amp, which in turn draws it from the power supply $+V_{S}$ rather than from $v_{1}$. (The illustration refers to the case $v_{1}>0$; for $v_{1}<0$ the load current will flow from $R_{2}$ through the op amp to $-V_{S}$.)

The above configurations show up so often, either on their own or as subcircuits of more complex systems, that we shall apply Eqs. (1.10) through (1.13) quite frequently.

### Our First Diode/Op-Amp Circuit

Having reviewed op amp basics, we are now ready to investigate our first diode/opamp circuit, shown in Fig. 1.31a. Where do we begin? As a rule, start out using simple inspection to see if you can identify already familiar subcircuits, and then build up your understanding from there, one step at a time. In the present case we observe that $D_{2}$ and $R_{3}$ form a half-wave rectifier of the type of Fig. 1.10a, so we can follow the line of reasoning developed there and analyze the cases $v_{I}>0$ and $v_{I}<0$ separately.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d2e70fdf64cb0b15173bg-024.jpg?height=450&width=583&top_left_y=1754&top_left_x=563)

FIGURE 1.32 Redrawing the circuit of Fig. 1.31a for (a) $v_{l}>0$ and (b) $v_{l}<0$.

- For $v_{I}>0, D_{2}$ is on, making $v_{P}=v_{I}$. But, by the op amp rule we have $v_{N}=v_{P}$, and thus $v_{N}=v_{I}$. This causes $D_{1}$ to be off, as pictured in Fig. 1.32a. In the absence of any current through $R_{2}$ the op amp gives $v_{O}=v_{N}$, so

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{O}=v_{I} \tag{1.14a}
\end{equation*}
$$

- For $v_{I}<0, D_{2}$ is off, making $v_{P}=0$ and thus, by the op amp rule, $v_{N}=0 . D_{1}$ is now on, as pictured in Fig. 1.32b, and the op amp acts as an inverting amplifier to give

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{O}=-\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}} v_{I}=-\frac{10}{10} v_{I}=-v_{I} \tag{1.14b}
\end{equation*}
$$

- We combine the two expressions by writing

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{O}=\left|v_{I}\right| \tag{1.15}
\end{equation*}
$$

and by stating that the circuit is a full-wave rectifier. The function is similar to that provided by the circuit of Fig. 1.12a and graphed in Fig. 1.13. There is a difference, however: in the circuit of Fig. 1.12a the rectified signal appears across a floating load, whereas in the op amp version of Fig. 1.31a the rectified signal is referenced to ground and as such it can be applied to a grounded load.

### Exercise 1.4

Find $v_{O}$ in the circuit of Fig. 1.31a if (a) $R_{3}$ is doubled; (b) $R_{2}$ is doubled; (c) $R_{1}$ is doubled; (d) the direction of each diode is reversed; (e) only the direction of $D_{1}$ is reversed.

Ans. (a) $v_{O}=\left|v_{I}\right| ;$ (b) $v_{O}=v_{I}$ for $v_{I}>0 ; v_{O}=-2 v_{I}$ for $v_{I}<0 ;$ (c) $v_{O}=v_{I}$ for $v_{I}>0$, $v_{O}=-0.5 v_{I}$ for $v_{I}<0 ;(d) v_{O}=-\left|v_{I}\right| ;(e) v_{O}=v_{I}$ for $v_{I}>0, v_{O}=0$ for $v_{I}<0$.

## 1.4 SEMICONDUCTORS

The material in widest use by the semiconductor industry today is silicon $(\mathrm{Si})$, an element of Group IV of the periodic table of elements (see the portion shown in Table 1.1). The atoms of Group IV elements possess four electrons in their outer electron shell, also called the valence band. Each atom shares these four electrons with its four nearest neighbor atoms to form covalent bonds. These bonds keep atoms

bound to fixed positions of an orderly spatial structure known as crystal lattice. This is depicted in the two-dimensional rendition of Fig. 1.33a. The number of silicon atoms per unit volume (atoms $/ \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ ), also called atomic density, is

$$
\begin{equation*}
N_{s i}=5 \times 10^{22} \text { atoms } / \mathrm{cm}^{3} \tag{1.16}
\end{equation*}
$$

Due to thermal agitation, a covalent bond may break on occasion, freeing an electron which then becomes available for conduction. Consequently, the parent atom is said to be ionized. As we know, the electron charge is $-q$, where

$$
\begin{equation*}
q=1.602 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C} \tag{1.17}
\end{equation*}
$$

Once an electron moves away from a covalent site, it leaves behind a vacancy having charge $+q$, as shown in Fig. 1.33b. An electron from another covalent bond may fill this vacancy, leaving in turn behind another vacancy at the covalent site of origin.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d2e70fdf64cb0b15173bg-026.jpg?height=536&width=923&top_left_y=1639&top_left_x=564)

FIGURE 1.33 (a) Pure silicon. (b) Creation of an electron-hole pair by thermal agitation.

As this process repeats itself, we are in effect witnessing the motion of positively charged vacancies, or holes, through the crystal.

Just as thermal agitation results in the creation of free electron-hole pairs, an electron and a hole may recombine and thus disappear from the pool of free charges. The recombination rate is proportional to the number of free electron-hole pairs available, which in turn is a strong function of temperature. In thermal equilibrium, the recombination rate equals the generation rate, resulting in an equilibrium electron concentration (or density) $n$ (electrons/cm ${ }^{3}$ ) and hole concentration (or density) $p$ (holes $/ \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ ) such that

$$
\begin{equation*}
n=p=n_{i} \tag{1.18}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $n_{i}$ is called the intrinsic concentration. For silicon, $n_{i}$ is such that

$$
\begin{equation*}
n_{i}^{2}(T)=B T^{3} e^{-V_{c 0} / V_{T}} \mathrm{~cm}^{-6} \tag{1.19}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $T$ is absolute temperature, in $\mathrm{K}, B$ is a suitable constant, $V_{G 0}=1.205 \mathrm{~V}$ is the bandgap voltage for silicon, and

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{T}=\frac{k T}{q} \tag{1.20}
\end{equation*}
$$

is a temperature-dependent scaling factor, in V, often arising in semiconductor physics and called the thermal voltage. Here $q$ is the electron charge and $k=1.381 \times 10^{-23} \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{K}$ is Boltzmann's constant. At room temperature ( $T=300 \mathrm{~K}$ ), we have $V_{T}=25.86 \mathrm{mV}$ $\cong 26 \mathrm{mV}$ 。

For silicon, Eq. (1.19) takes on the form

$$
\begin{equation*}
n_{i}^{2}(T)=1.5 \times 10^{33} T^{3} e^{-14,028 / T} \mathrm{~cm}^{-6} \tag{1.21}
\end{equation*}
$$

We observe that $n_{i}$ is a strong function of temperature. At $T=300 \mathrm{~K}$ we have $n_{i}^{2}=2 \times 10^{20} \mathrm{~cm}^{-6}$, or $n_{i}=1.4 \times 10^{10} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$, indicating that only one in about $36 \times$ $10^{12}$ silicon atoms is ionized. By contrast, in a good conductor each atom contributes one or more electrons to conduction. It is apparent that at room temperature pure silicon is not much of a conductor.

### Doping

The electric properties of an element of Group IV can be altered dramatically by replacing some of its atoms with atoms of elements from the adjacent groups. For instance, replacing an atom of silicon with one of phosphorous $(\mathrm{P})$, which belongs to Group V and thus possesses five electrons in its outer shell, results in the situation of Fig. 1.34a. Four of the five electrons will go into forming covalent bonds, just like those of a silicon atom would; the fifth electron, due to thermal agitation, will wander throughout the crystal, no longer belonging to any particular atom and thus being free and available for conduction. Group V elements are referred to as donors in that each atom contributes, or donates, an electron to the silicon crystal. By contrast, replacing an atom of silicon with one of boron (B), which belongs to
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d2e70fdf64cb0b15173bg-028.jpg?height=530&width=941&top_left_y=331&top_left_x=563)

FIGURE 1.34 Silicon with (a) a donor atom, and (b) an acceptor atom.

Group III and thus possesses only three electrons in its outer shell, will lead to the situation of Fig. 1.34b. Here, the lack of a fourth electron results in a hole, and since holes in turn accept electrons when they recombine, Group III elements are referred to as acceptors.

The replacement of silicon atoms with donor or acceptor atoms is called doping. Since doped silicon is no longer pure, donor and acceptor atoms are collectively referred to as impurities. By doping silicon with a sufficient number of impurities, we can turn it into a good conductor-hence the reason for calling it a semiconductor. Doping can be achieved in more than one way. With solid-state diffusion, the doping material is deposited on a selected area of the silicon crystal, which is then placed in a high temperature furnace to force the impurity atoms to penetrate and diffuse into the underlying region of the crystal. With ion implantation, the silicon crystal is bombarded with ions of the desired impurity material, which then remain embedded in the crystal. Doped silicon can also be grown directly as a crystal, starting with a suitable mixture of silicon and impurity atoms of the desired type.

The donor and acceptor concentrations (atoms $/ \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ ), also called doping densities, are denoted as $N_{D}$ and $N_{A}$, respectively. Depending on the particular requirements, doping doses may range from as low as $10^{14}$ atoms $/ \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ to as high as $10^{21}$ atoms $/ \mathrm{cm}^{3}$, that is, practical impurity densities are always much higher than the room-temperature intrinsic electron-hole concentration ( $\left.n_{i}=1.4 \times 10^{10} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}\right)$. Consequently, at room temperature, silicon doped with donor impurities, also called $n$-type silicon, has $n>$ $N_{D}$, while silicon doped with acceptor impurities, also called p-type silicon, has $p>N_{A}$.

Regardless of the type and amount of doping, the electron and hole concentrations satisfy at all times the mass-action law,

$$
\begin{equation*}
n \times p=n_{i}^{2} \tag{1.22}
\end{equation*}
$$

or $n \times p=2 \times 10^{20} \mathrm{~cm}^{-6}$ at room temperature ( $T=300 \mathrm{~K}$ ). Consequently, in n-type silicon we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
n \cong N_{D} \quad p \cong \frac{n_{i}^{2}}{N_{D}} \tag{1.23a}
\end{equation*}
$$

while in p-type silicon we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
p \cong N_{A} \quad n \cong \frac{n_{i}^{2}}{N_{A}} \tag{1.23b}
\end{equation*}
$$

To put numbers in perspective, suppose some $n$-type silicon has been doped with $N_{D}=10^{16} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$. Then, $n \cong 10^{16} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and $p \cong 2 \times 10^{20} / 10^{16}=2 \times 10^{4} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$, indicating a material much richer in electrons and much poorer in holes than intrinsic silicon. Since $n \gg p$, electrons in $n$-type silicon are aptly called majority charge carriers, and holes minority charge carriers. Conversely, a $p$-type silicon with $N_{A}=10^{18} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ would have $p \cong 10^{18} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and $n \cong 2 \times 10^{2} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$. Since now $p \gg n$, the majority carriers in $p$-type silicon are holes, and the minority carriers are electrons.

It is understood that the thermal generation of electron-hole pairs continues to take place just as in the intrinsic case. However, with such an abundance of majority carriers, the chance of recombining for minority carriers is now much higher, this being the reason for their much reduced concentration. In fact, the balance between the two charge types is governed by the mass-action law!

We note that the designations $n$-type and $p$-type identify only the type of majority carriers in the given material. They should not mislead the reader into regarding $n$-type material as negatively charged, or $p$-type material as positively charged! Regardless of the doping type, the material remains at all times neutrally charged because for every charge that has been freed there is the charge of the ionized atom left behind, which is of the opposite polarity. Figure. 1.35 depicts $n$ and $p$ for three significant cases.

### Drift and Diffusion Currents

There are two types of conduction mechanisms in semiconductors, often coexisting: drift and diffusion.

- The Drift Current: To discuss the drift mechanism, refer to Fig. 1.36a, top, where a slab of $p$-type material is assumed to be immersed in an electric field of strength $E$ (in $\mathrm{V} / \mathrm{cm}$ ). Such a field can be produced by connecting an external battery across the slab. If the slab is homogeneous, as assumed here, the
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d2e70fdf64cb0b15173bg-029.jpg?height=535&width=1219&top_left_y=1645&top_left_x=317)

FIGURE 1.35 Mobile-charge concentrations in a slab of (a) pure silicon, (b) n-type silicon, and (c) p-type silicon. (The vertical scales are logarithmic.)

FIGURE 1.36 Illustrating (a) current drift and (b) current diffusion for the case of holes.
potential $v(x)$ will vary linearly across the slab, as shown at the bottom. From basic physics we know that field and potential are related as

$$
\begin{equation*}
E=-\frac{d v(x)}{d x} \tag{1.24}
\end{equation*}
$$

Consequently, $E$ will be constant throughout the homogeneous slab.
Now, under the accelerating effect of $E$, holes will drift in the same direction as the field and achieve an average drift velocity $v_{p}$ (in $\mathrm{cm} / \mathrm{s}$ ) which is linearly proportional to the field strength,

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{p}=\mu_{p} E \tag{1.25a}
\end{equation*}
$$

Aptly called the hole mobility, $\mu_{p}$ (in $\mathrm{cm}^{2} / \mathrm{Vs}$ ) gives a measure of the average drift velocity acquired by holes for a given applied field. As holes drift, they produce the current $i_{p(\text { drift })}=d Q_{p} / d t$, where $d Q_{p}$ is the amount of charge transferred during the interval $d t$. Given that during $d t$ holes travel the distance $d x=v_{p} d t$, the holes making up $d Q_{p}$ are contained within the volume $A d x=A v_{p} d t$, and their number is thus $p A v_{p} d t$, where $p$ is their concentration (holes $/ \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ ), and $A$ is the cross sectional area of the silicon slab (in $\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ ). Multiplying this number by the hole charge $+q$ gives $d Q_{p}=q p A v_{p} d t$, so

$$
i_{p(\mathrm{drift})}=\frac{d Q_{p}}{d t}=q p A v_{p}=q p A \mu_{p} E
$$

As we progress, we will find it more convenient to work with the current per unit area, or current densiy $J$ (in $\mathrm{A} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$ ), rather than with the ordinary current $i$ (in A). The hole drift current density is simply $J_{p(\text { drift })}=i_{p(\text { drift })} / A$, or

$$
\begin{equation*}
J_{p(\mathrm{drift})}=q p \mu_{p} E \tag{1.25b}
\end{equation*}
$$

Similar considerations hold for a slab of $n$-type material, except that in this case the mobile charges are electrons, whose concentration and mobility are $n$ and $\mu_{n}$. Thus, the average drift velocity of electrons is

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{n}=\mu_{n} E \tag{1.26a}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\mu_{n}$ (in $\mathrm{cm}^{2} / \mathrm{Vs}$ ) is the electron mobility, and the electron drift current density is

$$
\begin{equation*}
J_{n(\mathrm{drift})}=q n \mu_{n} E \tag{1.26b}
\end{equation*}
$$

Equation (1.26b) is also at the basis of metals and ordinary conductors such as composition resistors, where the only type of mobile charges available are electrons. Both equations indicate the necessary ingredients for good conduction: high concentration along with high mobility.

- The Diffusion Current: The other mechanism for charge-carrier motion in semiconductors is diffusion-a mechanism not found in ordinary conductors. As we progress, we shall see that in semiconductor devices it is possible to establish and continuously maintain non-uniform profiles for the mobile charge densities. Figure $1.36 b$ shows an example of a linear density profile, such as that found in the base region of a forward-biased bipolar junction transistor. As holes wander randomly because of thermal agitation, they tend to diffuse from regions of higher density to regions of lower density, or toward the right in our example. This is similar to particles of smoke diffusing from the smoking area to the rest of a room. If holes are continuously injected to the left while being removed from the right, a sustained current flow will result. The hole diffusion current density is

$$
\begin{equation*}
J_{p(\mathrm{diff})}=-q D \frac{d p(x)}{d x} \tag{1.27a}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $D_{p}$ is the hole diffusivity (in $\mathrm{cm}^{2} / \mathrm{s}$ ). The negative sign stems from the fact that holes flow in the direction of the negative gradient in $p$. Likewise, the electron diffusion current density is

$$
\begin{equation*}
J_{n(\mathrm{diff})}=q D_{n} \frac{d n(x)}{d x} \tag{1.27b}
\end{equation*}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d2e70fdf64cb0b15173bg-031.jpg?height=46&width=1115&top_left_y=1964&top_left_x=399) the negative charge of electrons.

We note strong similarities between the expressions for the drift and diffusion currents. In fact, substituting Eq. (1.24) into Eqs. (1.25b) and (1.26b) gives

$$
J_{p(\mathrm{drift})}=-q p \mu_{p} \frac{d v(x)}{d x} \quad J_{n(\mathrm{drift})}=q n \mu \frac{d v(x)}{d x}
$$

FIGURE 1.37 Room-temperature dependence of the mobilities on the total doping density, and empirical formulas for their calculation for the case of donor atoms of phosphorous and acceptor atoms of boron.
which are even closer in form to Eqs. (1.27a) and (1.27b). These equations indicate that:

- To sustain a given current we need a gradient (a voltage gradient to sustain drift, a density gradient to sustain diffusion).
- Charge flow is in the direction of a decreasing gradient.
- The diffusivities $D_{p}$ and $D_{n}$ play a similar role to the mobilities $\mu_{p}$ and $\mu_{n}$ in that each offers a measure of how much current stems from a given gradient. Indeed, it turns out that diffusivities and mobilities are related by Einstein's relations

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{D_{n}}{\mu_{n}}=\frac{D_{p}}{\mu_{p}}=V_{T} \tag{1.28}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $V_{T} \cong 26 \mathrm{mV}$ is the thermal voltage of Eq. (1.20).
Mobilities and diffusivities are greatest when silicon is pure, but decrease with doping as well as temperature. Figure 1.37 shows the dependence of $\mu_{n}$ and $\mu_{p}$ on the total doping density $\left(N_{A}+N_{D}\right)$, at room temperature. The higher mobility (by a factor of two to three) exhibited by electrons compared to holes is the primary reason why $n$-type materials are generally preferred over $p$-type materials, particularly in the fabrication of devices intended for high-speed operation.

Lastly, it must be pointed out that the linear relationships between velocities and electric field, expressed as $v_{n}=\mu_{n} E$ and $v_{p}=\mu_{p} E$, hold only up to a certain field strength, typically on the order of $5 \mathrm{kV} / \mathrm{cm}$. Past this limit, electron and hole velocities saturate at approximately $10^{7} \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{s}$. Aptly called velocity saturation, this phenomenon sets an upper limit on the speed of operation of semiconductor devices such as MOSFETs.

### An Example: The Integrated-Circuit Diode

Figure 1.38 illustrates the most basic steps involved in the fabrication of the pn junction diode, a semiconductor device at the basis of most other integrated-circuit (IC) devices. Starting out with a lightly doped $n$-type slab, such as $N_{D}=10^{15} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$, a localized boron diffusion is made to create a $p$-type region. Clearly, in order to overcome

the existing $n$-type nature of this region, the acceptor density $N_{A}$ must exceed the existing donor density $N_{D}$ there. Then, in this region we have

$$
p \cong N_{A}-N_{D} \quad n \cong \frac{n_{i}^{2}}{N_{A}-N_{D}}
$$

An additional diffusion is made to create a heavily doped $n$-type region to ensure an ohmic contact between the $n$-type slab and a metal (more on this later in the chapter), and finally metal depositions are made to allow for the interconnection of the device to external circuitry.

The dimensions of the above device are in the range of micro meters $\left(1 \mu \mathrm{~m}=10^{-6} \mathrm{~m}\right)$. Such tiny dimensions allow for the simultaneous fabrication of a very large number of devices on the same wafer. To prevent different devices from interfering with each other, we must keep them electrically isolated from each other. Interestingly enough, a popular way of achieving isolation is through additional reverse-biased pn junctions, a subject that we will illustrate in greater detail when studying the fabrication of transistors. The interested student is encouraged to search the Web for videos and articles illustrating the fascinating subject of integrated circuit fabrication.

(b) $p$-type diffusion: $N_{A}=10^{17}$ boron atoms $/ \mathrm{cm}^{3}$
(c) $n^{+}$-type diffusion: $N_{D}=10^{20}$ phosphorous atoms $/ \mathrm{cm}^{3}$

### Solution

(a) We have $n \cong N_{D}=10^{15} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and $p \cong n_{i}^{2} / N_{D}=2 \times 10^{20} / 10^{15}=2 \times 10^{5} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$. Using the empirical formulas of Fig. 1.37, we find

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mu_{n}=68+\frac{1346}{1+\left(\frac{10^{15}}{9.2 \times 10^{16}}\right)^{0.71}}=1362 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \mathrm{Vs} \\
& \mu_{p}=45+\frac{427}{1+\left(\frac{10^{15}}{2.2 \times 10^{17}}\right)^{0.72}}=463 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \mathrm{Vs}
\end{aligned}
$$

Using Eq. (1.28), we find $D_{n}=0.026 \times 1362=35.4 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \mathrm{s}$ and $D_{p}=$ $0.026 \times 463=12 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \mathrm{s}$.
(b) We now have $p \cong N_{A}-N_{D}=10^{17}-10^{15} \cong 10^{17} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and $n \cong n_{i}^{2} /\left(N_{A}-N_{D}\right) \cong$ $2 \times 10^{3} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$. Using again the empirical formulas,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mu_{n}=68+\frac{1346}{1+\left(\frac{10^{17}+10^{15}}{9.2 \times 10^{16}}\right)^{0.71}}=719 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \mathrm{Vs} \\
& \mu_{p}=45+\frac{427}{1+\left(\frac{10^{17}+10^{15}}{2.2 \times 10^{17}}\right)^{0.72}}=317 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \mathrm{Vs}
\end{aligned}
$$

Moreover, $D_{n}=0.026 \times 719=18.7 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \mathrm{s}$ and $D_{p}=8.3 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \mathrm{s}$.
(c) We now have $n \cong 10^{20}+10^{15} \cong 10^{20} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}, p \cong 2 / \mathrm{cm}^{3} ; \mu_{n}=78 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \mathrm{Vs}$, $D_{n}=2 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \mathrm{s} ; \mu_{p}=50 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \mathrm{Vs}$, and $D_{p}=1.3 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \mathrm{s}$.

## 1.5 THE pn JUNCTION IN EQUILIBRIUM

When a $p$-type and an $n$-type region are joined together, they are said to form a $p n$ junction. Even though in practice they are fabricated contiguously as exemplified in Fig. 1.38, from a pedagogical viewpoint it is convenient to consider two slabs that have been fabricated separately and are brought into contact with each other subsequently, in the manner depicted in Fig. 1.39, top. To develop a numerical feel for the various quantities involved, we shall work with the following doping concentration example:

$$
\begin{equation*}
N_{A}=10^{18} / \mathrm{cm}^{3} \quad N_{D}=10^{16} / \mathrm{cm}^{3} \tag{1.29}
\end{equation*}
$$

Assume donor atoms of phosphorous and acceptor atoms of boron, so we can use the formulas of Fig. 1.37, when necessary. Using the subscript zero to identify equilibrium concentrations, we exploit Eq. (1.23b) to find the $p$-side hole and electron concentrations

$$
\begin{equation*}
p_{p 0} \cong N_{A}=10^{18} / \mathrm{cm}^{3} \quad n_{p 0} \cong \frac{n_{i}^{2}}{N_{A}}=2 \times 10^{2} / \mathrm{cm}^{3} \tag{1.30a}
\end{equation*}
$$

and we exploit Eq. (1.23a) to find the $n$-side electron and hole concentrations

$$
\begin{equation*}
n_{n 0} \cong N_{D}=10^{16} / \mathrm{cm}^{3} \quad p_{n 0} \cong \frac{n_{i}^{2}}{N_{D}}=2 \times 10^{4} / \mathrm{cm}^{3} \tag{1.30b}
\end{equation*}
$$

Once the two slabs are brought into contact, holes will diffuse from the $p$-side, where they are highly concentrated $\left(10^{18}\right.$ holes $\left./ \mathrm{cm}^{3}\right)$, toward the $n$-side, where they are concentrated only sparingly ( $2 \times 10^{4}$ holes $/ \mathrm{cm}^{3}$. $)$ Likewise, electrons will diffuse in the opposite direction. However, every hole diffusing across the metallurgical junction leaves behind a negatively charged ion, just as every diffusing electron leaves behind a positively charged ion. These ions are bound to their fixed positions in the crystal lattice and do not contribute to current. However, they form a space charge layer (SCL), also called depletion layer because it is essentially depleted of mobile charges
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d2e70fdf64cb0b15173bg-035.jpg?height=1603&width=810&top_left_y=339&top_left_x=327)

FIGURE 1.39 Equilibrium conditions in a pn slab.
due to their diffusion across the junction. The SCL, in turn, establishes an electric field $E$ in the direction opposing diffusion. As holes and electrons keep diffusing, the SCL keeps building up, until an equilibrium condition is reached whereby the electric field $E$ will exactly counterbalance the tendency of holes and electrons to diffuse further. Thereafter, the net current across the junction will be zero.

### Equilibrium Conditions

We express the equilibrium conditions by writing $J_{p(\text { drifif })}+J_{p(\text { diff }}=0$ and $J_{n(\text { drift })}+$ $J_{n(d i f f)}=0$. Taking the origin of the $x$-axis at the point of contact between the $p$ and $n$ regions, also called the metallurgical junction, we have, by Eqs. (1.25) through (1.27),

$$
\begin{align*}
& q p(x) \mu_{p} E(x)-q D \frac{d p(x)}{d x}=0  \tag{1.31a}\\
& q n(x) \mu_{n} E(x)+q D_{n} \frac{d n(x)}{d x}=0 \tag{1.31b}
\end{align*}
$$

where we are emphasizing that $p, n$, and $E$ are now functions of the position $x$ along the $p n$ slab.

The equilibrium situation is illustrated further in Fig. 1.39, where the origin of the $x$ axis has been taken right at the metallurgical junction. The edges of the SCL are located at $-x_{p 0}$ and $+x_{n 0}$, respectively. The charge density $\rho$ (in $\mathrm{C} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ ) due to immobile ions is $+q N_{D}$ in the $n$ side of the SCL, and $-q N_{A}$ in the $p$ side. Denoting the cross-sectional area of the $p$ and $n$ slabs as $A$, we find the total SCL charge in the $n$-side as $Q^{+}=q N_{D} \times A x_{n 0}$, and the total SCL charge in the $p$-side as $Q^{-}=-q N_{A} \times A x_{p 0}$. Charge neutrality requires that $Q^{+}=-Q^{-}$, or $q N_{D} A x_{n 0}=q N_{A} A x_{p 0}$. Simplifying, we get

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{x_{p 0}}{x_{n 0}}=\frac{N_{D}}{N_{A}} \tag{1.32}
\end{equation*}
$$

indicating that in an asymmetrically doped $p n$ junction such as ours $\left(N_{A} \gg N_{D}\right)$, the SCL will extend mostly into the more lightly doped side $\left(x_{n 0} \gg x_{p 0}\right)$. This makes sense as it takes more volume in the lightly doped side to come up with the same number of ions as the heavily doped side. We have tried to convey this pictorially in Fig. 1.39, top.

We readily visualize the electric field strength $E$ as a function of $x$ by counting the field lines. Each line starts on a positive ion at the right and ends on a negative ion at the left. The number of lines is maximum at the metallurgical junction $(x=0)$ and decreases linearly as we move away on either side, to finally drop to zero at the edges of the SCL. The regions outside the SCL, where the electric field is zero, are aptly called the neutral regions. Because of asymmetric doping, the profile of $E$ is a scalene triangle, and a negative one as $E$ is in the direction of negative $x$.

We readily find a relationship between the maximum strength $E_{m 0}$ and the SCL edges $x_{p 0}$ and $x_{n 0}$ via Gauss's theorem. In a one-dimensional case such as this, this theorem is expressed as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d E}{d x}=\frac{\rho(x)}{\varepsilon_{s i}} \tag{1.33}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\varepsilon_{s i}$ is silicon's permittivity $\left(\varepsilon_{s i}=1.04 \mathrm{pF} / \mathrm{cm}\right)$. In the right portion of the SCL we have $d E / d x=E_{m 0} / x_{n}$ and $\rho / \varepsilon_{s i}=q N_{D} / \varepsilon_{s i}$, so $E_{m 0} / x_{n 0}=q N_{D} / \varepsilon_{s i t}$. Applying similar considerations to the left side of the SCL and solving for $E_{m 0}$ gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
E_{m 0}=\frac{q N_{A} x_{p 0}}{\varepsilon_{s i}}=\frac{q N_{D} x_{n 0}}{\varepsilon_{s i}} \tag{1.34}
\end{equation*}
$$

### The Built-in Potential $\boldsymbol{\phi}_{\mathbf{0}}$

From basic electrostatics we know that an electric field is always accompanied by an electric potential gradient. For a one-dimensional situation such as ours, the relationship between field $E$ and potential $\phi$ is, by Eq. (1.24), $E=-d \phi / d x$. Rewriting as $\phi=-\int E d x$, we visualize $\phi$ as the negative of the area enclosed by the $E$ curve. Since $E$ has a linear profile, $\phi$ will have a quadratic profile, as shown in Fig. 1.39, bottom. We observe that outside the SCL the profile of $\phi$ is flat because $E=0$ there. The potentials there are denoted as $\phi_{p}$ and $\phi_{n}$, respectively. We now wish to find expressions for $\phi_{p}$ and $\phi_{n}$, as well as for the built-in equilibrium potential $\phi_{0}$, defined as

$$
\phi_{0}=\phi_{n}-\phi_{p}
$$

This potential acts as a barrier preventing holes and electrons from diffusing further, and is the result of the charge redistribution taking place automatically at either side of the metallurgical junction when we create it. Solving for $E(x)$ in Eq. (1.31) and using Einstein's relations of Eq. (1.28) gives

$$
E(x) d x=V_{T} \frac{d p(x)}{p(x)}=-V_{T} \frac{d n(x)}{n(x)}
$$

Using again $\phi(x)=-\int E(x) d x$ and integrating from $-x_{p 0}$ to $+x_{n 0}$ gives

$$
\int_{\phi_{p}}^{\phi_{n}} d \phi(x)=-V_{T} \int_{p_{p 0}}^{p_{n 0}} \frac{d p(x)}{p(x)}=V_{T} \int_{n_{n 0}}^{n_{n 0}} \frac{d n(x)}{n(x)}
$$

where the integration limits are, respectively, the values of $\phi, p$, and $n$ at $x=-x_{p 0}$ and $x=+x_{n 0}$. This gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\phi_{0}=\phi_{n}-\phi_{p}=V_{T} \ln \frac{p_{p 0}}{p_{n 0}}=V_{T} \ln \frac{n_{n 0}}{n_{p 0}} \tag{1.35}
\end{equation*}
$$

Using Eq. (1.10), we can also write

$$
\begin{gather*}
\phi_{0}=V_{T} \ln \frac{N_{A} N_{D}}{n_{i}^{2}}  \tag{1.36a}\\
\phi_{n}=V_{T} \ln \frac{N_{D}}{n_{i}}  \tag{1.36b}\\
\phi_{p}=V_{T} \ln \frac{n_{i}}{N_{A}} \tag{1.36c}
\end{gather*}
$$

Note that since in practical junctions $N_{A}$ and $N_{D}$ are greater than $n_{i}$, we have $\phi_{n}>0$ and $\phi_{p}<0$. Moreover, since $N_{A}$ and $N_{D}$ appear in the argument of the logarithmic function, the $\phi \mathrm{s}$ of Eq. (1.36) are not that sensitive to variations in the doping doses.
(a) Find the room-temperature values of $\phi_{n}, \phi_{p}$, and $\phi_{0}$ for a junction with the

EXAMPLE 1.6 dopings of Eq. (1.29).
(b) Find $\phi_{0}$ if both doping doses are increased by an order of magnitude.

### Solution

(a) We have $\phi_{n}=(26 \mathrm{mV}) \ln \left[10^{16} /\left(1.4 \times 10^{10}\right)\right]=0.350 \mathrm{~V}, \phi_{p}=-0.470 \mathrm{~V}$, and $\phi_{0}=0.350-(-0.470)=0.820 \mathrm{~V}$.
(b) Now $\phi_{0}=0.940 \mathrm{~V}$, not much of a change because of the logarithmic dependence. It pays to think of $\phi_{0}$ as being close to 1 V , regardless of the particular doping values.

### The Electric Field $E_{m 0}$, the SCL Width $X_{d 0}$, and the SCL Charge $\boldsymbol{Q}_{j 0}$

We now wish to derive an expression for all other pertinent junction parameters in equilibrium. The maximum field strength $E_{m 0}$ is found once again via $\int d \phi(x)=-\int E(x) d x$, where we integrate from $-x_{p 0}$ to $x_{n 0}$. The left-hand side integrates simply to $\phi_{0}$, while the right-hand side represents the negative of the area of the electric-field triangle. Consequently, we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
\phi_{0}=\frac{\left(x_{p 0}+x_{n 0}\right) E_{m 0}}{2} \tag{1.37}
\end{equation*}
$$

But, according to Eq. (1.34),

$$
\begin{equation*}
x_{p 0}=\frac{\varepsilon_{s i}}{q N_{A}} E_{m 0} \quad x_{n 0}=\frac{\varepsilon_{s i}}{q N_{D}} E_{m 0} \tag{1.38}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substituting $x_{p 0}$ and $x_{n 0}$ into Eq. (1.37), expressing $\phi_{0}$ via Eq. (1.36a), and solving for $E_{m 0}$, we finally get

$$
\begin{equation*}
E_{m 0}=\sqrt{\frac{2 q \phi_{0}}{\varepsilon_{s i}} \frac{N_{A} N_{D}}{N_{A}+N_{D}}} \tag{1.39}
\end{equation*}
$$

If we insert Eq. (1.39) back into Eq. (1.38), we obtain the equilibrium edges of the SCL as

$$
\begin{equation*}
x_{p 0}=\sqrt{\frac{2 \varepsilon_{s i} \phi_{0}}{q N_{A}} \frac{N_{D}}{N_{A}+N_{D}}} \quad x_{n 0}=\sqrt{\frac{2 \varepsilon_{s i} \phi_{0}}{q N_{D}} \frac{N_{A}}{N_{A}+N_{D}}} \tag{1.40}
\end{equation*}
$$

The sum of the two is aptly called the equilibrium $S C L$ width, $X_{d 0}=x_{p 0}+x_{n 0}$. By Eq. (1.40),

$$
\begin{equation*}
X_{d 0}=\sqrt{\frac{2 \varepsilon_{s i} \phi_{0}}{q}\left(\frac{1}{N_{A}}+\frac{1}{N_{D}}\right)} \tag{1.41}
\end{equation*}
$$

The equilibrium junction charge is $Q_{j 0}=Q^{+}=q N_{D} A x_{n 0}$, where $A$ is the aforementioned junction's cross-sectional area. Using Eq. (1.40),

$$
\begin{equation*}
Q_{j 0}=A \sqrt{2 \varepsilon_{s i} q \phi_{0} \frac{N_{A} N_{D}}{N_{A}+N_{D}}} \tag{1.42}
\end{equation*}
$$

Assuming a cross-sectional area $A=(100 \mu \mathrm{~m}) \times(100 \mu \mathrm{~m})$ for a $p n$ junction with the doping doses of Eq. (1.29), find $E_{m 0}, X_{d 0}, x_{p 0}, x_{n 0}$, and $Q_{j 0}$.

### Solution

From Example $1.6, \phi_{0}=0.820 \mathrm{~V}$. Also, since in our case $N_{A} \gg N_{D}$, we can approximate $N_{A} N_{D} /\left(N_{A}+N_{D}\right) \cong N_{D}=10^{16} \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$. Then, Eq. (1.39) gives

$$
E_{m 0} \cong \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \times 0.820 \times 10^{16}}{1.04 \times 10^{-12}}}=5.03 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~V} / \mathrm{cm}
$$

and Eq. (1.41) gives

$$
X_{d 0} \cong \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 1.04 \times 10^{-12} \times 0.820}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}}\left(\frac{1}{10^{16}}\right)}=3.26 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~cm}=0.326 \mu \mathrm{~m}
$$

Similarly, Eq. (1.40) gives $x_{p 0}=0.003 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ and $x_{n 0}=0.323 \mu \mathrm{~m}$, confirming that the SCL extends almost entirely into the more lightly doped side, which in our example is the $n$ side. Finally, since the junction area is $A=\left(100 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~cm}\right)^{2}=$ $10^{-4} \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, Eq. (1.42) gives $Q_{j 0}=5.23 \mathrm{pC}$.

### Exercise 1.5

Show that

$$
\begin{equation*}
\phi(0)=\phi_{p}+\frac{N_{D}}{N_{A}+N_{D}} \phi_{0} \tag{1.43}
\end{equation*}
$$

Hence, verify that $\phi(0)=0$ only in the case of symmetrically doped junctions $\left(N_{D}=N_{A}\right)$. Otherwise, $\phi(0)>0$ for $N_{D}>N_{A}$, and $\phi(0)<0$ for $N_{D}<N_{A}$ (as in the case of Fig. 1.39).

## 1.6 EFFECT OF EXTERNAL BIAS ON THE SCL PARAMETERS

Let us now investigate the effect of applying a voltage $v$ across our $p n$ junction in the manner of Fig. 1.40, top. (Note that the polarity convention for $v$ is positive at the $p$ side and negative at the $n$ side; for $v>0$ the $p n$ junction is said to be forward biased, and for $v<0$ it is reverse biased.) By KVL, the potential barrier across the spacecharge layer (SCL) becomes $\phi_{0}-v$. With a changed profile for $\phi$, the electric field strength $E$ will also have to change. Since the field lines making up $E$ come from the uncovered ions of the SCL, the SCL's width $X_{d}=x_{n}+x_{p}$ will have to change accordingly. Specifically, we can state that:

- Forward biasing the junction $(v>0)$ lowers the potential barrier as well as the electric field compared to the unbiased case, and thus shrinks $X_{d}$.
- Conversely, reverse biasing the junction $(v<0)$ raises the potential barrier and the electric field, and thus widens $X_{d}$. For a visual comparison, Fig. 1.40 uses gray lines to show the unbiased situation.

FIGURE 1.40 Effect of forward-biasing a pn junction.
To investigate the effect of the external bias $v$ quantitatively, we simply replace $\phi_{0}$ with $\left(\phi_{0}-v\right)$ in Eqs. (1.39) through (1.42). Thus, rewriting Eq. (1.39) with $E_{m}(v)$ in place of $E_{m 0}$ and $\left(\phi_{0}-v\right)$ in place of $\phi_{0}$, we get the maximum electric-field strength as a function of $v$

$$
E_{m}(v)=\sqrt{\frac{2 q\left(\phi_{0}-v\right)}{\varepsilon_{s i}} \frac{N_{A} N_{D}}{N_{A}+N_{D}}}=\sqrt{\frac{2 q \phi_{0}}{\varepsilon_{s i}} \frac{N_{A} N_{D}}{N_{A}+N_{D}}} \sqrt{1-\frac{v}{\phi_{0}}}
$$

This is expressed more concisely as

$$
\begin{equation*}
E_{m}(v)=E_{m 0} \sqrt{1-\frac{v}{\phi_{0}}} \tag{1.44}
\end{equation*}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d2e70fdf64cb0b15173bg-041.jpg?height=450&width=1190&top_left_y=333&top_left_x=324)

FIGURE 1.41 Voltage dependence of the (a) SCL width and (b) junction capacitance for $m=1 / 2$.
where $E_{m 0}$, aptly called the zero-bias $(v=0)$ value of $E_{m}$, was derived in Eq. (1.39). Proceeding in similar manner for the SCL's width, we find

$$
\begin{equation*}
X_{d}(v)=X_{d 0} \sqrt{1-\frac{v}{\phi_{0}}} \tag{1.45}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $X_{d 0}$ is the zero-bias $(v=0)$ value of $X_{d}$, which was derived in Eq. (1.41). The voltage dependence of $X_{d}$ is depicted in Fig. 1.41a. Finally, the junction charge is

$$
\begin{equation*}
Q_{j}(v)=Q_{j 0} \sqrt{1-\frac{v}{\phi_{0}}} \tag{1.46}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $Q_{j 0}$ is the zero-bias $(v=0)$ value of $Q_{j}$ as given in Eq. (1.42).

### The Junction Capacitance $\boldsymbol{C}_{\boldsymbol{j}}$

Since applying a voltage across a pn junction redistributes its SCL charge, the junction exhibits capacitive behavior. The junction capacitance is $C_{j}=d Q_{j} / d v$. Differentiating Eq. (1.46) and rearranging,

$$
\begin{equation*}
C_{j}(v)=\frac{C_{j 0}}{\left(1-v / \phi_{0}\right)^{m}} \tag{1.47a}
\end{equation*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{equation*}
C_{j 0}=A \sqrt{\frac{\varepsilon_{s i} q}{2 \phi_{0}} \frac{N_{A} N_{D}}{N_{A}+N_{D}}} \tag{1.47b}
\end{equation*}
$$

is the zero-bias $(v=0)$ value of $C_{j}$ and $m$, called the grading coefficient, is $1 / 2$ in the present case, which assumes an abrupt junction. Practical junctions often have a graded doping profile, in which case it can be shown ${ }^{2}$ that a more appropriate value is $m=1 / 3$. The actual value of $m$ can be found experimentally by measuring $C_{j}$ for different values of $v$ and then using data-interpolation to indirectly find $m$. The voltage dependence of $C_{j}$ is depicted in Fig. 1.41b.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d2e70fdf64cb0b15173bg-042.jpg?height=410&width=896&top_left_y=340&top_left_x=567)

FIGURE 1.42 (a) The junction capacitance $C_{j}$, and $(b)$ its parallel-plate equivalent.
Combining Eqs. (1.41), (1.45), and (1.47) with $m=1 / 2$, we put $C_{J}$ in yet another insightful form

$$
\begin{equation*}
C_{j}(v)=\varepsilon_{s i} \frac{A}{X_{d}(v)} \tag{1.48}
\end{equation*}
$$

This is the same form as that of a parallel-plate capacitor consisting of two plates of area $A$ separated by a dielectric material having permittivity $\varepsilon_{s i}$ and thickness $X_{d}$. This equivalence is illustrated in Fig. 1.42. However, unlike a fixed capacitor, the present one exhibits a voltage-dependent plate separation $X_{d}(v)$, indicating nonlinear capacitance behavior, as already seen in Fig. 1.41b. We also observe that Eq. (1.47a) predicts $C_{j} \rightarrow \infty$ for $v \rightarrow \phi_{0}$. This, of course, cannot happen in practice, indicating that Eq. $(1.47 a)$, whose derivation is based on a number of simplifying assumptions, no longer holds as $v$ approaches $\phi_{0}$.

EXAMPLE 1.8 Find $C_{j 0}$ for the junction of Example 1.7. Then, assuming $m=1 / 2$, calculate $E_{m}, X_{d}$, $Q_{j}$, and $C_{j}$ for $(a) v=+0.65 \mathrm{~V}$, and $(b) v=-5 \mathrm{~V}$.

### Solution

(a) Using Eq. (1.47b) we readily find $C_{j 0}=3.19 \mathrm{pF}$. Moreover

$$
\sqrt{1-v / \phi_{0}}=\sqrt{1-0.65 / 0.82}=0.455
$$

indicating a decrease in $E_{m}, X_{d}$, and $Q_{j}$, but an increase in $C_{j}$. Indeed, at $v=+0.65 \mathrm{~V}$ we have $E_{m}=5.03 \times 10^{4} \times 0.455=2.29 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~V} / \mathrm{cm}$, $X_{d}=0.148 \mu \mathrm{~m}, Q_{j}=2.38 \mathrm{pC}$, and $C_{j}=3.19 / 0.455=7.01 \mathrm{pF}$.
(b) Now $E_{m}, X_{d}$, and $Q_{j}$ will increase but $C_{j}$ will decrease by $\sqrt{1-(-5) / 0.82}=$ 2.66, so $E_{m}=13.4 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~V} / \mathrm{cm}, X_{d}=0.869 \mu \mathrm{~m}, Q_{j}=13.9 \mathrm{pC}$, and $C_{j}=1.20 \mathrm{pF}$.

Remark: It pays to keep in mind the following orders of magnitude for low-power junctions:

$$
\phi_{0} \sim 1 \mathrm{~V} \quad E_{m} \sim 10^{4} \mathrm{~V} / \mathrm{cm} \quad X_{d} \sim 1 \mu \mathrm{~m} \quad Q_{j} \sim 1 \mathrm{pC} \quad C_{j} \sim 1 \mathrm{pF}
$$

## 1.7 THE pn DIODE EQUATION

Forward-biasing a pn junction affects not only the parameters of its space-charge layer (SCL), but also the concentration profiles of its charge carriers in the neutral regions, and quite dramatically so, as we are about to see. The starting point is offered by Eq. (1.35), which we turn around by taking the logarithms throughout and solving for the minority concentrations,

$$
\begin{align*}
& p_{n 0}=p_{p 0} e^{-\phi_{0} / V_{T}}  \tag{1.49a}\\
& n_{p 0}=n_{n 0} e^{-\phi_{0} / V_{T}} \tag{1.49b}
\end{align*}
$$

These equations relate the hole and the electron concentrations at either side of the SCL for the unbiased $(v=0)$ equilibrium situation. If we now forward bias the junction $(v>0), E$ will decrease and thus allow holes to diffuse from the $p$ side, through the SCL, to the $n$ side, and electrons from the $n$ to the $p$ side. We can still use Eq. (1.49) to relate the concentrations right at the edges of the SCL, also called boundary concentrations, provided we replace $\phi_{0}$ with $\phi_{0}-v$. The result is

$$
\begin{align*}
& p_{n}\left(x_{n}\right)=p_{p}\left(-x_{p}\right) e^{-\left(\phi_{0}-v\right) / V_{T}}  \tag{1.50a}\\
& n_{p}\left(-x_{p}\right)=n_{n}\left(x_{n}\right) e^{-\left(\phi_{0}-v\right) / V_{T}} \tag{1.50b}
\end{align*}
$$

The so-called low-level injection assumption stipulates that even after biasing, the minority concentrations at either side of the SCL continue to remain much lower than the majority concentrations there, and thus leave the latter essentially undisturbed compared to the unbiased case. This means that we can let $p_{p}\left(-x_{p}\right)=p_{p 0}$ and $n_{n}\left(x_{n}\right)=$ $n_{n 0}$ in Eq. (1.50). Reusing Eq. (1.49), we can then write

$$
\begin{gather*}
p_{n}\left(x_{n}\right)=p_{n 0} e^{v / V_{T}}  \tag{1.51a}\\
n_{p}\left(-x_{p}\right)=n_{p 0} e^{v / V_{T}} \tag{1.51b}
\end{gather*}
$$

Referred to as the law of the junction, Eq. (1.51) relates the boundary values of the minority concentrations to the applied voltage $v$. Though the derivations were made for the forward-bias case $(v>0)$, this law holds also for the reverse-bias case $(v<0)$.

Assuming the doping doses of Eq. (1.29), find the minority and majority concentrations at either edge of the SCL if the junction is forward biased with $v=0.65 \mathrm{~V}$. Comment on your results.

### Solution

By Eq. (1.30), $p_{p}\left(-x_{p}\right)=p_{p 0} \cong 10^{18} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and $n_{n}\left(x_{n}\right) \cong n_{n 0} \cong 10^{16} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$. Moreover, $n_{p 0} \cong 2 \times 10^{2} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$, and $p_{n 0} \cong 2 \times 10^{4} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$. Since $\exp (0.650 / 0.026) \cong 7.2 \times 10^{10}$, Eq. (1.51) gives

$$
\begin{aligned}
& p_{n}\left(x_{n}\right) \cong 2 \times 10^{4} \times 7.2 \times 10^{10}=1.44 \times 10^{15} / \mathrm{cm}^{3} \\
& n_{p}\left(-x_{p}\right) \cong 2 \times 10^{2} \times 7.2 \times 10^{10}=1.44 \times 10^{13} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}
\end{aligned}
$$

FIGURE 1.43 Forward biasing a pn junction creates an excess of minority charges in the neutral regions. These charges diffuse away from the SCL, giving raise to diffusion currents.

These boundary values are shown numerically in Fig. 1.43. We observe that a forward bias of only 0.65 V causes $p_{n}\left(x_{n}\right)$ to shoot up from $2 \times 10^{4} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ to $1.44 \times 10^{15} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ ! However, this is still less than the majority concentration there $\left(10^{16} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}\right)$, thus confirming low-level injection. Likewise, $n_{p}\left(-x_{p}\right)$ has jumped from $2 \times 10^{2} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ to $1.44 \times 10^{13} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$. This too is quite a number, yet it is much less than the majority concentration there $\left(10^{18} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}\right)$, again indicating low-level injection.

### Excess Minority Concentrations

It is apparent that forward biasing the $p n$ junction establishes an excess of minority carriers at both edges of the SCL. The excess concentrations are $p_{n}^{\prime}\left(x_{n}\right)=p_{n}\left(x_{n}\right)-p_{n 0}$ at the right edge, and $n_{p}^{\prime}\left(-x_{p}\right)=n_{p}\left(-x_{p}\right)-n_{p 0}$ at the left edge. By Eq. (1.51), these excesses can be expressed as

$$
\begin{gather*}
p_{n}^{\prime}\left(x_{n}\right)=p_{n 0}\left(e^{v / V_{T}}-1\right)  \tag{1.52a}\\
n_{p}^{\prime}\left(-x_{p}\right)=n_{p 0}\left(e^{v / V_{T}}-1\right) \tag{1.52b}
\end{gather*}
$$

Once minority excesses have been established, the carriers will diffuse away from the SCL toward regions of lower excess concentrations (holes from $x_{n}$ toward the right, electrons from $-x_{p}$ toward the left). In both cases, their diffusion takes place in a sea of oppositely-charged majority carriers, indicating a high chance of recombination. In fact, the further away we go from the SCL's edges, the less and less excess minority carriers we are likely to find.

This diffuse-and-recombine process is governed by the diffusion equation, which for excess holes takes on the form ${ }^{2}$

$$
D_{p} \frac{d^{2} p_{n}^{\prime}(x)}{d x^{2}}=\frac{p_{n}^{\prime}(x)}{\tau_{p}}
$$

where $\tau_{p}$ is the mean recombination time, also called the mean lifetime of the excess holes. A similar equation holds for excess electrons, but with $\tau_{n}$ as the mean recombination time. The solution to the diffusion equation is an exponential decay with $x$ for holes, and with $-x$ for electrons, in the manner illustrated in Fig. 1.43, middle. Mathematically, the decay for holes is expressed as

$$
\begin{equation*}
p_{n}^{\prime}(x)=p_{n 0}\left(e^{v / V_{T}}-1\right) e^{-\left(x-x_{n}\right) / L_{p}} \tag{1.53}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the quantity

$$
\begin{equation*}
L_{p}=\sqrt{D_{p} \tau_{p}} \tag{1.54a}
\end{equation*}
$$

is called the hole diffusion length, in cm . It represents the distance from $x_{n}$ at which $p_{n}^{\prime}(x)$ drops to $1 / e(36.8 \%)$ of its boundary value $p_{n}^{\prime}\left(x_{n}\right)$. A similar expression holds for excess electrons in the $p$ side, but with the electron diffusion length

$$
\begin{equation*}
L_{n}=\sqrt{D_{n} \tau_{n}} \tag{1.54b}
\end{equation*}
$$

The lengths $L_{p}$ and $L_{n}$ are typically on the order of $10^{1} \mu \mathrm{~m}$, so we generally have $L_{p} \gg x_{n}$ and $L_{n} \gg x_{p}$.

Note that $p_{n}^{\prime} \rightarrow 0$ at the right end of the $n$-type slab $\left(x=W_{n}\right)$, as the excess holes undergo total recombination with the electrons of the metal electrode there. Likewise, $n_{p}^{\prime} \rightarrow 0$ at the left end of the $p$-type slab $\left(x=-W_{p}\right)$, as excess electrons undergo total removal by the metal electrode there.

By Eq. (1.27a) the diffusion of excess holes toward the right results in the current density $J_{p}(x)=-q D_{p} d p_{n}^{\prime}(x) / d x$. Differentiating Eq. (1.53) and substituting gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
J_{p}(x)=q D_{p} \frac{p_{n 0}}{L_{p}}\left(e^{v / V_{T}}-1\right) e^{-\left(x-x_{n}\right) / L_{p}} \tag{1.55a}
\end{equation*}
$$

A similar expression holds for the current density due to excess electrons diffusing toward the left, except that we need to replace $x$ with $-x$ in the exponent,

$$
\begin{equation*}
J_{n}(x)=q D_{n} \frac{n_{p 0}}{L_{n}}\left(e^{v / V_{T}}-1\right) e^{\left(x+x_{p}\right) / L_{n}} \tag{1.55b}
\end{equation*}
$$

We expect recombination within the (thin) depletion region to be negligible, so $J_{p}$ and $J_{n}$ will essentially be constant there. With reference to Fig. 1.43, bottom, we find the total current density within the SCL as $J_{\text {tot }}=J_{p}\left(x_{n}\right)+J_{n}\left(-x_{p}\right)$. Using Eq. (1.55), we readily get

$$
\begin{equation*}
J_{\text {tot }}=q\left(\frac{D_{p} p_{n 0}}{L_{p}}+\frac{D_{n} n_{p 0}}{L_{n}}\right)\left(e^{v / V_{T}}-1\right) \tag{1.56}
\end{equation*}
$$

Note that Fig. 1.43, bottom, shows only the minority diffusion currents. For a complete picture of conduction we need to show also the majority diffusion currents. Owing to the charge conservation principle, $J_{\text {tot }}$ must be constant throughout the slab. We can thus obtain each majority current component by taking the graphical difference between the total current and the corresponding minority current component, or $J_{p}=J_{\text {tot }}-J_{n}$ to the left of $-x_{p}$, and $J_{n}=J_{\text {tot }}-J_{p}$ to the right of $x_{n}$. The result, shown in Fig. 1.44, shows how fascinating conduction is inside a pn slab.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d2e70fdf64cb0b15173bg-046.jpg?height=767&width=877&top_left_y=1430&top_left_x=574)

FIGURE 1.44 Minority and majority current densities inside a pn slab.

If we were to scan the slab from left to right, our description of conduction would be as follows

- At the far left we see a current of mainly holes diffusing toward the right on their way to recombine with electrons. Some of these holes disappear by recombination in the $p$ side itself, others manage to make it all the way to the SCL, from where they emerge as minority carriers in the $n$ side. As they progress toward the right, they are further annihilated by electrons.
- Moving closer to the SCL while still on the $p$ side, we note that $J_{p}$ has subsided somewhat, but at the expense of an increase in $J_{n}$, so as to ensure the constancy of $J_{\text {tor }}$. The fact that close to the SCL, $J_{p}$ has subsided doesn't necessarily imply a reduction in hole concentration there. In fact, Example 1.9 has revealed that at $x=-x_{p}$ there are $10^{18}$ holes $/ \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ pressing against the SCL, quite a number compared to the $1.44 \times 10^{13}$ electrons/cm ${ }^{3}$ available there. Out of these $10^{18} \mathrm{holes} /$ $\mathrm{cm}^{3}$, only $1.44 \times 10^{15}$ holes $/ \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ manage to emerge from the SCL, at the right.
- Moving now inside the SCL, we see a two-way traffic of holes and electrons, hardly recombining with each other because $X_{d}$ is much shorter than the diffusion lengths $L_{p}$ and $L_{n}$. Because of asymmetric doping as well as differences in the hole and electron diffusivities and diffusion lengths, $J_{p}$ and $J_{n}$ are generally different inside the SCL.
- As we move past the SCL into the $n$ region, we note that excess holes fade away, annihilated by the majority of electrons present there. We instead observe a progressively larger current of electrons moving toward the left, on their way either to annihilate holes while still in the $n$ side, or to be annihilated by holes once they cross the SCL to emerge in the $p$ side.

### The Diode Equation

The overall current $i$ through a $p n$ junction of cross-sectional area $A$ is readily found as $i=A J_{\text {tot }}$. Using Eqs. (1.56), along with Eq. (1.30), we get what is commonly referred to as the diode equation

$$
\begin{equation*}
i=I_{s}\left(e^{v / V_{T}}-1\right) \tag{1.57}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $I_{s}$ is a scaling factor called the saturation current,

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{s}=A \times n_{i}^{2}(T) \times q\left(\frac{D_{p}}{L_{p} N_{D}}+\frac{D_{n}}{L_{n} N_{A}}\right) \tag{1.58}
\end{equation*}
$$

This factor gives an indication of how much current $i$ we get for a given applied voltage $v$. For low-power junctions, $I_{s}$ is typically on the order of femto-amperes ( $1 \mathrm{fA}=$ $10^{-15} \mathrm{~A}$ ). We observe that $I_{s}$ depends on:

- The cross-sectional area $A$ (the larger $A$, the higher the current-just as with ordinary resistors)
- Temperature $T$, especially via $n_{i}^{2}(T)$
- The doping densities $N_{A}$ and $N_{D}$, the diffusivities $D_{p}$ and $D_{n}$, and the diffusion lengths $L_{p}$ and $L_{n}$.

As we proceed we shall find that most practical junctions are fabricated with one side much more heavily doped than the other. When this is the case, one of the terms within parentheses in Eq. (1.58) becomes negligible, and $I_{s}$ is determined primarily by the term with the smaller doping concentration in its denominator. In our working $p n$ junction example, for which $N_{A} \gg N_{D}$, the dominant term in Eq. (1.58) is the first one, stemming from the injection of holes into the more lightly doped $n$-side. As we know, this is also the side into which most of the SCL extends. For obvious reasons, asymmetrically-doped junctions are also referred to as one-sided junctions. An example will better illustrate.
(a) Estimate $i$ if the $p n$ junction of Example 1.7 is biased at $v=0.65 \mathrm{~V}$. Assume $D_{p}=10 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \mathrm{s}, L_{p}=5 \mu \mathrm{~m}, D_{n}=7 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \mathrm{s}$, and $L_{n}=10 \mu \mathrm{~m}$. Comment on your results.
(b) Find the area $A$ needed for the junction of part (a) to give $i=0.15 \mathrm{~mA}$ at $v=0.65 \mathrm{~V}$.

### Solution

(a) Inserting the given data into Eq. (1.58) gives

$$
\begin{aligned}
I_{s} & =10^{-4} \times 2 \times 10^{20} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19}\left(\frac{10}{5 \times 10^{-4} \times 10^{16}}+\frac{7}{10 \times 10^{-4} \times 10^{18}}\right) \\
& =6.41+0.02=6.43 \mathrm{fA}
\end{aligned}
$$

As expected of a one-sided junction such as the present one, $I_{s}$ is determined primarily by one term, namely, the first term, representing hole injection. Electron injection into the heavily-doped $p$-side has little say in this case. Finally, we use Eq. (1.57) to find

$$
i=6.43 \times 10^{-15}\left(e^{650 / 26}-1\right)=463 \mu \mathrm{~A}
$$

(b) To lower $i$ from 0.463 mA to 0.15 mA , we need to lower $A$ in proportion, that is, from $10^{-4} \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ to $(0.15 / 0.463) \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, or to $0.324 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$. This requires a square area of about $(57 \mu \mathrm{~m}) \times(57 \mu \mathrm{~m})$.

### Short-Base Diodes

In the diode example of Fig. 1.43 the neutral regions are long enough to provide sufficient distance for the minority charges to recombine with the majority charges as they diffuse away from the SCL. Aptly called a long-base diode, this structure occurs when the device is fabricated with dimensions $W_{n} \gg L_{p}$ and $W_{p} \gg L_{n}$. As we progress, we shall see that $p n$ diodes are also fabricated with $W_{n} \ll L_{p}$, or $W_{p} \ll L_{n}$, or both. A popular example is the base-emitter junction of a bipolar junction transistor, this being the reason why such a structure is referred to as a short-base diode.

With $W_{n} \ll L_{p}$, the holes injected into the $n$-side don't have much of a chance to recombine while diffusing toward the right, indicating that $J_{p}$ will essentially be
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d2e70fdf64cb0b15173bg-049.jpg?height=719&width=565&top_left_y=343&top_left_x=332)

FIGURE 1.45 Minority carrier concentrations in a forward-biased short-base diode fabricated with $W_{n} \ll L_{p}$ and $W_{p} \ll L_{n}$.
constant in the $n$-side. By Eq. $(1.27 a)$, this implies, in turn, a constant slope for $p_{n}(x)$, as depicted in Fig. 1.45. If the condition $W_{p} \ll L_{n}$ holds, similar considerations apply to $J_{n}$ and $n_{p}(x)$ in the $p$-side. To find the $i-v$ characteristic of a short-base diode, we start with $J_{p}=-q D_{p} d p_{n}^{\prime}(x) / d x$, where $p_{n}^{\prime}(x)$ is the excess hole density in the $n$-side. The slope of the triangle in Fig. 1.45 is readily found as

$$
\frac{d p_{n}^{\prime}(x)}{d x}=-\frac{p_{n}\left(x_{n}\right)-p_{n 0}}{W_{n}-x_{n}} \cong-\frac{p_{n 0}\left(e^{v / V_{T}}-1\right)}{W_{n}}
$$

where we have exploited the fact that usually $x_{n} \ll W_{n}$. Similar considerations hold for the $p$-side slope $d n_{p}^{\prime}(x) / d x$. Proceeding as in the derivation of Eq. (1.58), we readily find that a short-base diode still obeys Eq. (1.57), but with the following expression for the saturation current,

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{s} \cong A n_{i}^{2} q\left(\frac{D_{p}}{W_{n} N_{D}}+\frac{D_{n}}{W_{p} N_{A}}\right) \tag{1.59}
\end{equation*}
$$

This is identical to that of Eq. (1.58), except for the replacements $L_{p} \rightarrow W_{n}$ and $L_{p} \rightarrow W_{n}$. Considering that in a short-base diode the $W \mathrm{~s}$ are much smaller than the $L \mathrm{~s}$, it is apparent that this structure requires a smaller cross-sectional area $A$ to achieve the same value of $I_{s}$. Another advantage is that the amount of excess charge stored in a forward-biased short-base diode is much smaller than that of a long-base device operating at the same current. This results in much faster switching times, as we shall see in Chapter 6.

EXAMPLE 1.11 Repeat Example 1.10, but for the case in which the diode has been fabricated with $W_{p}=0.5 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ and $W_{n}=1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$. Compare and comment.

### Solution

Since we have a one-sided junction with $N_{A} \gg N_{D}$, we expect the first term within parentheses in Eq. (1.59) to dominate, just like its counterpart of Eq. (1.58). Considering that the value of $W_{n}$ given here is five times as small as the value of $L_{p}$ given in Example 1.10, we anticipate a fivefold increase in $I_{s}$, or $I_{s} \cong 6.41 \times 5 \cong$ 33 fA . With the same applied voltage $v$, the current $i$ will also increase fivefold,

$$
i \cong 33 \times 10^{-15} e^{650 / 26} \cong 2.4 \mathrm{~mA}
$$

To lower $i$ from 2.4 mA to 0.15 mA , we need to lower $A$ in proportion, from $10^{-4} \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ to $(0.15 / 2.4) \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, or to $0.063 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$. This can be achieved with a square area of $(25 \mu \mathrm{~m}) \times(25 \mu \mathrm{~m})$.

## 1.8 THE REVERSE-BIASED pn JUNCTION

Reverse biasing a pn junction further increases the existing potential barrier, thus inhibiting hole and electron diffusion across the metallurgical junction. Given this strong preference to conduct in the forward direction, the $p n$ junction exhibits diode behavior, so from now on we shall use the words pn junction and diode interchangeably.

For sufficiently negative values of the applied voltage $v$ (say, for $v<-4 V_{T} \cong-0.1 \mathrm{~V}$ ), Eq. (1.57) predicts that $i$ will saturate at $-I_{s}$ (hence, the name saturation current). As we know, for low-power diodes, $I_{s}$ is typically in the fA range. However, the actual reverse current found in a pn junction, which we shall denote as $I_{R}$, is orders of magnitude higher than $I_{s}$, typically in the pA to nA range. This stems from the thermal generation of holeelectron pairs within the space-charge layer SCL, which we ignored in the course of our analysis. In fact, even though we have been referring to the SCL as the depletion region, thermal generation of hole-electron pairs does continue to take place there, and once generated, holes and electrons are swept in opposite directions by the strong local electric field $E$, resulting in a combined drift current from the $n$ side, through the SCL, to the $p$ side. Intuitively we expect $I_{R}$ to be proportional to the SCL's volume $A X_{d}$, and since $X_{d}$ increases with the amount of reverse bias, as per Eq. (1.45), $I_{R}$ will also increase with the reverse voltage in square-root fashion. Depending on the quality of fabrication, leakage current may also flow across the surface of the pn junction, further contributing to $I_{R}$.

The overall reverse current $I_{R}$ is a strong function of temperature, a behavior that engineers remember via the following important rule of thumb:

The reverse current $I_{R}$ of a pn junction doubles for about every $10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ of temperature increase

Once we know $I_{R}$ at some reference temperature $T_{0}$, we can estimate it at any other temperature $T$ using

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{R}(T) \cong I_{R}\left(T_{0}\right) \times 2^{\left(T-T_{0}\right) / 10} \tag{1.60}
\end{equation*}
$$

If at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ a certain diode exhibits $I_{R}=1 \mathrm{pA}$, estimate $I_{R}(a)$ at $125{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, and (b) at $-25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

### Solution

(a) By Eq. (1.60), $I_{R}\left(125^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right) \cong 10^{-12} \times 2^{(125-25) / 10} \cong 1 \mathrm{nA}$. (b) Likewise, $I_{R}\left(-25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ $\cong 0.03 \mathrm{pA}$.

### Reverse Breakdown

If we gradually increase the reverse bias of a $p n$ junction, a voltage is reached, called the breakdown voltage ( $B V$ ), at which the reverse current shoots up in magnitude from the negligible value $I_{R}$ discussed above to much higher values. The name stems from the fact that the $i-v$ curve bends sharply, or breaks down. This does not necessarily imply a destructive process-in fact, one always limits the reverse current within safety levels by interposing a suitable resistor in series between the driving voltage source and the reverse-biased junction. Figure 1.46 shows the complete $i-v$ characteristic of a typical $p n$ junction.

The breaking down of the $i-v$ curve evidently indicates the sudden availability of huge quantities of mobile charges to produce the much increased current levels. This sudden availability is the result of either of two separate mechanisms: Zener
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d2e70fdf64cb0b15173bg-051.jpg?height=688&width=837&top_left_y=1515&top_left_x=335)

FIGURE 1.46 The complete $i-v$ characteristic of a pn junction.
breakdown, and avalanche breakdown. The former occurs in heavily doped junctions, the latter in lightly doped junctions.

- In heavily doped junctions the electric field within the SCL is already fairly strong, and increasing it further with several volts of reverse bias will give it enough strength to strip electrons away from the covalent bonds and thus create electron-hole pairs. The field itself then sweeps these newly freed charges out of the SCL (holes into the $p$ side, electrons into the $n$ side), thus sustaining much higher currents than in the case of thermal generation alone. Called Zener effect, this phenomenon occurs for BV values on the order of 6 V or less.
- In lightly doped junctions the electric field is not strong enough to break covalent bonds directly. However, with the wider SCL widths now available, the field has more space to accelerate any free electrons that happen to be within the SCL. Given sufficient kinetic energy, these electrons will free new electron-hole pairs as they collide with the atoms of the crystal lattice. These secondary electrons can in turn free additional electrons, in an effect aptly called avalanche effect. This effect occurs for BV values on the order of 6 V or higher. In the neighborhood of 6 V the Zener and avalanche effects may coexist.

When designed to operate deliberately in the breakdown region, a diode is commonly referred to as a Zener diode, regardless of whether the actual breakdown mechanism is of the Zener or avalanche type. The coordinates of an operating point $Q_{B}$ in the breakdown region are conveniently relabeled as $-I_{Z}$ and $-V_{Z}$, respectively. The slope of the diode curve in the breakdown region is denoted as $1 / r_{z}$, and sufficiently to the left of the breakdown knee it is approximately constant. Depending on fabrication details, $r_{z}$ is on the order of $10^{1}$ to $10^{3} \Omega$.

The temperature coefficient at a given breakdown-region operating point $Q_{B}\left(I_{Z}, V_{Z}\right)$ is defined as

$$
\operatorname{TC}\left(V_{Z}\right)=\left.\frac{\partial V_{Z}}{\partial T}\right|_{I_{Z}}
$$

We again distinguish two cases:

- In the case of the Zener effect, increasing temperature will increase thermal agitation and thus facilitate covalent breakdown, so we need to turn down the applied voltage $V_{Z}$ a bit if we want to maintain the same current level $I_{Z}$ at a higher temperature. Thus, $\mathrm{TC}\left(V_{Z}\right)<0$ in the Zener case.
- In the avalanche case, thermal agitation will increase the frequency of collisions of free electrons with atoms of the crystal lattice, making it more difficult for electrons to accelerate and acquire sufficient kinetic energy to trigger the avalanche mechanism. Now we need to turn $u p$ the applied voltage $V_{Z}$ a bit if we want to maintain the same current level $I_{Z}$, so $\mathrm{TC}\left(V_{Z}\right)>0$ in the avalanche case. We summarize the two mechanisms as follows:

The Zener effect occurs in heavily doped junctions, $V_{Z}$ is lower than about 6 V , and $\mathrm{TC}\left(V_{Z}\right)<0$

The avalanche effect occurs in lightly doped junctions, $V_{Z}$ is higher than about 6 V , and $\mathrm{TC}\left(V_{Z}\right)>0$

By playing with the impurity concentrations during processing, the manufacturer can control the BV of a junction to a particular value. Two familiar representatives are the base-emitter (BE) and the base-collector (BC) junctions forming the bipolar junction transistor (BJT). The BE junction is heavily doped, and thus breaks down by the Zener effect in the neighborhood of 6 V . This low BV value poses no problem when the BJT is operated in the forward-active (FA) region, where the BE junction is forward biased. However, in the FA region the BC junction is reverse biased. To prevent it from going into breakdown, the collector region is doped lightly, indicating that BC breakdown is of avalanche type.

## 1.9 FORWARD-BIASED DIODE CHARACTERISTICS

For sufficiently high forward voltages (in practice, for $v>4 V_{T} \cong 0.1 \mathrm{~V}$ ), we can ignore unity in Eq. (1.57), and write

$$
\begin{equation*}
i_{D}=I_{S} e^{v_{D} / V_{T}} \tag{1.61}
\end{equation*}
$$

where we are now using subscript $D$ to signify operation well into the forward region. This equation represents a perfectly exponential $i-v$ characteristic. Also called the ideal diode equation, it is satisfied by practical pn junctions quite well over a wide range of currents, typically on the order of six decades, making it one of the most predictable laws of electronics. The exponential law enjoys some fascinating properties, as we are about to see.

Equation (1.61) is readily turned around as

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{D}=V_{T} \ln \left(\frac{i_{D}}{I_{s}}\right) \tag{1.62}
\end{equation*}
$$

In this form, it allows us to find the voltage drop $v_{D}$ needed to sustain a given current $i_{D}$.

### Properties of the Exponential Characteristic

The slope of the diode curve at a given operating current $I_{D}$ in the forward-bias region is defined as $g_{d}=d i_{D} /\left.d v_{D}\right|_{I_{D}}$, and is called the dynamic conductance of the diode. Differentiating Eq. (1.61), we get

$$
\begin{equation*}
g_{d}=\frac{I_{D}}{V_{T}} \tag{1.63}
\end{equation*}
$$

indicating that slope is linearly proportional to the operating current $I_{D}$. The reciprocal of $g_{d}$ is called the dynamic resistance of the diode, or $r_{d}=1 / g_{d}=V_{T} / I_{D}$. Both $g_{d}$ and $r_{d}$ span quite a range of values, depending on the operating current. Note the following significant values:

$$
r_{d}(1 \mathrm{~mA})=26 \Omega \quad r_{d}(1 \mu \mathrm{~A})=26 \mathrm{k} \Omega \quad r_{d}(1 \mathrm{nA})=26 \mathrm{M} \Omega
$$

The parameters $r_{d}$ and $g_{d}$ form the basis of small-signal diode circuit analysis, to be studied later.

Given a diode carrying a certain current $I_{D}$, we wish to find the voltage change $\Delta V_{D}$ required to change its current from $I_{D}$ to $m I_{D}$, where $m$ is some multiplicative factor. Using Eq. (1.62), we find such a voltage change as $\Delta V_{D}=V_{T} \ln \left(m I_{D} / I_{s}\right)-$ $V_{T} \ln \left(I_{D} / I_{s}\right)=V_{T} \ln \left[\left(m I_{D} / I_{s}\right) /\left(I_{D} / I_{s}\right)\right]$, or

$$
\Delta V_{D}=V_{T} \ln m
$$

Two popular cases are a change in current by an octave ( $m=2^{ \pm 1}$ ), or by a decade $\left(m=10^{ \pm 1}\right)$, which give, respectively, $\Delta V_{D(\text { oct })}=(26 \mathrm{mV}) \times( \pm \ln 2) \cong \pm 18 \mathrm{mV}$, and $\Delta V_{D(\mathrm{dec})}=(26 \mathrm{mV}) \times( \pm \ln 10) \cong \pm 60 \mathrm{mV}$. These findings form the basis of the following important rules of thumb, illustrated pictorially in Fig. 1.47a:

To effect an octave change in $I_{D}$ we need to change $V_{D}$ by 18 mV

To effect a decade change in $I_{D}$ we need to change $V_{D}$ by 60 mV
A convenient feature of the above rules is that they are independent of the particular quiescent point $Q_{F}$ on the diode curve where the changes are made. For instance, consider a diode initially operating at a quiescent current of $10 \mu \mathrm{~A}$. If we wish to double its current to $20 \mu \mathrm{~A}$, we need an increase $\Delta V_{D}=18 \mathrm{mV}$. To effect the tenfold change $10 \mu \mathrm{~A} \rightarrow 100 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ we need an increase $\Delta V_{D}=60 \mathrm{mV}$. Likewise, the change $10 \mu \mathrm{~A} \rightarrow 1 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ requires a decrease $\Delta V_{D}=-60 \mathrm{mV}$. If you wish to change $I_{D}$ from

FIGURE 1.47 Illustrating some important rules of thumb for pn junctions.
$10 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ to $50 \mu \mathrm{~A}$, pretend first to raise it from $10 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ to $100 \mu \mathrm{~A}\left(\Delta V_{D}=+60 \mathrm{mV}\right)$, and then to lower it from $100 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ to $50 \mu \mathrm{~A}\left(\Delta V_{D}=-18 \mathrm{mV}\right)$, for a net change $V_{D}=60-18=42 \mathrm{mV}$.

### Temperature Dependence

Whether we use Eq. (1.61) or (1.62), it is apparent that the diode characteristic depends on temperature via $V_{T}$ as well as $I_{s}$. A convenient way to characterize the overall thermal dependence is via the temperature coefficient of the forward voltage drop at a given operating current $I_{D}$, defined as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{TC}\left(V_{D}\right)=\left.\frac{\partial V_{D}}{\partial T}\right|_{I_{D}} \tag{1.64}
\end{equation*}
$$

Differentiating Eq. (1.62), we obtain

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{TC}\left(V_{D}\right)=\left.\frac{\partial\left[V_{T} \ln \left(I_{D} / I_{s}\right)\right]}{\partial T}\right|_{I_{D}}=\frac{V_{D}}{T}-V_{T}\left(\frac{d I_{s} / d T}{I_{s}}\right) \tag{1.65}
\end{equation*}
$$

According to Eqs. (1.58) and (1.59), $I_{s} \propto n_{i}^{2}(T) D(T)$, where $n_{i}$ is the intrinsic concentration and $D$ is the diffusivity, both of which are functions of temperature $T$. By Eq. (1.21), $n_{i}^{2}(T) \propto T^{3} e^{-V_{01} / V_{T}}$, where $V_{G 0}=1.205 \mathrm{~V}$ is the bandgap voltage for silicon. By Eqs. (1.20) and (1.28), $D(T)=(k T / q) \mu(T)$, where $\mu(T)$ is the mobility, in turn a function of temperature of the type $\mu(T) \propto T^{m}, m \cong-1.5$. Combining all this we have

$$
\begin{gathered}
I_{s} \propto T^{4+m} e^{-V_{c o}(q / k T)} \\
\frac{d I_{s} / d T}{I_{s}}=\frac{(4+m) T^{4+m-1} e^{-V_{\sigma_{0}}(q / k T)}+T^{4+m} e^{-V_{c o l}(q / k T)} \times V_{G 0}\left(q / k T^{2}\right)}{T^{4+m} e^{-V_{c 0}(q / k T)}}=\frac{4+m}{T}+\frac{V_{G 0}}{T V_{T}}
\end{gathered}
$$

Substituting into Eq. (1.65) and simplifying, we finally get

$$
\begin{equation*}
\operatorname{TC}\left(V_{D}\right)=\frac{V_{D}-(4+m) V_{T}-V_{G 0}}{T} \tag{1.66}
\end{equation*}
$$

Assuming $V_{D}=0.65 \mathrm{~V}$ at $T=300 \mathrm{~K}$, Eq. (1.66) gives $\mathrm{TC}\left(V_{D}\right) \cong-2.1 \mathrm{mV} /{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Engineers remember $p n$ junction thermal behavior via the following rule of thumb, pictorially illustrated in Fig. 1.47b:

At room-temperature the forward voltage-drop of a pn diode drifts by about $-2 \mathrm{mV} /{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$

Once we know $V_{D}$ at some reference temperature $T_{0}$, we can estimate it at any other temperature $T$ using

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{D}(T) \cong V_{D}\left(T_{0}\right)-(2 \mathrm{mV}) \times\left(T-T_{0}\right) \tag{1.67}
\end{equation*}
$$

EXAMPLE 1.13 If at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ a certain diode exhibits $V_{D}=650 \mathrm{mV}$ at $I_{D}=0.1 \mathrm{~mA}$, estimate $V_{D}$ at:
(a) $T=70^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $I_{D}=0.1 \mathrm{~mA}$.
(b) $T=0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $I_{D}=0.1 \mathrm{~mA}$.
(c) $T=50^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $I_{D}=0.02 \mathrm{~mA}$.
(d) $T=40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $I_{D}=4 \mathrm{~mA}$.

### Solution

Using the rules of thumb learned thus far we get:
(a) $V_{D} \cong 650-2 \times(70-25)=650-90=560 \mathrm{mV}$.
(b) $V_{D} \cong 650-2 \times(0-25)=650+50=700 \mathrm{mV}$.
(c) First, pretend to lower $I_{D}=$ from 0.1 mA to $0.01 \mathrm{~mA}\left(\Delta V_{D}=-60 \mathrm{mV}\right)$, and then double it ( $\Delta V_{D}=+18 \mathrm{mV}$ ) to end up at 0.02 mA with the net value $V_{D} \cong 650-60+18=608 \mathrm{mV}$. Finally, pretend to increase temperature from $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $50^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, for an additional change $\Delta V_{D}=-2 \times(50-25)=-50 \mathrm{mV}$. The final value is thus $V_{D} \cong 608-50=558 \mathrm{mV}$.
(d) Proceeding as in part ( $c$ ) we find $V_{D}=650+60+18+18-2 \times(40-25)=$ 716 mV .

If a forward-biased diode is placed in series with a reverse-biased Zener diode of the opposite temperature coefficient, or $\mathrm{TC}\left(V_{Z}\right)=-\mathrm{TC}\left(V_{D}\right) \cong+2 \mathrm{mV}$, the thermal variations of the two devices will cancel each other out to yield a composite voltage drop $V_{R E F}=V_{Z}+V_{D}$ approaching zero temperature coefficient. This technique is used in the implementation of thermally stable voltage references. The best stability is achieved for $V_{Z} \cong 6.2 \mathrm{~V}$, thus yielding $V_{R E F} \cong 6.2+0.7=6.9 \mathrm{~V}$ with $\mathrm{TC}\left(V_{R E F}\right) \rightarrow 0$.

### Deviations from Ideality

Rewriting Eq. (1.62) as $v_{D}=V_{T}\left(\ln i_{D}-\ln I_{s}\right)$, or

$$
\ln i_{D}=\left(\frac{1}{V_{T}}\right) v_{D}+\ln I_{s}
$$

indicates that if we plot $i_{D}$ versus $v_{D}$ on semi-logarithmic paper ( $v_{D}$ on the linear axis, $i_{D}$ on the logarithmic axis), we get a curve of the type

$$
y=\left(1 / V_{T}\right) x+y(0)
$$

This is a straight line with slope $\left(1 / V_{T}\right)$ and $0-\mathrm{V}$ intercept at $i_{D}=I_{S}$. This feature proves very convenient in the characterization of a diode. Given a set of measured data, we can easily find the best-fit straight line; then, we find its slope to obtain the experimental value of $V_{T}$, and we extrapolate the line in the limit $v_{D} \rightarrow 0$ to find its intercept on the $i_{D}$ axis and thus obtain the experimental value of $I_{s}$.

The semi-log-plot of an actual low-power pn diode characteristic is more likely to appear as in Fig. 1.48. The curve is fairly straight over a wide range of currents, typically from 1 nA to 1 mA , but deviates from ideality both at the high and
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d2e70fdf64cb0b15173bg-057.jpg?height=578&width=736&top_left_y=336&top_left_x=329)

FIGURE 1.48 Illustrating the effect of the emission coefficient $n$ at low and at high current levels.
low ends of the range. These deviations stem from various approximations that were made in the course of the derivations leading to the ideal diode equation. Specifically, deviations at the high end of the current range are caused by the presence of bulk resistance in the neutral regions as well as high-level injection effects, while deviation at the low end is caused by loss of mobile charges to recombination within the space-charge layer (SCL). We now wish to examine these approximations in greater detail.

- In our derivations we have assumed zero electric field inside the regions at either side of the SCL, so that the voltage that we apply across the terminals is transmitted entirely to the edges of the SCL itself. However, like any conductor, each of these regions exhibits a nonzero-if small—ohmic resistance called the bulk resistance. Denoting the overall resistance (sum of the $p$-side and $n$-side bulk resistances) as $r_{s}$, we observe that in response to the externally applied voltage $v_{D}$, the actual voltage $v_{J}$ reaching the junction is, by KVL,

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{J}=v_{D}-r_{S} i_{D} \tag{1.68}
\end{equation*}
$$

When the diode is operated at low current levels, the voltage drop across the bulk material is negligible and $v_{J} \cong v_{D}$. Not so at the upper end of the current range, where this drop may become significant and cause a deviation of the actual $i-v$ characteristic from exponential ideality. On semi-log paper, this appears as a curvature for values of $i_{D}$ on the order of 1 mA or higher.

- If the applied voltage across the junction is increased to the point of making the minority densities at the SCL edges comparable to the majority densities there, the low-level injection assumption no longer holds, and the diode equation now takes on the form

$$
\begin{equation*}
i_{D}=I_{s} e^{v_{D} / n V_{T}} \tag{1.69a}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $n$, called the emission coefficient (not to be confused with the electron concentration $n!$ ) is such that $n \rightarrow 1$ under low-level injection conditions, but $n \rightarrow 2$ when these conditions no longer hold. The inverse equation is now

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{D}=n V_{T} \ln \left(\frac{i_{D}}{I_{s}}\right) \tag{1.69b}
\end{equation*}
$$

Rewriting as

$$
\ln i_{D}=\left(\frac{1}{n V_{T}}\right) v_{D}+\ln I_{s}
$$

indicates that the slope of the semi-log curve is now $1 /\left(n V_{T}\right)$. Clearly, for $n=2$ the slope is only half of that for $n=1$. We can find the experimental value of the quantity $n V_{T}$ through a mere slope measurement on the semi-log plot.

- Equation (1.69) with $n \rightarrow 2$ holds also at the low end of the current range, but for a completely different reason, namely the loss of mobile charges to recombination (trapping) within the SCL. Evidently, our assumption of constant current densities within the SCL is not exactly valid. It must be said that loss to recombination occurs regardless of the operating point on the $i-v$ curve, but its effect is noticeable only at the low-end, where the forward current is comparable to, or even smaller than that due to loss. On semi-log paper, this appears as a curvature for values of $i_{D}$ on the order of 1 pA or lower.

EXAMPLE 1.14 If a $p n$ junction with $I_{s}=1 \mathrm{fA}$ gives $I_{D}=1 \mathrm{~mA}$ at $V_{D}=725 \mathrm{mV}$, find $r_{S}$.

### Solution

By Eq. (1.62) the actual junction voltage is $V_{J}=(26 \mathrm{mV}) \ln \left(10^{-3} / 10^{-15}\right)=718.4 \mathrm{mV}$. By Eq. (1.68), $r_{S}=(725-718.4) / 1=6.6 \Omega$.

## 1.10 Dc ANALYSIS OF pn DIODE CIRCUITS

A task that arises all the time in the analysis of diode circuits is finding a diode's quiescent point $Q=Q\left(I_{D}, V_{D}\right)$. As we know, if the diode is embedded in an otherwise linear circuit, this task simplifies considerably if we replace the surrounding circuitry with its Thévenin equivalent and thus end up with the situation of Fig. 1.49a. Here, $V_{O C}$ is the open-circuit voltage that the external circuit would produce between the nodes corresponding to the anode and the cathode, but with the diode removed, and $R_{e q}$ is the external circuit's equivalent resistance, that is, the resistance as seen by the diode.

### Load-Line Analysis

The operating point can be visualized graphically as the intercept of the diode curve and the load line, as already seen in Fig. $1.5 b$ for the case of the ideal diode. The situation is depicted in Fig. $1.49 b$ for the case of a forward-biased pn junction diode. Though graphical analysis helps us develop a visual feel for a circuit's workings, we usually need to find the operating point $Q$ numerically, the issue that we are going to address next.

FIGURE 1.49 Finding the quiescent point $Q$ of a $p n$-junction diode embedded in a linear circuit.

### Iterative Analysis

With reference to Fig. 1.49a we observe that the diode current is, by Ohm's law,

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{D}=\frac{V_{O C}-V_{D}}{R_{e q}} \tag{1.70}
\end{equation*}
$$

Also, the diode voltage is, by Eq. (1.69b),

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{D}=n V_{T} \ln \frac{I_{D}}{I_{s}} \tag{1.71}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $n$ is the emission coefficient, $1 \leq n \leq 2$. In the following we shall assume $n=1$ for simplicity, but the ensuing analysis can readily be generalized to the case $n \neq 1$ by replacing $V_{T}$ with $n V_{T}$. Substituting Eq. (1.70) into (1.71) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{D}=n V_{T} \ln \frac{V_{O C}-V_{D}}{R_{e q} I_{s}} \tag{1.72}
\end{equation*}
$$

This is a transcendental equation in that it does not provide us with a closed-form expression for the unknown $V_{D}$. However, we can solve it by iterations. To this end, we start out with a reasonable initial estimate for $V_{D}$, we insert it in the right-hand side of Eq. (1.72) to come up with a better estimate, and then we insert this new estimate back in the right-hand side to come up with yet a better estimate, repeating the procedure if necessary, until the result settles within a predetermined resolution.

In the circuit of Fig. 1.49a let $R_{e q}=1 \mathrm{k} \Omega$, and let the diode have $n=1, V_{T}=26 \mathrm{mV}$, and $I_{s}=1 \mathrm{fA}$. Estimate $V_{D}$ down to the mV , as well as $I_{D}$, if (a) $V_{O C}=1.5 \mathrm{~V}$, (b) $V_{O C}=3 \mathrm{~V}$, and (c) $V_{O C}=0.75 \mathrm{~V}$.

### Solution

(a) In the various $p n$-junction examples encountered so far we have found that $V_{D}$ is typically in the range of $0.6-0.7 \mathrm{~V}$, so let us arbitrarily start out with the initial guess $\mathrm{V}_{D(0)}=0.65 \mathrm{~V}$. Plugging into Eq. (1.72) gives the new estimate

$$
V_{D(1)}=n V_{T} \ln \frac{V_{O C}-V_{D(0)}}{R_{e q} I_{s}}=0.026 \ln \frac{1.5-0.65}{10^{3} \times 10^{-15}}=0.714 \mathrm{~V}
$$

Using this new value as initial guess we find

$$
V_{D(2)}=n V_{T} \ln \frac{V_{O C}-V_{D(1)}}{R_{e q} I_{s}}=0.026 \ln \frac{1.5-0.714}{10^{-12}}=0.712 \mathrm{~V}
$$

Iterating once more we find

$$
V_{D(3)}=n V_{T} \ln \frac{V_{O C}-V_{D(2)}}{R_{e q} I_{s}}=0.026 \ln \frac{1.5-0.712}{10^{-12}}=0.712 \mathrm{~V}
$$

Since the result hasn't changed within the intended resolution of 0.001 V ( $=1 \mathrm{mV}$ ), we conclude that $V_{D}=712 \mathrm{mV}$. Finally, the current is, by Eq. (1.70),

$$
I_{D}=\frac{1.5-0.712}{10^{3}}=0.788 \mathrm{~mA}
$$

(b) This time let us start out with the initial guess $V_{D(0)}=0.7 \mathrm{~V}$. Then,

$$
V_{D(1)}=0.026 \ln \frac{3-0.7}{10^{-12}}=0.740 \mathrm{~V}
$$

One more iteration confirms that this is actually the desired value, or $V_{D}=$ 740 mV within a 1-mV resolution. Then, $I_{D}=(3-0.74) / 1=2.26 \mathrm{~mA}$.
(c) Starting again with $V_{D(0)}=0.65 \mathrm{~V}$, we find

$$
V_{D(1)}=0.026 \ln \frac{0.75-0.65}{10^{-12}}=0.659 \mathrm{~V}
$$

Three more iterations confirm the final value $V_{D}=657 \mathrm{mV}$. Consequently, $I_{D}$ $=(0.75-0.657) / 1=93 \mu \mathrm{~A}$.

Remark 1: In going from (a) to (b) we have doubled $V_{O C}$, and in going from (a) to (c) we have halved $V_{O C}$; however, $I_{D}$ has neither doubled nor halved, as the presence of the diode renders the circuit nonlinear.

Remark 2: We could have found $I_{D}$ also using the diode equation. For instance, in part (a) we could have calculated

$$
I_{D}=I_{S} e^{V_{D} / n V_{T}}=10^{-15} e^{712 / 26}=0.782 \mathrm{~mA}
$$

This disagrees with the value of 0.788 mA found via Eq. (1.70). True, both calculations are afflicted by roundoff errors, but even so, which result is the more dependable of the two? Here's an important point to keep in mind: because of the high sensitivity of the exponential function to even small variations in its exponent, the value of $V_{D}$ in the exponent must be known very accurately for the result to be also accurate. By contrast, the value of the $V_{D}$ in the linear Eq. (1.70) need not be as accurate, and yet it will still yield a dependable $I_{D}$ value. Consequently, 0.788 mA is the more accurate value in our example.

Remark 3: Of course, if we use the exponential form with a more accurate value of $V_{D}$ the resulting $I_{D}$ will also be more accurate. In fact, using just one more significant digit from the third-iteration result, which is $V_{D(3)}=0.7122 \mathrm{~V}$ (rather than the truncated value of 0.712 V ) we get

$$
I_{D}=10^{-15} e^{712.2 / 26}=0.788 \mathrm{~mA}
$$

This matches that found via Eq. (1.70). If, for some reason, you need to use the diode equation in its exponential form, make sure that you know the value of $V_{D}$ to an adequate degree of accuracy!

### Piecewise-Linear Approximation and Large-Signal Diode Models

Load-line analysis provides a graphical means for visualizing a diode's role in a circuit, and iterative analysis provides a numerical means for calculating a diode's operating point. In practice, whether we analyze an existing diode circuit or we design a new one, we need faster, if only approximate, analysis techniques. Moreover, as we apply these techniques, we wish to draw from the wealth of knowledge acquired in prerequisite linear-circuits courses. Both requirements are met by effecting upon the actual pn-junction characteristic of Fig. 1.46 a piecewise-linear approximation as depicted in Fig. 1.50. Specifically, the actual curve, shown in shaded form, is approximated with three straight segments, each corresponding to a different region of operation, namely, the forward (ON), the cutoff (CO), and the breakdown (BD) regions. We make the following observations:

- When a pn junction is forward biased, its characteristic is exponential, that is, a curve that after a brief knee, shoots up quite rapidly, no matter which current range we choose to display. The curves of Figs. 1.47 and $1.49 b$ were doctored a bit to allow for a better visualization of the details under discussion, but the actual curve is indeed as in Fig. 1.46-quite steep. We know from one of the rules of thumb that increasing $V_{D}$ by a mere 60 mV raises $I_{D}$ tenfold, while decreasing it by 60 mV lowers $I_{D}$ tenfold, indicating that within the
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d2e70fdf64cb0b15173bg-061.jpg?height=728&width=1490&top_left_y=1444&top_left_x=326)

FIGURE 1.50 Piecewise-linear approximations and large signal models of the pn junction diode in its three regions of operation: forward (ON), cutoff (CO), and breakdown (BD).
range $V_{D} \pm 60 \mathrm{mV}, I_{D}$ undergoes a 100-to-1 change! For practical purpose, when a junction conducts only $1 / 100$ of its normal current, it can be regarded as being cut off (in digital applications, even a 10-to-1 ratio will do). Considering that a low-power silicon junction operating in the mA range typically exhibits a roomtemperature voltage drop of about 0.7 V , we approximate the exponential curve with a vertical segment located at $v=V_{D(\text { on })}=0.7 \mathrm{~V}$. The corresponding diode model is thus a battery of value $V_{D(\text { on })}$, as shown. For obvious reasons, this model is referred to as a constant voltage-drop model. The reader, who may find this approximation unconvincing, will soon realize that it is actually quite effective in providing us with a quick feel for the workings of diode circuits. During a second and more detailed pass, one can always use iterative techniques or computer simulation such as PSpice to refine the analysis and come up with more accurate results.

- From the knee leading to the exponential rise to the knee leading to the breakdown drop, the current is negligibly small, indicating that for practical purposes we can regard the junction as cut off (CO). The corresponding diode model is an open circuit, as shown. Note that the cutoff region extends to the right of the origin, all the way to the onset of the exponential raise. Even though for $v>0$ the junction is, strictly speaking, forward biased, the actual current between 0 V and the knee leading to the exponential raise is simply too small for the junction to be considered convincingly on. So, we take a weakly forward-biased junction as being effectively cut off.
- Well into the breakdown (BD) region, the characteristic is close to linear, so we approximate it with a straight segment, as shown. As seen in Fig. 1.46, the slope of the curve there is denoted as $1 / r_{z}$, and a BD operating point is denoted as $Q_{B}=Q_{B}\left(-I_{Z},-V_{Z}\right)$. To signify operation in the BD region, the circuit symbol for the diode is modified as shown at the lower left of Fig. 1.50. Also, the device is drawn upside down to make $V_{Z}$ positive at the top (cathode), and to make $I_{Z}$ positive when flowing from cathode to anode. This gimmick dispenses us from having to deal with negative voltages and currents. The diode model in the BD region is a battery of value $V_{Z 0}$ with a series resistance $r_{z}$, where $-V_{z 0}$ represents the location of the intercept of the extrapolated linear curve with the $v$ axis.

Again, the beginner may deem the piecewise linear approximation too gross, especially near the knee leading from the CO to the BD regions. However, it turns out that a $p n$ junction is seldom operated in the knee region. Generally speaking, the $p n$-junction finds application either as a rectifying switch, or as a voltage reference.

- When used as a rectifier a diode is designed to alternate between the ON and CO modes without ever entering the BD region. In fact, to be on the safe side, rectifiers are implemented with diodes having a breakdown voltage (BV) well above the maximum reverse voltage, also called peak inverse voltage (PIV), that the device is likely to ever experience in the given circuit.
- When used as a voltage reference a diode is operated deliberately in the BD region, and far enough down the BD curve to prevent the operating point from ever getting too close to the knee. This issue will be addressed in greater detail in Section 1.12.

Repeat Example 1.15, but using the constant voltage-drop diode model. Comment on your findings.

### Solution

Equation (1.70) now approximates to

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{D}=\frac{V_{O C}-V_{D(\mathrm{on})}}{R_{e q}} \tag{1.73}
\end{equation*}
$$

or $I_{D}=\left(V_{O C}-0.7\right) / 1$.
(a) We now get $I_{D}=(1.5-0.7) / 1=0.8 \mathrm{~mA}$, which is very close to 0.788 mA found in Example 1.15.
(b) Now $I_{D}=(3-0.7) / 1=2.3 \mathrm{~mA}$, which is even closer to 2.26 mA found in Example 1.15.
(c) If we try $I_{D}=(0.75-0.7) / 1=50 \mu \mathrm{~A}$, we obtain a result in significant disagreement with $93 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ found previously. It is apparent that Eq. (1.73) will give dependable results only if $V_{O C} \gg V_{D(\text { on })}$. If this condition is not met, then the iterative method is the only reasonable alternative for hand calculations.

Remark: Once again we want to stress the difference between $V_{D}$ and $V_{D(\text { on })}$, repeated as follows:

- $V_{D}$ is the actual voltage drop across the diode, and it can be used in critical calculations such as $I_{D}=I_{s} \exp \left(V_{D} / V_{T}\right)$, provided it is known to an adequate degree of accuracy, e.g. within millivolts.
- $V_{D(\text { on })}$ is an assumed $(\sim 0.7 \mathrm{~V})$ and thus only approximate value that we use in less critical calculations such as $I_{D}=\left[V_{O C}-V_{D(\text { on })}\right] / R_{e q}$, provided $V_{O C} \gg V_{D(\mathrm{on})}$.
A potentially catastrophic mistake is to write $I_{D}=I_{s} \exp \left(V_{D(\text { on })} / V_{T}\right)$. Make sure you never do this!

### Circuit Analysis Using the Piecewise Linear Approximation

Following is a procedure for determining the operating point of a pn diode for the case in which the device is embedded in an otherwise linear circuit:

- First, find the open-circuit voltage $V_{O C}$ produced by the external circuit with the diode removed (recall that the polarity of $V_{O C}$ is defined positive at the node connected to the anode.)
- Next, determine the region of diode operation as follows:
- If $V_{O C}>V_{D(\text { on })}(\cong 0.7 \mathrm{~V}$ for a silicon diode), the diode is operating in the ON region
- If $-V_{Z 0}<V_{O C}<V_{D(\text { on })}$, the diode is cut off (CO)
- If $V_{O C}<-V_{Z 0}$, the diode is operating in the BD region
- Finally, replace the diode with the model pertaining to that particular region, as depicted in Fig. 1.50, and proceed with the analysis of the resulting linear circuit using familiar analysis techniques.

Let us illustrate with practical examples.

### The pn Junction Diode as a Rectifier

To investigate the operation of the $p n$ junction diode as a rectifier we perform a PSpice simulation of a half-wave rectifier using the popular 1N4148 low-power pn diode, whose model is available in PSpice's analog library. With reference to the circuit of Fig. 1.51 $a$ we make the following observations:

- As long as $v_{I}<V_{D(\text { on })}$, the diode is off and the circuit behaves as in Fig. 1.51b, top, giving

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{O}=0 \quad \text { for } v_{I}<V_{D(\text { on })} \tag{1.74a}
\end{equation*}
$$

- For $v_{I}>V_{D(\text { on })}$ the diode is conductive and acts as a battery $V_{D(\text { on })}=0.7 \mathrm{~V}$, as shown in Fig. 1.51b, bottom. The output now follows the input, but with an offset of -0.7 V , by KVL. Thus,

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{O}=v_{I}-V_{D(\mathrm{on})} \quad \text { for } v_{I}>V_{D(\mathrm{on})} \tag{1.74b}
\end{equation*}
$$

Circuit behavior is illustrated further via the input and output waveforms of Fig. 1.52a, and the voltage transfer curve (VTC) of Fig. 1.52b. Compared to the ideal diode, for which $V_{D(\text { on })}=0$, a silicon diode requires about 0.7 V to turn on, and once on, it introduces an error in the form of a $-0.7-\mathrm{V}$ offset at the output. This offset may or may not be a problem, depending on the performance requirements of the application at hand. Also, a closer look at both plots reveals that the diode's transition from on to off (or vice versa) is not abrupt, as implied by our piecewise-linear approximation, but gradual, owing to the knee of the exponential curve. This feature is actually quite beneficial in the case of piecewise-linear function generators as it ensures a smoother transition from one segment to the next of the VTC.

Now that we understand how a silicon diode behaves as a half-wave rectifier, we find it easier to reexamine all other ideal-diode circuits investigated in Section 1.2, such as full-wave rectifiers, voltage clamps, piecewise-linear function generators, clamped

Ans. (a) 0 V and 4.3 V. (b) 0.7 V and 5 V . (c) $-0.7 \mathrm{~V} \leq v_{I C} \leq 5.7 \mathrm{~V}$.

### The Superdiode

There are applications, such as precision instrumentation, in which the rectifier's output offset of 0.7 V is unacceptable and needs to be eliminated somehow. The only way to ensure this, in the half-wave rectifier example of Fig. 1.51, is to drive the anode about 0.7 V higher than $v_{I}$ so that the voltage at the cathode will equal $v_{I}$ itself. This task is achieved by placing the diode within the negative feedback path of an operational amplifier (op amp), as depicted in the PSpice circuit of Fig. 1.54a. The relevant waveforms are displayed in Fig. 1.54b.

To analyze the circuit, recall the familiar op amp rule, stating that in negativefeedback operation an op amp will output whatever voltage $v_{O}$ it takes to force $v_{N}$ to track $v_{P}$. Consider the cases $v_{I}>0$ and $v_{I}<0$ separately.

- For $v_{I}>0$ the op amp needs to source current to $R$ in order to make the invertinginput voltage $\left(v_{O}\right)$ follow the non-inverting-input voltage $\left(v_{I}\right)$. This the op amp can readily do via the diode, whose direction conforms to that of the needed current. To turn on the diode, the op amp must swing its output $\left(v_{A}\right)$ a diode drop higher than $v_{O}$. For instance, with $v_{I}=1 \mathrm{~V}$, the op amp achieves $v_{O}=1 \mathrm{~V}$ by outputting $v_{A} \cong 1.7 \mathrm{~V}$. The situation during the positive alternations in $v_{I}$ is depicted in Fig. 1.55a.
- For $v_{I}<0$ the op amp would have to $\sin k$ current from $R$ in order to make $v_{O}$ follow $v_{I}$. But, this is impossible due to the diode's inability to conduct in the reverse direction. So, the diode goes off, in effect disconnecting $R$ from the circuit and thus give $v_{O}=0$. The situation is depicted in Fig. 1.55b. Deprived of the feedback path, the op amp can no longer influence its inverting input, so it ends up operating in the open-loop mode. As an example, consider the case $v_{I}=-1 \mathrm{~V}$, so that the voltage difference at the op amp's input is $v_{P}-v_{N}=(-1-0)=-1 \mathrm{~V}$. The op amp, in its attempt to magnify this negative input difference by the full open-loop gain, will swing its output $v_{A}$ in the negative direction as far as it will go. In fact, in this example the output saturates in the vicinity of -6 V .
- Once $v_{I}$ becomes again positive, the op amp will pull out of saturation and return to ride $v_{A}$ a diode drop higher than $v_{I}$, as already seen in Fig. 1.55a.

## 1.11 Ac ANALYSIS OF pn DIODE CIRCUITS

The piecewise-linear approximation of Fig. 1.50 encompasses the entire $i-v$ characteristic of the $p n$ diode. There is another important form of linearization in use, but involving only a limited portion of the forward-region characteristic. As we know, this characteristic is exponential and thus a highly nonlinear curve. However, if we restrict the diode's operation within a sufficiently small portion of this curve, as highlighted in Fig. 1.56a, then we can approximate this portion with a straight segment and thus apply familiar linear-circuit analysis techniques. This alternative form of linearization, aptly called small-signal approximation and depicted in expanded form in Fig. 1.56b, relies on two premises:

- First, we bias the diode at a suitable operating point $Q_{0}=Q_{0}\left(I_{D}, V_{D}\right)$ up the diode curve, in effect establishing the origin of a new system of $i$-v axes for signal variations about this point.
- Then, we vary the diode's operating point up and down the curve by amounts denoted as $i_{d}$ and $v_{d}$, keeping $i_{d}$ and $v_{d}$ sufficiently small so as to ensure that $i_{d} i s$ linearly proportional to $v_{d}$, just as in the case of ordinary resistance.

To simplify the bookkeeping, engineers have developed a special form of signal notation ${ }^{7}$ that has proved quite convenient not only for diodes, but also for other
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d2e70fdf64cb0b15173bg-067.jpg?height=457&width=1050&top_left_y=1756&top_left_x=319)

FIGURE 1.57 Illustrating the decomposition of a signal into its $d c$ and ac components, or $v_{D}=V_{D}+v_{d}$.
nonlinear devices like transistors, as we shall see. By this notation, the voltage and current of the pn diode are expressed in the form

$$
\begin{gather*}
v_{D}=V_{D}+v_{d}  \tag{1.75a}\\
i_{D}=I_{D}+i_{d} \tag{1.75b}
\end{gather*}
$$

where:

- $v_{D}$ and $i_{D}$ are referred to as the total signals (lower-case symbols with upper-case subscripts)
- $V_{D}$ and $I_{D}$ are their $d c$ components (upper-case symbols with upper-case subscripts)
- $v_{d}$ and $i_{d}$ are their ac components (lower-case symbols with lower-case subscripts)

This form of signal decomposition is illustrated in Fig. 1.57 for the case of the voltage $v_{D}$, but a similar picture holds also the current $i_{D}$.

Figure 1.58 shows two sets of waveforms obtained via PSpice simulation. The diode used is such that with $V_{D}=700 \mathrm{mV}$ it gives exactly $I_{D}=1.0 \mathrm{~mA}$. Moreover, to make it easier for the naked eye to observe any distortion, we have chosen a triangular waveform for the ac voltage component. We make the following observations:

- In Fig. 1.58a the diode is subjected to an ac voltage component (top) having peak values of $\pm 5 \mathrm{mV}$, and it responds with a current waveform (bottom) that is only slightly distorted. In a truly undistorted waveform, the positive and negative portions are mirror images of each other. In the example shown the positive portion is slightly bigger than the negative one because of the curvature of the diode's $i-v$ characteristic. Even so, we can state that distortion is reasonably low.
- In Fig. 1.58 b the ac voltage (top) has been raised to peak values of $\pm 18 \mathrm{mV}$, and the current response (bottom) is now highly distorted. The reason for choosing 18 mV is that we can figure out the peak values of current using one of the rules of thumb. Namely, with $v_{D}=(700+18) \mathrm{mV}, i_{D}$ doubles from 1.0 mA to 2.0 mA , whereas with $v_{D}=(700-18) \mathrm{mV}, i_{D}$ halves from 1.0 mA to 0.5 mA . For the current waveform to be undistorted, the positive peak should equal the negative peak, so it should be $1.0+0.5=1.5 \mathrm{~mA}$, not 2.0 mA . The pronounced distortion stems from the fact that the increased ac voltage drive causes the operating point to span a wider portion of the exponential curve. As seen, the negative portions of the waveforms get compressed, and the positive portions get expanded.

FIGURE 1.58 Voltage waveforms (top) and current waveforms (bottom) for two different ac voltage drives.

It is apparent that under the voltage drive conditions of Fig. 1.58a diode behavior can be regarded fairly close to linear, but that under the conditions of Fig. 1.58 b it can't. Next, we wish to investigate quantitatively the range of validity of the small-signal approximation.

### Small-Signal Operation

As we know, the function of the dc source $V_{D}$ in Fig. 1.59a is to bias the diode at a specific quiescent point $Q_{0}=Q_{0}\left(I_{D}, V_{D}\right)$ up the diode curve. Assuming an emission coefficient of unity $(n=1)$ for simplicity, the corresponding dc current is

$$
I_{D}=I_{S} e^{V_{D} / V_{T}}
$$

If we now turn on the $a c$ source $v_{d}$ as in Fig. 1.59b, the operating point will move up and down the diode curve, yielding the ac current $i_{d}$. In the expanded view of Fig. $1.56 b$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d2e70fdf64cb0b15173bg-069.jpg?height=389&width=1227&top_left_y=1750&top_left_x=321)

FIGURE 1.59 Systematic analysis of small-signal diode operation. The actual circuit is shown in the center (b), while (a) shows its large-signal or dc version, and (c) shows its small-signal or ac version.
we have captured a positive alternation of $v_{d}$, during which the diode's instantaneous operating point is $Q_{1}=Q_{1}\left(I_{D}+i_{d}, V_{D}+v_{d}\right)$. The diode equation gives, at $Q_{1}$,

$$
I_{D}+i_{d}=I_{s} e^{\left(V_{D}+v_{d}\right) / V_{T}}=\left(I_{s} e^{V_{D} / V_{T}}\right) e^{v_{d} / V_{T}}=I_{D} e^{v_{d} / V_{T}}
$$

or

$$
\begin{equation*}
i_{d}=I_{D}\left(e^{v_{d} / V_{T}}-1\right) \tag{1.76}
\end{equation*}
$$

Performing a series expansion of the exponential term gives

$$
i_{d}=I_{D}\left[\chi+\frac{v_{d}}{V_{T}}+\frac{1}{2!}\left(\frac{v_{d}}{V_{T}}\right)^{2}+\frac{1}{3!}\left(\frac{v_{d}}{V_{T}}\right)^{3}+\cdots-\chi\right]
$$

or

$$
\begin{equation*}
i_{d}=\frac{I_{D}}{V_{T}} v_{d}\left(1+\frac{v_{d}}{2 V_{T}}+\cdots\right) \tag{1.77}
\end{equation*}
$$

This equation indicates a nonlinear relationship between $i_{d}$ and $v_{d}$. This is not surprising, given the exponential and thus highly nonlinear characteristic of the diode. However, if we stipulate to keep the magnitude of $v_{d}$ sufficiently small, then the quadratic and higher-order terms in $v_{d}$ can be ignored, allowing us to work with a linear and thus simpler relationship. Specifically, if we stipulate to keep

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|v_{d}\right| \ll 2 V_{T}(\cong 52 \mathrm{mV}) \tag{1.78}
\end{equation*}
$$

then Eq. (1.77) simplifies as $i_{d}=\left(I_{D} / V_{T}\right) v_{d}$. This can be put in the form of Ohm's law,

$$
\begin{equation*}
i_{d}=\frac{v_{d}}{r_{d}} \tag{1.79}
\end{equation*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{equation*}
r_{d}=\frac{V_{T}}{I_{D}} \tag{1.80}
\end{equation*}
$$

is the diode's dynamic resistance. Its reciprocal $1 / r_{d}$ is simply the slope of the diode curve calculated at the quiescent point $Q_{0}$. With reference to Fig. $1.56 b$ we see that if $v_{d}$ is sufficiently small, the portion of the curve from $Q_{0}$ to $Q_{1}$ can be approximated with the straight segment tangent to the diode curve right at $Q_{0}$. For obvious reasons the ac variations $v_{d}$ and $i_{d}$ are referred to as small signals. By contrast, $V_{D}$ and $I_{D}$ are referred to as large signals. Equation (1.79) is referred to as the small-signal approximation, and Eq. (1.78) quantifies the validity of this approximation.

Ignoring higher-order terms in Eq. (1.77), we estimate the error $\varepsilon$ incurred in the small-signal approximation as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\varepsilon \cong \frac{v_{b e}}{2 V_{T}} \cong \frac{v_{b e}}{52 \mathrm{mV}} \tag{1.81}
\end{equation*}
$$

This amounts to about $2 \%$ for every 1-mV of $v_{b e}$. Thus, if we wish to keep $\varepsilon$ below $10 \%$ (an acceptable error in most practical situations), then we need to ensure that

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|v_{b e}\right| \leq 5 \mathrm{mV} \tag{1.82}
\end{equation*}
$$

This shall be our working condition, as we move along.
(a) If $I_{D}=1 \mathrm{~mA}$, find the peak values of $i_{d}$ in Fig. $1.58 a$, where $v_{d}$ has peak values of $\pm 5 \mathrm{mV}$. Calculate the peaks approximately, via Eq. (1.79), and exactly, via Eq. (1.76). What is the percentage error incurred in the smallsignal approximation?
(b) Repeat, but for the case of Fig. $1.58 b$, where $v_{d}$ has peak values of $\pm 18 \mathrm{mV}$.

### Solution

(a) By Eq. (1.80), $r_{d}=26 / 1=26 \Omega$. By Eq. (1.79), $i_{d}$ peaks at the values

$$
i_{d(\mathrm{pk})}=\frac{ \pm 5 \times 10^{-3}}{26} \cong \pm 192 \mu \mathrm{~A}
$$

By Eq. (1.76), the exact values of the positive and negative peaks of $i_{d}$ are, respectively,

$$
i_{d(\mathrm{pospk})}=10^{-3}\left(e^{5 / 26}-1\right)=212 \mu \mathrm{~A} \quad i_{d(\mathrm{neg} \mathrm{pk})}=10^{-3}\left(e^{-5 / 26}-1\right)=-175 \mu \mathrm{~A}
$$

We see that the small-signal approximation underestimates the positive peak by $(212-192) / 192$, or $10.3 \%$, and overestimates the negative peak by (192 - 175)/192, or $8.9 \%$. Both errors are consistent with Eq. (1.81) which predicts errors of approximately $\pm 5 / 52= \pm 9.6 \%$.
(b) Now Eq. (1.79) predicts

$$
i_{d(\mathrm{pk})}=\frac{ \pm 18 \times 10^{-3}}{26} \cong \pm 692 \mu \mathrm{~A}
$$

Using Eq. (1.76), or more simply the rule of thumb, we find the exact peak values to be $i_{d(\mathrm{pos} \mathrm{pk})}=1000 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ and $i_{d(\mathrm{neg} \mathrm{pk})}=-500 \mu \mathrm{~A}$. The underestimation error is now $31 \%$ and the overestimation error is $38 \%$, both of which are generally unacceptable. The far more pronounced distortion of Fig. $1.58 b$ confirms this.

Remark: The above results, derived for the case of an emission coefficient $n=1$, are readily generalized if we let $V_{T} \rightarrow n V_{T}$ in Eqs. (1.78), (1.80), and (1.81), and let $5 \mathrm{mV} \rightarrow n 5 \mathrm{mV}$ in Eq. (1.82). For example, for $n=1.5$, Eq. (1.78) becomes $\left|v_{d}\right| \ll 2 \times 1.5 V_{T}\left(\cong 78 \mathrm{mV}\right.$ ), and Eq. (1.82) becomes $\left|v_{d}\right| \leq 7.5 \mathrm{mV}$.

### The Small-Signal Diode Model

Equations (1.79) and (1.80) indicate that, under the condition of Eq. (1.78), a pn diode behaves with respect to the small signals $v_{d}$ and $i_{d}$ as a mere resistor $r_{d}$. The smallsignal model for the diode, also called incremental model, is shown in Fig. 1.60 (right).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d2e70fdf64cb0b15173bg-071.jpg?height=316&width=712&top_left_y=1909&top_left_x=325)

FIGURE 1.60 Large-signal model (left) and small-signal model (right) of the pn diode.

For convenience, also shown is the large-signal model (left). The beginner should be careful not to confuse the two! We use the large-signal model to investigate $d c$ biasing, for instance to find the quiescent current $I_{D}$. We use the small-signal model to investigate the diode's response to ac signals of suitably small magnitude.

The decomposition of the diode voltage and current into separate dc and ac components, along with the fact that both the large-signal and the small-signal diode models are linear, allows us to perform the dc and ac analyses separately, as pictured in Fig. 1.59a and 1.59c. We then apply the superposition principle and add the $d c$ and $a c$ results to obtain the total result. An example will better illustrate.

EXAMPLE 1.18 Let the diode of Fig. 1.61 have $I_{s}=1 \mathrm{fA}$ and $n=1$. Find $v_{D}=V_{D}+v_{d}$ if $v_{S}=V_{S}+v_{s}=8 \mathrm{~V}+(1 \mathrm{~V}) \sin \omega t$. Is the condition of Eq. (1.82) satisfied?
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d2e70fdf64cb0b15173bg-072.jpg?height=278&width=538&top_left_y=940&top_left_x=575)

FIGURE 1.61 Circuit of Example 1.18.

### Solution

Perform the dc and ac analyses separately to find, respectively, $V_{D}$ and $v_{d}$. Then, apply the superposition principle to obtain $v_{D}=V_{D}+v_{d}$.

- For $d c$ analysis refer to the dc version of Fig. 1.62a, showing only the $d c$ components $V_{S}$ and $I_{D}$. The ac components ( $v_{s}$ and $v_{d}$ ) have deliberately been set to zero as they don't intervene in dc analysis. Moreover, the diode has been replaced by its large-signal model (the battery $V_{D(\text { on })}$ ). We have

$$
\begin{aligned}
I_{D} & =\frac{V_{S}-V_{D(\mathrm{on})}}{R}=\frac{8-0.7}{10}=0.73 \mathrm{~mA} \\
V_{D} & =V_{T} \ln \frac{I_{D}}{I_{\mathrm{s}}}=26 \ln \frac{0.73 \times 10^{-3}}{10^{-15}}=710 \mathrm{mV}
\end{aligned}
$$

FIGURE 1.62 (a) Dc and (b) ac equivalents of the circuit of Fig. 1.61.

- For ac analysis refer to the ac version of Fig. 1.62b, showing only the ac components $v_{s}$ and $v_{d}$. The dc components $\left(V_{S}, I_{D}, V_{D}\right.$ ) have deliberately been set to zero in this case. Moreover, the diode has been replaced by its small-signal model (the incremental resistance $r_{d}$ ). We easily find

$$
\begin{aligned}
& r_{d}=\frac{V_{T}}{I_{D}}=\frac{26}{0.73} \cong 36 \Omega \\
& v_{d}=\frac{r_{d}}{R+r_{d}} v_{s}=\frac{36}{10,000+36}(1 \mathrm{~V}) \sin \omega t \cong(3.6 \mathrm{mV}) \sin \omega t
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $3.6 \mathrm{mV}<5 \mathrm{mV} \ll 2 V_{T}(\cong 52 \mathrm{mV}$ ), the error of our approximate ac calculations is less than $10 \%$.

- Finally, applying the superposition principle, we find the total diode voltage as

$$
v_{D}=(710+3.6 \sin \omega t) \mathrm{mV}
$$

### Exercise 1.7

Repeat Example 1.18 if a $6-\mathrm{k} \Omega$ resistance is connected in parallel with the diode.
Hint: Apply Thévenin Theorem to the circuit external to the diode.
Ans. $v_{D}=(706+4.2 \sin \omega t) \mathrm{mV}$.

### The pn Diode as a Current-Controlled Resistance

The relation $r_{d}=V_{T} / I_{D}$ indicates that in small-signal operation a $p n$ diode acts as a variable resistance whose value can be programmed via the bias current $I_{D}$. If we make $r_{d}$ part of a voltage divider, then we can achieve current-controlled attenuation. Alternatively, making it part of the feedback network of an op amp, we can achieve current-controlled amplification. These concepts find application, among others, in automatic gain control (AGC), where one circuit controls the gain of another circuit.

Figure $1.63 b$ shows a current-controlled attenuator. Current control is provided by the source $I_{D}$, which also causes the diode to develop the voltage drop $V_{D}=$ $V_{T} \ln \left(I_{D} / I_{s}\right)$. To prevent the signal source $v_{i}$ from disturbing the dc bias conditions of the diode, we interpose an ac-coupling capacitor $C$, as shown.

FIGURE 1.63 (b) Current-controlled attenuator and its (a) $d c$ and (c) ac equivalents.

We make the following observations about the capacitor:

- At dc, $C$ draws zero current and thus acts as an open circuit. In fact, in the dc equivalent of Fig. 1.63a, $C$ has been omitted altogether.
- When power is applied to the circuit, $C$ will charge up until its plates attain the open-circuit dc voltages of the corresponding nodes. So, the left plate remains at $0-\mathrm{V} \mathrm{dc}$, the right plate charges to $V_{D}$.
- $C$ is chosen sufficiently large to ensure that its impedance is negligible compared to $R$, in effect acting as an ac short. This requires that $1 /(\omega C) \ll R$, or $C \gg 1 /(\omega R)$, where $\omega$ is the input signal frequency.
To develop the ac equivalent of our circuit we replace $C$ by a short circuit and the diode by the variable resistance $r_{d}$. The result is shown in Fig. $1.63 c$, where $I_{D}$ has been omitted altogether as it is a dc quantity, thus having a zero ac component. Applying the voltage divider rule, we get

$$
v_{o}=\frac{r_{d}}{R+r_{d}} v_{i}=\frac{V_{T} / I_{D}}{R+V_{T} / I_{D}} v_{i}=\frac{1}{1+\left(R / V_{T}\right) I_{D}} v_{i}
$$

indicating that the gain of the circuit is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{o}}{v_{i}}=\frac{1}{1+\left(R / V_{T}\right) I_{D}} \tag{1.83}
\end{equation*}
$$

EXAMPLE 1.19 In the circuit of Fig. 1.63 b let

$$
v_{i}=(5 \mathrm{mV}) \cos 10^{6} t
$$

and let $I_{D}$ be variable over the range

$$
(10 \mu \mathrm{~A}) \leq I_{D} \leq(1 \mathrm{~mA})
$$

(a) Specify suitable values for $R$ and $C$ so that for $I_{D}=100 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ the gain is $0.5 \mathrm{~V} / \mathrm{V}$.
(b) If $I_{s}=2 \mathrm{fA}$, show all node voltages ( dc as well as ac components) in the circuit of part (a).
(c) Plot the gain $v_{o} / v_{i}$ versus $I_{D}$ over the specified range of $I_{D}$ values. What are the values of gain and $V_{D}$ at the extremes of the range?

### Solution

(a) At $I_{D}=100 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ we have $r_{d}=(26 \mathrm{mV}) /(100 \mu \mathrm{~A})=260 \Omega$. For a gain of $0.5 \mathrm{~V} / \mathrm{V}$, use $R=260 \Omega$. Moreover, use $C \gg 1 /(\omega R)=1 /\left(10^{6} \times 260\right)=$ 3.8 nF . For instance, pick $C=0.1 \mu \mathrm{~F}$.
(b) The voltage drop across the diode is $V_{D}=V_{T} \ln \left(I_{D} / I_{s}\right)=0.026 \ln \left[10^{-4} /(2 \times\right.$ $\left.\left.10^{-15}\right)\right] \cong 640 \mathrm{mV}$, so the node voltages are as shown in Fig. 1.64a.
(c) With the given component values, Eq. (1.83) gives

$$
\frac{v_{o}}{v_{i}}=\frac{1}{1+10^{4} I_{D}}
$$

whose plot is shown in Fig. 1.64b. At $I_{D}=10 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ this gives $v_{o} / v_{i}=$ $0.91 \mathrm{~V} / \mathrm{V}$. Moreover, by the rule of thumb, $V_{D}=640-60=580 \mathrm{mV}$. Similarly, at $I_{D}=1 \mathrm{~mA}$ we get $v_{o} / v_{i}=0.091 \mathrm{~V} / \mathrm{V}$ and $V_{D}=700 \mathrm{mV}$.

Figure 1.65a shows how a pn diode can be used in connection with an op amp to implement a current-controlled amplifier. As in the case of the controlled attenuator, the source $I_{D}$ programs the value of $r_{d}$, and the capacitor is used to block the dc voltage component $V_{D}$ developed by the diode. The ac equivalent, shown in Fig. 1.65b, reveals the familiar noninverting op amp configuration, whose gain is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{o}}{v_{i}}=1+\frac{R}{r_{d}}=1+\frac{R}{V_{T}} I_{D} \tag{1.84}
\end{equation*}
$$

In this case the impedance provided by $C$ must be negligible compared to $r_{d}$ over the entire range of $r_{d}$ values. This condition is hardest to satisfy when $r_{d}$ is minimized, so we must have $C \gg 1 /\left[\omega r_{d(\min )}\right]$.

EXAMPLE 1.20 In the circuit of Fig. $1.65 a$ let $v_{i}=(5 \mathrm{mV}) \cos 10^{4} t$, and let $I_{D}$ be variable over the range $(0.1 \mathrm{~mA}) \leq I_{D} \leq(1 \mathrm{~mA})$. Specify suitable values for $R$ and $C$ so that for $I_{D}=$ 1 mA the gain is $100 \mathrm{~V} / \mathrm{V}$. What is the range of variability of the gain of your circuit?

### Solution

At $I_{D}=1 \mathrm{~mA}$ we have $r_{d}=26 \Omega$. For a gain of $100 \mathrm{~V} / \mathrm{V}$ we need $R$ such that $100=$ $1+R / 26$, or $R=2574 \Omega$. Moreover, we need $C \gg 1 /\left[\omega r_{d(\min )}\right]=1 /\left(10^{4} \times 26\right)=$ $3.8 \mu \mathrm{~F}$. For instance, pick $C=100 \mu \mathrm{~F}$.

At $I_{D}=0.1 \mathrm{~mA}$ we have $r_{d}=260 \Omega$, so the gain is $1+2574 / 260=11.9 \mathrm{~V} / \mathrm{V}$. Thus, as $I_{D}$ is varied from 1 mA to 0.1 mA , the gain varies from $100 \mathrm{~V} / \mathrm{V}$ to $10.9 \mathrm{~V} / \mathrm{V}$.

## 1.12 BREAKDOWN-REGION OPERATION

The very steep diode curve in the breakdown (BD) region suggests that we can use the $p n$ diode as a voltage reference, if only an approximate one. A voltage reference is a circuit that provides a constant output voltage $V_{o}$ in spite of variations in its own supply voltage $V_{I}$ and in the load current $I_{L}$. Such a voltage is used as a reference by other circuits, like data converters, multimeters, and regulated power supplies, or also to power circuits with moderate power requirements, which we shall generally refer to as the load (LD). As we know, the reciprocal of slope of the BD-region characteristic is denoted as $r_{z}$ and is called the dynamic resistance in the BD region. The smaller $r_{z}$, the steeper the characteristic. According to the BD diode model depicted in Fig. 1.50, in the limit $r_{z} \rightarrow 0$ the diode would act as a perfect voltage source $V_{\text {Z0 }}$.

As we know, the breakdown effect is due to two different mechanisms: Zener breakdown for BD voltages of less than about 6 V , and avalanche breakdown for BD voltages of more than about 6 V . Diodes specifically intended for BD-region operation are referred to as Zener diodes, regardless of the BD mechanism, and exhibit $r_{z}$ values on the order of a few ohms to a few tens of ohms. Commercial Zener diodes are available in the same standard values as $10 \%$ resistances, such as $4.3 \mathrm{~V}, 4.7 \mathrm{~V}$, $5.1 \mathrm{~V}, 5.6 \mathrm{~V}, 6.2 \mathrm{~V}, 6.8 \mathrm{~V}, 7.5 \mathrm{~V}, 8.2 \mathrm{~V}, 9.1 \mathrm{~V}, 10 \mathrm{~V} \ldots .$. The manufacturer's data sheets usually report $V_{Z}$ as well as $r_{z}$ at some specific bias current $I_{Z}$ well down the BD curve, away from the knee. With reference to the BD model of Fig. 1.50, we can find the extrapolated value $V_{z 0}$ indirectly as

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{z 0}=V_{Z}-r_{z} I_{Z} \tag{1.85}
\end{equation*}
$$

EXAMPLE 1.21 A certain Zener diode is specified to have $r_{z}=10 \Omega$, and $V_{Z}=6.2 \mathrm{~V}$ at $I_{Z}=20 \mathrm{~mA}$. Find $V_{z 0}$, as well as the value of $V_{Z}$ at $I_{Z}=10 \mathrm{~mA}$.

### Solution

By Eq. (1.85), $V_{z 0}=6.2-10 \times 0.02=6.0 \mathrm{~V}$. By Eq. (1.85) still, $V_{z}=V_{z 0}+r_{z} I_{z}=$ $6.0+10 \times 0.01=6.1 \mathrm{~V}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d2e70fdf64cb0b15173bg-077.jpg?height=458&width=1157&top_left_y=321&top_left_x=319)

FIGURE 1.66 (a) The Zener diode as a voltage reference. (b) To investigate the reference's behavior, replace the Zener diode with its BD-region model.

### Solution

(a) From Fig. $1.66 b$ it is apparent that $V_{O}=V_{Z}$, so at $I_{Z}=5 \mathrm{~mA}$ we have $V_{o}=$ $V_{z 0}+r_{z} I_{Z}=6.0+10 \times 0.005=6.05 \mathrm{~V}$. The diode current is minimized when $V_{I}$ is minimized $(15 \mathrm{~V})$ and $I_{L}$ is maximized $(10 \mathrm{~mA})$, so $R$ must be such that

$$
R=\frac{V_{l(\min )}-V_{O}}{I_{Z(\min )}+I_{L(\mathrm{fs})}}=\frac{15-6.05}{5+10} \cong 600 \Omega
$$

The closest standard values are $620 \Omega$ and $560 \Omega$. To be on the safe side, use $560 \Omega$.
(b) Again from Fig. $1.66 b$ we note that $V_{O}$ is maximized when $V_{I}$ is maximized $(25 \mathrm{~V})$ and $I_{L}$ is minimized $(0 \mathrm{~mA})$, so using Eq. (1.86) we find

$$
V_{O(\max )}=\frac{10}{560+10} 25+\frac{560}{560+10} 6.0-0=6.333 \mathrm{~V}
$$

Conversely, $V_{O}$ is minimized when $V_{I}$ is minimized $(15 \mathrm{~V})$ and $I_{L}$ is maximized (10 mA), so

$$
V_{O(\min )}=\frac{10}{560+10} 15+\frac{560}{560+10} 6.0-(560 / / 10) 0.01=6.060 \mathrm{~V}
$$

The overall variation in $V_{O}$ is $6.333-6.060=0.273 \mathrm{~V}$, or $0.273 / 6.2=4.4 \%$. Given the much wider range of variability of $V_{I}$ as well as the full-scale variability of $I_{L}$, this is a remarkable result!

### Line and Load Regulation

The output of a voltage reference should be independent of $V_{I}$ and $I_{L}$, so only the second term in the right-hand side of Eq. (1.86) is a desirable one. The other two terms should be zero, a condition that the present circuit could achieve only in the limit $r_{z} \rightarrow 0$. The quality of a voltage reference is specified in terms of two parameters borrowed from voltage-regulator terminology, namely, (a) the line regulation, representing the mV change in $V_{O}$ for every $1-\mathrm{V}$ change in $V_{l}$, and $(b)$ the load regulation, representing the mV change in $V_{O}$ for every 1-mA change in $I_{L}$. From Eq. (1.86) we find, for the present circuit,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\text { Line regulation }=\frac{\Delta V_{O}}{\Delta V_{I}}=\frac{r_{z}}{R+r_{z}} \tag{1.87a}
\end{equation*}
$$

$$
\begin{equation*}
\text { Load regulation }=\frac{\Delta V_{O}}{\Delta I_{L}}=-\left(R / / r_{z}\right) \tag{1.87b}
\end{equation*}
$$

Find the line and load regulation of the circuit of Example 1.22. Express your results in $\mathrm{mV} / \mathrm{V}$ and $\mathrm{mV} / \mathrm{mA}$, as well as in percentage form.

### Solution

Line Regulation $=10 / 570=17.5 \mathrm{mV} / \mathrm{V}$. Since 17.5 mV represents $0.27 \%$ of 6.2 V , we can also say that Line Regulation $=0.27 \% / \mathrm{V}$. Likewise, Load Regulation $=-(560 / / 10)=-9.8 \mathrm{mV} / \mathrm{mA}$, or $-0.16 \% / \mathrm{mA}$.

### Solution

(a) We have $R=\left(V_{I}-V_{D(\text { on })}\right) / I_{D} \cong(5-0.7) / 1.0=4.3 \mathrm{k} \Omega$. Moreover, $V_{O}=$ $(26 \mathrm{mV}) \ln \left(10^{-3} / 10^{-15}\right)=0.718 \mathrm{~V}$. At $I_{D}=1 \mathrm{~mA}$ the diode has $r_{d}=26 / 1=$ $26 \Omega$, so Line Regulation $=r_{d} /\left(R+r_{d}\right)=26 /(4300+26)=6 \mathrm{mV} / \mathrm{V}$, and Load Regulation $=-R / / r_{d} \cong-26 \mathrm{mV} / \mathrm{mA}$.
(b) To achieve the same output voltage with a voltage divider we need a second resistor of value $0.718 / 1.0=0.718 \mathrm{k} \Omega$. We now have Line Regulation $=$ $718 /(4300+718)=143 \mathrm{mV} / \mathrm{V}$, and Load Regulation $=-4300 / / 718 \cong$ $-615 \mathrm{mV} / \mathrm{mA}$. Clearly, a diode reference is much better than a voltage divider.

### Zener Diodes as Voltage Clamps

Its voltage-source behavior in the BD region makes the Zener diode suited to stable voltage-clamp applications. The example of Fig. 1.70 is based on a pair of Zener diodes connected back to back. Since they are in series, they are either both off, or both on (one in the forward region and the other in the BD region). We have three possibilities:

- For $v_{I}$ sufficiently positive to turn on both diodes, $D_{1}$ will operate in the BD region and $D_{2}$ in the forward region, as depicted in Fig. 1.71a. The output is clamped at $V_{O H}=V_{Z 1}+V_{D 2(0 n)}$, where we are ignoring the Zener-diode resistance $r_{z 1}$ compared to $R$. Clearly, this situation occurs for $v_{I}>V_{O H}$.
- For $v_{I}$ sufficiently negative, the situation reverses, with $D_{1}$ now operating in the forward region and $D_{2}$ in the BD region. As depicted in Fig. 1.71b, the output is now clamped at $V_{O L}=-\left(V_{D 1(\mathrm{on})}+V_{Z 2}\right)$. This situation occurs for $v_{I}<V_{O L}$.

FIGURE 1.70 A Zener-diode clamp, and its effect upon the input waveform.

- For $V_{O L}<v_{I}<V_{O H}$ there isn't sufficient voltage drive to turn on the diodes, so they both act as open circuits. The situation is depicted in Fig. 1.71c, where the lack of current causes $R$ to drop 0 V , thus giving $v_{O}=v_{I}$. We say that now $R$, being unencumbered, pulls $v_{O}$ to $v_{I}$.

The clamping effect is depicted in Fig. 1.70b. For instance, if $D_{1}$ is a 4.3-V Zener diode and $D_{2}$ is a 6.8-V Zener diode, $v_{O}$ will be clamped in the positive direction at $V_{O H}=$ $4.3+0.7=5.0 \mathrm{~V}$, and in the negative direction at $V_{O L}=-(0.7+6.8)=-7.5 \mathrm{~V}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d2e70fdf64cb0b15173bg-082.jpg?height=343&width=1524&top_left_y=1172&top_left_x=237)

FIGURE 1.71 Illustrating the three possible conditions for the circuit of Fig. 1.70a.
There are situations in which it is desirable that clamping be symmetric about 0 V , or $V_{O L}=-V_{O H}$. This requires that the two Zener diodes be matched. Alternatively, we can use only one Zener diode, but along with a diode bridge to make it perform the same clamping action both in the positive and negative directions. The circuit is shown in Fig. 1.72, where we have again three possibilities:

- For $v_{I}$ sufficiently positive to turn on the Zener diode via the diode bridge, current flows down the path

$$
\text { source } \rightarrow R \rightarrow D_{1} \rightarrow D_{Z} \rightarrow D_{4} \rightarrow \text { ground }
$$

The output is clamped at $V_{O H}=V_{D 1(\mathrm{on})}+V_{Z}+V_{D 4(\mathrm{on})}=V_{Z}+2 V_{D(\mathrm{on})}$. Clearly, this situation arises for $v_{I}>\left(V_{Z}+2 V_{D(\text { on })}\right)$.

- For $v_{I}$ sufficiently negative, current flows down the path

$$
\text { ground } \rightarrow D_{2} \rightarrow D_{Z} \rightarrow D_{3} \rightarrow R \rightarrow \text { source }
$$

and this occurs for $v_{I}<-\left(V_{Z}+2 V_{D(\text { on })}\right)$. The output is now clamped at $V_{O L}=$ $-\left(V_{Z}+2 V_{D(\text { on })}\right)=-V_{O H}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d2e70fdf64cb0b15173bg-083.jpg?height=463&width=634&top_left_y=324&top_left_x=329)

FIGURE 1.72 Symmetric voltage clamp.

- For $\left|v_{t}\right|<\left(V_{Z}+2 V_{D(\text { on })}\right)$ there isn't sufficient voltage drive to turn on any of the diodes, so they all act as open circuits. The lack of current allows $R$ to pull $v_{O}$ to $v_{I}$, thus giving $v_{O}=v_{I}$.

For instance, using a 5.1-V Zener diode will cause the output to be clamped at $\pm(5.1+1.4)= \pm 6.5 \mathrm{~V}$.

Figure $1.73 a$ illustrates the use of a Zener-diode clamp to limit the output swing of an op amp (in this example an inverting-type amplifier). We identify three possibilities:

- As long as both diodes are off, the Inverting Amplifier Rule indicates that the circuit will give

$$
v_{O}=-\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}} v_{I}
$$

As shown in Fig. 1.73b, the voltage transfer curve (VTC) is a straight line with the gain $\left(-R_{2} / R_{1}\right)$ as its slope. With both diodes in cutoff, any current through $R_{1}$ flows right through $R_{2}$.

- For $v_{I}$ sufficiently positive both diodes will go on ( $D_{1}$ forward, $D_{2}$ in breakdown), thus establishing a fixed voltage drop between the op amp's inverting
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d2e70fdf64cb0b15173bg-083.jpg?height=474&width=1045&top_left_y=1734&top_left_x=327)

FIGURE 1.73 Using Zener diodes to limit the output swing of an op amp.
input, which is at virtual ground, and the output $v_{o}$. Consequently, the output is now clamped at

$$
V_{O L}=-\left(V_{D 1(\text { on })}+V_{Z 2}\right)
$$

For instance, if $D_{2}$ is a 4.3-V Zener diode, the output will be clamped at $V_{O L}=$ $-(0.7+4.3)=-5 \mathrm{~V}$. As we raise $v_{I}$ above the value corresponding to the onset of the clamping action, the current through $R_{2}$ remains fixed at $\left(V_{D 1(\text { on })}+V_{Z 2}\right) / R_{2}$, so any excess current coming in via $R_{1}$ will be diverted to the output terminal via the diodes.

- For $v_{I}$ sufficiently negative the opposite situation occurs ( $D_{1}$ in breakdown, $D_{2}$ forward), and the output is now clamped at

$$
V_{O H}=+\left(V_{Z 1}+V_{D 2(\text { on })}\right)
$$

For instance, if $D_{1}$ is a $6.8-\mathrm{V}$ Zener diode, the output will be clamped at $V_{O H}=+(6.8+0.7)=+7.5 \mathrm{~V}$.
If symmetric clamping is desired, the Zener diodes need to be matched. Alternatively, we replace the back-to-back Zener pair with a single Zener diode and a diode bridge, in the manner discussed in connection with Fig. 1.72.

## 1.13 Dc POWER SUPPLIES

As implied by its name, a dc power supply is a circuit that provides a specified dc voltage to power other circuits. The supply is powered in turn by another power source, which in the following we shall assume to be the household ac power, which in the United States is $120 \mathrm{~V} \mathrm{rms}, 60 \mathrm{~Hz}$. Since the household ac voltage is sinusoidal, we need to convert it to a dc voltage. As a first step we rectify it to eliminate its negative alternations and thus ensure that the voltage is always positive. However, the result is a pulsating voltage, that is, a voltage that periodically returns to zero. We need an energy-storage device to hold the voltage above some specified level during the times when the rectifier's output would drop to zero. Such a device is the capacitor, and the result is shown in Fig. 1.74 for the simpler case of a half-wave rectifier (the full-wave rectifier will be discussed later), and a load that we model with resistor $R$. Not shown in the figure for simplicity is a transformer, which we use to step down the ac voltage from its peak value of $120 \sqrt{2} \mathrm{~V}$ to the value required by the application at hand ( 10 V in the example of Fig. 1.74).

FIGURE 1.75 Voltage (top) and current (bottom) waveforms for the dc power supply of Fig. 1.74.

The relevant waveforms of the circuit of Fig. 1.74 are shown in Fig. 1.75, with respect to which we make the following observations:

- At power turn-on the diode $D$ and the capacitor $C$ act as a peak detector, and we witness a large initial current surge to charge $C$, initially assumed discharged, to the peak value of the input, short of the diode voltage drop $(10-0.7=9.3 \mathrm{~V}$ in our example.)
- Once $v_{I}$ peaks out, the diode goes off, leaving the capacitor as the sole source of power for the load. As $R$ draws current, $C$ will discharge. However, in a welldesigned dc supply, $C$ is chosen large enough to keep discharge fairly small during the time intervals when the diode is off.
- As the next positive input alternation comes along and $v_{I}$ rises above the present capacitor voltage by a diode voltage drop, the diode becomes again conductive, recharging the capacitor to the peak value of the input, short of the diode voltage drop.
- Henceforth all the waveforms repeat, with the output voltage exhibiting ripple, and the diode current consisting of spikes during the diode conduction intervals.

### Ripple, Conduction Interval, and Peak Diode Current

We now wish to investigate the interdependence of the various parameters intervening in the design of a dc power supply. Dc supplies of the type under discussion here are hardly precise systems, so we make a number of simplifying assumptions to speed up our estimations. As mentioned, in a well-designed dc supply the capacitor
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d2e70fdf64cb0b15173bg-086.jpg?height=706&width=1209&top_left_y=341&top_left_x=568)

FIGURE 1.76 (a) Dc power supply, and (b) voltage and current waveforms.
is chosen sufficiently large to ensure a small ripple relative to the peak value $V_{p}$ of the ac input, or

$$
V_{r} \ll V_{p}
$$

where $V_{r}$ denotes the peak-to-peak amplitude of the output ripple. Also, it is convenient to assume the diode to be ideal, or $V_{D(\text { on })} \cong 0$. With these approximations in mind, we redraw the circuit and the repetitive portion of its waveforms as in Fig. 1.76. As seen, capacitor discharge is approximately linear, and thus governed by the rule that engineers express in the form $C \Delta v=I \Delta t$ (cee delta vee equals aye delta tee), where presently $\Delta v$ is the ripple $V_{r}, I$ is the average load current $I_{L}$, and $\Delta t$ is the time interval during which the diode is off, or $T_{\mathrm{OFF}}$. Thus, $C V_{r} \cong I_{L} T_{\mathrm{OFF}}$. Solving for the ripple, we obtain

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{r} \cong \frac{I_{L} T_{\mathrm{OFF}}}{C} \tag{1.91}
\end{equation*}
$$

With reference to Fig. 1.76b, top, we approximate $I_{L} \cong\left(V_{p}-0.5 V_{r}\right) / R \cong V_{p} / R$ and $T_{\text {OFF }} \cong T=1 / f$, where $f$ is the input frequency. Consequently, Eq. (1.91) becomes

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{r} \cong \frac{V_{p}}{f R C} \tag{1.92}
\end{equation*}
$$

If we wish to know to a better degree of accuracy the average value of the output, also called the output dc component and aptly denoted as $V_{O}$, then the diode's voltage drop needs to be taken into consideration. By inspection,

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{O}=V_{p}-V_{D(\mathrm{on})}-0.5 V_{r} \tag{1.93}
\end{equation*}
$$

(a) Estimate the ripple in the circuit of Fig. 1.74.
(b) If $V_{D(\text { on })}=0.7 \mathrm{~V}$, what is the dc component of the output? What value must $V_{p}$ be changed to if we want $V_{O}=10 \mathrm{~V}$ ?
(c) If $V_{p}$ is changed to 50 V and $R$ to $10 \mathrm{k} \Omega$, find $C$ for a ripple of not more than 2 V .

### Solution

(a) By Eq. (1.92),

$$
V_{r} \cong \frac{10}{60 \times 10^{3} \times 150 \times 10^{-6}}=1.1 \mathrm{~V}
$$

which is in fairly good agreement with Fig. 1.75, top.
(b) By Eq. (1.93), $V_{O}=10-0.7-0.5 \times 1.1=8.75 \mathrm{~V}$, also in fairly good agreement with Fig. 1.75, top. For $V_{o}=10 \mathrm{~V}$, we need to raise $V_{p}$ to $10+0.7+0.5 \times 1.1$, or to $V_{p}=11.25 \mathrm{~V}$.
(c) Using again Eq. (1.91), we need

$$
C \geq \frac{V_{p}}{f R V_{r}}=\frac{50}{60 \times 10^{4} \times 2} \cong 42 \mu \mathrm{~F}
$$

We now wish to develop expressions for the diode conduction interval $T_{\mathrm{ON}}$ and the peak diode current $i_{D(\max )}$. To simplify our estimations, we again assume $V_{D(\text { on })}=0$. With reference to Fig. 1.76b, top, we express the input as $v_{I}(t)=V_{p} \cos (2 \pi f t)$. Impos$\operatorname{ing} v_{O}\left(-T_{\mathrm{ON}}\right)=v_{l}\left(-T_{\mathrm{ON}}\right)=V_{p}-V_{r}$ yields

$$
V_{p} \cos \left[2 \pi f\left(-T_{\mathrm{ON}}\right)\right]=V_{p}-V_{r}
$$

Rearranging and expanding the cosine function, we write

$$
1-\frac{V_{r}}{V_{p}}=\cos \left[2 \pi f\left(-T_{\mathrm{ON}}\right)\right]=\cos \left(2 \pi f T_{\mathrm{ON}}\right)=1-\frac{1}{2}\left(2 \pi f T_{\mathrm{ON}}\right)^{2}+\cdots
$$

It is apparent from the figure that the condition $V_{r} \ll V_{p}$ implies $T_{\mathrm{ON}} \ll T(=1 / f)$, so we can ignore higher-order terms in the series expansion. Solving for $T_{\mathrm{ON}}$ we get

$$
\begin{equation*}
T_{\mathrm{ON}} \cong \frac{1}{2 \pi f} \sqrt{\frac{2 V_{r}}{V_{p}}} \tag{1.94}
\end{equation*}
$$

With reference to Fig. 1.76a, we observe that during diode conduction we have, by KCL

$$
\begin{equation*}
i_{D}=C \frac{d v_{O}}{d t}+i_{L}=C \frac{d\left[V_{p} \cos (2 \pi f t)\right]}{d t}+i_{L} \tag{1.95}
\end{equation*}
$$

The diode current is maximum at the onset of the conduction interval, or $t=-T_{\mathrm{ON}}$. At this instant we have

$$
\left.\frac{d \cos (2 \pi f t)}{d t}\right|_{t=-T_{o \mathrm{o}}}=-2 \pi f \sin \left[2 \pi f\left(-T_{\mathrm{ON}}\right)\right] \cong(2 \pi f)^{2} T_{\mathrm{ON}}=2 \pi f \sqrt{\frac{2 V_{r}}{V_{p}}}
$$

where we have approximated $\sin x \cong x$ and have also used Eq. (1.94). Substituting into Eq. (1.95), along with the approximation $i_{L} \cong I_{L} \cong V_{p} / R$, we finally get

$$
\begin{equation*}
i_{D(\max )} \cong I_{L}\left(1+2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{2 V_{p}}{V_{r}}}\right) \tag{1.96}
\end{equation*}
$$

EXAMPLE 1.26 (a) Estimate the conduction interval in the circuit of Fig. 1.74, and express it as a percentage of the period $T$. Comment on your result.
(b) Find $i_{D(\max )}$ for the same circuit.
(c) Estimate the average diode current $i_{D(\text { avg })}$ during the conduction interval $T_{\mathrm{ON}}$, and again comment.

### Solution

(a) Using $V_{r}=1.1 \mathrm{~V}$ from Example 1.25, we have, by Eq. (1.94),

$$
T_{\mathrm{ON}}=\frac{1}{2 \pi 60} \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 1.1}{10}}=1.24 \mathrm{~ms}
$$

Since the period is $T=1 / 60=16.7 \mathrm{~ms}$, the diode conducts during $1.24 / 16.7=$ 0.075 , or only $7.5 \%$ of each cycle, thus confirming the validity of the approximation $T_{\text {OFF }} \cong T$.
(b) We have $I_{L} \cong V_{p} / R=10 / 1=10 \mathrm{~mA}$. By Eq. (1.96),

$$
i_{D(\max )}=10\left(1+2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 10}{1.1}}\right) \cong 280 \mathrm{~mA}
$$

(c) Given the approximately triangular shape of the current spikes, we estimate $i_{D(\text { avg })} \cong i_{D(\max )} / 2=140 \mathrm{~mA}$. Note that $i_{D(\text { avg })} \gg I_{L}$, an obvious consequence of the fact that the charge delivered by the capacitor to the load during the time interval $T_{\mathrm{OFF}}$ must be replenished by the diode during the much shorter conduction interval $T_{\mathrm{ON}}$.

When designing a dc power supply we must select a diode type with adequate current-handling capability during the brief spikes of conduction. Also, we must ensure that the breakdown voltage is sufficiently higher than the peak inverse voltage (PIV), which is the maximum reverse voltage that the diode ever experiences in a given circuit. In the circuit of Fig. 1.74 this condition occurs when $v_{I}$ reaches its negative peak, at which point the voltage across the diode is, by KVL, $v_{D}=-V_{p}-v_{O} \cong$ $-V_{p}-V_{p}=-2 V_{p}$. Consequently,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{PIV} \cong 2 V_{p} \tag{1.97}
\end{equation*}
$$

With the data of Fig. 1.74, PIV $=20 \mathrm{~V}$. To be on the safe side, specify a PIV at least $50 \%$ higher than the calculated value. In our case, let PIV $\geq 1.5 \times 20=30 \mathrm{~V}$.

### Dc Supplies with Full-Wave Rectifiers

It is apparent that if we use a full-wave rectifier instead of a half-wave, the ripple will be approximately reduced in half, everything else remaining the same. Alternatively, we can guarantee the same ripple but with a capacitance half as large, which is quite desirable because large-valued capacitors are bulky. As mentioned, a dc supply that is powered from the household ac power is likely to be preceded by a transformer to scale down the $120-\mathrm{V}$ ac voltage to a more manageable value as required by the application at hand. We can take advantage of this and use a center-tapped transformer, along with a pair of diodes, to achieve full-wave rectification in the manner depicted in Fig. 1.77. A center tapped winding can be viewed as two identical windings connected in series but in antiphase, so that the voltages at its terminals, relative to the common node, are, respectively, $+v_{S}$ and $-v_{S}$. Once we add two diodes as shown, we end up with two separate half-wave rectifiers, but operating on alternate half cycles, in effect resulting in full-wave rectification. Equation (1.91) still holds. However, in Eq. (1.92) we must replace $f$ with $2 f$ to reflect the fact that the period of the full-wave rectified ac voltage is half that of the original voltage and its frequency is thus $2 f$. Consequently, Eqs. (1.92) and (1.96) become

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{r} \cong \frac{V_{p}}{2 f R C} \tag{1.98}
\end{equation*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{equation*}
i_{D(\max )} \cong I_{L}\left(1+2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{V_{p}}{2 V_{r}}}\right) \tag{1.99}
\end{equation*}
$$

indicating that, everything else remaining the same, both $V_{r}$ and $i_{D(\max )}$ are approximately reduced in half compared to the half-wave case. However, we still have PIV $\cong 2 V_{p}$. The conduction interval of each diode is still governed by Eq. (1.94), if with the new value of $V_{r}$.

A notorious disadvantage of the center-tapped transformer is that its secondary coil requires twice as many turns. The alternative implementation of Fig. 1.78 utilizes a single secondary, but with a diode bridge to achieve full-wave rectification. Its

FIGURE 1.78 Dc power supply using a diode bridge rectifier.
waveforms are similar to those of Fig. 1.77b, and Eqs. (1.98) and (1.99) hold also in the present case. However, with two diode drops, Eq. (1.93) changes to

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{O}=V_{p}-2 V_{D(\mathrm{on})}-0.5 V_{r} \tag{1.100}
\end{equation*}
$$

Moreover, we now have

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{PIV} \cong V_{p} \tag{1.101}
\end{equation*}
$$

Given the various options available-half wave, full-wave with center-tapped transformer, or full-wave with diode bridge-a designer will evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each and settle for the one that best meets the cost and complexity constraints of the application at hand.

### Concluding Observation

It is important to realize that the expressions of Eqs. (1.94), (1.96), (1.98), and (1.99) have been derived for the case of sinusoidal inputs, as most dc power supplies are powered from the household ac line. However, there are specialized cases in which the input waveform is not necessarily sinusoidal. It is left as an exercise, in the end-of-chapter problems, to apply the same line of reasoning to non-sinusoidal cases and develop ad-hoc expressions for $T_{\mathrm{ON}}, i_{D(\max )}$, and $i_{D(\text { avg })}$. Also, for simplicity, the load is usually simulated with a mere resistance. A more realistic load model is a Norton equivalent, consisting of a fixed load-current in parallel with a resistance.

### SPICE Models for Diodes

SPICE (an acronym for Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) is a powerful computer-simulation tool designed to help verify complex circuits that would be prohibitive to analyze via hand calculations. Nowadays there are a plethora of SPICE versions available (a Web search will reveal the existence of online clubs devoted to particular versions, where members exchange useful tips). Rather than committing to a particular version, I have tried to keep the SPICE examples general and simple enough so students can try them out using their preferred SPICE version. All examples were created using the Student Versions of Cadence's PSpice. This version, available free of charge, is a powerful pedagogical tool especially for the beginner, as you can glean from the various PSpice examples scattered throughout the current and subsequent chapters.

However powerful, SPICE is no substitute for true understanding-the kind attainable through diligent reasoning and patient paper-and-pencil calculations. Even when circuit complexity mandates the use of SPICE, one must still be able to examine the results provided by the computer and spot-check them by a combination of hand calculations and intuitive insight. Consequently, SPICE is only an analytical aid-if a most powerful one.

It is assumed that the student is already familiar with SPICE basics from prerequisite courses such as circuits courses and labs (how to create a circuit schematic using parts from SPICE's internal libraries, how to direct SPICE to perform a specific type of analysis among the various possible, and how to display traces using Probe, the oscilloscope-like feature provided by PSpice). The focus of this Appendix is SPICE models for diodes.

When we use a semiconductor device in a SPICE circuit schematic, we need to specify the characteristics of that device. The characteristics are expressed in terms of a list of parameters that SPICE then uses to create an internal model of the device. Shown in Table 1A. 1 are the parameters intervening in the creation of the model for $p n$ diodes. PSpice comes with a library of models for some of the most popular semiconductor devices. Moreover, the user can create additional models by suitably editing one of the already available models.

As an example, consider the PSpice circuit of Fig. 1.51a, utilizing the popular $1 N 4148$ pn diode. By PSpice convention, diode names must start with the letter D, so the part number has been designated as D1N4148. To create the circuit we use the Place $\rightarrow$ Part commands to lay out the various components, and the Place $\rightarrow$ Wire commands to interconnect them. When it comes to placing the diode, we import it from PSpice's library by going down its list of entries and left-clicking on the D1N4148 part. To visualize its model, first left-click on the diode to select it, then right-click to activate a pull-down menu of possible actions. Left-click on Edit PSpice Model, and the following list will appear:

```
.model D1N4148 D(Is=2.682n N=1.836 Rs=.5664 Ikf=44.17m Xti=3
+ Eg=1.11 Cjo=4p M=.3333 Vj=.5 Fc=.5 Isr=1.565n Nr=2
+ Bv=100 Ibv=100u Tt=11.54n)
```

TABLE 1A.1 Partial parameter list of the PSpice diode model.

| Symbol | Name | Parameter description | Units | Default | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $I_{s}$ | Is | Saturation current | A | 10 fA | 2 fA |
| $n$ | N | Emission coefficient |  | 1 | 1.5 |
| $r_{S}$ | Rs | Bulk resistance | $\Omega$ | 0 | 2 |
| $C_{j 0}$ | Cjo | Zero-bias junction capacitance | F | 0 | 1.0 pF |
| $m$ | M | Grading coefficient |  | 0.5 | 0.33 |
| $\phi_{0}$ | Vj | Built-in potential | V | 1 V | 0.8 V |
| $\tau_{T}$ | Tt | Transit time | S | 0 | 0.2 ns |
| $V_{Z}$ | Bv | Voltage at onset of breakdown | V | $\infty$ | 100 V |
| $I_{Z}$ | Ibv | Current at onset of breakdown | A | 0.1 nA | $100 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ |

The parameter values shown are designed to match as closely as possible those given in the manufacturer's data sheets. We easily see that this particular diode type has $I_{s}=2.682 \mathrm{nA}, n=1.836, r_{s}=0.5664 \Omega, C_{j 0}=4 \mathrm{pF}, m=0.3333, \phi_{0}=$ 0.5 V , and $\tau_{T}=11.54 \mathrm{~ns}$. We also note that the onset of the breakdown region (knee of the $i-v$ curve in reverse bias) is specified to be 100 V at $100 \mu \mathrm{~A}\left(V_{Z}=\right.$ 100 V at $I_{Z}=100 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ ). The complete list contains additional parameters representing higher-order effects that are beyond our present scope. Also, note the usage of a space to separate individual parameters, and the usage of the + symbol to denote continuity when the list is too long to fit in a single line. For more details, see Ref. [11].

If you wish to create your own diode model to experiment with, you can do so simply by overwriting (editing) the parameter values of an existing diode model, such as the D1N4148 considered above. However, to avoid losing the original D1N4148 model, a new name must be given to the newly formed model. This is what was done to create a model for the pseudo-ideal diode of Figs. 2.14 and 2.16. The diode model was renamed as Dideal, and the parameter list was edited as follows:
.model Dideal D(Is=1n N=0.001)
Even though we know that a practical $p n$ junction has $1 \leq n \leq 2$, here we have specified an artificially small value of $n$ to ensure that the exponential $i-v$ curve shoots up for very small values of $v$, thus approximating an ideal diode. (To get an idea, use the logarithmic diode law to verify that to sustain $i=1 \mathrm{~mA}$ this diode requires only $v=0.36 \mathrm{mV}-$ almost 0 V , and certainly much less than the typical voltage drop of 0.7 V !) This is all we need to simulate an almost ideal diode, so all other parameters have been omitted from the list. All omitted parameters are automatically assigned default values according to Table 1A.1.

PSpice's library contains also a model for the 1N750 4.7-V Zener diode:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d2e70fdf64cb0b15173bg-092.jpg?height=212&width=1190&top_left_y=1561&top_left_x=575)

The last line, starting with an asterisk, is by convention a comment line summarizing salient characteristics. It states that this diode is rated to provide $V_{Z}=4.7 \mathrm{~V}$ at $I_{Z}=20 \mathrm{~mA}$. Moreover, the reciprocal of the slope of the $i-v$ curve in the breakdown region, denoted as $r_{z}$ in the text, is specified at different points as $r_{z}=300 \Omega$ at $I_{Z}=1 \mathrm{~mA}, r_{z}=12.5 \Omega$ at $I_{Z}=5 \mathrm{~mA}$, and $r_{z}=2.6 \Omega$ at $I_{Z}=20 \mathrm{~mA}$. Clearly, the further down the curve past the knee, the steeper the slope.

The user can readily edit the above model to create a Zener diode with a different rating. For instance, changing $\mathrm{Bv}=4.7$ to $\mathrm{Bv}=6.2$ will turn the model into that of a 6.2-V Zener.
