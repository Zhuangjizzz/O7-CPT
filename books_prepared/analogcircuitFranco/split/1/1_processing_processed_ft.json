These ions are fixed in the crystal lattice and do not contribute to current, creating a region depleted of mobile charges, hence the name 'depletion layer'.

This behavior introduces a non-ideal knee in the VTC, which can be beneficial for applications like piecewise-linear function generators, ensuring smoother transitions between different segments of the VTC.

Its primary role is to smooth the pulsating voltage output from the rectifier, which periodically drops to zero, to maintain a more constant dc voltage across the load resistor. When the rectifier's output voltage is at its peak, the capacitor charges up. During the intervals when the rectifier's output drops to zero, the capacitor discharges slowly, providing a continuous voltage to the load. This results in a reduced ripple in the output voltage, making it more stable and suitable for powering other circuits."
