Its creation over a century ago marked the beginning of the electronic age. Similar to resistors, diodes have two terminals; however, unlike resistors, diodes allow current to flow in only one direction. To understand this qualitatively, consider early vacuum-tube diodes. These diodes featured an incandescent filament known as a cathode, which emitted free electrons, and a plate called an anode, which controlled current flow. A positive voltage applied to the anode relative to the cathode attracted electrons, enabling current flow from cathode to anode. Conversely, a negative voltage repelled electrons, preventing current flow. Using a hydraulic analogy, a diode can be likened to a one-way valve.\nJohn A. Fleming invented the vacuum-tube diode in 1904. Two years later, in 1906, Greenleaf W. Pickard developed an alternative diode by creating a point contact with a silicon slab, pioneering the first solid-state electronic device. Despite this, the semiconductor industry took half a century to flourish, leaving vacuum-tube electronics dominant in the first half of the twentieth century.\nToday, diodes are crafted from semiconductor materials, offering significant advantages over vacuum tubes in miniaturization, reliability, power efficiency, and cost. The most prevalent diode today is the silicon pn junction, though other materials and junction types are also used. The pn junction is pivotal in microelectronics, underpinning not only diode functions but also key devices like the bipolar junction transistor (BJT), junction field-effect transistor (JFET), and silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR). It is also integral to the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET), the most widely used device in modern microelectronics. Additionally, in its reverse-biased state, the pn junction isolates different devices on a single semiconductor chip.\nStudents transitioning from linear circuits courses will quickly realize that diodes, like transistors, are highly nonlinear devices. Fortunately, various techniques for analyzing nonlinear devices heavily leverage concepts from linear circuits courses. The analytical tools acquired in these courses, such as Ohm's Law, Kirchhoff's Laws (KVL and KCL), Voltage/Current Divider Rules, Thévenin's/Norton's Theorems, and the Superposition Principle, remain invaluable as we delve into electronic devices and systems.\nCHAPTER HIGHLIGHTS\nThe chapter initiates with the ideal diode, a concept aimed at fostering a basic understanding of diode behavior and introducing nonlinear circuit analysis techniques, foundational for all subsequent electronics study. Covered applications include diode rectifiers, logic gates, voltage clamps, piecewise-linear function generators, peak detectors, dc restorers, and voltage multipliers.\nNext, we revisit basic operational amplifier principles from prerequisite courses, as diodes (and later, transistors) provide extensive application opportunities for op amps. The first diode-op-amp application explored is full-wave rectification, with more to follow.\nAs noted, contemporary diodes are semiconductor-based, necessitating a study of fundamental pn junction theory. After reviewing semiconductor basics typically covered in physics courses, the chapter offers an intuitive discussion of the pn junction, emphasizing practical insights essential for modern electronics engineers. Regardless of whether students pursue careers in IC design, product, process, or reliability engineering, or as test or applications engineers, the pn junction remains a recurring element, warranting in-depth examination.

Unlike the resistor, which conducts in either direction, the diode carries current only from the terminal called anode $(A)$ to the terminal called cathode $(C)$. Its circuit symbol, shown in Fig. 1.1a, uses an arrowhead to signify this directionality. The voltage across the diode is defined as positive at the anode and negative at the cathode, thus conforming to the passive sign convention of other popular devices such as resistors.\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:The diagram illustrates the ideal diode symbol and its behavior curve. The 'ON' area denotes forward bias, with current moving from anode (A) to cathode (C). The 'CO' area represents reverse bias, where no current flows.\nimage_name:(b)\ndescription:The graph in Figure 1.1 (b) presents the ideal diode's \\(i\\)-\\(v\\) characteristic. It depicts the correlation between current \\(i\\) and voltage \\(v\\) across a diode in two clear regions: the 'ON' area and the cutoff (CO) area.\n1. **Graph Type and Purpose:**\n- This graph is a characteristic curve for an ideal diode, a common tool in electronics to visualize the relationship between current and voltage within a diode.\n2. **Axis Labels and Units:**\n- The horizontal axis denotes voltage \\(v\\) and is set to zero at the origin. Positive voltage is to the right, and negative voltage is to the left.\n- The vertical axis denotes current \\(i\\) and is also set to zero at the origin. Positive current is upwards, and negative current is downwards.\n3. **Behavior and Trends:**\n- In the 'ON' area, forward biasing (positive voltage) causes a sharp increase in current with a minimal voltage change, showing that the diode conducts.\n- In the CO area, reverse biasing (negative voltage) results in zero current, indicating that the diode does not conduct.\n4. **Notable Features and Technical Details:**\n- The 'ON' area is marked where current is positive and voltage is positive, indicating conduction.\n- The cutoff area is marked where current is zero despite the negative voltage, indicating non-conduction.\n- Arrows on the graph represent the direction of current flow in both areas. In the 'ON' area, the arrow points upwards for positive current flow. In the CO area, the arrow points to zero current.\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- The graph includes labels \"ON\" and \"CO\" to indicate the diode's operational state.\n- Diode symbols with anode \\(A\\) and cathode \\(C\\) are shown beside the graph, depicting current flow direction and voltage polarity in both areas.\nFIGURE 1.1 (a) Circuit symbol and sign convention for the diode. (b) Ideal-diode \\(i\\)-\\(v\\) characteristic and diode models in the on (ON) region and in the cut-off (CO) region of operation.\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:The circuit diagram '(a)' depicts a simple series circuit containing a voltage source, a diode, and a load. The diode is forward-biased, allowing current 'i' to flow from the source through the diode to the load. The valve analogy illustrates the forward operation of the diode, where it behaves like a closed valve allowing flow from a pump to a tank.\nimage_name:(b)\ndescription:The block diagram labeled \"(b)\" uses a valve analogy to demonstrate the reverse operation of a diode. It is divided into two main parts: an electrical circuit and a mechanical analogy.\n**Main Components:**\n1. **Electrical Circuit:**\n- **Diode:** Represented by its standard symbol, showing the direction of current flow. Here, the diode is reverse-biased, preventing current.\n- **Source:** Signified by a voltage source, supplying electrical energy.\n- **Load:** Represented by a block in the circuit, indicating the component consuming power if current were to flow.\n2. **Mechanical Analogy:**\n- **Tank and Pump:** The tank symbolizes the load, while the pump symbolizes the energy source. The valve analogy is used to demonstrate the flow direction.\n**Information or Control Flow:**\n- In the electrical circuit, current flow attempts to move in reverse through the diode but is blocked, indicated by the \"0\" label next to the current arrow.\n- In the mechanical analogy, the valve is closed, blocking flow from the tank to the pump, reflecting the diode's blocking action in reverse-biased condition.\n**Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n- The arrow on the diode symbol in the circuit denotes the direction of conventional current flow, which is blocked here.\n- The \"0\" label next to the current arrow highlights the absence of current when the diode is reverse-biased.\n**Overall System Function:**\nThe primary purpose of this diagram is to depict the diode's behavior in reverse operation. In this state, the diode functions as an open circuit, preventing current flow. The valve analogy assists in visualizing this by showing a closed valve preventing fluid flow from the tank to the pump, mirroring the diode's role in the electrical circuit. This illustrates the diode's function as a unidirectional device, allowing current to flow only when forward-biased.\nFIGURE 1.2 Valve analogy of a diode: (a) forward operation and (b) reverse operation.\nA diode responds to an applied voltage by conducting current in the direction of its arrowhead ( \\(i>0\\) ), known as the forward ( F ) direction. When forward-biased, the diode conducts the current as if it were a short circuit ( \\(v=0\\) ). However, if current is forced in the opposite direction ( \\(R\\) direction), the diode resists current flow, acting as an open circuit ( \\(i=0\\) ). In this case, the diode is said to be reverse-biased or cut off ( \\(CO\\) ). When cut off, the diode maintains any voltage ( \\(v<0\\) ) imposed by the surrounding circuitry.\nFigure 1.1 b shows the \\(i\\)-\\(v\\) characteristic of the diode, which can be mathematically expressed as\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv=0 & \\text{ for } i>0  \\tag{1.1a}\\\\\ni=0 & \\text{ for } v<0 \\tag{1.1b}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nThe diode models (short circuit and open circuit) corresponding to the two operating modes are also shown alongside the curves. A device exhibiting these characteristics is known as an ideal diode. As we will see, real-world diodes only approximate these idealized curves.\nUsing the analogy of a water valve as depicted in Fig. 1.2, the valve rotates at the top and has a stopper at the bottom. Pushing electric current to a load through a diode is similar to pumping water to a tank through a pipe equipped with a valve. Forward pressure on the valve opens it, allowing water flow, as seen in Fig. 1.2a. However, reverse pressure on the valve closes it, preventing flow, as shown in Fig. 1.2b. To better understand diode operation, consider our first circuit example.\nEXAMPLE 1.1 (a) In the circuit of Fig. 1.3, let \\(R_{1}=1 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega\\) and \\(R_{2}=2 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega\\). If \\(v_{S}=3 \\mathrm{~V}\\), find \\(i_{S}\\) so that \\(D\\) draws 1 mA. Show the final circuit.\n(b) If \\(i_{S}=3 \\mathrm{~mA}\\), find \\(v_{S}\\) so that \\(D\\) drops 2 V. Show the circuit.\n(c) If \\(i_{S}=2 \\mathrm{~mA}\\) and \\(v_{S}=6 \\mathrm{~V}\\), find \\(R_{1}\\) and \\(R_{2}\\) so that \\(D\\) operates at the origin of the \\(i\\)-\\(v\\) plane, where \\(v=0\\) and \\(i=0\\).\nimage_name:Figure 1.3\ndescription:\n[\nname: R1, type: Resistor, value: R1, ports: {N1: X2, N2: GND}\nname: R2, type: Resistor, value: R2, ports: {N1: X1, N2: Vs}\nname: D, type: Diode, ports: {Na: X2, Nc: X1}\nname: is, type: CurrentSource, value: is, ports: {Np: X2, Nn: GND}\nname: Vs, type: VoltageSource, value: Vs, ports: {Np: Vs, Nn: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:This circuit comprises a current source \\(is\\), a diode \\(D\\), and two resistors \\(R1\\) and \\(R2\\).

This diagram is divided into two main sections: an electrical circuit and a mechanical analogy.\n\n**Main Components:**\n1. **Electrical Circuit:**\n   - **Diode:** Shown with the standard symbol, indicating the direction of current flow.

In this state, the diode acts as an open circuit, preventing any current flow. The valve analogy helps to conceptualize this by showing the closed valve that stops fluid flow from the tank to the pump, mirroring the diode's function in the electrical circuit. This demonstrates the diode's role as a one-way device, allowing current to flow only in the forward direction when not reverse-biased.\n\nWhen invited to draw current in the direction of its arrowhead ( $i>0$ ), also called the forward ( F ) direction, a diode will eagerly conduct the given current by acting as a short circuit $(v=0)$. In this case the the diode is said to be forward biased, or also to be on (ON). However, if we try to force current in the opposite direction, also called the reverse $(\\mathrm{R})$ direction, the diode will stubbornly oppose current flow by acting as an open circuit $(i=0)$. The diode is now said to be reverse biased, or also to be cut off $(\\mathrm{CO})$. When cut off, the diode will sustain whatever voltage $(v<0)$ is imposed by the surrounding circuitry.\n\nFigure $1.1 b$ shows the $i-v$ characteristic of the diode, which we express mathematically as\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv=0 & \\text { for } i>0  \\tag{1.1a}\\\\\ni=0 & \\text { for } v<0 \\tag{1.1b}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nA diode can be likened to a water valve according to the analogy of Fig. 1.2. The valve hinges at the top and has a stopper at the bottom. Forcing electric current to a load via a diode is like pumping water to a tank via a pipe equipped with a valve. If pump pressure is applied in the forward direction, the valve will open and allow water to flow as in Fig. 1.2a. However, if pressure is applied in the reverse direction as in Fig. 1.2b, the valve will close and inhibit water flow. To develop a feel for diode operation, let us consider our first circuit example.\n\nEXAMPLE 1.1 (a) In the circuit of Fig. 1.3 let $R_{1}=1 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$ and $R_{2}=2 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$. If $v_{S}=3 \\mathrm{~V}$, find $i_{S}$ so that $D$ draws 1 mA . Show the final circuit.\n(b) If $i_{S}=3 \\mathrm{~mA}$, find $v_{S}$ so that $D$ drops 2 V . Show the circuit.\n(c) If $i_{S}=2 \\mathrm{~mA}$ and $v_{S}=6 \\mathrm{~V}$, find $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ so that $D$ operates at the origin of the $i-v$ plane, where $v=0$ and $i=0$.\n\nThe circuit consists of a current source is, a diode D, and two resistors R1 and R2. The current source is connected to node X2, which is also connected to the anode of diode D and one terminal of resistor R1. The cathode of the diode is connected to node X1, which is also connected to one terminal of resistor R2. The other terminal of R2 is connected to the positive terminal of the voltage source Vs. The negative terminal of the voltage source and one terminal of R1 are connected to the ground.\n\nIn conduction $D$ acts as a short-circuit, so $v_{A}=v_{C}$. By Ohm's law and KVL, $v_{A}=v_{C}=(2 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega) \\times(1 \\mathrm{~mA})+(3 \\mathrm{~V})=5 \\mathrm{~V}$, causing the $1-\\mathrm{k} \\Omega$ resistance to draw $(5 \\mathrm{~V}) /(1 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega)=5 \\mathrm{~mA}$, flowing downward. KCL gives $i_{S}=(1 \\mathrm{~mA})+$ $(5 \\mathrm{~mA})=6 \\mathrm{~mA}$, so the situation is as in Fig. 1.4a.\n\nIn cutoff $D$ acts as an open circuit, so the $2-\\mathrm{k} \\Omega$ resistance drops 0 V . By Ohm's law, $v_{A}=3 \\times 1=3 \\mathrm{~V}$. By KVL, the voltage at the cathode is $v_{C}=v_{A}+2=3+2=5 \\mathrm{~V}$, so $v_{S}=v_{C}=5 \\mathrm{~V}$ as shown in Fig. 1.4b.\n\n$i=0 \\Rightarrow v_{C}=v_{S}=6 \\mathrm{~V} ; v=0 \\Rightarrow v_{A}=v_{C}=6 \\mathrm{~V}$ and $R_{1}=v_{A} / i_{S}=6 / 2=$ $3 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$. As long as $D$ is cut off, the value of $R_{2}$ is irrelevant. $R_{2}$ has an impact only when $D$ is on.\n\nEven though it consists of two straight segments, the diode characteristic is nonlinear. (In fact, it is said to be piecewise linear.) Yet, as demonstrated by Example 1.1, we can still apply the analytical techniques learned in linear-circuits courses because at any given time the diode operates only in one of its two possible modes (either ON or CO), where it admits a model (open or short circuit) that is indeed linear. Thus, to carry out our analysis, we only need to determine which of the two modes the diode happens to be operating in at a given time.\n\nThe circuit contains a voltage source Voc, a resistor Req, and a diode. The diode is connected with its anode at node X3 and cathode at node X1.

    "text": "A diode functions as a unidirectional conductor, allowing current to flow from its anode to its cathode. This is distinct from a resistor, which permits current in both directions. The diode's circuit symbol, depicted in Fig. 1.1a, features an arrowhead that indicates this unidirectional flow. The voltage across the diode is positive at the anode and negative at the cathode, adhering to the passive sign convention used by other devices like resistors.\n\nFig. 1.1a presents a diagram of the ideal diode symbol and its characteristic curve. The 'ON' region signifies forward bias, where current flows from the anode (A) to the cathode (C). The 'CO' region represents reverse bias, where no current flows. Fig. 1.1b is an ideal diode \\(i\\)-\\(v\\) characteristic graph, illustrating the relationship between current \\(i\\) and voltage \\(v\\) across the diode in two distinct regions: the ON region and the cut-off (CO) region.\n\nThe graph in Fig. 1.1b is a characteristic curve graph for an ideal diode, used in electronics to show how current and voltage relate. The horizontal axis represents voltage \\(v\\), with positive voltage to the right and negative to the left. The vertical axis represents current \\(i\\), with positive current upwards and negative downwards.\n\nIn the ON region, when the diode is forward-biased, the current increases sharply with a small voltage increase, indicating conduction. In the CO region, when the diode is reverse-biased, the current is zero, indicating no conduction. The ON region is marked where the current is positive, and the voltage is positive, indicating conduction. The cut-off region is marked where the current remains zero despite the negative voltage, indicating no conduction.\n\nThe graph includes labels \"ON\" and \"CO\" at the corresponding regions to indicate the diode's operational state. Diode symbols with anode \\(A\\) and cathode \\(C\\) terminals are shown next to the graph, demonstrating the direction of current flow and voltage polarity in both regions.\n\nFig. 1.2 illustrates the valve analogy of a diode: (a) forward operation and (b) reverse operation. In forward operation, the diode acts as a closed valve, allowing flow from the pump to the tank. In reverse operation, the diode acts as an open circuit, preventing any current flow.\n\nThe circuit diagram in Fig. 1.3 shows a simple series circuit with a voltage source, a diode, and a load. The diode is forward-biased, allowing current to flow from the source through the diode to the load. The valve analogy illustrates the forward operation of the diode, where it acts as a closed valve allowing flow from the pump to the tank.\n\nThe system block diagram in Fig. 1.2b illustrates the reverse operation of a diode using a valve analogy. It is divided into two main sections: an electrical circuit and a mechanical analogy. The electrical circuit includes a diode, a source, and a load. The mechanical analogy includes a tank and a pump.\n\nIn the electrical circuit, the current flow is attempted in the reverse direction through the diode, but the diode blocks this flow, resulting in zero current. In the mechanical analogy, the valve is closed, preventing the flow from the tank to the pump, corresponding to the diode's blocking action in the reverse-biased condition.\n\nThe arrow on the diode symbol in the circuit indicates the direction of conventional current flow, which is blocked in this case. The label \"0\" next to the current arrow in the circuit emphasizes that no current flows when the diode is reverse-biased.\n\nThe primary function of this diagram is to illustrate the behavior of a diode in reverse operation. In this state, the diode acts as an open circuit, preventing any current flow. The valve analogy helps to conceptualize this by showing the closed valve that stops fluid flow from the tank to the pump, mirroring the diode's function in the electrical circuit. This demonstrates the diode's role as a one-way device, allowing current to flow only in the forward direction when not reverse-biased.\n\nThe diode can be likened to a water valve according to the analogy in Fig. 1.2. The valve hinges at the top and has a stopper at the bottom. Forcing electric current to a load via a diode is like pumping water to a tank via a pipe equipped with a valve. If pump pressure is applied in the forward direction, the valve will open and allow water to flow. However, if pressure is applied in the reverse direction, the valve will close and inhibit water flow.\n\nTo develop a feel for diode operation, let us consider our first circuit example.\n\nEXAMPLE 1.1 (a) In the circuit of Fig. 1.3, let \\(R_{1}=1 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega\\) and \\(R_{2}=2 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega\\). If \\(v_{S}=3 \\mathrm{~V}\\), find \\(i_{S}\\) so that \\(D\\) draws 1 mA. Show the final circuit.\n\n(b) If \\(i_{S}=3 \\mathrm{~mA}\\), find \\(v_{S}\\) so that \\(D\\) drops 2 V. Show the circuit.\n\n(c) If \\(i_{S}=2 \\mathrm{~mA}\\) and \\(v_{S}=6 \\mathrm{~V}\\), find \\(R_{1}\\) and \\(R_{2}\\) so that \\(D\\) operates at the origin of the \\(i\\)-\\(v\\) plane, where \\(v=0\\) and \\(i=0\\).\n\nFig. 1.3 shows the circuit of Example 1.1.\n\n#### Solution\n\n(a) In conduction, \\(D\\) acts as a short-circuit, so \\(v_{A}=v_{C}\\). By Ohm's law and KVL, \\(v_{A}=v_{C}=(2 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega) \\times(1 \\mathrm{~mA})+(3 \\mathrm{~V})=5 \\mathrm{~V}\\), causing the \\(1\\mathrm{k} \\Omega\\) resistance to draw \\((5 \\mathrm{~V}) /(1 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega)=5 \\mathrm{~mA}\\), flowing downward. KCL gives \\(i_{S}=(1 \\mathrm{~mA})+(5 \\mathrm{~mA})=6 \\mathrm{~mA}\\), so the situation is as in Fig. 1.4a.\n\n(b) In cutoff, \\(D\\) acts as an open circuit, so the \\(2\\mathrm{k} \\Omega\\) resistance drops 0 V. By Ohm's law, \\(v_{A}=3 \\times 1=3 \\mathrm{~V}\\). By KVL, the voltage at the cathode is \\(v_{C}=v_{A}+2=3+2=5 \\mathrm{~V}\\), so \\(v_{S}=v_{C}=5 \\mathrm{~V}\\) as shown in Fig. 1.4b.\n\n(c) \\(i=0 \\Rightarrow v_{C}=v_{S}=6 \\mathrm{~V}\\); \\(v=0 \\Rightarrow v_{A}=v_{C}=6 \\mathrm{~V}\\) and \\(R_{1}=v_{A} / i_{S}=6 / 2=3 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega\\). As long as \\(D\\) is cut off, the value of \\(R_{2}\\) is irrelevant. \\(R_{2}\\) has an impact only when \\(D\\) is on.\n\n#### Finding the Operating Mode of a Diode\n\nEven though it consists of two straight segments, the diode characteristic is nonlinear. However, as demonstrated by Example 1.1, we can still apply the analytical techniques learned in linear-circuits courses because at any given time the diode operates only in one of its two possible modes (either ON or CO), where it admits a model (open or short circuit) that is indeed linear. Thus, to carry out our analysis, we only need to determine which of the two modes the diode happens to be operating in at a given time.\n\nThe circuit contains a voltage source \\(V_{OC}\\), a resistor \\(R_{eq}\\), and a diode. The diode is connected with its anode at node \\(X_{3}\\) and cathode at node \\(X_{1}\\). The load lines for different \\(V_{OC}\\) polarities are shown in figures (b) and (c).\n\nThe graph labeled \"(b)\" is a load line diagram used in the context of diode circuit analysis. This type of graph is a plot of current (i) versus voltage (v), often used to determine the operating point of a diode within a circuit.\n\nThe load line is a straight line with a negative slope, indicating a linear relationship between current and voltage as determined by the circuit's Thévenin equivalent resistance \\(R_{eq}\\). The slope of the load line is \\(-1/R_{eq}\\), showing the inverse relationship between current and voltage. The load line intersects the voltage axis at \\(v_{OC}\\), the open-circuit voltage, and the current axis at a point determined by \\(v_{OC}/R_{eq}\\).\n\nThe load line is annotated with a point labeled \\(Q_{F}\\), which represents the forward operating point of the diode when \\(v_{OC} > 0\\). The intersection of the load line with the diode's characteristic curve determines the actual operating point of the diode. The slope \\(-1/R_{eq}\\) is significant as it reflects the resistance of the circuit seen by the diode.\n\nThe diagram includes an annotation for the load line for \\(v_{OC} > 0\\), indicating the condition under which the forward operating point \\(Q_{F}\\) is relevant. The point \\(Q_{F}\\) is where the diode's characteristic curve intersects with the load line, defining the diode's current and voltage under the given conditions.\n\nThis graph is essential for visualizing how the diode will behave in the circuit, allowing for the determination of its operating point based on the surrounding linear circuit components.\n\nThe graph labeled (c) is a load line analysis diagram for a diode circuit. It is used to determine the operating point of the diode when the open-circuit voltage \\(v_{OC}\\) is less than zero.\n\nThe load line is a straight line with a negative slope, indicating a linear relationship between \\(v\\) and \\(i\\) when considering the external circuit's resistance \\(R_{eq}\\). The slope of the line is \\(-1/R_{eq}\\), showing that as the voltage across the diode decreases, the current increases linearly.\n\nThe line intersects the horizontal axis at \\(v_{OC}\\), which is negative in this case, indicating the open-circuit voltage. The point \\(Q_{R}\\) on the load line represents the quiescent or operating point of the diode for \\(v_{OC} < 0\\).\n\nThe load line is annotated with \"Load line for \\(v_{OC} < 0\\)\" to specify the condition under which this line applies. The slope \\(-1/R_{eq}\\) is indicated with a right-angle marker, emphasizing the resistance's role in determining the line's slope.\n\nThis graph helps in analyzing the diode's behavior when embedded in a linear circuit with a negative open-circuit voltage, allowing for the determination of current and voltage across the diode at the operating point \\(Q_{R}\\).\n\nThere are many situations in which the diode is embedded in a linear circuit, indicating that we can simplify our analysis significantly if we replace the surrounding circuitry with its Thévenin equivalent. After doing so, we end up with the basic situation of Fig. 1.5a, where \\(v_{OC}\\) is the open-circuit voltage that the external circuit would sustain between the nodes corresponding to the anode and the cathode, but with the diode removed. Moreover, \\(R_{eq}\\) is the external circuit's equivalent resistance as seen by the diode. Shown in Fig. $1.5 b$ and $1.5 c$ is the \\(i\\)-\\(v\\) characteristic of the diode as well as that of the surrounding circuit, the latter being referred to as the load line. As we know from basic circuit theory, the load line is a straight line intercepting the \\(v\\)-axis at \\(v=v_{OC}\\), and having a slope of \\(-1 / R_{eq}\\). The circuit's operating point lies at the intersection of the diode curve and the load line, where the diode and the surrounding circuit share the same voltage and current. It is apparent that\n\n- If \\(v_{OC}>0\\), the operating point \\((Q_{F})\\) lies on the ON segment, where the diode is forward biased and thus acts as a short circuit to yield\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv=0 \\quad i=\\frac{v_{OC}}{R_{eq}}(>0) \\tag{1.2a}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n- Conversely, if \\(v_{OC}<0\\), the operating point \\((Q_{R})\\) lies on the CO segment, where the diode is reverse biased and thus acts as an open circuit to yield\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni=0 \\quad v=v_{OC}(<0) \\tag{1.2b}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\nLet us illustrate via an actual example.\n\nEXAMPLE 1.2 (a) Find \\(v\\) and \\(i\\) in the circuit of Fig. $1.6 a$ if \\(v_{S}=12 \\mathrm{~V}\\), \\(R_{1}=10 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega\\), \\(R_{2}=30 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega\\), and \\(R_{3}=R_{4}=15 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega\\).\n\n(b) Repeat, but with \\(R_{2}\\) lowered from \\(30 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega\\) to \\(2.0 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega\\).\n\n(c) What happens if we reverse the diode's direction in part (a)? In part (b)?\n\nFig. 1.6 (a) shows the circuit of Example 1.2. (b), (c) show subcircuits to find the Thévenin's equivalent of the network surrounding the diode.\n\n#### Solution\n\n(a) Removing the diode yields the subcircuit of Fig. $1.6 b$, where the voltage divider rule gives\n$$\nv_{OC}=\\left(\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}-\\frac{R_{4}}{R_{3}+R_{4}}\\right) v_{S}\n$$\nSubstituting the given component values gives \\(v_{OC}=9-6=3 \\mathrm{~V}\\). Since \\(v_{OC}>0\\), the diode will be on, acting as a short circuit with \\(v=0\\). To find \\(i\\), we need \\(R_{eq}\\). To this end, we suppress the voltage source to obtain the subcircuit of Fig. 1.6c. By inspection,\n$$\nR_{eq}=\\left(R_{1} / / R_{2}\\right)+\\left(R_{3} / / R_{4}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the given component values gives \\(R_{eq}=15 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega\\). Consequently, by Eq. $(1.2 a)$, \\(i=3 / 15=0.2 \\mathrm{~mA}\\). The situation is shown in Fig. $1.7 a$, where the student is encouraged to find all other voltages and currents in the circuit as a check.\n\n(b) With \\(R_{2}\\) lowered to \\(2.0 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega\\) we get \\(v_{OC}=2-6=-4 \\mathrm{~V}\\). Since we now have \\(v_{OC}<0\\), the diode is off, acting as an open circuit with \\(i=0\\). The situation is depicted in Fig. 1.7b.\n\n(c) Reversing the diode direction so that the anode is now at the right and the cathode is at the left will cause the diode to be off in part (a) and on in part (b). Thus, in part (a) the diode current is zero, and the diode voltage is -3 V. In part (b) we get \\(R_{eq}=(10 / / 2)+(15 / / 15)=55 / 6 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega\\), \\(v=0 \\mathrm{~V}\\), and \\(i=4 /(55 / 6)=24 / 55 \\mathrm{~mA}\\), now flowing toward the left.\n\n#### Cut-and-Try Approach\n\nIf the diode is part of a nonlinear circuit, as in the case of multiple-diode circuits, it is generally not possible to perform a Thévenin's reduction of the surrounding circuitry. However, knowing that the diode must be either on or off, we can use intuition to make an educated assumption, and then check that our results are consistent with our assumption, changing the assumption if needed, until we obtain consistent results. A two-diode circuit provides a classic example of the cut-and-try approach.\n\nEXAMPLE 1.3 (a) The circuit of Fig. $1.8 a$ is powered by a dual \\(\\pm 6-\\mathrm{V}\\) dc power supply system, which we show in concise form (that is, without drawing the actual dc voltage sources) in order to reduce cluttering in the circuit diagram. Find the current \\(I_{D}\\) and voltage \\(V_{D}\\) for each diode.\n\n(b) Repeat, but with the resistances interchanged with each other.\n\nFig. 1.8 (a) shows the circuit of Example 1.3. (b) shows the circuit after it has been solved.\n\n#### Solution\n\n(a) Knowing that each diode has to be either in conduction (ON) or cut off (CO), we have four possibilities: \\((D_{1}, D_{2})=(\\mathrm{CO}, \\mathrm{CO}),(\\mathrm{CO}, \\mathrm{ON}),(\\mathrm{ON}, \\mathrm{CO})\\), (ON, ON). However, considering that the \\(+6-\\mathrm{V}\\) source tends to source current to both anodes, and that the \\(-6-\\mathrm{V}\\) source tends to sink current from \\(D_{2}\\)'s cathode, it seems reasonable to assume that both diodes be on, or \\((D_{1}, D_{2})=\\) (ON, ON). Thus, replacing each diode with a short circuit, we end up with the situation of Fig. 1.5b, where the diode voltages are\n$$\nV_{D_{1}}=V_{D_{2}}=0 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\nMoreover, applying first Ohm's law and then KCL we have\n$$\n"

In this diagram, the diode is reverse-biased, meaning it does not conduct current.\n   - **Source:** Represented by a voltage source symbol, providing electrical power.\n   - **Load:** Indicated as a block in the circuit, representing the component that would consume power if current were flowing.\n\n2. **Mechanical Analogy:**\n   - **Tank and Pump:** The tank represents the load, and the pump represents the source of power. The valve analogy is used to show the direction of flow.\n\n**Flow of Information or Control:**\n\n- In the electrical circuit, the current flow is attempted in the reverse direction through the diode, but the diode blocks this flow, resulting in zero current (as indicated by the label \"0\").\n- In the mechanical analogy, the valve is closed, preventing the flow from the tank to the pump, which corresponds to the diode's blocking action in the reverse-biased condition.\n\n**Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n\n- The arrow on the diode symbol in the circuit indicates the direction of conventional current flow, which in this case is blocked.\n- The label \"0\" next to the current arrow in the circuit emphasizes that no current flows when the diode is reverse-biased.\n\n**Overall System Function:**\n\nThe primary function of this diagram is to illustrate the behavior of a diode in reverse operation. In this state, the diode acts as an open circuit, preventing any current flow. The valve analogy helps to conceptualize this by showing the closed valve that stops fluid flow from the tank to the pump, mirroring the diode's function in the electrical circuit. This demonstrates the diode's role as a one-way device, allowing current to flow only in the forward direction when not reverse-biased.\n\nFIGURE 1.2 Valve analogy of a diode: (a) forward operation and (b) reverse operation.\n\nWhen invited to draw current in the direction of its arrowhead ( $i>0$ ), also called the forward ( F ) direction, a diode will eagerly conduct the given current by acting as a short circuit $(v=0)$. In this case the diode is said to be forward biased, or also to be on (ON). However, if we try to force current in the opposite direction, also called the reverse $(\\mathrm{R})$ direction, the diode will stubbornly oppose current flow by acting as an open circuit $(i=0)$. The diode is now said to be reverse biased, or also to be cut off $(\\mathrm{CO})$. When cut off the diode will sustain whatever voltage $(v<0)$ is imposed by the surrounding circuitry.\n\nFigure $1.1 b$ shows the $i-v$ characteristic of the diode, which we express mathematically as\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv=0 & \\text { for } i>0  \\tag{1.1a}\\\\\ni=0 & \\text { for } v<0 \\tag{1.1b}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nAlso shown next to the curves are the diode models (a short circuit and an open circuit) corresponding to the two modes of operation. A device with the characteristic shown is referred to as an ideal diode. As we shall see, practical diodes will only approximate these idealized curves.\n\nA diode can be likened to a water valve according to the analogy of Fig. 1.2. The valve hinges at the top and has a stopper at the bottom. Forcing electric current to a load via a diode is like pumping water to a tank via a pipe equipped with a valve. If pump pressure is applied in the forward direction, the valve will open and allow water to flow as in Fig. 1.2a. However, if pressure is applied in the reverse direction as in Fig. 1.2b, the valve will close and inhibit water flow. To develop a feel for diode operation, let us consider our first circuit example.\n\nEXAMPLE 1.1 (a) In the circuit of Fig. 1.3 let $R_{1}=1 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$ and $R_{2}=2 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$.

After doing so, we end up with the basic situation of Fig. 1.5a, where vOC is the open-circuit voltage that the external circuit would sustain between the nodes corresponding to the anode and the cathode, but with the diode removed. (Note that the polarity of vOC is defined positive at the point of connection to the anode!) Moreover, Req is the external circuit's equivalent resistance as seen by the diode. Shown in Fig. 1.5b and 1.5c is the i-v characteristic of the diode as well as that of the surrounding circuit, the latter being referred to as the load line. As we know from basic circuit theory, the load line is a straight line intercepting the v-axis at v=vOC, and having a slope of -1 / Req. The circuit's operating point lies at the intersection of the diode curve and the load line, where the diode and the surrounding circuit share the same voltage and current. It is apparent that\n- If vOC>0, the operating point (QF) lies on the ON segment, where the diode is forward biased and thus acts as a short circuit to yield\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv=0 \\quad i=\\frac{v_{O C}}{R_{e q}}(>0) \\tag{1.2a}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n- Conversely, if vOC<0, the operating point (QR) lies on the CO segment, where the diode is reverse biased and thus acts as an open circuit to yield\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni=0 \\quad v=v_{O C}(<0) \\tag{1.2b}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\nLet us illustrate via an actual example.\n\nEXAMPLE 1.2 (a) Find v and i in the circuit of Fig. 1.6a if vS=12 V, R1=10 kΩ, R2=30 kΩ, and R3=R4=15 kΩ.\n(b) Repeat, but with R2 lowered from 30 kΩ to 2.0 kΩ.\n(c) What happens if we reverse the diode's direction in part (a)? In part (b)?\n\nImage description for (a):\nThe circuit consists of a voltage source Vs, four resistors (R1, R2, R3, R4), and a diode.

    "text": "Figure 1.10a illustrates a commonly utilized diode circuit, the signal rectification. When the input voltage \\( v_I \\) is positive, the diode conducts, and the output voltage \\( v_O \\) equals \\( v_I \\) (refer to Fig. 1.10b). Conversely, when \\( v_I \\) is negative, the diode is non-conducting, resulting in \\( v_O = 0 \\) V (refer to Fig. 1.10c). Figure 1.11a displays the output \\( v_O \\) in response to a sinusoidal input \\( v_I \\). The circuit transmits only the positive segments of the input waveform to the load \\( R \\), while blocking the negative segments. It's noted that while \\( v_I \\) fluctuates in polarity and averages to zero, \\( v_O \\) is unidirectional and exhibits a non-zero mean, or a non-zero DC component. Hence, the circuit is termed a rectifier. The circuit's functionality can also be depicted through the voltage transfer characteristic (VTC) curve, as shown in Fig. 1.11b. The diode's presence causes a nonlinear VTC. It can be confirmed that reversing the diode's connection in Fig. 1.10a yields a rectifier that allows only the negative segments of the input waveform. As it transmits only half the input wave, the circuit in Fig. 1.10a is known as a half-wave rectifier. In contrast, a full-wave rectifier allows both halves of the input wave, one as is and the other inverted. Also known as an absolute-value circuit, it utilizes the four-diode configuration in Fig. 1.12a, referred to as a diode bridge. To comprehend its operation, consider first when \\( v_I > 0 \\), and then when \\( v_I < 0 \\).\n\nFor \\( v_I > 0 \\), the input source \\( v_I \\) drives current into \\( D_1 \\)'s anode and draws current from \\( D_4 \\)'s cathode, causing both diodes to conduct, as shown in Fig. 1.12b. In this scenario, \\( v_O = v_I \\) (>0). Additionally, \\( D_2 \\) and \\( D_3 \\) are reverse-biased by \\( v_0 \\), as also depicted in Fig. 1.12b. The current path is thus source → \\( D_1 \\) → \\( R \\) → \\( D_4 \\) → source.\n\nFor \\( v_I < 0 \\), the input source \\( v_I \\) pulls current from \\( D_3 \\)'s cathode and supplies current to \\( D_2 \\)'s anode, causing both diodes to conduct, as shown in Fig. 1.12c. Now, \\( v_O = -v_I \\), or \\( v_O > 0 \\) since \\( v_I < 0 \\). Moreover, \\( D_1 \\) and \\( D_4 \\) are now reverse-biased, as also shown in Fig. 1.12c. The current path is now source → \\( D_2 \\) → \\( R \\) → \\( D_3 \\) → source. It's observed that the current through \\( R \\) flows to the right in both instances, affirming the absolute-value function previously mentioned.\n\nFigure 1.13a shows the response \\( v_O \\) to a sinusoidal input \\( v_I \\), while Fig. 1.13b shows the VTC, succinctly expressed as\n\\[ v_O = |v_I| \\]\n\nRectifier circuits find application in power electronics, communications, and instrumentation.\n\nExample 1.4 (a) In Fig. 1.14 is depicted a straightforward, albeit not very efficient, circuit for charging a 12-V car battery. Assuming \\( v_S \\) is an AC source with a 24-V peak amplitude obtained from household AC power via a step-down transformer, sketch and label \\( v_S \\) as well as the battery current \\( i \\).\n\n(b) Determine the fraction of each AC cycle during which the battery receives current.\n\n#### Solution\n\n(a) It's evident that as long as \\( |v_S| \\leq 12 \\) V, all diodes are non-conducting, and \\( i = 0 \\). However, as soon as \\( v_S \\) exceeds 12 V, \\( D_1 \\) and \\( D_4 \\) turn on, thereby establishing the current path\n\\[ \\text{source} \\rightarrow R \\rightarrow D_1 \\rightarrow \\text{battery} \\rightarrow D_4 \\rightarrow \\text{source} \\]\nConversely, when \\( v_S \\) falls below -12 V, \\( D_2 \\) and \\( D_3 \\) turn on, thereby establishing the current path\n\\[ \\text{source} \\rightarrow D_2 \\rightarrow \\text{battery} \\rightarrow D_3 \\rightarrow R \\rightarrow \\text{source} \\]\n\nIn either case, we have\n\\[ i = 0 \\quad \\text{for} \\quad |v_S| \\leq 12 \\text{ V} \\quad i = \\frac{v_S - 12 \\text{ V}}{R} \\quad \\text{for} \\quad |v_S| > 12 \\text{ V} \\]\nThe peak value of the current is \\( (24 - 12) / 12 = 1 \\) A. The waveforms are shown in Fig. 1.14b.\n\n(b) During the first cycle, \\( i \\) starts flowing into the battery at the instant \\( t_1 \\) such that\n\\[ 24 \\sin \\frac{2 \\pi t_1}{T} = 12 \\]\nor \\( t_1 = T / 12 \\), and stops conducting at \\( t_2 = T / 2 - T / 12 \\). Thus, the conduction interval is \\( T_{\\text{ON}} = t_2 - t_1 = T / 3 \\), or \\( T_{\\text{ON}} = (2 / 3)(T / 2) \\), where \\( T / 2 \\) is the period of the current waveform. In summary, the battery receives current during \\( 2 / 3 \\) of the time."

    "text": "The original text:\n```\nFigure $1.10 a$ depicts one of the most popular diode applications, namely, signal rectification. During the positive alternations of $v_{I}$ the diode is on and the circuit gives $v_{O}=v_{I}$ (see Fig. 1.10b). During the negative alternations of $v_{I}$ the diode is cut off, and the circuit gives $v_{O}=0 \\mathrm{~V}$ (see Fig. 1.10c). Figure 1.11a shows the response $v_{O}$ to a sinusoidal input $v_{I}$. We say that the circuit passes on to the load $R$ only the positive portions of the input waveform, while the negative portions are inhibited. We observe that while $v_{I}$ alternates in polarity and averages out to zero, $v_{O}$ is unipolar and thus exhibits a nonzero average, or a nonzero dc component. For this reason the circuit is referred to as rectifier. Its behavior can be visualized also via the voltage\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:\n[\nname: V_I, type: VoltageSource, value: V_I, ports: {Np: V_I, Nn: GND}\nname: D1, type: Diode, ports: {Na: V_I, Nc: X1}\nname: R, type: Resistor, value: R, ports: {N1: X1, N2: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit is a half-wave rectifier.

This curve, expressed mathematically as\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\nv_{O}=v_{I} & \\text { for } v_{I}>0 \\\\\nv_{O}=0 & \\text { for } v_{I}<0 \\tag{1.3b}\n\\end{array}\n$$\nis shown in Fig. 1.11b. Needless to say, the presence of the diode results in a nonlinear VTC. The student can easily verify that reversing the diode interconnection in Fig. 1.10a results in a rectifier that passes only the negative portions of the input waveform.\nSince it passes only half the input wave, the circuit of Fig. 1.10a is called a halfwave rectifier. By contrast, a full-wave rectifier passes both halves of the input wave, one unchanged and the other inverted. Also called absolute-value circuit, it is implemented using the four-diode arrangement of Fig. 1.12a, known as a diode bridge. To understand its operation, consider first the case $v_{I}>0$, then the case $v_{I}<0$.\n- For $v_{I}>0$ we expect the input source $v_{I}$ to source current to $D_{1}$ 's anode and to sink current from $D_{4}$ 's cathode, causing both diodes to be on, as depicted in Fig. 1.12b. Under these circumstances we have $v_{O}=v_{I}(>0)$. Moreover, we note that both $D_{2}$ and $D_{3}$ are reverse biased by the amount $v_{0}$, as also shown in Fig. 1.12b. The current loop is thus source $\\rightarrow D_{1} \\rightarrow R \\rightarrow D_{4} \\rightarrow$ source.\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:\n[\nname: VI, type: VoltageSource, value: VI, ports: {Np: VI, Nn: GND}\nname: D1, type: Diode, ports: {Na: VI, Nc: X1}\nname: D2, type: Diode, ports: {Na: GND, Nc: X1}\nname: D3, type: Diode, ports: {Na: X2, Nc: VI}\nname: D4, type: Diode, ports: {Na: X2, Nc: GND}\nname: R, type: Resistor, value: R, ports: {N1: X1, N2: X2}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit is a full-wave rectifier with diodes D1 and D4 conducting when vI > 0, and diodes D2 and D3 conducting when vI < 0.

The graph is a piecewise linear plot showing the relationship between the input voltage \\(v_I\\) on the horizontal axis and the output voltage \\(v_O\\) on the vertical axis.\n1. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n- The horizontal axis represents the input voltage \\(v_I\\) and is marked with a zero point, extending in both the negative and positive directions.\n- The vertical axis represents the output voltage \\(v_O\\), also marked with a zero point.\n- The scales are linear, and there are no specific units marked, but it is implied to be volts for both axes.\n2. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- The plot is symmetric about the origin, forming a 'V' shape.\n- For positive values of \\(v_I\\), the slope of the line is \\(+1\\) V/V, indicating that the output voltage \\(v_O\\) equals the input voltage \\(v_I\\).\n- For negative values of \\(v_I\\), the slope of the line is \\(-1\\) V/V, indicating that the output voltage \\(v_O\\) is the negative of the input voltage \\(v_I\\).\n- This behavior reflects the operation of a full-wave rectifier, where negative input voltages are inverted to positive output voltages.\n3. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The graph intersects at the origin (0,0), which is a key point where both input and output voltages are zero.\n- The slopes of \\(+1\\) V/V and \\(-1\\) V/V on either side of the origin are significant, highlighting the rectification process.\n4. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- The graph is annotated with the slopes \\(+1\\) V/V and \\(-1\\) V/V, emphasizing the linear relationship in each region.\nOverall, this VTC graph clearly illustrates the function of a full-wave rectifier, showing how input voltages are transformed into output voltages by inverting negative inputs to positive outputs, while maintaining the magnitude of positive inputs.\nFIGURE 1.13 Illustrating full-wave rectification via (a) the input/output waveforms and (b) the VTC.\n- For $v_{I}<0$ we expect the input source $v_{I}$ to sink current from $D_{3}$ 's cathode and to source current to $D_{2}$ 's anode, causing both diodes to be on, as depicted in Fig. 1.12c.

The current loop is now source $\\rightarrow$ $D_{2} \\rightarrow R \\rightarrow D_{3} \\rightarrow$ source. We observe that the current through $R$ flows toward the right in both cases, confirming the absolute-value function mentioned earlier.\nFigure $1.13 a$ shows the response $v_{O}$ to a sinusoidal input $v_{I}$, while Fig. $1.13 b$ shows the VTC, which we express concisely as\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{O}=\\left|v_{I}\\right| \\tag{1.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\nRectifier circuits find application in power electronics, communications, and instrumentation.\nEXAMPLE 1.4 (a) Shown in Fig. 1.14 is a simple-if not overly efficient—circuit for charging a $12-\\mathrm{V}$ car battery.

    "text": "Figure 1.10(a) illustrates a common diode application, signal rectification. When $v_{I}$ is positive, the diode conducts, and the circuit outputs $v_{O}=v_{I}$ (refer to Fig. 1.10b). When $v_{I}$ is negative, the diode blocks, resulting in $v_{O}=0$ V (refer to Fig. 1.10c). Figure 1.11a displays the response $v_{O}$ to a sinusoidal input $v_{I}$. The circuit only passes the positive segments of the input waveform to the load $R$, while blocking the negative segments. We note that while $v_{I}$ alternates and averages to zero, $v_{O}$ is unipolar and exhibits a nonzero average, or a nonzero DC component. Hence, the circuit is termed a rectifier. The rectifier's behavior can also be depicted via a voltage transfer curve (VTC), representing the plot of $v_{O}$ versus $v_{I}$, as shown in Fig. 1.11b. It is clear that the presence of the diode creates a nonlinear VTC. Reversing the diode connection in Fig. 1.10a yields a rectifier that passes only the negative segments of the input waveform. Since it passes only half the input wave, the circuit in Fig. 1.10a is called a half-wave rectifier. In contrast, a full-wave rectifier passes both halves of the input wave, one unchanged and the other inverted. Also known as an absolute-value circuit, it is implemented using the four-diode arrangement in Fig. 1.12a, known as a diode bridge. To understand its operation, consider the cases when $v_{I}>0$ and $v_{I}<0$.\n\nFor $v_{I}>0$, the input source $v_{I}$ supplies current to $D_{1}$'s anode and sinks current from $D_{4}$'s cathode, causing both diodes to conduct, as shown in Fig. 1.12b. In this case, we have $v_{O}=v_{I}$. Additionally, both $D_{2}$ and $D_{3}$ are reverse-biased by $v_{0}$, as shown in Fig. 1.12b. The current loop is thus source $\\rightarrow D_{1} \\rightarrow R \\rightarrow D_{4} \\rightarrow$ source.\n\nFor $v_{I}<0$, the input source $v_{I}$ sinks current from $D_{3}$'s cathode and supplies current to $D_{2}$'s anode, causing both diodes to conduct, as depicted in Fig. 1.12c. Now, we have $v_{O}=-v_{I}$, or $v_{O}>0$ because $v_{I}<0$. Moreover, both $D_{1}$ and $D_{4}$ are now reverse-biased, as also shown in Fig. 1.12c. The current loop is now source $\\rightarrow D_{2} \\rightarrow R \\rightarrow D_{3} \\rightarrow$ source. We observe that the current through $R$ flows in the same direction in both cases, confirming the absolute-value function mentioned earlier.\n\nFigure 1.13(a) shows the response $v_{O}$ to a sinusoidal input $v_{I}$, while Fig. 1.13(b) shows the VTC, which we express concisely as:\n$$\nv_{O}=\\left|v_{I}\\right|\n$$\nRectifier circuits find application in power electronics, communications, and instrumentation.\n\nExample 1.4 (a) Shown in Fig. 1.14 is a simple, albeit not overly efficient, circuit for charging a $12-\\mathrm{V}$ car battery.

The waveforms are shown in Fig. 1.14b.\n\n(b) During the first cycle, $i$ starts flowing into the battery at the instant $t_{1}$ such that:\n$$\n24 \\sin \\frac{2 \\pi t_{1}}{T}=12\n$$\nor $t_{1}=T / 12$, and stops conducting at $t_{2}=T / 2-T / 12$. Consequently, the conduction interval is $T_{\\mathrm{ON}}=t_{2}-t_{1}=T / 3$, or $T_{\\mathrm{ON}}=(2 / 3)(T / 2)$, where $T / 2$ is the period of the current waveform.

The current path becomes source → \\( D_1 \\) → \\( R \\) → \\( D_4 \\) → source. \n\nFor \\( v_I < 0 \\), the input source withdraws current from the cathode of \\( D_3 \\) and provides current to the anode of \\( D_2 \\), engaging both diodes (Fig. 1.12c). Thus, \\( v_O = -v_I \\) (>0) because \\( v_I < 0 \\). In this case, \\( D_1 \\) and \\( D_4 \\) are reverse-biased (Fig. 1.12c). The current flow is source → \\( D_2 \\) → \\( R \\) → \\( D_3 \\) → source. Observe that the current through \\( R \\) moves to the right in both instances, affirming the circuit's absolute-value functionality.\n\nFigure 1.13a exhibits the output \\( v_O \\) in response to a sinusoidal input \\( v_I \\), while Fig. 1.13b displays the VTC, succinctly represented by:\n\n\\[\nv_O = |v_I|\n\\]\n\nRectifier circuits are employed in power electronics, telecommunications, and instrumentation. \n\nExample 1.4 (a) Figure 1.14 depicts a rudimentary, albeit not highly efficient, circuit for charging a 12-V car battery. Assuming \\( v_S \\) is an AC source with a peak amplitude of 24 V, obtained from household AC power via a step-down transformer, sketch and label \\( v_S \\) as well as the battery current \\( i \\). (b) Determine the fraction of each AC cycle during which the battery receives current.\n\n#### Solution\n\n(a) Evidently, when \\( |v_S| \\leq 12 \\) V, all diodes are non-conducting, and \\( i = 0 \\). However, as soon as \\( v_S \\) surpasses 12 V, \\( D_1 \\) and \\( D_4 \\) turn on, establishing the current path:\n\nsource → \\( R \\) → \\( D_1 \\) → battery → \\( D_4 \\) → source\n\nConversely, when \\( v_S \\) falls below -12 V, \\( D_2 \\) and \\( D_3 \\) turn on, establishing the current path:\n\nsource → \\( D_2 \\) → battery → \\( D_3 \\) → \\( R \\) → source\n\n(b) During the first cycle, \\( i \\) commences flowing into the battery at \\( t_1 \\) such that:\n\n\\( 24 \\sin \\frac{2 \\pi t_1}{T} = 12 \\)\n\nor \\( t_1 = \\frac{T}{12} \\), and ceases at \\( t_2 = \\frac{T}{2} - \\frac{T}{12} \\).

In essence, the battery receives current for \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) of the cycle duration."

    "text": "The depicted Figure 1.10a represents a common diode application known as signal rectification. When the input voltage \\( v_I \\) is positive, the diode conducts, allowing the circuit to output \\( v_O = v_I \\) as shown in Figure 1.10b. Conversely, when \\( v_I \\) is negative, the diode is non-conducting, resulting in an output of \\( v_O = 0 \\) V, as depicted in Figure 1.10c. Figure 1.11a illustrates the output response \\( v_O \\) to a sinusoidal input \\( v_I \\). The circuit is designed to pass only the positive segments of the input waveform to the load \\( R \\), while blocking the negative segments. Notably, while \\( v_I \\) fluctuates in polarity and averages to zero, \\( v_O \\) remains unipolar, exhibiting a nonzero average or a nonzero DC component. This characteristic earns the circuit its name as a rectifier. The rectifier's behavior can also be visualized through its voltage transfer characteristic (VTC) curve, as shown in Figure 1.11b. This curve is mathematically expressed as \\( v_O = v_I \\) for \\( v_I > 0 \\) and \\( v_O = 0 \\) for \\( v_I < 0 \\). The inclusion of the diode results in a nonlinear VTC. Reversing the diode's connection in Figure 1.10a would yield a rectifier that only passes the negative segments of the input waveform. As it only allows half of the input wave to pass, the circuit in Figure 1.10a is referred to as a half-wave rectifier. In contrast, a full-wave rectifier processes both halves of the input wave, one unchanged and the other inverted. Also known as an absolute-value circuit, it is constructed using the four-diode configuration shown in Figure 1.12a, which is known as a diode bridge. To comprehend its operation, consider the scenarios where \\( v_I > 0 \\) and \\( v_I < 0 \\). For \\( v_I > 0 \\), the input source \\( v_I \\) supplies current to the anode of \\( D_1 \\) and draws current from the cathode of \\( D_4 \\), causing both diodes to conduct, as illustrated in Figure 1.12b. In this case, \\( v_O = v_I \\) (>0). Additionally, both \\( D_2 \\) and \\( D_3 \\) are reverse-biased by \\( v_0 \\), as depicted in Figure 1.12b. The current path is thus source → \\( D_1 \\) → \\( R \\) → \\( D_4 \\) → source. For \\( v_I < 0 \\), the input source \\( v_I \\) extracts current from the cathode of \\( D_3 \\) and provides current to the anode of \\( D_2 \\), causing both diodes to conduct, as shown in Figure 1.12c. Now, \\( v_O = -v_I \\), or \\( v_O > 0 \\) since \\( v_I < 0 \\). Moreover, \\( D_1 \\) and \\( D_4 \\) are now reverse-biased, as also illustrated in Figure 1.12c. The current path is now source → \\( D_2 \\) → \\( R \\) → \\( D_3 \\) → source. It is observed that the current through \\( R \\) flows to the right in both instances, confirming the absolute-value function previously mentioned. Figure 1.13a displays the output response \\( v_O \\) to a sinusoidal input \\( v_I \\), while Figure 1.13b presents the VTC, succinctly expressed as \\( v_O = |v_I| \\). Rectifier circuits are employed in various fields such as power electronics, communications, and instrumentation. Example 1.4 (a) presents a straightforward, albeit not very efficient, circuit for charging a 12-V car battery. Assuming \\( v_S \\) is an AC source with a 24-V peak amplitude derived from household AC power via a step-down transformer, the task is to sketch and label \\( v_S \\) as well as the battery current \\( i \\). (b) Determine the portion of each AC cycle during which the battery receives current. Solution (a) reveals that as long as \\( |v_S| \\leq 12 \\) V, all diodes are non-conducting and \\( i = 0 \\). However, once \\( v_S \\) surpasses 12 V, \\( D_1 \\) and \\( D_4 \\) turn on, establishing the current path source → \\( R \\) → \\( D_1 \\) → battery → \\( D_4 \\) → source. Conversely, when \\( v_S \\) falls below -12 V, \\( D_2 \\) and \\( D_3 \\) turn on, establishing the current path source → \\( D_2 \\) → battery → \\( D_3 \\) → \\( R \\) → source. In either case, the current through the battery is zero for \\( |v_S| \\leq 12 \\) V and follows \\( i = (v_S - 12 \\) V)/\\( R \\) for \\( |v_S| > 12 \\) V. The peak current value is (24 - 12)/12 = 1 A. The waveforms are depicted in Figure 1.14b. Solution (b) reveals that during the first cycle, \\( i \\) starts flowing into the battery at the instant \\( t_1 \\) such that 24 sin(2π\\( t_1 \\)/\\( T \\)) = 12, or \\( t_1 = T/12 \\), and ceases conducting at \\( t_2 = T/2 - T/12 \\). Thus, the conduction interval is \\( T_{ON} = t_2 - t_1 = T/3 \\), or \\( T_{ON} = (2/3)(T/2) \\), where \\( T/2 \\) is the period of the current waveform. In summary, the battery receives current for \\( 2/3 \\) of the time."

    "text": "Figures $1.15 a$ and $1.16 a$ illustrate how diodes can be utilized to execute basic logic functions that form the foundation of digital systems. The inputs $A$ and $B$, along with the output $Y$, are binary-valued voltages that can either be low $(L)$, such as 0 V, or high $(H)$, such as the power-supply voltage $V_{S}$ (commonly 5 V). Understanding the circuit behavior is best achieved by analyzing the rows of the accompanying tables one by one.\n\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:Figure 1.15 (a) presents a system block diagram of a diode-based logic gate circuit that executes the OR function. The main components of this circuit are two diodes, designated as \\(D_A\\) and \\(D_B\\), and a resistor \\(R\\) connected to ground. The circuit inputs are labeled \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), with the output designated as \\(Y\\).\nMain Components:\n1. **Diodes (\\(D_A\\) and \\(D_B\\))**: These are crucial for determining the logic operation. Each diode is linked to one of the inputs (\\(A\\) or \\(B\\)), allowing current to flow when the input is high.\n2. **Resistor (\\(R\\))**: This is situated between the output \\(Y\\) and ground, assisting in pulling the output to a low state when both inputs are low.\nFlow of Information or Control:\n- The inputs \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are binary voltages, either high (\\(H\\)) or low (\\(L\\)).\n- The diodes \\(D_A\\) and \\(D_B\\) are oriented such that if either \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) is high, the corresponding diode conducts, enabling current to flow to the output \\(Y\\), thereby pulling it high.\n- If both inputs \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are low, neither diode conducts, and the resistor \\(R\\) pulls the output \\(Y\\) low.\nLabels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:\n- The diodes are marked \\(D_A\\) and \\(D_B\\), indicating their connection to inputs \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), respectively.\n- The output \\(Y\\) represents the result of the OR operation, being high if at least one input is high.\nOverall System Function:\nThe main function of this system is to perform a logical OR operation on the binary inputs \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). The configuration of the diodes and the resistor ensures that the output \\(Y\\) is high if either or both inputs are high, and low only when both inputs are low. This is confirmed by the accompanying truth table, which demonstrates that the circuit operates as an OR gate.\n| $A$ | $B$ | $D_{A}$ | $D_{B}$ | $Y$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $L$ | $L$ | CO | CO | $L$ |\n| $L$ | $H$ | CO | ON | $H$ |\n| $H$ | $L$ | ON | CO | $H$ |\n| $H$ | $H$ | ON | ON | $H$ |\n(b)\nFIGURE 1.15 (a) Diode circuit implementing the OR function, and (b) its truth table.\nimage_name:Figure 1.15 (a)\ndescription:\n[\nname: DA, type: Diode, ports: {Na: Y, Nc: A}\nname: DB, type: Diode, ports: {Na: Y, Nc: B}\nname: R, type: Resistor, value: R, ports: {N1: Y, N2: VS}\nname: VS, type: VoltageSource, value: VS, ports: {Np: VS, Nn: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit realizes an OR gate using diodes DA and DB, a resistor R, and a voltage source VS. The output Y is high if either input A or B is high.\nimage_name:Figure 1.16 (a)\ndescription:Figure 1.16 (a) depicts a system block diagram of a diode-based circuit that performs the AND logic function. The primary components of this circuit include two diodes, labeled as $D_A$ and $D_B$, a resistor $R$, and a voltage source $V_S$. The circuit is connected to two inputs, $A$ and $B$, and generates an output $Y$.\nMain Components:\n1. **Diodes ($D_A$ and $D_B$):**\n- These are the key elements for executing the AND logic operation, allowing current to pass only when forward-biased.\n2. **Resistor ($R$):**\n- Connected between the voltage source $V_S$ and the node where the diodes intersect, it helps limit the current flow through the circuit.\n3. **Voltage Source ($V_S$):**\n- Supplies the necessary voltage for the circuit's operation.\nFlow of Information or Control:\n- **Input Signals ($A$ and $B$):**\n- These signals are applied to the anodes of diodes $D_A$ and $D_B$, respectively.\n- If both inputs $A$ and $B$ are high, both diodes become forward-biased, allowing current to flow from $V_S$ through the resistor $R$ to the output $Y$.\n- If either input is low, the corresponding diode remains reverse-biased, preventing current flow and resulting in a low output $Y$.\n- **Output Signal ($Y$):**\n- The output is high only when both input signals are high, consistent with the behavior of an AND gate.\nLabels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:\n- The diagram includes labels for each component and signal path, clearly identifying the inputs ($A$, $B$) and the output ($Y$).\nOverall System Function:\n- This diode circuit acts as an AND gate. The arrangement ensures that the output $Y$ is high only when both inputs $A$ and $B$ are high, effectively performing the logical AND operation. The resistor $R$ and voltage source $V_S$ maintain proper current and voltage levels for the diodes and the overall circuit operation.\n(a)\n| $A$ | $B$ | $D_{A}$ | $D_{B}$ | $Y$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $L$ | $L$ | ON | ON | $L$ |\n| $L$ | $H$ | ON | CO | $L$ |\n| $H$ | $L$ | CO | ON | $L$ |\n| $H$ | $H$ | CO | CO | $H$ |\n(b)\nFIGURE 1.16 (a) Diode circuit implementing the AND function, and (b) its truth table.\n- In Figure 1.15a, as long as both inputs $A$ and $B$ are low $(0 \\mathrm{~V})$, both diodes are off, resulting in zero voltages and currents, and thus $Y$ is low. However, if at least one input is driven high (5 V), current is sourced to the anode of the corresponding diode, turning it on and pulling $Y$ high, as shown in Figure 1.15b. This logic function, termed the OR function, is represented by the logic-gate symbol adjacent to the circuit in Figure 1.15a. The table in Figure 1.15b summarizes its behavior and is known as the truth table.\n- In Figure 1.16a, as long as at least one input is low $(0 \\mathrm{~V})$, the corresponding diode will be on due to current sinking from its cathode, keeping $Y$ low. Only when both $A$ and $B$ are high will both diodes be cut off, causing the current through $R$ to drop to zero. With no current, the voltage drop across $R$ is zero, and $R$ pulls $Y$ to $V_{S}$, or high, as depicted in Figure 1.16b. This logic function, known as the AND function, is indicated by the logic-gate symbol next to the circuit in Figure 1.16a. The table in Figure 1.16b summarizes its behavior and is termed the truth table.\nEach gate can be easily expanded to accommodate more than two inputs by adding extra diodes as needed. While these gates are certainly useful, they are insufficient for constructing a complete digital system, as additional functions like inversion are required. This necessitates the use of a transistor, which will be explored in the following two chapters."

    "text": "The directional switching behavior of a diode can be utilized to set predefined voltage limits within a circuit. This is particularly relevant for the inputs of integrated circuits (ICs), which must adhere to the voltage limits specified in their data sheets to avoid malfunction or permanent damage. Typically, the input voltages to an IC should never surpass its power-supply voltages.\n\nFigure 1.17a exemplifies this scenario for a single-supply IC, such as a CMOS digital circuit or a single-supply operational amplifier. However, this principle can be easily extended to multiple-supply systems, like dual-supply operational amplifiers. Referring to Fig. $1.17a$, it is evident that when the external input $v_{I}$ is within the range $0 \\leq v_{I} \\leq V_{S}$, both diodes remain off, resulting in the signal at the IC's input pin being $v_{I C} \\cong v_{I}$.\n\n**Image Description (a):**\n- **Components:**\n  - **R:** Resistor, value: R, connected between nodes N1 (vI) and N2 (vIC).\n  - **D1:** Diode, connected between nodes Na (vIC) and Nc (VS).\n  - **D2:** Diode, connected between nodes Na (GND) and Nc (vIC).\n  - **IC:** Operational Amplifier, connected with InP at vIC, InN at GND, and OutP at vO.\n  - **VS:** Voltage Source, value: VS, connected between nodes Np (VS) and Nn (GND).\n\n**Additional Information:**\nThe circuit diagram illustrates a single-supply IC with diode clamps to restrict the input voltage range. Diode D1 limits the input voltage to the supply voltage VS, while D2 limits it to ground, ensuring the IC's input voltage remains within safe limits, thereby protecting the IC from overvoltage.\n\n**Image Description (b):**\nThe graph in Figure 1.17(b) is a time-domain waveform plot, depicting the behavior of the input voltage $v_I$ and the clamped voltage $v_{IC}$ over time, showcasing the effect of diode clamps in a single-supply IC circuit.\n1. **Graph Type and Function:**\n   - This is a time-domain waveform graph.\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n   - The x-axis represents time $t$, typically measured in seconds or milliseconds, though specific units are not indicated in the diagram.\n   - The y-axis represents voltage, labeled with values $0$ and $V_S$ (supply voltage), indicating voltage levels in volts.\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n   - The input voltage $v_I$ is depicted as a sinusoidal waveform oscillating above and below the supply voltage $V_S$ and ground (0 volts).\n   - The clamped voltage $v_{IC}$ follows $v_I$ as long as $v_I$ is between 0 and $V_S$. When $v_I$ exceeds $V_S$, $v_{IC}$ is clamped at $V_S$; similarly, when $v_I$ drops below 0, $v_{IC}$ is clamped at 0 volts.\n   - This results in a clipped waveform for $v_{IC}$, with flat tops and bottoms due to the clamping action.\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n   - The waveform for $v_I$ shows a typical sinusoidal shape with peaks above $V_S$ and valleys below 0.\n   - The waveform for $v_{IC}$ demonstrates clamping at $V_S$ and 0 volts, indicating the action of diodes $D_1$ and $D_2$.\n   - The transition points where $v_I$ exceeds $V_S$ or drops below 0 correspond to the activation of the diodes, where $D_1$ and $D_2$ conduct to keep $v_{IC}$ within the supply range.\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n   - The graph includes annotations for $v_I$ and $v_{IC}$, highlighting the difference between the input and clamped voltages.\n   - Horizontal lines at $V_S$ and 0 volts emphasize the clamping levels enforced by the diodes.\n\nThis graph effectively demonstrates how diode clamps keep the IC input voltage within the safe operating range, preventing it from exceeding the supply voltage limits.\n\n**FIGURE 1.17 (a) Using diode clamps to limit the input voltage range of an IC. (b) Waveforms.**\n\n(assuming the IC draws negligible input current, which is true for CMOS logic circuits and op amps.) If $v_{I}$ surpasses the supply voltage $V_{S}$, either due to user error or interference noise on $v_{I}$, $D_{1}$ will conduct, creating a short between $v_{I C}$ and $V_{S}$. We say that $D_{1}$ clamps $v_{I C}$ at $V_{S}$. Similarly, if $v_{I}$ falls below ground potential, $D_{2}$ will clamp $v_{I C}$ at 0 V. As shown in Fig. $1.17b$, the diodes protect the IC from potential input overdrive by limiting the input-pin voltage to the range\n$$\n0 \\leq v_{I C} \\leq V_{S}\n$$\nThus, a diode clamp is also known as a limiter, and since it clips the input waveform portions outside the allowed range, it is also called a clipper.\n\nThe necessity for protection against input overdrives is so critical and common that many ICs are equipped with internal diode-clamping networks, alleviating this concern for the user. In this context, MOSFETs are particularly sensitive to input overvoltages when handled by humans. Since the gate terminal is the plate of a very small capacitor, any electrostatic charge on the user's body can transfer to this capacitor during contact, potentially leading to high voltages (as per $V=Q / C$) that can destroy the dielectric. However, with appropriate diode clamps, the user's body discharges through one of the diodes, preventing device destruction.\n\n#### Exercise 1.2\nIn the circuit of Fig. 1.17, with $R=10 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$ and $V_{S}=5 \\mathrm{~V}$, assuming the IC draws no current at its input terminal, determine the current through $R$ (magnitude and direction) for the following $v_{I}$ values: (a) 1 V, (b) 8 V, (c) -2 V, (d) 4.5 V.

Referring to Fig. $1.17a$, it is evident that when the external input $v_{I}$ is within the range $0 \\leq v_{I} \\leq V_{S}$, both diodes are off, making the signal at the IC's input pin $v_{I C} \\cong v_{I}$.\n\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:\n[\nname: R, type: Resistor, value: R, ports: {N1: vI, N2: vIC}\nname: D1, type: Diode, ports: {Na: vIC, Nc: VS}\nname: D2, type: Diode, ports: {Na: GND, Nc: vIC}\nname: IC, type: OpAmp, value: IC, ports: {InP: vIC, InN: GND, OutP: vO}\nname: VS, type: VoltageSource, value: VS, ports: {Np: VS, Nn: GND}\n]\nextrainfo: The circuit diagram shows a single-supply IC with diode clamps to limit the input voltage range. Diode D1 clamps the input voltage to the supply voltage VS, and D2 clamps it to ground. This ensures the IC's input voltage stays within safe limits, protecting it from overvoltage.\n\nimage_name:(b)\ndescription: The graph in Figure 1.17(b) is a time-domain waveform plot. It shows the behavior of the input voltage $v_I$ and the clamped voltage $v_{IC}$ over time, illustrating the effect of diode clamps in a single-supply IC circuit.\n1. **Type of Graph and Function:**\n- This is a time-domain waveform graph.\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n- The x-axis represents time $t$, typically in seconds or milliseconds, though units are not specified in the diagram.\n- The y-axis represents voltage, labeled with values $0$ and $V_S$ (the supply voltage), indicating voltage levels in volts.\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- The input voltage $v_I$ oscillates sinusoidally above and below the supply voltage $V_S$ and ground (0 volts).\n- The clamped voltage $v_{IC}$ follows $v_I$ when $v_I$ is between 0 and $V_S$. If $v_I$ exceeds $V_S$, $v_{IC}$ is clamped at $V_S$; if $v_I$ falls below 0, $v_{IC}$ is clamped at 0 volts.\n- This results in a clipped waveform for $v_{IC}$, with flat tops and bottoms due to the clamping action.\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The $v_I$ waveform shows a typical sinusoidal shape with peaks above $V_S$ and valleys below 0.\n- The $v_{IC}$ waveform shows clamping at $V_S$ and 0 volts, indicating the action of diodes $D_1$ and $D_2$.\n- Transition points where $v_I$ exceeds $V_S$ or drops below 0 correspond to the diodes' activation, keeping $v_{IC}$ within the supply range.\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- Annotations for $v_I$ and $v_{IC}$ highlight the difference between input and clamped voltages.\n- Horizontal lines at $V_S$ and 0 volts emphasize the clamping levels set by the diodes.\nThis graph effectively shows how diode clamps keep the IC input voltage within safe operating limits, preventing it from exceeding supply voltage constraints.\n\nFIGURE 1.17 (a) Using diode clamps to limit the input voltage range of an IC.\n(b) Waveforms.\n(assuming the IC draws negligible input current, which is true for CMOS logic circuits and op amps.) If $v_{I}$ exceeds the supply voltage $V_{S}$, due to user error or interference noise, $D_{1}$ will activate, creating a short between $v_{I C}$ and $V_{S}$. We say $D_{1}$ clamps $v_{I C}$ at $V_{S}$. Similarly, if $v_{I}$ falls below ground potential, $D_{2}$ will clamp $v_{I C}$ at 0 V. As shown in Fig. $1.17b$, the diodes protect the IC from input overdrive by keeping the input-pin voltage within the range\n$$\n0 \\leq v_{I C} \\leq V_{S}\n$$\nFor this reason, a diode clamp is also known as a limiter, and since it clips input waveform portions outside the allowed range, it is also called a clipper.\n\nThe necessity for protection against input overdrives is critical and common, leading many ICs to include internal diode-clamping networks, easing user concerns. Notably, MOSFETs are highly sensitive to input overvoltages due to their tiny gate capacitor. Any electrostatic charge from the user can transfer to this capacitor, causing potentially destructive high voltages (as per $V=Q / C$). However, with appropriate diode clamps, the user's body discharges through a diode, preventing device destruction.\n\n#### Exercise 1.2\nIn the circuit of Fig. 1.17, with $R=10 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$ and $V_{S}=5 \\mathrm{~V}$, and assuming the IC draws no input current, determine the current through $R$ (magnitude and direction) for $v_{I}$ values of: (a) 1 V, (b) 8 V, (c) -2 V, (d) 4.5 V. (e) If $R$ draws 0.25 mA to the right, what can you infer about $v_{I}$? (f) If $R$ draws 0.5 mA to the left? (g) If the current through $R$ is zero?\nAns. (a) 0 mA; (b) $0.3 \\mathrm{~mA}(\\rightarrow)$; (c) $0.2 \\mathrm{~mA}(\\leftarrow)$; (d) 0 mA; (e) $v_{I}=7.5 \\mathrm{~V}$; (f) $v_{I}=-5 \\mathrm{~V}$; (g) $0 \\leq v_{I} \\leq 5 \\mathrm{~V}$."

This implies that by connecting the output of this clamped capacitor circuit to a peak detector, we can generate a dc voltage of $+2 V_{m}$, effectively twice the input amplitude! To delve deeper into the behavior of this composite circuit, we employ PSpice simulations. Known as a voltage doubler, the circuit is illustrated in Fig. 1.23 for a 1-kHz, 10-V sinusoidal input. The setup incorporates pseudo-ideal diodes, whose PSpice models are derived by modifying an existing diode model in PSpice's library and setting the parameters $I_{s}$ and $n$ to the specified values in the table (further details in Appendix 1A).\nThe diverse waveforms are presented in Fig. 1.24, where it is evident that following a transient phase of fewer than ten cycles, the output stabilizes at the dc value\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{2} \\rightarrow 2 V_{m} \\tag{1.7}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\nor $v_{2}=20 \\mathrm{~V}$ in this instance. The reason for the multiple cycles to reach steady state is the loading effect of $C_{2}$ on $C_{1}$. If $C_{1}$ were significantly larger than $C_{2}$, steady state would be achieved by the second positive peak of $v_{I}$. However, with equal capacitors, which is the typical configuration, the charge积累 by $C_{1}$ at each positive peak of $v_{I}$ is equally redistributed between $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$, causing a decrease in $v_{1}$ that is significant at the first peak but diminishes with subsequent peaks. It can be demonstrated (see Exercise 1.3) that the values reached by $v_{2}$ at each peak of $v_{I}$ are $5 \\mathrm{~V}, 12.5 \\mathrm{~V}, 16.25 \\mathrm{~V}, 18.125 \\mathrm{~V}$, and so on.\nimage_name:FIGURE 1.23\ndescription:\n[\nname: vI, type: VoltageSource, value: 10 Vac, ports: {Np: vI, Nn: 0}\nname: C1, type: Capacitor, value: 1 nF, ports: {Np: vI, Nn: v1}\nname: D1, type: Diode, ports: {Na: 0, Nc: v1}\nname: D2, type: Diode, ports: {Na: v1, Nc: v2}\nname: C2, type: Capacitor, value: 1 nF, ports: {Np: v2, Nn: 0}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit is a voltage doubler using pseudo-ideal diodes.

    "text": "An intriguing aspect of the clamped-capacitor circuit depicted in Fig. $1.22 a$ is its ability to produce a positive output peak that is double the input peak. This implies that by directing the output of this circuit to a peak detector, we can generate a dc voltage of $+2 V_{m}$, effectively doubling the input amplitude. To delve deeper into the behavior of this composite circuit, we employ PSpice simulations. Known as a voltage doubler, the circuit is illustrated in Fig. 1.23 for a scenario involving a 1-kHz, 10-V sinusoidal input. The design incorporates pseudo-ideal diodes, whose PSpice models are derived by modifying an existing diode model in the PSpice library and setting the parameters $I_{s}$ and $n$ to the specified values in the table (further details in Appendix 1A).\n\nThe various waveforms are presented in Fig. 1.24, where it is observed that following a transient phase of fewer than ten cycles, the output stabilizes at the dc value\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{2} \\rightarrow 2 V_{m} \\tag{1.7}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\nor $v_{2}=20 \\mathrm{~V}$ in this example. The reason for the multiple cycles required to reach steady state is the loading effect of $C_{2}$ on $C_{1}$.

However, with equal capacitors, which is the typical configuration, the charge accumulated by $C_{1}$ at each positive peak of $v_{I}$ is evenly distributed between $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$, causing a decrease in $v_{1}$ that is substantial at the first peak but diminishes with subsequent peaks. It can be demonstrated (see Exercise 1.3) that the values reached by $v_{2}$ at each peak of $v_{I}$ are $5 \\mathrm{~V}, 12.5 \\mathrm{~V}, 16.25 \\mathrm{~V}, 18.125 \\mathrm{~V}$, and so on.\n\nimage_name:FIGURE 1.23\ndescription:\n[\nname: vI, type: VoltageSource, value: 10 Vac, ports: {Np: vI, Nn: 0}\nname: C1, type: Capacitor, value: 1 nF, ports: {Np: vI, Nn: v1}\nname: D1, type: Diode, ports: {Na: 0, Nc: v1}\nname: D2, type: Diode, ports: {Na: v1, Nc: v2}\nname: C2, type: Capacitor, value: 1 nF, ports: {Np: v2, Nn: 0}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit is a voltage doubler using pseudo-ideal diodes.

Clearly, $v_{2}$ is less than $v_{1}$, a condition known as loading, caused by $R_{2}$ drawing current through $R_{1}$, leading to voltage loss across $R_{1}$.\nHowever, if the source is connected to the load through a buffer as in Fig. 1.30b, there will be no voltage drop across $R_{1}$ since the op amp does not draw input currents. Thus, the buffer eliminates loading, ensuring $v_{2}=v_{1}$. While $R_{2}$ does draw current, it is supplied by the op amp, which in turn draws from the power supply $+V_{S}$ rather than from $v_{1}$. (This illustration pertains to the case $v_{1}>0$; for $v_{1}<0$, the load current flows from $R_{2}$ through the op amp to $-V_{S}$.)\nThese configurations frequently appear, either independently or as components of more complex systems, leading to frequent application of Eqs.

    "text": "The electrical characteristics of a Group IV element can be significantly modified by substituting some of its atoms with atoms from neighboring groups. For example, replacing a silicon atom with a phosphorus atom ($\\mathrm{P}$), which is part of Group V and has five electrons in its outer shell, results in the scenario depicted in Fig. 1.34a. Out of these five electrons, four will form covalent bonds similar to those of a silicon atom, while the fifth, due to thermal energy, will move freely within the crystal, unattached to any specific atom and thus available for conduction. Group V elements are known as donors because each atom contributes an electron to the silicon crystal. In contrast, substituting a silicon atom with a boron atom (B), which belongs to Group III and has only three electrons in its outer shell, leads to the situation shown in Fig. 1.34b. Here, the absence of a fourth electron creates a \"hole,\" and since holes can accept electrons, Group III elements are termed acceptors.\n\nThe process of replacing silicon atoms with donor or acceptor atoms is called doping.
