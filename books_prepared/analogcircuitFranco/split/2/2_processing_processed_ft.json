By inserting a third element, the grid, between the cathode and anode of the diode, he created a device that could modulate electron flow, effectively acting as an amplifier. This innovation enabled stronger signal amplification, leading to advancements in radio communications, television, radar, and early digital computers. The triode's ability to control current flow with minimal power laid the groundwork for the development of the npn BJT, which mimics the triode's function using semiconductor materials. The BJT, consisting of an emitter, base, and collector, uses the base to control electron flow from the emitter to the collector, similar to how the grid controlled electron flow in the triode."

This means they can amplify signals or switch power efficiently. For instance, in a triode, the grid uses a small input signal to control a larger current flow between the cathode and anode. Similarly, a transistor can control a significant power transfer from an external source with minimal input power. A practical example is a car radio, where a low-power radio receiver controls an audio power amplifier to transfer higher power from the car battery to the loudspeakers. This amplification capability is why triodes and transistors are termed active devices and are essential in various electronic applications."

This led to the development of the first all-transistor radio in the 1950s. The concept of integrating multiple components (transistors, diodes, resistors, capacitors) on a single semiconductor chip, known as the integrated circuit (IC), was realized in 1958 by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments and independently in 1959 by Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor. Key milestones include the development of the first IC operational amplifier by Fairchild Semiconductor, the introduction of TTL and ECL digital IC families by Texas Instruments and Motorola, respectively, and the advent of MOSFET technology in the early 1970s. Intel's development of the first microprocessor in 1971 marked another significant milestone, leading to the exponential growth of IC electronics governed by Moore's law."
