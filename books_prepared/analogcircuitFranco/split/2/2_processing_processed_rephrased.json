This period saw milestones like radio communications (AM and FM), television, radar, and post-World War II digital computers.\nCentral to the triode's operation was the use of the grid to control current between the cathode and plate. By a hydraulic analogy, the triode acted like a valve. From a circuit perspective, it implemented the concept of a controlled (or dependent) source studied in basic circuit courses.

The utility of triodes and transistors lies in their ability to control significant power with minimal input power, earning them the designation as active devices or amplifiers. An active device uses little power to control a larger power transfer from an external source, exemplified by a car radio where a low-power receiver controls power transfer from the battery to speakers. The term \"transistor\" combines \"transfer\" and \"resistor,\" highlighting its role in power transfer. While a transistor is inherently passive, it becomes active when paired with an external energy source.\nThe transistor quickly replaced bulkier, power-intensive, and less reliable vacuum tubes. Early transistor circuits mirrored vacuum-tube designs, with adjusted power supplies and components. The 1950s introduced the first all-transistor hand-held radio, and by the decade's end, the concept of integrating entire circuits on a single semiconductor chip, or integrated circuit (IC), emerged. Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments and Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor independently realized this in 1958 and 1959.

However, the realm of electronics expanded significantly with the invention of a three-element vacuum tube known as the triode. In 1906, Lee DeForest modified Fleming's diode valve, discussed at the start of Chapter 1, by adding a third element between the cathode and anode, termed the grid, which he used to modulate electron flow from cathode to anode. In fact, by applying an audio signal from a microphone to the grid, he achieved a much stronger signal at the anode (which he renamed the plate), and subsequently used this signal to drive a pair of earphones. Aptly named the audion, this new valve effectively functioned as an amplifier, which he later applied to the design of radio signal detectors and oscillators. Indeed, vacuum tubes dominated electronics for the next half-century, evolving to include additional grids and culminating in the tetrode and pentode. During this period, significant innovations emerged, such as radio communications (AM and FM), television, radar, and, following World War II, the first digital computers.\n\nCentral to the triode's operation was the concept of using one element (the grid) to control current flow between the other two (cathode and plate). By a hydraulic analogy, the triode could be likened to a valve. From a circuit perspective, it implemented the idea of a controlled (or dependent) source, a concept studied in introductory circuit courses. The next major milestone in electronics occurred when the triode's function was replicated on a semiconductor material, resulting in the invention of the transistor in 1947 by John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley at Bell Labs. The closest equivalent to the triode is today's npn bipolar junction transistor (npn BJT), which consists of an $n$-type semiconductor slab with: (a) one heavily doped side ($n^{+}$-type) serving as a rich source of free electrons, termed the emitter; (b) the opposite side, functioning like the triode's plate, called the collector; and (c) a thin layer of $p$-type material in between, known as the base, designed to attract electrons from the emitter and direct them to the collector, akin to the triode's grid. The utility of triodes and transistors lies in their ability to control a much larger power output with a minimal input power, earning them the designation as active devices or amplifiers. Essentially, an active device uses a small amount of power to control the transfer of a greater power from an external source, like a power supply. A classic example is a car radio, where a low-power receiver controls the transfer of higher power from the car battery to the speakers. The term \"transistor\" itself is a contraction of \"transfer\" and \"resistor.\" In essence, a transistor is a passive device, but when combined with an external energy source, it functions as an active device.\n\nThe newly invented transistor quickly replaced the bulkier, power-intensive, and less reliable vacuum tube. Initially, transistor circuits closely mirrored vacuum-tube designs, with appropriate adjustments to power supplies and components. The 1950s saw the advent of the first all-transistor hand-held radio. By the decade's end, the potential for further miniaturization and power efficiency led to the monolithic fabrication of entire circuits (transistors, diodes, resistors, and small capacitors, along with their interconnections) on a single semiconductor chip, termed the integrated circuit (IC). This was first achieved in 1958 by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments and independently in 1959 by Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor. The 1960s witnessed significant advancements, including the first IC operational amplifier by Fairchild Semiconductor ( $\\mu \\mathrm{A}$ Series), and the development of digital IC families like transistor-transistor logic (TTL) by Texas Instruments (7400 Series) and emitter-coupled logic (ECL) by Motorola (10K Series).\n\nIn the early 1970s, the metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) field-effect transistor (FET), or MOSFET, became commercially viable. Compared to the BJT, the MOSFET could be made smaller, and digital MOSFET circuits could operate with virtually zero standby power. This technology was pivotal in the first battery-powered calculators and wristwatches. Additionally, RCA introduced complementary MOS (CMOS) as a low-power alternative to TTL and ECL. In 1971, Intel used MOS technology to create the first microprocessor. Since then, IC technology has advanced exponentially, permeating nearly every aspect of modern life. This growth has followed Moore's law, which posits that the number of devices on a chip doubles approximately every 18 months due to advances in fabrication. Formulated in 1965, this law remains valid, though it is approaching physical limits that may eventually render it obsolete.\n\nWhile the BJT was the dominant semiconductor device for nearly three decades, it has been surpassed by the MOSFET in digital electronics due to the latter's size and power efficiency. Nevertheless, the BJT remains preferred in areas like high-performance analog and radiofrequency electronics, and in discrete designs due to the availability of diverse devices. BJTs and MOSFETs can also be co-fabricated on the same chip, a technology known as biCMOS, leveraging the strengths of both. Contemporary ICs often integrate digital and analog functions, hence the term mixed-signal or mixed-mode ICs.\n\nMicroelectronics is undoubtedly one of the most dynamic and challenging fields. Beginners may find it overwhelming, but by focusing on fundamental principles that transcend current technologies, we can apply these concepts to future innovations. Emphasizing general principles and continuous learning is essential for young engineers aiming to thrive in this ever-evolving field.\n\nCHAPTER HIGHLIGHTS\nThis chapter starts with the physical structure of the BJT, foundational semiconductor principles, device characteristics, operating regions, and modeling. As in Chapter 1's discussion of the pn junction, the emphasis is on practical aspects relevant to today's industrial context (rules of thumb).\n\nThe BJT is then examined in its primary applications: as an amplifier in analog electronics and as a switch in digital electronics. The large-signal and small-signal models developed for the pn junction are extended to accommodate the more complex BJT.\n\nFollowing a review of BJT biasing techniques, the chapter explores the three basic amplifier configurations: common-emitter (CE), common-collector (CC), and common-base (CB). The CE configuration is highlighted for voltage amplification, while the CC and CB configurations are suited for voltage and current buffering, respectively. The role of the BJT as a resistance transformation device is also emphasized, with transformation equations provided for easy reference in subsequent chapters.\n\nThe amplifiers discussed are of the discrete type, constructed from off-the-shelf components (transistors, resistors, and capacitors), allowing students to experiment in the lab. Although modern circuits integrate numerous transistors on a single chip, understanding single-transistor amplifiers is crucial before tackling multi-transistor ICs, a topic covered in Chapter 4. Discrete amplifiers offer the pedagogical advantage of familiar circuit elements surrounding the transistor, with a clearer separation between dc and ac components compared to complex monolithic designs. Additionally, engineers often need to supplement ICs with discrete component circuitry (buffers, drivers, power boosters, etc.). Thus, this chapter aims to introduce students to single-transistor amplifier basics, laying a solid foundation for studying multi-transistor ICs in later chapters.\n\nThe chapter extensively utilizes PSpice for displaying BJT characteristics, transfer curves, and waveforms, as well as for verifying dc and ac calculations."

    "text": "Figure 2.1 depicts, in a simplified manner, the structure of an npn bipolar junction transistor (npn BJT) commonly found in traditional integrated-circuit (IC) technology. This device is manufactured through a series of intricate steps, including pattern definition, crystal growth, diffusion, material deposition, and material removal, on a wafer of lightly-doped $p$-type silicon ($p^{-}$), known as the substrate. The wafer serves as the physical foundation for the device in question as well as for all other devices within the same IC.\n\nA BJT comprises three terminals: the emitter (E), base (B), and collector (C). A fourth terminal (S) provides access to the substrate but plays no active role except to ensure electrical isolation between neighboring devices. The fabrication of an npn BJT begins with a polished $p^{-}$ wafer, as shown at the bottom, and proceeds through the following stages:\n- Initially, heavily doped $n$-type silicon ($n^{+}$) is deposited in the area designated for the BJT and then diffused into the wafer to create a low-resistance path known as the buried layer.\n\n**Image Description:**\nThe diagram presents the basic physical structure of an integrated circuit (IC) npn bipolar junction transistor (BJT).

The emitter and collector consist of heavily doped n-type silicon (n+), while the base is a p-type region.\n   - **n+ Buried Layer:** This heavily doped n-type silicon layer facilitates a low-resistance path for the collector current.\n   - **n- Epitaxial Layer:** A lightly doped n-type silicon layer grown atop the n+ buried layer, forming the collector region.\n   - **p- Substrate:** The base layer of the structure, composed of lightly doped p-type silicon.\n   - **p- Isolation (p- Iso):** These regions encircle the BJT structure, providing electrical isolation from adjacent devices.\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n   - The emitter, base, and collector are vertically aligned to enable the flow of charge carriers (electrons) from the emitter to the collector through the base.\n   - The n+ buried layer ensures a low-resistance path for the collector current, enhancing the transistor's performance.\n   - The p- isolation regions electrically isolate the BJT from other components on the same chip, preventing unwanted interactions.\n3. **Labels and Annotations:**\n   - Labels \"Emitter,\" \"Base,\" and \"Collector\" identify the respective regions of the BJT.\n   - Labels \"n+ Buried layer,\" \"n- Epitaxy,\" \"p- Iso,\" and \"p- Substrate\" indicate the material properties and doping levels of the different regions.\n   - The \"Junction isolation\" label highlights the isolation technique used to separate the BJT from other devices.\n   - The \"Base width\" annotation indicates the physical width of the base region, a critical parameter affecting the transistor's performance.\n\n**FIGURE 2.1 Basic physical structure of an IC npn BJT.**\n- Subsequently, a crystal layer of lightly doped $n$-type silicon ($n^{-}$) is grown over the $n^{+}$ buried layer and the surrounding $p^{-}$ wafer area. This layer, termed the epitaxial (or epi) layer, is designed to form the collector region.\n- A $p$-type diffusion is introduced into the epi layer along the perimeter of the BJT region, extending until it meets the $p$-type substrate below. This diffusion, known as $p^{-}$iso, is intended to provide junction isolation between adjacent BJTs.\n- Another, less deep $p$-type diffusion is performed in the epi layer to create the base region of the BJT.\n- Two heavily doped $n$-type diffusions are conducted simultaneously: one into the $p$-type base region to form the $n^{+}$ emitter region, and the other into the $n^{-}$ epi layer to establish an ohmic contact between the $n^{-}$ epi region and the collector electrode. (Currently, the $n^{+}$ collector diffusion extends all the way to the buried layer below.)\n- Finally, three metal depositions form the E, B, and C electrodes. An additional connection is made to the substrate (S), which, in the case of the npn BJT shown, is always maintained at the most negative voltage (MNV) in the circuit. (Students interested in the fascinating topic of transistor fabrication are encouraged to explore online videos and articles.)\n\nViewing the collector regions as $n$-type material surrounded by $p$-type regions, we recognize a distributed $pn$ junction. Biasing the $p^{-}$ substrate (and thus the outer $p^{-}$iso regions) at the MNV ensures that this distributed junction remains reverse biased at all times. Aside from negligible leakage currents, this configuration isolates the collectors of adjacent BJTs, allowing them to operate independently.\n\nA BJT comprises two fundamental elements: (a) the $pn$ junction formed by the base-emitter (B-E) regions, and (b) the $pn$ junction formed by the base-collector (B-C) regions. The most common operational mode of a BJT involves a forward-biased B-E junction and a reverse-biased B-C junction, known as the forward active (FA) mode. This mode, essential for BJT applications as an amplifier, involves a current of electrons flowing from the emitter, through the base, to the collector, controlled by the base-emitter voltage drop $v_{BE}$.\n\n**Image Description:**\nThe image depicts a cross-sectional diagram of a monolithic npn bipolar junction transistor (BJT) operating in the forward active mode, illustrating the current flow and structure of the BJT.\n1. **Identification of Components and Structure:**\n   - The BJT consists of three main regions: the emitter (E), base (B), and collector (C).\n   - The emitter and collector are marked as $n^+$ regions, indicating heavily doped n-type semiconductor material.\n   - The base is a $p$ region, indicating p-type semiconductor material.\n   - The diagram also includes $n^-$ epitaxy, a lightly doped n-type layer between the base and collector.\n   - Surrounding the main structure are $p^-$ iso regions, providing electrical isolation.\n   - The substrate is labeled as $p^-$ and is connected to the ground.\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n   - The emitter (E) is connected to ground, with current $i_E$ flowing from it.\n   - The base (B) is connected to a voltage source $v_{BE}$ of approximately 0.7 V, indicating a forward-biased base-emitter junction.\n   - The collector (C) is connected to a voltage source $v_{CB}$ of at least 0.2 V, indicating a reverse-biased base-collector junction.\n   - The flow of electrons is depicted moving from the emitter through the base to the collector, characteristic of forward active mode operation.\n   - Holes are shown in the base region, indicating recombination processes.\n   - The currents $i_E$, $i_B$, and $i_C$ are illustrated, with $i_B$ being the base current and $i_C$ the collector current.\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n   - Arrows indicate the direction of electron flow and hole movement.\n   - The $v_{BE}$ and $v_{CB}$ voltages are labeled with their respective values, emphasizing the biasing conditions.\n   - The diagram is annotated with labels for electrons and holes to clarify the charge carriers involved in the BJT's operation.\n   - The $p^-$ substrate is connected to a terminal labeled $S$, which is grounded, ensuring the device's isolation from other components.\n\n**FIGURE 2.2 Currents in a monolithic npn BJT operating in the forward active mode.**\nThis scenario is illustrated in Fig. 2.2, where we observe that, since electrons are negative, the directions of the terminal currents $i_E$ and $i_C$ are opposite to the direction of electron flow. Additionally, we note the following:\n- Not all electrons emitted from the emitter are collected by the collector. Some recombine with holes in the $p$-type base region, resulting in a base current component of holes to sustain this recombination. By making the base region very thin (fractions of $1 \\mu$m), manufacturers ensure that this recombination component remains small.\n- As with all $pn$ junctions, the diffusion of electrons from E to B is accompanied by the diffusion of holes from B to E. By doping the emitter much more heavily than the base (typically by two or more orders of magnitude), manufacturers ensure that the influx of electrons from the emitter significantly exceeds the diffusion of holes from the base, keeping this second base current component also small.\n\nThe desire for a small base current $i_B$ for a given collector current $i_C$ stems from the fact that the ratio\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\beta_{F}=\\frac{i_{C}}{i_{B}} \\tag{2.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\nknown as the forward current gain, is a key performance metric of the BJT. It also offers flexibility, allowing the BJT to function either as a voltage-controlled current source ($i_C$ controlled by $v_{BE}$) or as a current-controlled current source ($i_C$ controlled by $i_B$). Integrated-circuit BJTs typically have $\\beta_{F} \\approx 250$, though special BJTs, known as superbeta BJTs, can achieve $\\beta_{F}$ values as high as 10,000. As we delve deeper, we will examine BJT behavior in greater detail."

    "text": "Figure 2.1 depicts, in a simplified manner, the structure of an npn bipolar junction transistor (npn BJT) commonly found in traditional integrated-circuit (IC) technology. This device is manufactured through a series of intricate steps, including pattern definition, crystal growth, diffusion, material deposition, and material removal, on a wafer of lightly-doped $p$-type silicon ($p^{-}$), known as the substrate. The wafer serves as the physical foundation for the device in question as well as for all other devices within the same IC.\n\nA BJT comprises three terminals: the emitter (E), base (B), and collector (C). A fourth terminal (S) provides access to the substrate but plays no active role except to ensure electrical isolation between neighboring devices. The fabrication of an npn BJT begins with a polished $p^{-}$ wafer, as shown at the bottom, and proceeds through the following stages:\n- Initially, heavily doped $n$-type silicon ($n^{+}$) is deposited in the area designated for the BJT and then diffused into the wafer to create a low-resistance path known as the buried layer.\n\n**Description of FIGURE 2.1: Basic physical structure of an IC npn BJT**\nThe diagram presents the fundamental physical structure of an integrated circuit (IC) npn bipolar junction transistor (BJT). It provides a cross-sectional view highlighting the various regions and materials involved in the device's construction.\n1. **Components and Structure:**\n   - **Emitter, Base, and Collector:** These are the primary regions of the npn BJT. The emitter and collector consist of heavily doped n-type silicon ($n^{+}$), while the base is a p-type region.\n   - **$n^{+}$ Buried Layer:** This heavily doped n-type silicon layer offers a low-resistance path for the collector current.\n   - **$n^{-}$ Epitaxial Layer:** A lightly doped n-type silicon layer grown atop the $n^{+}$ buried layer, forming the collector region.\n   - **$p^{-}$ Substrate:** The bottom layer, composed of lightly doped p-type silicon.\n   - **$p^{-}$ Isolation ($p^{-}$ Iso):** These regions encircle the BJT structure, providing electrical isolation from adjacent devices.\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n   - The emitter, base, and collector are vertically aligned to facilitate the flow of charge carriers (electrons) from the emitter to the collector through the base.\n   - The $n^{+}$ buried layer ensures a low-resistance path for the collector current, enhancing transistor performance.\n   - The $p^{-}$ isolation regions electrically isolate the BJT from other components on the same chip, preventing unwanted interactions.\n3. **Labels and Annotations:**\n   - Labels \"Emitter,\" \"Base,\" and \"Collector\" identify the respective regions of the BJT.\n   - Labels \"$n^{+}$ Buried layer,\" \"$n^{-}$ Epitaxy,\" \"$p^{-}$ Iso,\" and \"$p^{-}$ Substrate\" indicate the material properties and doping levels of the different regions.\n   - The \"Junction isolation\" label highlights the isolation technique used to separate the BJT from other devices.\n   - The \"Base width\" annotation indicates the physical width of the base region, a critical parameter affecting transistor performance.\n\n**Continuation of Fabrication Steps:**\n- Subsequently, a crystal layer of lightly doped $n$-type silicon ($n^{-}$) is grown atop the $n^{+}$ buried layer and the surrounding $p^{-}$ wafer area. This layer, termed the epitaxial (or epi) layer, is designed to form the collector region.\n- A $p$-type diffusion is introduced into the epi layer along the perimeter of the BJT region until it connects with the $p$-type substrate below. This diffusion, known as $p^{-}$ iso, is intended to provide junction isolation between adjacent BJTs.\n- Another, less deep $p$-type diffusion is made into the epi layer to create the base region of the BJT.\n- Two heavily doped $n$-type diffusions are performed simultaneously: one into the $p$-type base region to form the $n^{+}$ emitter region, and the other into the $n^{-}$ epi layer to establish an ohmic contact between the $n^{-}$ epi region and the collector electrode. (Currently, the $n^{+}$ collector diffusion extends all the way to the buried layer below.)\n- Finally, three metal depositions form the E, B, and C electrodes. An additional connection is made to the substrate (S), which, in the case of the npn BJT shown, is always maintained at the most negative voltage (MNV) in the circuit. (Students interested in the fascinating topic of transistor fabrication are encouraged to explore online videos and articles.)\n\nViewing the collector regions as $n$-type material surrounded by $p$-type regions, we identify a distributed $pn$ junction. Biasing the $p^{-}$ substrate (and thus the outer $p^{-}$ iso regions) at the MNV ensures that this distributed junction remains reverse biased at all times. Aside from negligible leakage currents, this configuration keeps the collectors of adjacent BJTs isolated, allowing them to operate independently.\n\nA BJT consists of two fundamental elements: (a) the $pn$ junction formed by the base-emitter (B-E) regions, and (b) the $pn$ junction formed by the base-collector (B-C) regions. The most common operating mode for a BJT is with the B-E junction forward biased and the B-C junction reverse biased, known as the forward active (FA) mode. This mode, essential for BJT applications as an amplifier, involves a current of electrons flowing from the emitter, through the base, to the collector, controlled by the base-emitter voltage drop $v_{BE}$.\n\n**Description of FIGURE 2.2: Currents in a monolithic npn BJT operating in the forward active mode**\nThis image illustrates a cross-sectional view of a monolithic npn bipolar junction transistor (BJT) operating in the forward active mode, depicting the flow of currents and the structure of the BJT.\n1. **Identification of Components and Structure:**\n   - The BJT consists of three main regions: the emitter (E), base (B), and collector (C).\n   - The emitter and collector are marked as $n^{+}$ regions, indicating heavily doped n-type semiconductor material.\n   - The base is a $p$ region, indicating p-type semiconductor material.\n   - The diagram also includes $n^{-}$ epitaxy, a lightly doped n-type layer between the base and collector.\n   - Surrounding the main structure are $p^{-}$ iso regions, providing electrical isolation.\n   - The substrate is labeled $p^{-}$ and is connected to ground.\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n   - The emitter (E) is connected to ground, with current $i_E$ flowing from it.\n   - The base (B) is connected to a voltage source $v_{BE}$ of approximately 0.7 V, indicating a forward-biased base-emitter junction.\n   - The collector (C) is connected to a voltage source $v_{CB}$ of at least 0.2 V, indicating a reverse-biased base-collector junction.\n   - Electron flow is depicted from the emitter through the base to the collector, characteristic of forward active mode operation.\n   - Holes are shown in the base region, indicating recombination processes.\n   - Currents $i_E$, $i_B$, and $i_C$ are illustrated, with $i_B$ being the base current and $i_C$ the collector current.\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n   - Arrows indicate the direction of electron flow and hole movement.\n   - Voltages $v_{BE}$ and $v_{CB}$ are labeled with their respective values, emphasizing the biasing conditions.\n   - Labels for electrons and holes clarify the charge carriers involved in BJT operation.\n   - The $p^{-}$ substrate is connected to a terminal labeled $S$, which is grounded, ensuring device isolation.\n\n**Continuation of BJT Operation:**\nThe situation is depicted in Fig. 2.2, where we observe that, since electrons are negative, the directions of the terminal currents $i_E$ and $i_C$ are opposite to the direction of electron flow. Additionally, we note the following:\n- Not all electrons emitted from the emitter are collected by the collector. Some recombine with holes in the $p$-type base region, forming a base current component of holes to sustain this recombination. By making the base region very thin (fractions of $1 \\mu$m), manufacturers ensure that this recombination component remains small.\n- As with all $pn$ junctions, electron diffusion from E to B is accompanied by hole diffusion from B to E.

(Students interested in the fascinating topic of transistor fabrication are encouraged to explore online videos and articles.)\n\nViewing the collector regions as $n$-type material surrounded by $p$-type regions, we recognize a form of distributed $p n$ junction. Biasing the $p^{-}$ substrate (and thus the outer $p^{-}$iso regions) at the MNV ensures that this distributed junction remains reverse biased at all times. Aside from typically negligible leakage currents, this arrangement keeps the collectors of adjacent BJTs isolated from each other, allowing different BJTs to operate independently.\n\nTwo fundamental components of a BJT are: (a) the $p n$ junction formed by the base-emitter (B-E) regions, and (b) the $p n$ junction formed by the base-collector (B-C) regions. The most prevalent mode of BJT operation involves the B-E junction being forward biased and the B-C junction being reverse biased. This mode, which underpins BJT applications as an amplifier, is known as the forward active (FA) mode. In essence, the primary event in an $n p n$ BJT operating in FA mode is a current of electrons flowing from the emitter, through the base, to the collector, controlled by the base-emitter voltage drop $v_{B E}$.\n\nThis scenario is depicted in Fig. 2.2, where it is noted that, since electrons are negative, the directions of the terminal currents $i_{E}$ and $i_{C}$ are opposite to the direction of electron flow. Additionally, two observations can be made:\n- Not all electrons emitted from the emitter are collected by the collector. As they pass through the $p$-type base region, a small fraction recombines with the numerous holes present there, indicating the presence of a base current component of holes to sustain this recombination process. By making the base region very thin (fractions of $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$), the manufacturer ensures that this recombination component remains small.\n- As with all $p n$ junctions, the diffusion of electrons from E to B is accompanied by the diffusion of holes from B to E. By doping the emitter much more heavily than the base (typically by two or more orders of magnitude), the manufacturer ensures that the influx of electrons from the emitter significantly outweighs the diffusion of holes from the base, thus keeping this second base current component also small.\n\nThe rationale for desiring a small base current $i_{B}$ for a given collector current $i_{C}$ is that the ratio\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\beta_{F}=\\frac{i_{C}}{i_{B}} \\tag{2.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\nknown as the forward current gain, serves as a figure of merit for the BJT. It also offers additional flexibility, allowing the BJT to operate either as a voltage-controlled current source ($i_{C}$ controlled by $v_{B E}$) or as a current-controlled current source ($i_{C}$ controlled by $i_{B}$). Integrated-circuit BJTs typically have $\\beta_{F} \\approx 250$, although it is possible to fabricate special BJTs, known as superbeta BJTs, with $\\beta_{F}$ values as high as 10,000.

    "text": "It is evident that operating the BJT in the forward-active mode, as illustrated in Fig. 2.6, results in an accumulation of minority carriers (electrons, in this instance) in its base region. This surplus electron distribution, defined by\n$$\nn_{B}^{\\prime}(x)=n_{B}(x)-n_{B 0}\n$$\nis presented in Fig. 2.7, along with its values at $x=0$ and $x=W_{B}$. Upon injection into the base, these excess electrons diffuse toward the SCL of the B-C junction, where the electric field $E_{C B}$ drives them out of the base, through the SCL, and into the collector region, from which they move towards the collector electrode (refer to Fig. 2.6). The diffusion of electrons within the base region is dictated by the diffusion equation\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nJ_{n}=q D_{n} \\frac{d n_{B}^{\\prime}(x)}{d x} \\tag{2.9}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\nwhere $J_{n}$ represents the electron current density (in $\\mathrm{A} / \\mathrm{cm}^{2}$), $q$ is the electron charge, and $D_{n}$ is the electron diffusion constant, also known as electron diffusivity (in $\\mathrm{cm}^{2} / \\mathrm{s}$). By calculating the slope of the triangle, we derive\n$$\nJ_{n}=q D_{n}\\left[-\\frac{n_{B 0}\\left(e^{v_{B E} / V_{T}}-1\\right)-\\left(-n_{B 0}\\right)}{W_{B}}\\right]=-\\frac{q D_{n} n_{B 0}}{W_{B}} e^{v_{B E} / V_{T}}\n$$\nThe negative sign denotes that the direction of $J_{n}$ is opposite to $x$, specifically from right to left.

Setting $i_{B B}=-Q_{n} / \\tau_{n}$, we derive\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{B B}=\\frac{q A_{E} n_{i}^{2}(T) W_{B}}{2 \\tau_{n} N_{A E}} e^{v_{B E} / V_{T}} \\tag{2.14}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\nwhere $\\tau_{n}$ is the mean electron lifetime in the base.\nimage_name:FIGURE 2.8 Calculating the excess charge Q_n in the base region.\ndescription:In \"FIGURE 2.8 Calculating the excess charge Q_n in the base region,\" a 3D plot illustrates the distribution of charge carriers in the base region of a BJT.\n1. **Graph Type and Function:**\n- This 3D representation shows the variation of excess electron concentration across the BJT's base region.\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n- The vertical axis, labeled \\( n'_B(x) \\), represents electron concentration as a function of position \\( x \\) in the base.\n- The horizontal axis shows the position \\( x \\) within the base, ranging from \\( 0 \\) to \\( W_B \\), where \\( W_B \\) is the base width.\n- The third dimension, perpendicular to the \\( x \\)-axis, implicitly represents concentration changes due to the applied base-emitter voltage \\( V_{BE} \\).\n3. **Behavior and Trends:**\n- The graph shows a linear increase in electron concentration from \\( -n_{B0} \\) at \\( x = 0 \\) to a higher value at \\( x = W_B \\), influenced by \\( n_{B0} (e^{v_{BE}/V_T} - 1) \\), indicating an exponential increase with voltage.\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The shaded area represents the excess charge \\( Q_n \\) in the base, obtained by integrating the concentration over the base width.\n- The line \\( n'_B(x) \\) illustrates the linear change in concentration across the base.\n- The differential element \\( dQ_n \\) is shown, representing the infinitesimal change in charge over a small width \\( dx \\).\n5. **Annotations and Data Points:**\n- Annotations like \\( dQ_n \\) and \\( dx \\) highlight the differential charge and width.\n- The base width \\( W_B \\) is marked on the x-axis, and the concentration at \\( x = 0 \\) is indicated as \\( -n_{B0} \\).\nOverall, the graph visually explains the distribution and calculation of excess charge in a BJT's base, emphasizing its dependence on position and applied voltage.\nFIGURE 2.8 Calculating the excess charge $Q_{n}$ in the base region.\n- The $i_{B C}$ component accounts for the thermal generation of electron-hole pairs within the space-charge layer (SCL) of the reverse-biased B-C junction. These pairs are swept in opposite directions by the strong electric field $E_{C B}$. Depending on fabrication quality, surface leakage may also occur. BJT data sheets typically report $I_{C B 0}$, the C-B leakage current with the emitter open. At room temperature, $I_{C B 0}$ ranges from 1 nA to 1 pA and is often negligible in hand calculations. However, this current is highly temperature-dependent, as summarized by the rule of thumb:\nThe leakage current $I_{C B 0}$ doubles approximately every $10^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ increase in temperature.\nThus, at high operating temperatures, it may be necessary to consider the leakage current in hand analysis.\nRevisiting Fig. 2.6, we see that all base-current components are composed of holes. Yet, the base electrode, typically metallic, conducts via electron flow. To ensure continuity between these current types, free electron-hole pairs must spontaneously generate at the metal-base interface. These pairs allow holes to enter the base region, sustaining $i_{B E}+i_{B B}$, while electrons move up the base wire to sustain $i_{B}$.\nA portion of the holes required for $i_{B E}+i_{B B}$ also comes from the collector as $i_{B C}$. As noted, $i_{B C}$ increases with temperature. Additionally, $i_{B C}$ can be increased by illuminating the B-C SCL with light. Light quanta impart enough energy to create free hole-electron pairs, which are then swept apart by the electric field. With sufficient light, the hole current from collector to base can turn the BJT on without external $i_{B}$. When used as a light-controlled device, the BJT is termed a phototransistor, commonly used in optocouplers. An optocoupler consists of an LED and a phototransistor in the same package. Current through the LED generates light, activating the BJT. Since the LED and BJT are light-coupled, they can belong to separate circuits, providing galvanic isolation. Alternatively, an LED and a BJT can be coupled via fiber optics, enabling long-distance information transmission with minimal loss and interference."

The BJT's B-E junction functions as a diode, with the base as the anode and the emitter as the cathode. Assuming a 0.7V junction voltage drop, the emitter voltage is -0.7V, leading to:\n$$\nI_{E}=\\frac{-0.7-(-5)}{4.3}=1.0 \\mathrm{~mA}\n$$\nSince $I_{C}=0$, $I_{B}=I_{E}=1.0 \\mathrm{~mA}$. As shown in Fig. 2.9b, both $I_{E}$ and $I_{B}$ primarily consist of electrons from the emitter to the base, with a minor component of holes from the base to the emitter, due to heavier emitter doping. The BJT acts like a standard pn diode in this setup.\n\n(b) Connecting the collector to +5V reverse biases the B-C junction, allowing electrons in the thin base to reach the collector. Some recombine with holes, but most reach the collector. Thus:\n$$\nI_{B}=\\frac{I_{C}}{\\beta_{F}}=\\frac{I_{E}-I_{B}}{\\beta_{F}}\n$$\nor\n$$\nI_{B}=\\frac{I_{E}}{\\beta_{F}+1}\n$$\nNow, $I_{B}=1.0 / 101=9.9 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$ and $I_{C}=100 \\times 9.9=0.99 \\mathrm{~mA}$. Fig. 2.9c illustrates this, with the primary event being electron flow from E to C.\n\n#### Exercise 2.1\nThree students debate whether a BJT can be made by connecting two discrete pn junctions back-to-back. The first suggests creating an npn BJT by connecting the anodes of two diodes for the p-type base, using one cathode as the n-type emitter and the other as the n-type collector. The second argues that this device won't amplify base current, citing two main reasons. The third proposes using the B-E junction of one npn BJT and the B-C junction of another, connecting their bases to form the composite device's base (leaving the first BJT's collector and the second's emitter disconnected). The second still claims it won't work as a current amplifier. Why?\n\n(a) Assuming Eq. (2.15) yields $\\beta_{F}=100$ for the BJT in Fig. 2.9c, find $I_{B}$ and its components $I_{B E}$ and $I_{B B}$.\n(b) If the manufacturer halves $W_{B}$, or doubles it, what happens?\n\n#### Solution\n(a) We find:\n$$\nI_{B}=I_{B E}+I_{B B}=\\frac{I_{C}}{\\beta_{F}}=\\left(\\frac{1}{150}+\\frac{1}{300}\\right) 0.99 \\mathrm{~mA}=6.6 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}+3.3 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}=9.9 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}\n$$\n(b) Halving $W_{B}$ results in:\n$$\n\\beta_{F}=\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{150}(0.5)+\\frac{1}{300}(0.5)^{2}}=\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{300}+\\frac{1}{1200}}=240\n$$\nWith $I_{E}=1.0 \\mathrm{~mA}$, we get $I_{B}=1.0 / 241=4.15 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}, I_{C}=0.996 \\mathrm{~mA}, I_{B E}=3.32 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$, and $I_{B B}=0.83 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$.

In this setup, the LM336-5.0 diode provides a high-quality $5-\\mathrm{V}$ voltage reference, which we then buffer to the load.\n\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:\n[\nname: VDD, type: VoltageSource, value: 12V, ports: {Np: VDD, Nn: GND}\nname: R1, type: Resistor, value: 3.0kΩ, ports: {N1: VDD, N2: Vz}\nname: LM336-5.0, type: Diode, ports: {Na: GND, Nc: Vz}\nname: OpAmp1, type: OpAmp, value: 741, ports: {InP: Vz, InN: Vo, Out: Vo, Vdd: VDD, -Vdd: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit is a 5V regulated power supply using a 741 op-amp and LM336-5.0 diode with a 3.0kΩ resistor. It is powered by a 12V source and is capable of driving loads up to approximately 25mA.\n\nimage_name:(b)\ndescription:\n[\nname: 12 V, type: VoltageSource, value: 12 V, ports: {Np: VDD, Nn: GND}\nname: 3.0 kΩ, type: Resistor, value: 3.0 kΩ, ports: {N1: VDD, N2: Vo}\nname: LM336-5.0, type: Diode, ports: {Na: Vo, Nc: GND}\nname: 741, type: OpAmp, ports: {InP: Vo, InN: GND, OutP: B, OutN: GND}\nname: NPN, type: NPN, ports: {C: VDD, B: B, E: Vo}\nname: LD, type: Other, ports: {N1: Vo, N2: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:This circuit is a regulated power supply using a BJT as a current booster. The BJT increases the output current drive capability of the op-amp. The LM336-5.0 provides a 5V reference voltage, and the 741 op-amp is configured as a voltage follower. The circuit is powered by a 12V source, and the load can draw up to 200mA.\n\nFIGURE 2.10 Illustrating how a BJT enhances the output current drive capability of an op amp.\n\nThis configuration will function correctly but only for load currents up to around 25 mA, which is the maximum output current capability of the 741 op amp according to its data sheets. If the load (denoted as LD) attempts to draw a current $I_{L}$ exceeding this limit, the output voltage will drop, and regulation will be lost.\n\nHowever, this is where the BJT proves invaluable! By inserting a BJT between the op amp and the load, as shown in Fig. 2.10b, the op amp's output current is amplified by $\\beta_{F}+1$, as demonstrated in Example 2.2. This allows a significantly higher current to flow from the unregulated 12-V source, through the BJT, to the load. The circuit's behavior is dictated by the well-known op amp rule, which states that the op amp will supply whatever output voltage and current are necessary to make its inverting input voltage ( $V_{o}$ ) track its non-inverting input voltage ( $\\left(V_{Z}\\right)$ ). In our scenario, the op amp must provide the base current\n$$\nI_{B}=\\frac{I_{E}}{\\beta_{F}+1}=\\frac{200 \\mathrm{~mA}}{100+1}=1.98 \\mathrm{~mA}\n$$\nwhich is comfortably within the $25-\\mathrm{mA}$ capability of the 741 op amp. Assuming a typical B-E junction voltage drop of about 0.7 V, the op amp must also supply the base voltage\n$$\nV_{B}=V_{B E}+V_{E} \\cong 0.7+5.0=5.7 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\nwhich is also well within the 741's output voltage capability.\n\nIn the illustrated application, the BJT is used to enhance the output current drive capability of a low-power device like an op amp. This role is common in various power-related circuits, such as regulated power supplies and audio power amplifiers. Despite the availability of IC voltage regulators, it is beneficial for beginners to construct and test the circuits in Fig. 2.10 in a lab setting."

To understand this, consider a BJT initially biased at a voltage $v_{C E}=V_{C E 1}$ in the active region (see Fig. 2.16a). Let the corresponding base width be $W_{B 1}$, the electron current density be $J_{n 1}$ (see Fig. 2.16b), and the collector current be $I_{C 1}\\left(=J_{n 1} A_{E}\\right)$. If $v_{C E}$ is increased to $V_{C E 2}$, the reverse bias across the B-C junction also increases, enhancing the electric field $E_{C B}$ within its space-charge layer (SCL). Referring to Fig. 2.5, we can assert that the increase in field lines necessitates a widening of the SCL to expose more ions. Consequently, the base width reduces to $W_{B 2}\\left(<W_{B 1}\\right)$, as shown in Fig. 2.16b.

To understand this, consider a BJT initially biased at a voltage $v_{C E}=V_{C E 1}$ in the active region (see Fig. 2.16a). Let the corresponding base width be $W_{B 1}$, the electron current density be $J_{n 1}$ (see Fig. 2.16b), and the collector current be $I_{C 1}\\left(=J_{n 1} A_{E}\\right)$. If $v_{C E}$ is increased to $V_{C E 2}$, the reverse bias across the B-C junction also increases, leading to a higher electric field $E_{C B}$ within its space-charge layer (SCL). Referring to Fig. 2.5, we can infer that the increase in field lines necessitates a widening of the SCL to expose more ions. Consequently, the base width reduces to $W_{B 2}\\left(<W_{B 1}\\right)$, as shown in Fig. 2.16b.

The curves start at different points on the y-axis, reflecting the impact of different $V_{BE}$ values on the collector current.\nA notable feature is that all curves appear to converge at a single point on the negative x-axis, labeled as $-V_A$. This convergence point represents the Early voltage, a conceptual value indicating the extrapolated intersection of the curves. The Early effect is demonstrated by the non-zero slope of the curves, signifying the modulation of the effective base width with changes in $v_{CE}$.\nThe overall behavior shows a linear increase in $i_C$ with increasing $v_{CE}$, and the convergence of the curves highlights the Early effect, where the collector current is influenced by base-width modulation as $v_{CE}$ increases. The graph effectively visualizes the relationship between collector current and collector-emitter voltage under varying base-emitter voltages, emphasizing the impact of the Early effect on BJT operation.\n\nFIGURE 2.15 Demonstrating the Early effect and the Early voltage $V_{A}$.\n\nThe倾斜 of the $i_{C}-v_{C E}$ curves is due to the reduction in the effective base width $W_{B}$ as $v_{C E}$ increases, a phenomenon known as base-width modulation or the Early effect. To understand this, consider a BJT initially biased at a voltage $v_{C E}=V_{C E 1}$ in the active region (see Fig. 2.16a). Let the corresponding base width be $W_{B 1}$, the electron current density be $J_{n 1}$ (see Fig. 2.16b), and the collector current be $I_{C 1}\\left(=J_{n 1} A_{E}\\right)$. If $v_{C E}$ is increased to $V_{C E 2}$, the reverse bias across the B-C junction also increases, leading to a higher electric field $E_{C B}$ within its space-charge layer (SCL). Referring to Fig. 2.5, we can state that the increase in field lines necessitates a widening of the SCL to expose more ions. Consequently, the base width decreases to $W_{B 2}\\left(<W_{B 1}\\right)$, as shown in Fig. 2.16b. With a narrower base width, the slope of $n_{B}^{\\prime}(x)$ increases, raising the current density to $J_{n 2}\\left(>J_{n 1}\\right)$, and thus the collector current to $I_{C 2}\\left(>I_{C 1}\\right)$.

The curves depict the relationship between collector current ($i_C$) and collector-emitter voltage ($v_{CE}$) for different base-emitter voltages ($V_{BE}$) ranging from 650 mV to 710 mV.\n\nImage Description (b):\n- The graph in figure (b) presents the $i_C$-$v_{CE}$ curve for a 2N2222 BJT, showing the collector current ($i_C$) versus the collector-emitter voltage ($v_{CE}$) for various base-emitter voltages ($V_{BE}$). The x-axis represents $v_{CE}$ in volts, ranging from 0 to 1 V, while the y-axis represents $i_C$ in milliamperes, ranging from 0 to 12 mA.\n1. **Type of Graph and Function**: This is a set of characteristic curves for a bipolar junction transistor (BJT), specifically illustrating the relationship between collector current and collector-emitter voltage for different base-emitter voltages.\n2. **Axes Labels and Units**: The x-axis is labeled $v_{CE}$ (V) and the y-axis is labeled $i_C$ (mA). Both axes use a linear scale with gridlines for easy value reading.\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends**: Each curve corresponds to a different $V_{BE}$ value, ranging from 650 mV to 710 mV. As $v_{CE}$ increases, $i_C$ initially rises sharply and then stabilizes, indicating the transistor is in the active region. Higher $V_{BE}$ values result in higher $i_C$, reflecting increased transistor activity.\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details**: The curves show a slight upward slope with increasing $v_{CE}$, demonstrating the Early effect, where the effective base width decreases with higher $v_{CE}$, causing a slight increase in $i_C$ even in the active region. The curves do not reach saturation within the given $v_{CE}$ range.\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points**: Each curve is labeled with its corresponding $V_{BE}$ value, clearly showing the effect of base-emitter voltage on collector current. The curves converge towards a common point at higher $v_{CE}$ values, illustrating the Early voltage concept, though this is not explicitly shown due to the limited $v_{CE}$ range in the graph.\n\nFIGURE 2.14: PSpice display of the 2N2222's $i_{C}-V_{C E}$ curves for different $V_{B E}$ values and $0 \\leq v_{C E} \\leq 1 \\mathrm{~V}$.\n\nImage Description (Figure 2.15):\n- Figure 2.15 plots the Early effect and the Early voltage ($V_A$) in a bipolar junction transistor (BJT). The graph shows $i_C$ vs. $v_{CE}$, with the x-axis representing the collector-emitter voltage ($v_{CE}$) in volts and the y-axis representing the collector current ($i_C$) in milliamperes (mA). The x-axis ranges from 0 to 20 volts, and the y-axis ranges from 0 to 15 mA.\n- The graph includes multiple linear curves, each representing a different base-emitter voltage ($V_{BE}$). These curves have a positive slope, indicating that as $v_{CE}$ increases, $i_C$ also increases. The curves start at different y-axis points, reflecting the impact of different $V_{BE}$ values on the collector current.\n- A notable feature is the convergence of all curves at a single point on the negative x-axis, labeled as $-V_A$. This point represents the Early voltage, a conceptual value indicating the extrapolated intersection of the curves. The Early effect is shown by the non-zero slope of the curves, signifying the modulation of the effective base width with changes in $v_{CE}$.\n- The graph overall shows a linear increase in $i_C$ with increasing $v_{CE}$, and the convergence of the curves illustrates the Early effect, where the collector current is influenced by base-width modulation as $v_{CE}$ increases. The graph effectively visualizes the relationship between collector current and collector-emitter voltage under varying base-emitter voltages, highlighting the Early effect's impact on BJT operation.\n\nFIGURE 2.15: Illustrating the Early effect and the Early voltage $V_{A}$.\n\nThe slope of the $i_{C}-v_{C E}$ curves is due to the reduction in the effective base width $W_{B}$ as $v_{C E}$ increases, a phenomenon known as base-width modulation or the Early effect. To understand this, consider a BJT initially biased at a voltage $v_{C E}=V_{C E 1}$ in the active region (see Fig. 2.16a). Let the corresponding base width be $W_{B 1}$, the electron current density be $J_{n 1}$ (see Fig. 2.16b), and the collector current be $I_{C 1}\\left(=J_{n 1} A_{E}\\right)$. If $v_{C E}$ is increased to $V_{C E 2}$, the reverse bias across the B-C junction also increases, enhancing the electric field $E_{C B}$ within its space-charge layer (SCL). Referring to Fig. 2.5, this increase in field lines necessitates a widening of the SCL to expose more ions, thereby reducing the base width to $W_{B 2}\\left(<W_{B 1}\\right)$, as shown in Fig. 2.16b. With a narrower base width, the slope of $n_{B}^{\\prime}(x)$ increases, raising the current density to $J_{n 2}\\left(>J_{n 1}\\right)$, and thus the collector current to $I_{C 2}\\left(>I_{C 1}\\right)$. The causal chain is summarized as:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(\\text { increasing } v_{C E}\\right) & \\Rightarrow(\\text { widens the B-C SCL }) \\Rightarrow\\left(\\text { shrinks } W_{B}\\right) \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow\\left(\\text { increases the slope of } n_{B}^{\\prime}\\right) \\Rightarrow\\left(\\text { increases } J_{n}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nImage Description (a):\n- The graph labeled \"(a)\" depicts the relationship between the collector current \\(i_C\\) and the collector-emitter voltage \\(v_{CE}\\) in a bipolar junction transistor (BJT), demonstrating the Early effect.\n1. **Type of Graph and Function**:\n- This is a linear plot showing the dependency of the collector current \\(i_C\\) on the collector-emitter voltage \\(v_{CE}\\) at a constant base-emitter voltage \\(v_{BE}\\).\n2. **Axes Labels and Units**:\n- The vertical axis represents the collector current \\(i_C\\), typically measured in amperes (A).\n- The horizontal axis represents the collector-emitter voltage \\(v_{CE}\\), typically measured in volts (V).\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends**:\n- The graph shows a set of parallel lines with a positive slope, indicating that as \\(v_{CE}\\) increases, \\(i_C\\) also increases, but at a decreasing rate due to the Early effect.\n- The main line of interest is a bold line indicating a specific \\(v_{BE}\\) value where the collector current \\(i_C\\) is observed.\n- The plot shows a slight increase in \\(i_C\\) as \\(v_{CE}\\) increases, characteristic of the Early effect, indicating \\(i_C\\)'s weak dependence on \\(v_{CE}\\).\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details**:\n- Two points, \\(Q_1\\) and \\(Q_2\\), are marked on the bold line, corresponding to two different \\(v_{CE}\\) values, \\(V_{CE1}\\) and \\(V_{CE2}\\), with corresponding collector currents \\(I_{C1}\\) and \\(I_{C2}\\).\n- The increase in \\(i_C\\) from \\(I_{C1}\\) to \\(I_{C2}\\) as \\(v_{CE}\\) goes from \\(V_{CE1}\\) to \\(V_{CE2}\\) illustrates the Early effect.\n- The graph also shows several other lines with different \\(v_{BE}\\) values, demonstrating how \\(i_C\\) varies with \\(v_{BE}\\) and \\(v_{CE}\\).\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points**:\n- The graph is annotated with \\(V_{BE}\\) to indicate the constant base-emitter voltage at which the observations are made.\n- The points \\(Q_1\\) and \\(Q_2\\) are specifically marked to show the change in \\(i_C\\) with changing \\(v_{CE}\\), highlighting the Early effect in BJTs.\n\nImage Description (b):\n- The graph labeled \"(b)\" illustrates the concept of base-width modulation in a Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) by showing the change in the electron concentration gradient across the base region.\n1. **Type of Graph and Function**:\n- This is a schematic representation of electron concentration as a function of position within the base of a BJT.\n2. **Axes Labels and Units**:\n- The horizontal axis is labeled as \\(x\\), representing the position across the base.\n- The vertical axis is labeled as \\(n'_B(x)\\), indicating the electron concentration gradient, with units of \\(\\text{cm}^{-3}\\).\n- The scale appears linear, with no specific units or markers indicated.\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends**:\n- The graph shows a triangular region where the electron concentration decreases linearly from a maximum at \\(x = 0\\) to zero at the base width, indicating a linear gradient of electron concentration.\n- The slope of the line decreases as the base width narrows, illustrating the Early effect, where a narrower base increases the current density.\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details**:\n- Two key lines are shown: one representing the initial condition with a base width \\(W_{B1}\\) and another showing a reduced base width \\(W_{B2}\\).\n- The initial gradient \\(J_{n1}\\) is steeper than the gradient \\(J_{n2}\\) after the base width is reduced, indicating an increase in current density as \\(W_B\\) decreases.\n- The shaded area represents the increase in current density \\(J_n\\) as the base width narrows.\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points**:\n- The graph highlights the initial electron concentration \\(n_{B0}\\) and its exponential dependence on \\(v_{BE}\\) as \\(n_{B0}(e^{v_{BE}/V_T} - 1)\\).\n- The critical points \\(W_{B1}\\) and \\(W_{B2}\\) are marked to show the change in base width, with \\(W_{B2} < W_{B1}\\).\n- The difference between \\(J_{n1}\\) and \\(J_{n2}\\) is highlighted to emphasize the increase in current density due to base-width modulation.\n\nFIGURE 2.16: Illustrating the effects of base-width modulation.\n\nIt is evident that while $i_{C}$ is primarily controlled by $v_{B E}$, it also has a weak dependence on $v_{C E}$. To account for this dependence, Eq. (2.10) is modified as:\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{C}=I_{s}{ }^{v_{B E} / V_{z}}\\left(1+\\frac{v_{C E}}{V_{A}}\\right) \\tag{2.21}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\nWe observe that the narrower the initial base width of the BJT, the more pronounced the Early effect, and consequently, the lower the value of $V_{A}$. Performing a spot check on the PSpice simulation of Fig. 2.13, as any engineer should for good practice, we select $V_{B E}=700 \\mathrm{mV}$ and use Eq. (2.21) with $V_{C E}=1.0 \\mathrm{~V}$ to find:\n$$\nI_{C}=14.34 \\times 10^{-15} e^{700 / 25.9}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{75}\\right) \\cong 7.9 \\mathrm{~mA}\n$$\nThis result aligns with the plotted value in Fig. 2.13b."
