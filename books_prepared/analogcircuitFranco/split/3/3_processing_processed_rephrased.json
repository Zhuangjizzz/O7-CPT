Essentially, a DMOSFET comprises a thin layer of $n$-type material termed the channel, forming a parallel-plate capacitor with the gate electrode. The channel's source end provides a rich supply of free electrons designed to flow to the opposite end, termed the drain. The source and drain functions resemble those of the triode's cathode and plate (or the BJT's emitter and collector). The gate, akin to the triode's grid (or the BJT's base), modulates the channel's conductivity, thus controlling electron flow from source to drain.

Contemporary ICs often integrate digital and analog functions, termed mixed-signal or mixed-mode ICs.\n\nMicroelectronics is undeniably exciting, challenging, and rapidly evolving. Beginners may feel overwhelmed, but focusing on general principles that transcend current technologies is crucial for understanding new developments and maintaining a successful engineering career.\n\nCHAPTER HIGHLIGHTS\nThis chapter commences with an examination of the MOSFET's physical structure, fundamental semiconductor principles, device characteristics, operating regions, and modeling. Emphasis is placed on practical aspects relevant to today's industry (rules of thumb). The chapter focuses on long-channel FETs (channel lengths of several micrometers or more) due to their predictable behavior and ease of modeling, suitable for beginners. However, modern ICs use short-channel FETs (channel lengths less than $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$), where higher-order effects like carrier velocity saturation cause deviations from long-channel behavior. These short-channel effects necessitate complex models for accurate results, typically handled by computer simulations. We will use long-channel models for intuitive understanding and rely on simulations for precision.\n\nAfter exploring various resistive MOSFET circuits to grasp basic operation, the chapter delves into the MOSFET's roles as an amplifier in analog electronics and a switch in digital electronics. We develop large-signal and small-signal models for FETs, examining the common-source (CS), common-drain (CD), and common-gate (CG) amplifier configurations. The CS configuration is ideal for voltage amplification, while the CD and CG configurations serve as voltage and current buffers, respectively. The MOSFET's role as a resistance transformation device, foundational to its name, is emphasized, with transformation equations provided for reference.\n\nThe chapter focuses on discrete amplifiers, constructed from individual transistors, resistors, and capacitors. The CD4007 CMOS Transistor Array, containing three $n$ MOSFETs and three $p$ MOSFETs, is a useful experimental tool. Despite modern MOSFET amplifiers being predominantly IC-based, studying discrete designs aids understanding and reveals principles applicable to ICs. Mastery of single-transistor discrete design prepares us for the complexity of multi-transistor ICs, covered in Chapter 4.\n\nThe chapter concludes with a detailed analysis of the CMOS inverter/amplifier, a fundamental IC building block demonstrating CMOS versatility in both analog and digital domains. Basic CMOS logic gates are also discussed in detail.\n\nThroughout, PSpice is extensively used as a software oscilloscope for displaying MOSFET characteristics, transfer curves, and waveforms, and as a verification tool for DC and AC calculations."

In fact, as early as 1925, Julius Lilienfeld patented a device that is now recognized as the field-effect transistor (FET). Due to fabrication challenges at the time, he could not make it operational. Approximately 35 years later, in 1960, Dawon Kahng and John Atalla at Bell Laboratories successfully demonstrated the first metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) type FET, commonly referred to as the MOSFET.\n\nThe MOSFET that most closely resembles the vacuum-tube triode is the $n$-channel depletion-type MOSFET ( $n$-channel DMOSFET), one of four possible MOSFET variants. Simply put, a DMOSFET comprises a thin layer of $n$-type material known as the channel, forming a parallel-plate capacitor with an electrode termed the gate. One end of the channel, called the source, serves as a abundant source of free electrons designed to flow to the opposite end, known as the drain. The functions of the source and drain are analogous to those of the cathode and plate in the triode (or the emitter and collector in the BJT). The gate's role, similar to the grid in the triode (or the base in the BJT), is to modulate the channel's conductivity, thereby controlling electron flow from source to drain. Specifically, applying a negative gate voltage induces a positive charge in the channel, reducing the concentration of free electrons. A sufficiently negative gate voltage depletes the channel of free electrons, halting current flow entirely. By analogy, FET behavior can be compared to controlling water flow in a garden hose by squeezing it, potentially stopping the flow completely.\n\nFollowing the successful demonstration of the first MOSFET, this new technology found applications particularly where its advantages of smaller size and lower power consumption made it competitive with the BJT. The first battery-powered electronic calculators and wristwatches utilized this technology. Additionally, RCA introduced a new digital integrated circuit (IC) family called complementary MOS (CMOS), offering a low-power alternative to the then dominant bipolar logic family, TTL. In 1971, Intel employed MOS technology to develop the first microprocessor. Since then, IC electronics has advanced exponentially, permeating nearly every facet of modern life. This remarkable growth is governed by Moore's law, which posits that due to ongoing advancements in IC fabrication, the number of devices that can be integrated on a given chip area doubles approximately every 18 months. Formulated in 1965, this law remains valid, though it is acknowledged that technological progress will eventually encounter physical limits, leading to its obsolescence.\n\nOver time, the MOSFET has surpassed the BJT, particularly in high-density IC electronics, due to its aforementioned benefits of smaller size and lower power consumption. Nevertheless, in applications like high-performance analog electronics, the BJT remains the preferred transistor type. To leverage the strengths of both BJTs and MOSFETs, these devices are sometimes fabricated together on the same chip, resulting in biCMOS technology, which offers greater design possibilities than either all-BJT or all-MOSFET technologies alone. Furthermore, contemporary ICs often integrate both digital and analog functions on a single chip, hence the term mixed-signal or mixed-mode ICs.\n\nMicroelectronics is undoubtedly an exhilarating, challenging, and rapidly evolving field. Beginners may find it overwhelming, and rightly so. However, as we delve into the study of today's dominant processes and devices, we will focus on general principles that transcend current technological contexts and can be applied to understand new processes and devices as they emerge and mature. Emphasizing general principles, coupled with ongoing education, is essential for young engineers aiming to establish and sustain a fulfilling career in this seemingly ever-changing field.\n\n**CHAPTER HIGHLIGHTS**\nThe chapter initiates with an examination of the MOSFET's physical structure, fundamental semiconductor principles, device characteristics, operating regions, and modeling. Significant emphasis is placed on practical aspects relevant to today's industrial environment (rules of thumb). The FETs analyzed are of the long-channel type (channel lengths several micrometers or longer) because their behavior aligns well with theoretical predictions, making them easier to model and understand for beginners. However, modern IC processes utilize short-channel devices (channel lengths a fraction of $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$). At these small scales, higher-order effects, particularly carrier velocity saturation, can cause significant deviations from long-channel behavior. These short-channel effects necessitate more complex formalisms and sophisticated models for accurate results, though these advanced models are more suited for computer simulations than hand analysis. We will primarily use the formalism and models of long-channel devices to develop an intuitive understanding of MOSFETs, relying on computer simulations for precise results.\n\nAfter exploring various resistive MOSFET circuits to build a foundational understanding of MOSFET circuit operation, we examine the MOSFET in its two primary applications: as an amplifier in analog electronics and as a switch in digital electronics. We then develop appropriate large-signal and small-signal models for FETs, enabling us to analyze the three basic amplifier configurations: common-source (CS), common-drain (CD), and common-gate (CG). The CS configuration is presented as the natural choice for voltage amplification, while the CD and CG configurations are ideal for voltage and current buffering, respectively. Emphasis is also placed on the MOSFET's role as a resistance transformation device, which is the basis for the term \"transistor.\" Transformation equations are provided in a convenient table for easy reference in subsequent chapters.\n\nThe amplifiers discussed in this chapter are discrete, constructed using individual transistors, resistors, and capacitors. (The CD4007 CMOS Transistor Array, containing three $n$ MOSFETs and three $p$ MOSFETs, is a useful tool for laboratory experiments.) Although MOSFET amplifiers are now predominantly implemented in IC form, studying discrete designs is primarily educational, as they are easier to comprehend and reveal important principles applicable to IC implementations. Mastering discrete single-transistor amplifier design will better equip us to handle the complexity of multi-transistor ICs, a topic covered in Chapter 4.\n\nFor the benefit of computer engineering students, the chapter concludes with an in-depth analysis of the CMOS inverter/amplifier, a fundamental IC building block that showcases the versatility of CMOS technology in both analog and digital domains. Basic CMOS logic gates are also discussed in detail.\n\nThe chapter extensively utilizes PSpice both as a software oscilloscope to display MOSFET characteristics, transfer curves, and waveforms, and as a verification tool for DC and AC calculations."

    "text": "The prevailing IC technology today employs the $n$ MOSFET along with its counterpart, the $p$ MOSFET, collectively known as complementary MOS (or CMOS) technology. This approach necessitates the fabrication of both types of devices on a single substrate. A $p$ MOSFET is created by reversing the doping types of the body, source, and drain regions of an $n$ MOSFET, resulting in an $n^{-}$ body and $p^{+}$ source and drain regions. To facilitate the coexistence of these devices on a shared substrate, the $p$ MOSFET is situated within a locally doped $n$-type ($n^{-}$) substrate, referred to as a well or tub, which is formed through a separate diffusion process into the existing $p^{-}$ wafer before transistor fabrication.\n\nThe structure is illustrated in cross-section in Fig. 3.2, where subscripts $n$ and $p$ denote the terminals of the $n$ MOSFET and $p$ MOSFET, respectively. The $n$ MOSFET, positioned to the left of center, resembles that in Fig. 3.1, but its body connection ($B_{n}$) is at the top left, rather than at the bottom as depicted in the simplified version of Fig. 3.1.

The $p$ MOSFET, located to the right of center, resides within its own $n^{-}$ well, with the well connection ($B_{p}$) at the top right.

This is achieved by growing a ring of $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ insulator material, known as field oxide, around each transistor's intended location before fabrication. Each transistor must be electrically isolated not only from neighboring devices but also from its own body. The $p$-type body of the $n$ MOSFET forms $p n$ junctions with the $n$-type source and drain regions, so $B_{n}$ is connected to the most negative voltage (MNV) in the circuit to keep these junctions reverse biased and in cutoff under all circuit conditions. Similarly, the $n$-type well of the $p$ MOSFET forms $n p$ junctions with the $p$-type source and drain regions, so $B_{p}$ is connected to the most positive voltage (MPV) in the circuit to maintain cutoff under all conditions. For example, in a digital CMOS circuit powered between 5 V and ground, $B_{n}$ is linked to ground, and $B_{p}$ is connected to +5 V. These connections are made internally by the manufacturer."

    "text": "To explore the mechanism of channel formation in an $n$ MOSFET, we concentrate on its gate-oxide-bulk configuration, which resembles a parallel-plate capacitor, albeit with plates composed of different materials. While earlier MOSFETs utilized metal, such as aluminum, for the gate electrode, contemporary designs employ $n^{+}$silicon, leading to the term \"silicon-gate processes\" for modern techniques. The $n^{+}$silicon film, grown atop amorphous oxide, comprises sub-micrometer-sized crystallites rather than a single crystal, earning it the name polysilicon.

However, if $G$ and $B$ are externally connected as in Fig. 3.3a, electrons will diffuse from the electron-rich $n^{+}$ gate, through the connection, to the electron-deficient $p^{-}$ bulk, leaving behind a layer of immobile positive donor ions in the gate. Once in the bulk, these excess electrons recombine with holes to satisfy the mass-action law, resulting in the formation of a layer of immobile negative acceptor ions in the bulk. These two layers concentrate near the gate-oxide and bulk-oxide interfaces to minimize the system's electrostatic energy. Just as in a $p n$ junction, these space-charge layers create an electric field $E$ from the gate, through the oxide, to the bulk, reaching an equilibrium where this field prevents further electron diffusion through the external connection. Associated with this field is a built-in potential $\\phi_{0}=\\phi_{n}-\\phi_{p}$ across the gate-bulk structure, where\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\phi_{p}=V_{T} \\ln \\frac{n_{i}}{N_{A}} \\quad \\phi_{n}=V_{T} \\ln \\frac{N_{D}}{n_{i}} \\tag{3.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nare the equilibrium electrostatic potentials (also known as Fermi potentials) of the bulk and gate, respectively.

Since both $N_{A}$ and $N_{D}$ exceed $n_{i}$, we have $\\phi_{p}<0$ and $\\phi_{n}>0$. Additionally, since $N_{A}$ and $N_{D}$ appear in the logarithmic function's argument, $\\phi_{p}$ and $\\phi_{n}$ are not highly sensitive to variations in doping levels.\n\nAn ordinary capacitor with its plates shorted together will be in a discharged state $(Q=0)$. However, if the plates are made of different materials, as in this case, $Q \\neq 0$ even when $V_{G B}=0$. To drive $Q$ to zero, as shown in Fig. $3.3 b$, a voltage $V_{G B}$ of equal magnitude but opposite polarity to $\\phi_{0}$, or $V_{G B}=-\\phi_{0}=\\phi_{p}-\\phi_{n}$, must be applied. This value of $V_{G B}(<0)$ is also known as the flatband voltage due to its effect on the energy bands of the bulk material.

In this scenario, however, no current flows due to the oxide insulator separating the two regions."

Here, $V_{T}=k T / q$ is the thermal voltage ( $V_{T} \\cong 26 \\mathrm{mV}$ at $T=300 \\mathrm{~K}), N_{A}$ and $N_{D}$ are the doping densities in the bulk and gate materials, and $n_{i}$ is the intrinsic electron-hole concentration of silicon $\\left(n_{i} \\cong 1.4 \\times 10^{10} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}\\right.$ at $T=$ 300 K ). Since both $N_{A}$ and $N_{D}$ exceed $n_{i}$, $\\phi_{p}<0$ and $\\phi_{n}>0$. Moreover, due to the logarithmic function's argument, $\\phi_{p}$ and $\\phi_{n}$ are not highly sensitive to variations in doping levels.\n\nAn ordinary capacitor with its plates shorted would be in a discharged state $(Q=0)$. However, if the plates are made of different materials, as in this case, $Q \\neq 0$ even when $V_{G B}=0$. To reduce $Q$ to zero, as in Fig. $3.3 b$, a voltage $V_{G B}$ equal in magnitude but opposite in polarity to $\\phi_{0}$ must be applied, i.e., $V_{G B}=-\\phi_{0}=\\phi_{p}-\\phi_{n}$. This $V_{G B}(<0)$ value is termed the flatband voltage due to its impact on the bulk material's energy bands. This voltage will serve as the reference for subsequent analysis.\n\nEXAMPLE 3.1 Given $N_{A}=10^{16} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and $N_{D}=10^{20} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$, determine the electrostatic potentials and the $V_{G B}$ required to eliminate the space-charge layers.\n\n#### Solution\n\nFrom Eq. (3.2),\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\phi_{p}=0.026 \\ln \\frac{1.4 \\times 10^{10}}{10^{16}}=-0.35 \\mathrm{~V} \\\\\n& \\phi_{n}=0.026 \\ln \\frac{10^{20}}{1.4 \\times 10^{10}}=+0.59 \\mathrm{~V}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTo achieve charge neutrality in the gate and bulk, the gate must be biased more negatively than the body, resulting in $V_{G B}=-\\phi_{0}=-0.35-0.59=-0.94 \\mathrm{~V}$.\n\nRemark: If the gate-bulk were an ordinary $n p$ junction, a $V_{G B}=-0.94 \\mathrm{~V}$ would heavily forward bias it, causing a significant forward current from the $p$-bulk (anode) to the $n$-gate (cathode). In this scenario, however, no current flows due to the insulating oxide layer separating the two."

The PMOS is configured such that the gate-source voltage V_GS is less than the threshold voltage V_tp0, indicating the condition for strong inversion.\n\nFIGURE 3.6 The onset of strong inversion in (a) the $n$ MOSFET and (b) the pMOSFET.\n\nThe initial three terms are identical to those in Eq. (3.6). The subsequent term, involving the unit-area charge $Q_{o x}$, accounts for dangling bonds in the bulk at the interface and positive ions trapped in the oxide near the oxide-bulk interface during fabrication. ${ }^{2}$ The first four terms constitute the native threshold of the $n$ MOSFET. The final term, involving the unit-area charge $Q_{i}$, accounts for impurities intentionally introduced by the manufacturer at the oxide-bulk interface to adjust $V_{t 0}$ to the desired value. For $p$-type impurities, $Q_{i}<0$, and for $n$-type impurities, $Q_{i}>0$. For this reason, the native threshold is also referred to as the undoped threshold.\n\nUsing the data from Example 3.2, along with a surface state density $N_{o x}=$ $2 \\times 10^{11}$ positive ions/ $\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$,\n(a) Determine the native threshold of the $n$ MOSFET.\n(b) Identify the implant type and dosage $N_{i}$ required for $V_{t 0}=+1.0 \\mathrm{~V}$.\n(c) Identify the implant type and dosage $N_{i}$ required for $V_{t 0}=-1.0 \\mathrm{~V}$.\n\n#### Solution\n\n(a) We calculate $Q_{o x}=q N_{o x}=1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\times 2 \\times 10^{11}=32 \\mathrm{nC} / \\mathrm{cm}^{2}$. Using the result from Example 3.2,\n\n$$\nV_{t 0}=0.11-\\frac{32}{138}=-0.122 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\n(b) To increase $V_{t 0}$ from its native value of -0.122 V to +1.0 V, a $p$-type implant, such as boron, is needed, which will introduce negative ions ( $Q_{i}<0$ ) in the bulk near the surface. By setting\n\n$$\n+1.0=-0.122-\\frac{Q_{i}}{C_{o x}}=-0.122-\\frac{-q N_{i}}{C_{o x}}=-0.122+\\frac{1.602 \\times 10^{-19} N_{i}}{138 \\times 10^{-9}}\n$$\n\nwe find $N_{i}=9.66 \\times 10^{11} p$-type ions $/ \\mathrm{cm}^{2}$.\n(c) To decrease $V_{t 0}$ from its native value of -0.122 V to -1.0 V, an $n$-type implant, such as phosphorus, is required, which will introduce positive ions ( $Q_{i}>0$ ) in the bulk near the surface.

    "text": "When we elevate $v_{DS}$, an intriguing phenomenon unfolds: the channel's cross-section narrows, as exemplified in Fig. 3.9b. This results from the discrepancy in overdrive voltages at the source and drain ends. At the source, the overdrive is $V_{OV}=V_{GS}-V_{t}$, whereas at the drain, it diminishes to $V_{OV}=\\left(V_{GS}-v_{DS}\\right)-V_{t}$. For example, if $V_{t}=1 \\mathrm{~V}$, $V_{GS}=5 \\mathrm{~V}$, and $v_{DS}=$ 2 V, the overdrive at the source computes to $V_{OV(\\text {source})}=5-1=4 \\mathrm{~V}$, while at the drain, it computes to $V_{OV(\\text {drain})}=(5-2)-1=2 \\mathrm{~V}$. In this scenario, the channel at the drain end is merely half the thickness of that at the source end.\n\nFor a quantitative examination, consult Fig. 3.10, where the channel is envisioned as a sliced loaf, with focus on a slice of width $d y$ at a distance $y$ from the source. The voltage at each slice spans from 0 V at the source end to $v_{DS}$ at the drain end. The slice of interest experiences a voltage $v(y)$ between these two extremes, i.e., $0 \\leq v(y) \\leq v_{DS}$. The gate forms a capacitance $d C=C_{ox} \\times W \\times d y$ with the channel slice, thus the induced channel charge $d Q_{n}$ is given by the capacitance equation:\n\n$$\nd Q_{n}=-d C\\left\\{\\left[V_{GS}-v(y)\\right]-V_{t}\\right\\}=-C_{ox} W d y\\left[V_{GS}-V_{t}-v(y)\\right]\n$$\n\n(The charge is negative due to the presence of electrons.) The voltage drop $v_{DS}$ across the channel generates an electric field $E$ directed from drain to source. This field drives the negative charge packet $d Q_{n}$ towards the drain, thereby generating the current $i_{D}$. By definition,\n\n$$\ni_{D}=-\\frac{d Q_{n}}{d t}=C_{ox} W\\left[V_{GS}-V_{t}-v(y)\\right] \\frac{d y}{d t}\n$$\n\nHere, $d y / d t$ signifies the drift velocity of $d Q_{n}$ towards the drain. This velocity is proportional to the electric field, i.e., $d y / d t=-\\mu_{n} E(y)$, with $\\mu_{n}$ being the electron mobility. (The negative sign arises because electrons move against the electric field.) Since electric field and potential are related by $E(y)=-d v(y) / d y$, we have $d y / d t=\\mu_{n} d v(y) / d y$. Substituting this into the previous equation yields\n\n$$\ni_{D}=\\mu_{n} C_{ox} W\\left[V_{GS}-V_{t}-v(y)\\right] \\frac{d v(y)}{d y}\n$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $d y$ and integrating from $y=0$ (where $v(y)=0$) to $y=L$ (where $v(y)=v_{DS}$) gives\n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L} i_{D} d y=\\mu_{n} C_{ox} W \\int_{0}^{v_{DS}}\\left[V_{GS}-V_{t}-v(y)\\right] d v(y)\n$$\n\nThe left side integrates to $i_{D} L$, and the right side integrates to $\\left(V_{GS}-V_{t}\\right) v_{DS}-1 / 2 v_{DS}^{2}$.

Common to all devices, it is distinctive of the fabrication process, thus the term 'process'. Figure 3.11 displays the $i_{D}$ versus $v_{DS}$ plot for a certain overdrive voltage $V_{OV}$.\n\nIn the region near the origin, where $v_{DS}$ is small enough to render the quadratic term negligible in Eq.

Consequently, $k=\\left(50 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} / \\mathrm{V}^{2}\\right) 5=250 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} / \\mathrm{V}^{2}$.\n(b) From Eq.

For $V_{GS} \\leq 1 \\mathrm{~V}$, the MOSFET is in cutoff, resulting in $r_{DS}=\\infty$.\n\nWith further increase in $v_{DS}$, the channel narrows progressively at the drain end, and the quadratic term in Eq. (3.12) becomes more significant. As a result, the curve's slope decreases, indicating a rise in the channel's dynamic resistance. This operational region is termed the triode region, drawing an analogy with vacuum tubes exhibiting similar traits.

By definition, $i_{D}$ is determined by the rate of change of the induced charge, and the velocity of the charge packet is proportional to the electric field. This relationship allows us to derive an equation for $i_{D}$ in terms of the channel voltage profile.\n\nIntegrating this equation across the channel length yields an expression for $i_{D}$ that includes both linear and quadratic terms in $v_{DS}$. This expression is particularly insightful as it encapsulates the channel's behavior under different operating conditions. The linear term dominates for small $v_{DS}$, characterizing the ohmic region, while the quadratic term becomes significant at higher $v_{DS}$, defining the triode region.\n\nThe graph in Fig. 3.11 plots $i_{D}$ against $v_{DS}$, showcasing the transition from the ohmic to the triode region as $v_{DS}$ increases. The channel resistance $r_{DS}$, which is influenced by the overdrive $V_{OV}$ and the channel dimensions, can be manipulated by the IC designer to achieve desired characteristics.\n\nFinally, the widening of the depletion layer as $v_{DS}$ increases, as depicted in Fig. 3.9, is a visual representation of the channel constriction and the corresponding changes in the transistor's behavior."
