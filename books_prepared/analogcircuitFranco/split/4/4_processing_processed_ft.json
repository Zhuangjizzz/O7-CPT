The voltage gain is the ratio of the change in the output voltage to the change in the input voltage. Since the collectors are connected to ground through $R_{C}$ and $r_{o}$ in parallel, the effective load seen by each transistor is $R_{C} || r_{o}$. Therefore, the differential mode gain $a_{dm}$ is given by $a_{dm} = - (R_{C} || r_{o}) / r_{e}$, where $r_{e}$ is the small-signal emitter resistance. This negative sign indicates that the output voltage is 180 degrees out of phase with the input voltage."

In a Class AB amplifier, each transistor is biased to conduct for slightly more than half a cycle, overlapping the conduction periods to mitigate crossover distortion.
