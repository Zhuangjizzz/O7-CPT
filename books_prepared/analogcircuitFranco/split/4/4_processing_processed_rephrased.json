Indeed, the first transistor circuits were essentially replicas of vacuum-tube circuit designs, albeit with appropriate adjustments to power supplies and associated components. Broadly, these circuits fall into the category we have previously explored, commonly known as discrete circuits.\n\nBy the late 1950s, it became apparent that the significant miniaturization and power reduction achieved with transistors could be further leveraged by creating entire circuits—comprising transistors, diodes, resistors, and small capacitors, along with their interconnections—on a single piece of semiconductor material, or chip. This concept, also termed an integrated circuit (IC), was first realized in 1958 by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments and independently in 1959 by Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor. The 1960s witnessed intense development, culminating in the creation of the first monolithic operational amplifier by Fairchild Semiconductor (mA Series) and the introduction of digital IC families such as transistor-transistor logic (TTL) by Texas Instruments (7400 Series) and emitter-coupled logic (ECL) by Motorola (10K Series).\n\nSimultaneously, in the early 1960s, the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) emerged as a commercial product. Compared to the BJT, the MOSFET provided benefits of reduced size and lower power consumption. This technology paved the way for the first battery-powered electronic calculators and wristwatches, as well as a low-power alternative to the dominant TTL bipolar logic family, specifically the CMOS digital family of the 4000 Series by RCA. These innovations were followed by the debut of the first microprocessor by Intel in 1971. Since then, IC technology has advanced exponentially, permeating nearly every facet of modern life. This remarkable growth has been guided by Moore's law, which posits that due to ongoing advancements in IC fabrication, the number of devices that can be integrated onto a chip doubles approximately every 18 months. First articulated in 1965, this principle remains valid today, although it is acknowledged that technological progress will eventually encounter physical limits, potentially leading to the law's obsolescence.\n\nThe BJT, having been the predominant semiconductor device for nearly three decades, has been surpassed by the MOSFET, particularly in high-density ICs, due to the latter's advantages of smaller size and lower power consumption. Nevertheless, the BJT remains the preferred choice in high-performance general-purpose analog ICs and in specialized discrete designs, thanks to the availability of a diverse range of devices. It is also feasible to fabricate BJTs and MOSFETs together on the same chip, albeit with an increase in fabrication steps and cost. This hybrid technology, known as BiCMOS, leverages the strengths of both transistor types to offer more innovative design solutions. Modern ICs often integrate both digital and analog functions on a single chip, hence the term mixed-signal or mixed-mode ICs. Typically, designers aim to implement as many functions as possible in digital form, resorting to analog circuitry primarily when interfacing with the external, inherently analog world.\n\nCHAPTER HIGHLIGHTS\n\nThe chapter commences with a comparison between discrete and monolithic design. It then reviews BJT and FET characteristics, focusing on second-order effects that were intentionally omitted in earlier introductory chapters but are pertinent to monolithic circuit implementations. The basic single-transistor configurations from Chapters 2 and 3 are also revisited, this time from a monolithic perspective, where dc biasing and output loading are provided by other transistors functioning as current sources or sinks, rather than by resistors.\n\nSubsequently, the chapter explores various multiple-transistor circuit configurations that have become standard building blocks in analog ICs. These include Darlington and cascode configurations, differential pairs, current mirrors, dc current sources and sinks, active-loaded gain stages, and push-pull output stages. Special emphasis is placed on the differential pair, which forms the core of most analog ICs. Initially, the pair is examined under the idealized assumption of perfectly matched components, followed by an analysis of the impact of fabrication mismatches on input offset errors and common-mode rejection ratio. Whenever feasible, BJT and FET implementations are discussed in parallel to avoid redundancy and to highlight the similarities and differences between the two technologies.\n\nThis chapter introduces students to a range of ingenious design solutions that contribute to the allure of analog electronics.

    "text": "To elucidate the parallels and disparities between discrete and integrated circuit (IC) design, we can examine the conventional common-emitter (CE) configuration from Fig. 4.1, which, in the era of discrete components preceding ICs, served as the primary means for voltage amplification. Assuming that each capacitor behaves as an AC short circuit relative to the equivalent resistance of the circuit it's part of, the small-signal gain can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\na=\\frac{v_{o}}{v_{i}}=-g_{m}\\left(r_{o} / / R_{C}\\right) \\tag{4.1a}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nTo adapt this design for monolithic fabrication, we must eliminate the capacitors and substitute the resistors with appropriately biased transistors wherever feasible. The process involves the following steps:\n\n- The role of $C_{1}$ in Fig. 4.1 is to bridge the DC disparity between the input source (usually with a DC component of 0 V) and the base (commonly biased at $1 / 3 V_{C C}$), while also providing an AC short between source and base ($v_{b} \\rightarrow v_{i}$). The optimal approach to remove $C_{1}$ is to directly couple the input source to the base, as depicted in Fig. 4.2a. DC coupling also obviates the need for the biasing resistors $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$.\n- The purpose of $R_{E}$ in Fig. 4.1 is to set the bias current $I_{E}$, whereas $C_{2}$'s function is to ensure an AC ground at the emitter ($v_{e} \\rightarrow 0$). Both these functions can be achieved, at least in theory, by biasing the emitter negatively with a suitable voltage source $V_{B E 1}=V_{T} \\ln \\left(I_{C 1} / I_{s 1}\\right)$, as shown in Fig. 4.2a.\n\nThe descriptions of the images have been provided in the context as textual representations of the circuit diagrams and graphs. The diagrams illustrate the transformation from a discrete voltage amplifier circuit to one suitable for monolithic fabrication, and the graphs depict the output voltage waveforms of the amplifier circuits. The additional information provided offers a detailed explanation of the circuit components and their functions.\n\nFor the transformation to monolithic fabrication, the resistors are replaced with biased transistors, and the capacitors are removed to achieve direct DC coupling. The AC equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 4.2b, where the AC resistance $r_{o p}$ is considered instead of $R_{C}$ for gain calculation. The gain equation is modified to account for the parameters of the NPN and PNP transistors used.\n\nThe operational conditions for the transistors to maintain the gain equation are specified, and the output voltage swing (OVS) is defined by the voltages $v_{O(\\min )}$ and $v_{O(\\max )}$. The gain is calculated for a given example, and the output voltage $v_{o}(t)$ is determined for an input signal. It is noted that the gain with an active load can be significantly higher than with a discrete load, and further gain enhancement is possible by increasing the effective resistance at the collector of the PNP transistor.\n\nThe need for precise biasing schemes is discussed, considering the required accuracy and stability against temperature variations. The implementation of these schemes in IC technology is attributed to the availability of matching and tracking capabilities, which will be demonstrated in subsequent sections."

    "text": "To exemplify the likenesses as well as disparities between discrete and monolithic design, we should revisit the conventional CE configuration of Fig. 4.1, which was the mainstay of voltage amplification in the era of discrete designs prior to the advent of integrated circuits. Assuming each capacitor behaves as an AC short in comparison to the equivalent resistance offered by the encompassing circuitry, the small-signal gain assumes the following form:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\na=\\frac{v_{o}}{v_{i}}=-g_{m}\\left(r_{o} / / R_{C}\\right) \\tag{4.1a}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nTo transpose this design into a form appropriate for monolithic fabrication, we must eliminate the capacitors and substitute the resistors with suitably biased transistors whenever feasible. The subsequent steps are pertinent:\n\n- The role of $C_{1}$ in Fig. 4.1 is to rectify the DC discrepancy between the input source (usually with a DC component of 0 V) and the base (typically biased at $1 / 3 V_{C C}$) while establishing an AC short between source and base ($\\left.v_{b} \\rightarrow v_{i}\\right)$). The optimal method to discard $C_{1}$ is to connect the input source directly to the base, as depicted in Fig. 4.2a. DC coupling also obviates the need for the biasing resistors $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$.\n- The function of $R_{E}$ in Fig. 4.1 is to set the bias current $I_{E}$, whereas that of $C_{2}$ is to guarantee an AC ground at the emitter ($\\left.v_{e} \\rightarrow 0\\right)$). Both functions can be fulfilled, at least theoretically, by biasing the emitter negatively through a suitable voltage source $V_{B E 1}=V_{T} \\ln \\left(I_{C 1} / I_{s 1}\\right)$, as also demonstrated in Fig. 4.2a.\n- The function of $R_{C}$ in Fig. 4.1 is to bias the collector, usually at $V_{O} \\cong 2 / 3 V_{C C}$, while also determining the gain, in accordance with Eq. $4.1 a$. The most effective way to eliminate $R_{C}$ is to substitute it with a pnp BJT operating as a current source, as also illustrated in Fig. 4.2a. Once this is executed, the AC equivalent becomes as depicted in Fig. 4.2b, where $r_{o p}$ is the AC resistance perceived when looking into $Q_{4}$ 's collector, now assuming the role of $R_{C}$ in the gain expression. Consequently, Eq. (4.1a) transforms into\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\na=\\frac{v_{o}}{v_{i}}=-g_{m n}\\left(r_{o n} / / r_{o p}\\right) \\tag{4.1b}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere we are utilizing subscripts $n$ and $p$ to differentiate between the parameters of the $n p n$ and $p n p$ BJTs.

DC coupling also obviates the need for biasing resistors $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$.\n- The purpose of $R_{E}$ in Fig. 4.1 is to set the bias current $I_{E}$, while the function of $C_{2}$ is to ensure an AC ground at the emitter ($v_{e} \\rightarrow 0$). Both these roles can, in principle, be fulfilled by negatively biasing the emitter using a suitable voltage source $V_{B E 1}=V_{T} \\ln \\left(I_{C 1} / I_{s 1}\\right)$, as demonstrated in Fig. 4.2a.\n\nThe circuit depicted in Fig. 4.1 is a discrete voltage amplifier where the bias current $I_E$ is set by $R_E$, and $C_2$ ensures an AC ground at the emitter. An NPN transistor $Q_1$ is utilized for amplification.\n\nFigure 4.2(a) presents a discrete voltage amplifier using two transistors, $Q_1$ and $Q_4$. $Q_1$ is an NPN transistor responsible for amplification, and $Q_4$ is a PNP transistor connected to $V_{CC}$.

Additional voltage sources $V_{EB4}$ and $V_{BE1}$ are used for biasing.\n\nThe graph labeled \"Waveform Shape\" represents a time-domain waveform of an AC signal, characteristic of AC signals in amplification circuits. The waveform is sinusoidal, indicating periodic oscillations with a peak voltage $v_{o(\\text{max})}$ and a minimum voltage $v_{o(\\text{min})}$. The waveform oscillates around a central DC level $V_O$, highlighting the superposition of the AC component $v_o$ on the DC level.\n\nFigure 4.2(b) shows an AC amplifier circuit with an NPN transistor $Q_1$. The input voltage $v_i$ is applied to the base of $Q_1$, and the output voltage $v_o$ is taken from the collector.

It is evident that Eq. (4.1b) will hold true only if $v_{o}$ is confined within this range, i.e., for $v_{O(\\min )} \\leq v_{O} \\leq v_{O(\\text { max })}$.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 4.1\n\n(a) In the circuit of Fig. $4.2 a$, assume $Q_{1}$ has $I_{s}=10 \\mathrm{fA}, V_{A}=100 \\mathrm{~V}$, and $V_{C E(\\operatorname{EOS})}=$\n\n0.2 V, and let $Q_{4}$ have $I_{s}=5 \\mathrm{fA}, V_{A}=75 \\mathrm{~V}$, and $V_{E C(\\mathrm{EOS})}=0.2 \\mathrm{~V}$. If $V_{C C}=10 \\mathrm{~V}$, specify appropriate values for $V_{B E}$ and $V_{E B}$ so that with $v_{I}=0$ the BJTs draw 1 mA and $V_{O}$ lies in the middle of the OVS.\n(b) Determine the AC gain $a$ as well as $v_{o}(t)$ if $v_{I}(t)=V_{I}+v_{i}(t)=0 \\mathrm{~V}+(2.5 \\mathrm{mV}) \\cos \\omega t$. Does $v_{o}(t)$ remain within the linear output range at all times?\n\n#### Solution\n\n(a) Using Eq. (4.2), we find:\n\n$$\nv_{O(\\min )} \\cong 0.2-0.7=-0.5 \\mathrm{~V} \\quad v_{O(\\max )} \\cong 10-0.2=9.8 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nTo bias the output in the center of the OVS, we require:\n\n$$\nV_{O}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left[v_{O(\\max )}+v_{O(\\min )}\\right]=\\frac{1}{2}(9.8-0.5)=4.65 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nFor $Q_{1}$, applying Eq. (2.21), we get:\n\n$$\nI_{C 1}=I_{s} e^{V_{B E 1} / V_{T}}\\left(1+\\frac{V_{C E 1}}{V_{A 1}}\\right)\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n10^{-3}=10 \\times 10^{-15} \\times e^{V_{B E} /(26 \\mathrm{mV})}\\left(1+\\frac{4.65-(-0.7)}{100}\\right)\n$$\n\nSolving this, we obtain $V_{B E 1}=657.2 \\mathrm{mV}$. Adapting the above expression to $Q_{4}$ 's collector current yields:\n\n$$\n10^{-3}=5 \\times 10^{-15} \\times e^{V_{E A /} /(26 \\mathrm{mV})}\\left(1+\\frac{10-4.65}{75}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhich gives $V_{E B 4}=674.8 \\mathrm{mV}$.\n(b) With $g_{m n}=1 /(26 \\Omega), r_{o n}=100 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$, and $r_{o p}=75 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$, Eq. (4.1b) yields:\n\n$$\na=-\\frac{100 / / 75}{0.026}=-1,648 \\mathrm{~V} / \\mathrm{V}\n$$\n\nConsequently, since $(2.5 \\mathrm{mV}) \\times 1648=4.12 \\mathrm{~V}$, we have:\n\n$$\nv_{o}(t)=V_{O}+v_{o}(t)=4.65 \\mathrm{~V}+(4.12 \\mathrm{~V}) \\cos \\left(\\omega t-180^{\\circ}\\right)\n$$\n\nIt is noted that $v_{O}$ fluctuates between $4.65+4.12=8.77 \\mathrm{~V}$ and $4.65-4.12=0.53 \\mathrm{~V}$, indicating that the condition $v_{O(\\min )}<v_{O}<v_{O(\\max )}$ is satisfied throughout.\n\nIt is observed that the gain attainable with an active load can be significantly greater than that with a discrete load, attributable to the fact that typically $r_{o p} \\gg R_{C}$. High gains are particularly beneficial in negative-feedback systems like op amp circuits, where a higher gain leads to more pronounced advantages of negative feedback (this will become evident when we discuss negative feedback in Chapter 7.)\n\nAs we progress, we will explore methods to further enhance gain by suitably increasing the effective resistance seen looking into $Q_{4}$ 's collector, for instance, by introducing emitter degeneration for $Q_{4}$. If this resistance is made much higher than $r_{o n}$, then the AC gain of Eq. (4.1b) simplifies to $a=a_{\\text {intrinsic }}$, where:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\na_{\\text {intrinsic }}=-g_{m} r_{o}=-\\frac{V_{A}}{V_{T}} \\tag{4.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHere, $V_{A}$ is the Early voltage of the amplifying BJT ($Q_{1}$ in this case), $V_{T}$ is the thermal voltage (26 mV at $T=300 \\mathrm{~K}$), and $a_{\\text {intrinsic }}$ is the maximum gain achievable with a single BJT, appropriately termed the intrinsic gain. In Example 4.1, we have $a_{\\text {intrinsic }}=-100 / 0.026=-3846 \\mathrm{~V} / \\mathrm{V}$. Compare this with the case of a typical passive load of the types examined in Chapter 2, say $R_{C}=10 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$, which would yield $a=-(100 / / 10) / 0.026=-350 \\mathrm{~V} / \\mathrm{V}$, an entire order of magnitude lower than the intrinsic gain!\n\nAt this juncture, we ponder how to implement the sources $V_{B E 1}$ and $V_{E B 4}$ in Fig. 4.2a. Example 4.1 indicates that their values must be accurate to within millivolts. Additionally, we know that these values drift with temperature by approximately $-2 \\mathrm{mV} /{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, hence the need for biasing schemes capable of assuring stable collector currents against a spectrum of fabrication and environmental variations. In IC technology, these schemes are made feasible by the aforementioned availability of matching and tracking, as will be demonstrated subsequently."

However, given that it incorporates no capacitors and only one resistor, and that transistors are the preferred components in IC technology, the monolithic design is highly advantageous. It also offers greater flexibility by responding to the difference between two input signals and can achieve much higher voltage gains.\n\nBy the time MOS technology became commercially practical, the principles of IC design were already well established in bipolar technology, making it straightforward to adapt them to the new technology. Figure 4.5b presents the CMOS equivalent of the bipolar design in Fig. 4.5a. In this instance, even the current-setting resistor $R$ has been replaced by a transistor, specifically the diode-connected MOSFET $M_{7}$, whose $W / L$ ratio is selected to achieve the desired bias current $I_{S S}$. As we proceed, we will find that Eq. (4.5) is also applicable to the CMOS amplifier version, with the only difference being the lower transconductances of FETs. (The circuits in Fig. 4.5 will be extensively discussed in Section 4.9.)\n\nFigure 4.6 depicts a PSpice circuit used to illustrate the VTC of the bipolar amplifier in Fig. 4.5a. The steepness of the curve verifies the circuit's high gain. Additionally, the saturation limits of the linear operating region are shown."

    "text": "In our examination of npn BJT operation, we observed that increasing $v_{C E}$ enlarges the base-collector depletion region, thereby reducing the effective base width $W_{B}$. This phenomenon, termed the Early effect, results in a steeper profile of excess electrons in the base, ultimately increasing the collector current $i_{C}$ due to its proportionality to this profile's slope. Additionally, there is a more nuanced effect of base-width modulation: a decrease in $W_{B}$ also diminishes the recombination component $i_{B B}$ of the total base current $i_{B}$. Recall that $i_{B}=i_{B E}+i_{B B}$, where $i_{B E}$ is the diffusion component from base to emitter, and $i_{B B}$ is the recombination component within the base. According to Eq. (2.14), $i_{B B}$ is proportional to the excess charge in the base region, which in turn is proportional to the volume $A_{E} \\times W_{B}$. Thus, a reduction in $W_{B}$ decreases $i_{B B}$, and consequently, $i_{B}$. In summary, when $v_{C E}$ is increased while $v_{B E}$ remains constant, we observe (a) an increase in the current $i_{C}$ drawn from the $v_{C E}$ source, and (b) a decrease in the current $i_{B}$ drawn from the $v_{B E}$ source. In small-signal operation, we model the former using the familiar resistance $r_{o}$ between collector and emitter, and the latter with an additional resistance $r_{\\mu}$ between collector and base. The resulting refined model is illustrated in Fig. 4.7.\n\nAssuming $v_{B E}$ is constant, we determine $r_{\\mu}$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r_{\\mu}}=\\frac{d i_{B B}}{d v_{C E}}=\\frac{d i_{C}}{d v_{C E}} \\frac{d i_{B B}}{d i_{C}}=\\frac{1}{r_{o}} \\frac{d i_{B B}}{d i_{C}}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nr_{\\mu}=\\frac{i_{c}}{i_{b b}} r_{o} \\tag{4.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $i_{c}$ and $i_{b b}$ are small-signal variations of $i_{C}$ and $i_{B B}$.

    "text": "During our examination of the BJT's resistance-transformation capabilities, we assumed a grounded AC collector to simplify our analysis, as depicted in Fig. 2.42. The derived results served as reasonable approximations for discrete circuits where the collector's external resistance is not substantial. Nevertheless, in monolithic circuits, the collector often connects to an active load with a high equivalent resistance, making the findings from Chapter 2 insufficient. Consequently, we must reassess the BJT's resistance transformation with the more comprehensive AC circuit shown in Fig. 4.9. The novel aspect here is the coupling between \\( R_C \\) and the BJT model's internal circuitry via \\( r_o \\). We continue to use lowercase subscripts to differentiate between small-signal resistances \\( R_b, R_e, \\) and \\( R_c \\) and their external counterparts \\( R_B, R_E, \\) and \\( R_C \\).\n\n**Resistance \\( R_b \\) as Observed at the Base.** The circuit for determining this resistance is shown in Fig. 4.10a.

The schematic and equations are instrumental in analyzing transistor circuits for input and output resistances.\n\nAfter eliminating \\( v_e \\) and \\( v_c \\), and taking the ratio \\( R_b=\\frac{v_b}{i_b} \\), we obtain, after some algebra,\n\n$$\nR_b=r_{\\pi}+\\left(\\beta_{0}+1\\right)\\left(R_E // r_o\\right) \\times \\frac{1+R_C/[(\\beta_{0}+1)r_o]}{1+R_C/(R_E+r_o)}\n$$\n\nIt becomes evident that if \\( R_C \\ll (\\beta_{0}+1) r_o \\) and \\( R_C \\ll (R_E+r_o) \\), the equation simplifies to the familiar form \\( R_b=r_{\\pi}+\\left(\\beta_{0}+1\\right)(R_E // r_o) \\). In the discrete designs of Chapter 2, \\( R_C \\) was always small enough to satisfy these conditions. However, this is not always the case in monolithic designs, where \\( R_C \\) can be significantly large if the collector is terminated on an active load. Indeed, in the limit \\( R_C \\rightarrow \\infty \\), the equation yields \\( R_b \\rightarrow r_{\\pi}+R_E \\)! This result can be justified by observing that with \\( R_C=\\infty \\) in Fig. 4.10a, the current \\( \\beta_0 i_b \\) is forced to flow entirely through \\( r_o \\), creating a self-contained subcircuit. Consequently, the source \\( v_i \\) perceives \\( r_{\\pi} \\) in series with \\( R_E \\)!\n\n**Resistance \\( R_e \\) as Observed at the Emitter.** Analyzing the current sum at the emitter node in Fig. 4.10b yields\n\n$$\n(\\beta_{0}+1) i_b+i_e+\\frac{v_c-v_e}{r_o}=0\n$$\n\nWe require two additional equations to eliminate \\( i_b \\) and \\( v_c \\). Ignoring \\( r_{\\mu} \\), we use Ohm's law to write\n\n$$\ni_b=\\frac{0-v_e}{R_B+r_{\\pi}}\n$$\n\nMoreover, KCL at the collector node gives\n\n$$\n\\frac{0-v_c}{R_C}=\\beta_0 i_b+\\frac{v_c-v_e}{r_o}\n$$\n\nEliminating and solving for the ratio \\( R_e=\\frac{v_e}{i_e} \\) results in, after some algebra,\n\n$$\nR_e=\\left(\\frac{R_B+r_{\\pi}}{\\beta_0+1} // r_o\\right) \\times \\frac{1+R_C/r_o}{1+R_C/[(\\beta_0+1)r_o+R_B+r_{\\pi}]}\n$$\n\nIf \\( R_C \\ll r_o \\), this equation reduces to the familiar form of discrete designs, i.e., \\( R_e \\cong \\left[\\frac{(R_B+r_{\\pi})}{(\\beta_0+1)}\\right] // r_o \\), which remains small due to the \\( (\\beta_0+1) \\) term in the denominator. However, if the collector is terminated on a current source, \\( R_C \\) can be large enough to dramatically increase \\( R_e \\). In fact, it can be verified that in the limit \\( R_C \\rightarrow \\infty \\), the equation results in \\( R_e \\rightarrow R_B+r_{\\pi} \\)! Again, with the collector AC open-circuited, the current \\( \\beta_0 i_b \\) will circulate solely through \\( r_o \\), creating a self-contained subcircuit. As a result, the source \\( v_e \\) sees only \\( r_{\\pi} \\) in series with \\( R_B \\).\n\n**Resistance \\( R_c \\) as Observed at the Collector.** With sufficient emitter degeneration, the resistance seen at the collector can be quite large, making the neglect of \\( r_{\\mu} \\) unacceptable. Including \\( r_{\\mu} \\) in the calculations significantly complicates the algebra without offering substantial insight. A quicker, albeit approximate, approach is to separately investigate the effects of \\( r_o \\) and \\( r_{\\mu} \\) and then combine them. For the test circuit in Fig. 4.11a, we ignore \\( r_{\\mu} \\) and use familiar results to write \\( i_{c1}=\\frac{v_c}{R_{c1}} \\), where\n\n$$\nR_{c1} \\cong r_o\\left[1+\\frac{g_m(r_{\\pi} // R_E)}{1+R_B/(r_{\\pi}+R_E)}\\right]\n$$\n\nIn the circuit of Fig. 4.11b, we ignore \\( r_o \\) and apply KCL to get\n\n$$\ni_{c2}=\\frac{v_c-v_b}{r_{\\mu}}+\\frac{g_m}{1+g_m R_E} v_b\n$$\n\nUsing the voltage divider formula,\n\n$$\nv_b=\\frac{R_B // R_b}{(R_B // R_b)+r_{\\mu}} v_c \\cong \\frac{R_B // R_b}{r_{\\mu}} v_c\n$$\n\nwhere we have used the fact that in practical circuits \\( r_{\\mu} \\gg R_B // R_b, R_b=r_{\\pi}+\\left(\\beta_0+1\\right) R_E \\). Clearly, \\( v_b \\) is much smaller than \\( v_c \\), so we can further simplify as\n\n$$\ni_{c2}=\\frac{v_c}{r_{\\mu}}+\\frac{g_m}{1+g_m R_E} \\frac{R_B // R_b}{r_{\\mu}} v_c \\cong \\frac{1}{r_{\\mu}}\\left(1+\\frac{R_B // R_b}{R_E+1/g_m}\\right) v_c=\\frac{v_c}{R_{c2}}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nR_{c2}=\\frac{r_{\\mu}}{1+(R_B // R_b)/(R_E+1/g_m)}\n$$\n\nWith \\( r_o \\) and \\( r_{\\mu} \\) present simultaneously, the total current drawn from the \\( v_c \\) source is \\( i_c \\cong i_{c1}+i_{c2}=\\frac{v_c}{R_{c1}}+\\frac{v_c}{R_{c2}} \\). Taking \\( R_c=\\frac{v_c}{i_c} \\), we find\n\n$$\nR_c \\cong R_{c1} // R_{c2} \\cong r_o\\left[1+\\frac{g_m(r_{\\pi} // R_E)}{1+R_B/(r_{\\pi}+R_E)}\\right] // \\left[\\frac{r_{\\mu}}{1+(R_B // R_b)/(R_E+1/g_m)}\\right]\n$$\n\nIt is observed that \\( R_B \\) reduces both \\( R_{c1} \\) and \\( R_{c2} \\). In applications aiming to maximize \\( R_c \\), it is advisable to keep \\( R_B \\) as small as the design permits.\n\nIn the context of monolithic transistor amplifiers, which are likely biased and/or loaded by another transistor acting as a current source or sink, it is instructive to reevaluate the basic CE, CC, and CB configurations from the perspective of monolithic design. To highlight the unique aspects of this design approach, we first examine a circuit devoid of loading and consider ideal current sources/sinks (for simplicity, we also assume \\( r_{\\mu}=\\infty \\)). Subsequently, we adapt our findings to scenarios with non-ideal sources/sinks, output loading, and \\( r_{\\mu} \\neq \\infty \\)."

Unfortunately, including \\( r_{\\mu} \\) in the calculations significantly complicates the algebra without providing much insight. A quicker, albeit approximate, approach is to investigate the effects of \\( r_{o} \\) and \\( r_{\\mu} \\) separately and then combine them.

In applications where it is desired to maximize \\( R_{c} \\), it would be best to keep \\( R_{B} \\) as small as the design allows.\n\nA monolithic transistor amplifier is likely to be biased and/or loaded by another transistor configured as a current source or sink, so it is instructive to reassess the basic CE, CC, and CB configurations from the perspective of monolithic design. To focus on the distinguishing aspects of this type of design, we first investigate a circuit in the absence of loading and for the case of ideal current sources/sinks (to keep things simple, we also assume \\( r_{\\mu}=\\infty \\)). Then, we adapt our results to the case of non-ideal sources/sinks, in the presence of output loading, and with \\( r_{\\mu} \\neq \\infty \\)."

For the test circuit of Fig. 4.11a, we ignore \\( r_{\\mu} \\) and reuse known results to write \\( i_{c 1}=v_{c} / R_{c 1} \\), where\n\n$$\nR_{c 1} \\cong r_{o}\\left[1+\\frac{g_{m}\\left(r_{n} / / R_{E}\\right)}{1+R_{B} /\\left(r_{\\pi}+R_{E}\\right)}\\right]\n$$\n\nIn the circuit of Fig. 4.11b, we ignore \\( r_{o} \\) and apply KCL,\n\n$$\ni_{c 2}=\\frac{v_{c}-v_{b}}{r_{\\mu}}+\\frac{g_{m}}{1+g_{m} R_{E}} v_{b}\n$$\n\nUsing the voltage divider formula,\n\n$$\nv_{b}=\\frac{R_{B} / / R_{b}}{\\left(R_{B} / / R_{b}\\right)+r_{\\mu}} v_{c} \\cong \\frac{R_{B} / / R_{b}}{r_{\\mu}} v_{c}\n$$\n\n[Textual descriptions of the images have been provided as part of the context and are not included in the rephrased text.]\n\nWith \\( r_{o} \\) and \\( r_{\\mu} \\) present simultaneously, the total current drawn from the \\( v_{c} \\) source is \\( i_{c} \\cong i_{c 1}+i_{c 2}=v_{c} / R_{c 1}+v_{c} / R_{c 2} \\). Taking \\( R_{c}=v_{c} / i_{c} \\), we find\n\n$$\nR_{c} \\cong R_{c 1} / / R_{c 2} \\cong r_{o}\\left[1+\\frac{g_{m}\\left(r_{\\pi} / / R_{E}\\right)}{1+R_{B} /\\left(r_{\\pi}+R_{E}\\right)}\\right] / /\\left[\\frac{r_{\\mu}}{1+\\left(R_{B} / / R_{b}\\right) /\\left(R_{E}+1 / g_{m}\\right)}\\right]\n$$\n\nIt is observed that the presence of \\( R_{B} \\) decreases both \\( R_{c 1} \\) and \\( R_{c 2} \\). In applications aiming to maximize \\( R_{c} \\), it would be preferable to keep \\( R_{B} \\) as small as the design permits.\n\nAs previously mentioned, a monolithic transistor amplifier is likely to be biased and/or loaded by another transistor functioning as a current source or sink. Therefore, it is beneficial to reevaluate the fundamental CE, CC, and CB configurations from the perspective of monolithic design. To concentrate on the unique aspects of this design approach, we initially investigate a circuit without loading and for the scenario of ideal current sources/sinks (for simplicity, we also assume \\( r_{\\mu}=\\infty \\)). Subsequently, we adapt our findings to the case of non-ideal sources/sinks, in the presence of output loading, and with \\( r_{\\mu} \\neq \\infty \\)."

(4.9) with $\\beta_{0}=g_{m} r_{\\pi}=160$,\n\n$$\nR_{i}=4+161(1 / / 50) \\times \\frac{1+1650 /(161 \\times 50)}{1+1650 /(1+50)}=9.7 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega\n$$\n\n(d) Using Eqs (4.18) and (4.9) with $R_{C}=10 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$, we now get\n\n$$\n\\frac{v_{o}}{v_{i}}=-9.63 \\mathrm{~V} / \\mathrm{V} \\quad R_{i}=136 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega\n$$\n\nWith $R_{C}$ this low, we could have used the familiar expressions of Eq. (4.19) to estimate\n\n$$\n\\frac{v_{o}}{v_{i}} \\cong-\\frac{10}{0.025+1}=-9.76 \\mathrm{~V} / \\mathrm{V} \\quad R_{i} \\cong 4+161 \\times 1=165 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega\n$$\n\nwhich are in fair agreement with the above. It is evident that reducing $R_{C}$ decreases $a$ while increasing $R_{i}$. The distinction between monolithic and discrete design is further illustrated in Exercise 4.3, p. 357.\n(e) With $r_{\\mu}=5 \\times 160 \\times 50=40 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega$, to assess its impact, we adapt Eq. (4.18). Thus, in (a) the gain drops to $-2000 \\times 40 /(0.05+40)=-1997 \\mathrm{~V} / \\mathrm{V}$ and in (b) the gain drops to $-1600 \\times 40 /(1.65+40)=-1537 \\mathrm{~V} / \\mathrm{V}$. In both cases, the change is minor, indicating that $r_{\\mu}$ can be ignored, at least in this example.\n\n#### EXercise 4.2\n\nUtilize Eq. (4.16a) to predict the gain of the circuit in Fig. 4.12 if (a) $R_{E}=\\beta_{0} r_{o}$, and (b) $R_{E}=\\infty$. Then, justify your results through physical reasoning.\n```"

Typically, $\\lambda^{\\prime}$ ranges from 0.02 to $0.2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{V}$. An IC designer specifies $L$ to achieve a desired $\\lambda$, and $W$ to achieve a desired $k$, where $k=k^{\\prime}(W / L)$. Note that this flexibility is not available in bipolar IC design!\n\nWhen $\\lambda V_{D S} \\ll 1$, we can ignore the term $\\lambda V_{D S}$ in Eq. (4.30) for simplified dc calculations. However, in monolithic circuits, this simplification may not be acceptable. An example will illustrate this better.\n\n**EXAMPLE 4.7** Consider the diode-connected FET in Fig. 4.20 with $V_{t}=1.0 \\mathrm{~V}$, $k^{\\prime}=100 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} / \\mathrm{V}^{2}$, and $\\lambda^{\\prime}=0.2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{V}$.\n(a) Determine $W$ and $L$ to achieve $\\lambda=0.1 \\mathrm{~V}^{-1}$ and $k=0.5 \\mathrm{~mA} / \\mathrm{V}^{2}$.\n(b) If $I=1.0 \\mathrm{~mA}$, find $V$ assuming $\\lambda=0$ for simplified dc calculations.\n(c) Refine the calculation from part (b) using $\\lambda=0.1 \\mathrm{~V}^{-1}$.\n(d) Adjust $I$ to maintain the $V$ value found in part (b).\n(e) Modify the $W / L$ ratio to keep the $I$ and $V$ values from part (b) without changing $\\lambda$.\n\n**Image Description:**\nThe circuit includes a current source (I) and a voltage source (V) connected to an NMOS transistor (M1). The NMOS transistor's source is grounded, with both the drain and gate connected to the same node (D).\n\n**FIGURE 4.20 Circuit of Example 4.7.**\n\n#### Solution\n\n(a) We require $L=\\lambda^{\\prime} / \\lambda=0.2 / 0.1=2 \\mu \\mathrm{m}$, and $W / L=k / k^{\\prime}=0.5 / 0.1=5$. Thus, $W=5L=10 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$.\n(b) We find $V_{O V}=\\sqrt{2 I_{D} / k}=\\sqrt{2 \\times 1 / 0.5}=2 \\mathrm{~V}$, and $V=V_{t}+V_{O V}=1.0+2.0=3.0 \\mathrm{~V}$.\n(c) Now,\n\n$$\n1 \\mathrm{~mA}=\\frac{0.5 \\mathrm{~mA}}{2}(V-1.0)^{2} \\times(1+0.1 \\times V)\n$$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides and solving for $V$, we get\n\n$$\nV=1.0+\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{1+0.1 \\times V}}\n$$\n\nStarting with $V=3.0 \\mathrm{~V}$ and iterating, we find $V=2.77 \\mathrm{~V}$ (less than 3.0 V due to $\\lambda$).\n(d) $I=(1 \\mathrm{~mA}) \\times(1+0.1 \\times 3.0)=1.3 \\mathrm{~mA}$ (greater than 1 mA because of $\\lambda$).\n(e) To reduce $I$ from 1.3 mA to 1.0 mA while keeping $V=3.0 \\mathrm{~V}$, we need to decrease the $W / L$ ratio proportionally. Thus, $(W / L)_{\\text {new }}=(W / L)_{\\text {old }} \\times(1.0 / 1.3)=5 \\times 0.77=3.85$. To maintain the same $\\lambda$, keep $L_{\\text {new }}=L_{\\text {old }}$, and adjust $W_{\\text {new }}=W_{\\text {old }} \\times 0.77=7.7 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$."

The body shared by all $n$ MOSFETs is connected to the most negative voltage (MNV) in the circuit to prevent the accidental activation of the diode formed by the $p$-type body and the $n$-type source. Similarly, the body shared by all $p$ MOSFETs is connected to the most positive voltage (MPV). For a saturated $n$ MOSFET where the source can reach a different potential than the body, the drain current assumes a more general form:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{D}=\\frac{k}{2}\\left[v_{G S}-v_{t}\\left(v_{S B}\\right)\\right]^{2}\\left(1+\\lambda v_{D S}\\right) \\tag{4.32}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis explicitly shows that the threshold voltage $v_{t}$ depends on the source-to-body voltage $v_{S B}(\\geq 0)$. This dependency is described by Eq. (3.8), reproduced here for ease of reference:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{t}\\left(v_{S B}\\right)=V_{t 0}+\\gamma\\left[\\sqrt{v_{S B}+2\\left|\\phi_{p}\\right|}-\\sqrt{2\\left|\\phi_{p}\\right|}\\right] \\tag{4.33}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\gamma=\\frac{\\sqrt{2 q N_{A} \\varepsilon_{s i}}}{C_{o x}} \\tag{4.34}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor a $p$ MOSFET, Eq. (4.33) transforms to $v_{t}\\left(v_{B S}\\right)=V_{t 0}-\\gamma\\left[\\sqrt{v_{B S}+2 \\phi_{n}}-\\sqrt{2 \\phi_{n}}\\right]$, with $\\gamma$ still determined by Eq. (4.34), but with $N_{A}$ replaced by $N_{D}$. It is evident that FETs operating with $v_{B}=v_{S}$ will also have $v_{t}=V_{t 0}$. However, FETs with $v_{S} \\neq v_{B}$ will have $v_{t} \\neq V_{t 0}$, a phenomenon known as the body effect. Since $v_{S B}$ (or $v_{S B}$ for a $p$ MOSFET) influences $i_{D}$, the body acts as a secondary gate, though its impact on $i_{D}$ is less than that of the primary gate due to the square root function in Eq. (4.33). Hence, the body is also termed the back gate.\n\n**FIGURE 4.21 Small-signal MOSFET model**\n\n**Description:**\n- **M1:** NMOS, ports: S (S), D (D), G (G)\n- **gmVgs:** Voltage-Controlled Current Source, ports: Np (D), Nn (-Vbs)\n- **gmbVbs:** Voltage-Controlled Current Source, ports: Np (D), Nn (-Vbs)\n- **ro:** Resistor, value: ro, ports: N1 (D), N2 (-Vbs)\n\n**Extra Info:** The circuit diagram illustrates a small-signal model of a MOSFET incorporating the body effect.

This leads to the small-signal model depicted in Fig. 4.21, where $g_{m b}$, aptly named the body transconductance, is defined as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ng_{m b}=\\left.\\frac{\\partial i_{D}}{\\partial v_{B S}}\\right|_{V_{G S} V_{D S}} \\tag{4.35}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwith $v_{G S}$ and $v_{D S}$ held constant.
