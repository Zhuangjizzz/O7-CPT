Without underbiasing, the push-pull transistors $Q_{14}$ and $Q_{20}$, which have larger emitter areas, would draw a standby current roughly four times as large as that of the diodes. By suitably underbiasing $Q_{18}$, the collector current $I_{C 18}$ is reduced, which in turn reduces the overall standby current drawn by the circuit. This is illustrated in the example where $I_{C 18}$ is estimated to be around 14 µA, significantly lower than it would be without underbiasing."
