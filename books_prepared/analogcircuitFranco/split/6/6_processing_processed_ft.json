M5 is connected to the drain of M4 (X2) and its gate to X2, while M6 is connected to the drain of M5 (X3) and its gate to X4. When there is a differential voltage at the input, the current through M4 changes, which in turn affects the voltage at X2. This change is amplified by M5 and M6, further reinforcing the difference and preparing it for the final amplification by the output inverter (M9 and M10). This stage is crucial for ensuring that even small input voltage differences are sufficiently amplified to produce a clear output signal."

This value differs from 40 mV because our hand calculations are based on λ=0. Figure 5.29b provides an expanded view of the snapping action taking place as v_I is raised to V_IH. Once M1 pulls M5 out of the triode region, v_O1 drops more rapidly until M6 turns on. At this point M6 pulls v_O2 toward V_DD as fast as it can. This, in turn, shuts off M5, causing a final and more rapid drop in v_O1. It is apparent that because of the flip-flop action provided by M5 and M6, v_O1 and v_O2 coexist only in complementary form (one is high whereas the other is low, and vice versa)."

CX, being switched between ground and the op amp's virtual-ground input, remains permanently discharged, making the circuit insensitive to CX. CY does participate in the transfer of charge between Vi and ground but does not interfere with C1, ensuring the circuit is also insensitive to CY. This design, though requiring a more complex switch system with four FETs, effectively reduces the impact of stray capacitances."
