Unencumbered by compensation requirements, comparators operate at maximum speed (the dynamics of voltage comparators are explored in Chapter 6).\n- The output saturation voltages of operational amplifiers are not compatible with digital logic levels (for example, a 741 operational amplifier powered by \\( \\pm 15 \\mathrm{~V} \\) supplies saturates at around \\( \\pm 13 \\mathrm{~V} \\), which is far from TTL/CMOS logic levels). In contrast, voltage-comparator output stages are designed for this type of compatibility.\n\nIf speed and logic compatibility are not critical, an operational amplifier can be used as a voltage comparator. However, most comparator applications necessitate specialized circuits optimized for this specific function.

    "text": "Following the operational amplifier, the voltage comparator is arguably the most widely used high-gain amplifier. Its role is to compare two analog input voltages, $v_{P}$ and $v_{N}$, and produce a binary output, such as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\nv_{O}=V_{O L} & \\text { for } v_{P}<v_{N} \\\\\nv_{O}=V_{O H} & \\text { for } v_{P}>v_{N} \\tag{5.43b}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nHere, $V_{O L}$ and $V_{O H}$ are predefined logic levels, such as the standard TTL/CMOS-compatible voltages $V_{O L}=0 \\mathrm{~V}$ and $V_{O H}=5 \\mathrm{~V}$. Often referred to as a decision circuit, the comparator can also function as a 1-bit analog-to-digital converter. Figure 5.20a depicts the comparator's circuit symbol, while Fig. 5.20b illustrates the voltage transfer curve (VTC) derived from Eq. (5.43). As is known, the slope of a VTC indicates gain, so the VTC in Fig. $5.20 b$ suggests an amplifier with infinite gain that saturates at $V_{O L}$ and $V_{O H}$.\n\nSince infinite gain is not physically feasible, the VTC of an actual comparator is more accurately represented by Fig. 5.20c, where the voltage gain is approximated as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\na \\cong \\frac{V_{O H}-V_{O L}}{V_{I H}-V_{I L}} \\tag{5.44}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn this context, $V_{I L}$ and $V_{I H}$ denote the input voltage $v_{I}$ values at which the gain $a=1 \\mathrm{~V} / \\mathrm{V}$. Consequently, Eq. (5.43) is modified to:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\nv_{O}=V_{O L} & \\text { for } v_{P}<\\left(v_{N}+V_{I L}\\right) \\\\\nv_{O}=V_{O H} & \\text { for } v_{P}>\\left(v_{N}+V_{I H}\\right) \\tag{5.45b}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nAdditionally, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{O}=a\\left(v_{P}-v_{N}\\right) \\quad \\text { for }\\left(v_{N}+V_{I L}\\right)<v_{P}<\\left(v_{N}+V_{I H}\\right) \\tag{5.45c}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:\n[\nname: OpAmp, type: OpAmp, ports: {InP: vP, InN: vN, OutP: vO}\n]\nextrainfo:Diagram (a) illustrates a voltage comparator using an OpAmp.

(b) Idealized VTC, and (c) real-life VTC.\n\nIt is evident that the real-life VTC in Fig. 5.20c is merely an approximation of the ideal VTC in Fig. 5.20b. However, the closer $V_{I L}$ and $V_{I H}$ are to each other, the greater the gain and the closer the VTC approaches the ideal.\n\nAs a high-gain amplifier, the voltage comparator shares many similarities with the op amp (indeed, they use the same circuit symbol). However, they differ in two key aspects:\n\n- Op amps are designed to operate with negative feedback, whereas comparators are not. In Chapter 7, we will learn that to prevent potential oscillation, an op amp includes a frequency-compensation network, which, in its simplest form, is just a capacitance, such as $C_{c}$ in Figs. 5.1, 5.13, and 5.16. In Chapter 6, we will see that $C_{c}$ significantly slows down the op amp's dynamics. Comparators, conversely, do not require frequency compensation since voltage comparison does not involve negative feedback (in fact, a compensation capacitance would only unnecessarily slow down the comparator). Free from compensation constraints, comparators operate at maximum speed (the dynamics of voltage comparators are explored in Chapter 6).\n- The output saturation voltages of op amps are not compatible with digital logic levels (for example, a 741 op amp powered by $\\pm 15-\\mathrm{V}$ supplies saturates at around $\\pm 13 \\mathrm{~V}$, which is far from TTL/CMOS logic levels). In contrast, voltage-comparator output stages are designed to be compatible with such logic levels.\n\nIf speed and logic compatibility are not critical, an op amp can be used as a voltage comparator. However, most comparator applications require specialized circuits optimized for this specific function. To understand this better, let us examine some typical bipolar and CMOS voltage-comparator implementations."

The simplest approach is to use a pull-up resistor $R_{P U}$, in which case the circuit yields $V_{O L}=V_{C E 8(\\text { sat) }} \\cong 0.2 \\mathrm{~V}$ when $Q_{8}$ is in saturation, and $V_{O H}=V_{C C}$ when $Q_{8}$ is in cutoff. With $V_{C C}=5 \\mathrm{~V}$, the circuit provides TTL/CMOS logic levels of approximately 0 V and 5 V. The gain of this stage is estimated as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\na_{3}=-\\frac{v_{o}}{v_{b 8}} \\cong-g_{m 8} R_{P U} \\tag{5.48}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n- The dc biasing circuit, depicted in Fig. 5.22, includes the multiple-output current mirror $Q_{9}$ through $Q_{12}$, along with the stabilized current reference $I_{R E F}$, which is shared among all four comparators on the chip. The current $I_{R E F}$ is replicated by $Q_{10}$ to bias the $Q_{2}-Q_{3}$ pair, and by $Q_{11}$ to actively load $Q_{7}$. Additionally, $Q_{12}$ forms a Widlar current source that generates a $7-\\mu \\mathrm{A}$ current, which then divides between the two collectors to supply the $3.5-\\mu \\mathrm{A}$ bias currents for the $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{4}$ buffers.\nimage_name:FIGURE 5.22\ndescription:\n[\nname: Q9, type: PNP, ports: {C: X1, B: X1, E: VCC}\nname: Q10, type: PNP, ports: {C: LOAD1, B: X1, E: X1}\nname: Q11, type: PNP, ports: {C: LOAD2, B: X1, E: VCC}\nname: Q12, type: PNP, ports: {C: LOAD3, B: X1, E: X2}\nname: IREF, type: CurrentSource, value: 100 μA, ports: {Np: X1, Nn: GND}\nname: R, type: Resistor, value: 9.9 kΩ, ports: {N1: VCC, N2: X2}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit diagram represents the DC biasing circuitry of the 339 voltage comparator.

    "text": "In voltage comparator circuits, while high gain and speed are typically sought-after, they can lead to issues when dealing with noisy inputs. For instance, in the circuit depicted in Fig. 5.25a, a comparator is used to count the zero crossings of a slowly-varying signal \\( v_I \\) that is corrupted by noise. This noise can cause the comparator to fluctuate erratically around 0 V, resulting in inaccurate counts. Although the noise level may seem exaggerated in the figure, it's important to note that with high gain, even a small noise of a few tens of micro-volts can cause significant fluctuations.\n\nThis undesirable fluctuation, known as chatter, can be mitigated by incorporating hysteresis as shown in Fig. 5.25b. The comparator in this case has two different voltage threshold curves (VTCs) depending on the output state. When \\( v_O = V_{OL} \\), the comparator switches when \\( v_I \\) reaches \\( V_{TH} \\), and when \\( v_O = V_{OH} \\), it switches when \\( v_I \\) drops to \\( V_{TL} \\). If the hysteresis width \\( V_{TH} - V_{TL} \\) is greater than the maximum peak-to-peak amplitude of the noise, chatter is effectively eliminated, as demonstrated in Fig. 5.25b. Hysteresis can be introduced through positive feedback, either externally by the user or internally by the IC designer, with the latter being our focus here.\n\nFigure 5.26 presents a common CMOS implementation of a comparator with hysteresis. Disregarding \\( M_5 \\) and \\( M_6 \\) momentarily, we can see that the \\( M_4-M_7 \\) mirror directs \\( i_{D2} \\) towards the output node \\( v_0 \\), while the \\( M_3-M_8 \\) and \\( M_9-M_10 \\) mirrors guide \\( i_{D1} \\) away from \\( v_0 \\). As a result, the circuit acts as a differential amplifier with a small-signal gain of \\( a = v_0 / (v_p - v_n) = g_{m1} (r_{o7} // r_{o10}) \\) and a VTC similar to that in Fig. 5.20c (also see Fig. 4.66).\n\nThe presence of \\( M_5 \\) and \\( M_6 \\) introduces a flip-flop action that unbalances the loads seen by \\( M_1 \\) and \\( M_2 \\), creating hysteresis. This effect is due to the cross-coupled PMOS transistors \\( M_5 \\) and \\( M_6 \\), which provide the hysteresis mechanism. The circuit operates between power supplies VDD and VSS, with input nodes \\( v_N \\) and \\( v_P \\), and an output node \\( v_O \\).\n\nWhen considering the effect of \\( M_5 \\) and \\( M_6 \\), they act as two cross-coupled inverters that maintain the circuit in an unbalanced state. This不平衡 is precisely what causes hysteresis. To understand this, refer to the simplified representations in Fig. 5.27, where the cross-coupled FETs \\( M_5 \\) and \\( M_6 \\) are assumed to have \\( W/L \\) ratios that are \\( m \\) (where \\( m > 1 \\)) times larger than those of the diode-connected FETs \\( M_3 \\) and \\( M_4 \\). The following observations can be made:\n\n- For \\( v_I \\) sufficiently negative, as in Fig. 5.27a, \\( M_1 \\) is off, so \\( M_3 \\) and \\( M_5 \\) are also off. All of \\( I_{SS} \\) flows through \\( M_2 \\), causing \\( v_{O2} \\) to be low. This, in turn, pulls \\( v_{O1} \\) to \\( V_{DD} \\). With \\( v_{SG6} = 0 \\), \\( M_6 \\) is also off, resulting in \\( i_{D4} = i_{D2} = I_{SS} \\).\n- Raising \\( v_I \\) will gradually turn on \\( M_1 \\) while \\( M_2 \\) becomes less conductive.

    "text": "While high gain and speed are typically sought after in voltage comparators, they can actually work against us when dealing with noisy inputs. Take, for instance, the circuit in Fig. $5.25 a$, which employs a comparator to count the zero crossings of a noisy, slowly-varying signal $v_{I}$. The noise can cause the comparator to toggle its output multiple times when $v_{I}$ is near 0 V, resulting in inaccurate counts. Although the depicted noise level might seem exaggerated, it's important to note that even minor noise, when amplified significantly, can cause such issues.\n\nThis phenomenon, known as chatter, can be mitigated by introducing hysteresis, as shown in Fig. $5.25b$. Here, the comparator demonstrates two distinct VTCs, depending on its output state. When $v_{O}$ equals $V_{O L}$, the comparator switches when $v_{I}$ reaches $V_{T H}$, and conversely, when $v_{O}$ equals $V_{O H}$, it switches at $V_{T L}$. If the hysteresis width, which is the difference between $V_{T H}$ and $V_{T L}$, is greater than the peak-to-peak amplitude of the input noise, chatter is effectively prevented, as demonstrated in Fig. $5.25b$. Hysteresis can be implemented through positive feedback, either externally by the user or internally by the IC designer, with our focus being on the latter.\n\nFigure $5.26$ presents a commonly used CMOS implementation of a comparator with hysteresis. Disregarding $M_{5}$ and $M_{6}$ for a moment, we see that the $M_{4}-M_{7}$ mirror directs $i_{D 2}$ towards the output node $v_{0}$, while the $M_{3}-M_{8}$ and $M_{9}-M_{10}$ mirrors divert $i_{D 1}$ away from $v_{0}$. This configuration results in a differential amplifier with a small-signal gain of $a=v_{o} /\\left(v_{p}-v_{n}\\right)=g_{m 1}\\left(r_{o 7} / / r_{o 10}\\right)$ and a VTC similar to that of Fig. $5.20c$ (refer also to Fig. $4.66$).\n\nIn the context of the provided images, Fig. $5.25 a$ illustrates a comparator without hysteresis, prone to chatter due to noise in the input signal. The circuit consists of a voltage source $V1$ providing $v_I$ and an inverter $U1$ that outputs $v_O$. The diagram highlights how the output switches rapidly as the input crosses the threshold, a behavior known as chatter.\n\nFigures $5.25 b$ and $5.26$ show the implementation of hysteresis in a CMOS comparator. The time-domain waveform graph in Fig. $5.25 b$ demonstrates how the output voltage $v_O$ responds to the noisy input voltage $v_I$ over time, with clear hysteresis behavior. The vertical axis represents voltage levels $V_{OH}$ and $V_{OL}$, and the horizontal axis represents time, typically in seconds or milliseconds.\n\nIn Fig. $5.26$, the CMOS comparator circuit incorporates hysteresis through the cross-coupled PMOS transistors $M_{5}$ and $M_{6}$, creating a flip-flop action that stabilizes the output against noise. The circuit operates between power supplies $VDD$ and $VSS$, with input nodes $vN$ and $vP$, and an output node $vO$.\n\nFurther analysis of the circuit behavior with $M_{5}$ and $M_{6}$ present reveals the role of these transistors in introducing hysteresis. The circuit's behavior is unbalanced due to the differing characteristics of $M_{5}$ and $M_{4}$, leading to the hysteresis effect. The exact voltage levels $V_{I H}$ and $V_{I L}$ at which the comparator trips are determined by the circuit's parameters and the FET formulae.\n\nThe PSpice simulations in Fig. $5.28$ and the resulting plots in Fig. $5.29$ confirm the theoretical calculations and provide a detailed view of the hysteresis and snapping action in the comparator circuit.\n\nThe circuits in Fig. $5.30$ demonstrate power-supply-based current references, using both bipolar and MOS transistors. These circuits are designed to provide a stable reference current that is less dependent on the supply voltage.\n\nThe small-signal model in Fig. $5.33$ is used to analyze the power-supply dependence of a reference current, taking into account the transistor characteristics and the circuit's parameters.\n\nIn summary, the introduction of hysteresis in comparator circuits is crucial for reducing the impact of noise and ensuring stable output switching. The theoretical analysis, circuit implementations, and simulations all contribute to a comprehensive understanding of how hysteresis works and how it can be effectively utilized in comparator design."

    "text": "The circuits depicted in Fig. 5.32 are termed self-biased or bootstrapped because each mirror biases and is concurrently biased by the other. Specifically, if one mirror fails to activate, the other will also remain inactive, causing the circuit to persist in this undesirable state indefinitely. Consequently, a mechanism is required that, upon power application to the circuit, will initiate at least one of the mirrors, compelling the circuit to transition to the desired state and stabilize there. This mechanism, aptly named the startup circuit, in its simplest form comprises a large resistor $R_{\\text {startup }}$ to inject a minimal startup current into one of the mirrors, as illustrated in Fig. 5.34a for the bipolar scenario. (It is imperative that this current be significantly smaller than $I_{R E F}$ to prevent the introduction of an unacceptable error.)\n\nA more refined approach involves a startup circuit that activates only when the reference is in an unwanted state, subsequently becoming inactive once the reference attains the desired state. In the CMOS example shown in Fig. $5.34 b$, the diode-connected transistors $M_{7}$ and $M_{8}$ create a voltage divider to provide an appropriate gate bias for $M_{9}$. If $M_{1}$ is off, $V_{G S 9}$ is designed to be sufficiently high to turn on $M_{9}$, thereby forcing both mirrors out of the cutoff state. Once $M_{1}$ fully activates, $V_{G S 9}$ is designed to decrease below $V_{t 9}$, turning off $M_{9}$ and leaving the rest of the circuit undisturbed.\n\nSince the current $I_{R E F}$ is utilized internally, provisions must be made for its external replication.

Referring to Fig. 5.33, we observe that the current $i$ is initially amplified to $m_{p} i$ by $Q_{3}$, then converted to $v_{1} \\cong r_{1} m_{p} i \\cong m_{p} i / g_{m 1}$ by $Q_{1}$, and finally returned by $Q_{2}$ as $G_{m 2} v_{1} \\cong\\left(m_{p} G_{m 2} / g_{m 1}\\right) i$. Thus, the overall amplification experienced by $i$ around the loop, termed the loop gain $T$, is $T=m_{p} G_{m 2} / g_{m 1}$.

    "text": "The circuits depicted in Fig. 5.32 are termed self-biased or bootstrapped due to their mutual biasing mechanism, where each mirror biases the other. Specifically, if one mirror fails to activate, the other will also remain off, causing the circuit to persist in an undesirable state. Consequently, a mechanism is required that, upon power application, initiates at least one mirror, propelling the circuit towards the desired state and maintaining it there. This mechanism, known as the startup circuit, typically involves a large resistor $R_{\\text {startup }}$ to inject a minimal startup current into one of the mirrors, as illustrated in Fig. 5.34a for a bipolar configuration. (It is imperative that this current be significantly smaller than $I_{R E F}$ to prevent intolerable errors.)\n\nA more refined approach involves a startup circuit that activates only when the reference is in an unwanted state, subsequently becoming inactive once the reference stabilizes in the desired state. In the CMOS example shown in Fig. $5.34 b$, the diode-connected transistors $M_{7}$ and $M_{8}$ create a voltage divider to provide an appropriate gate bias for $M_{9}$. If $M_{1}$ is off, $V_{G S 9}$ is set sufficiently high to activate $M_{9}$, thereby forcing both mirrors out of the cutoff state.

Referring to Fig. 5.33, we observe that the current $i$ is initially amplified to $m_{p} i$ by $Q_{3}$, then converted to $v_{1} \\cong r_{1} m_{p} i \\cong m_{p} i / g_{m 1}$ by $Q_{1}$, and finally returned by $Q_{2}$ as $G_{m 2} v_{1} \\cong\\left(m_{p} G_{m 2} / g_{m 1}\\right) i$. Thus, the overall amplification experienced by $i$ around the loop, termed the loop gain $T$, is $T=m_{p} G_{m 2} / g_{m 1}$. To prevent instability, we must ensure $T<1$ (indeed, Example $5.11 a$ has $T=0.257 \\mathrm{~A} / \\mathrm{A}$, and Example $5.11 b$ has $T=0.571 \\mathrm{~A} / \\mathrm{A}$).\n\n#### Solution\n\nWe have $\\Delta V_{B E}=V_{T} \\ln \\left(m_{p} \\times m_{n}\\right)=26 \\ln (1 \\times 8)=54 \\mathrm{mV}$, $R_{1}=\\Delta V_{B E} / I_{E 2} \\cong 54 / 0.1=0.54 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$, and $R=1 / 0.1=10 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$.

    "text": "The circuits depicted in Fig. 5.32 are termed self-biased or bootstrapped due to their mutual biasing mechanism, where each mirror biases the other. Specifically, if one mirror fails to activate, the other will also remain off, causing the circuit to linger in this undesirable state indefinitely. Consequently, a mechanism is essential to ensure that at least one mirror is activated upon power-up, propelling the circuit towards the intended state and maintaining it there. This mechanism, known as the startup circuit, typically includes a large resistor $R_{\\text {startup }}$ to inject a minimal startup current into one of the mirrors, as illustrated in Fig. 5.34a for the bipolar configuration. (Naturally, this current must be significantly smaller than $I_{R E F}$ to prevent intolerable errors.)\n\nA more refined approach involves a startup circuit that only activates when the reference is in an unwanted state and deactivates once the reference reaches the desired state. In the CMOS example shown in Fig. $5.34 b$, the diode-connected transistors $M_{7}$ and $M_{8}$ form a voltage divider to provide an appropriate gate bias for $M_{9}$. If $M_{1}$ is off, $V_{G S 9}$ is set high enough to turn on $M_{9}$, thereby forcing both mirrors out of the cutoff state. Once $M_{1}$ is fully on, $V_{G S 9}$ is designed to drop below $V_{t 9}$, turning $M_{9}$ off and leaving the rest of the circuit unaffected.\n\nSince the current $I_{R E F}$ is utilized internally, provisions must be made for its external replication.

Interestingly, the engineering field has historically favored the voltage perspective, as evidenced by the earlier commercial maturity and popularity of voltage-mode circuits, such as the op amp, a voltage-in/voltage-out component. The advancement of current-mode analog ICs has also been hindered by technological factors, like the challenge of producing monolithic pnp BJTs that match the quality of their npn counterparts. In this section, we explore current-mode circuits, including transconductors, current conveyors (CCs), operational transconductance amplifiers (OTAs), current feedback amplifiers (CFAs), and Gilbert Cells."

    "text": "A transconductor is a circuit that converts voltage input to current output. To avoid loading effects, it should ideally have very high (preferably infinite) resistance at both its input and output terminals. The simplest form of a transconductor is a transistor.

It is designed to handle a ±10V triangular input signal.

The impact of exceeding this constraint is illustrated by the PSpice circuit in Fig. 5.43a, which uses input voltage dividers to scale a $\\pm 10-\\mathrm{V}$ triangular signal to an input difference $v_{B 1}-v_{B 2}$ of about $\\pm 44-\\mathrm{mV}$. Since 44 mV is not significantly smaller than $4 V_{T}$ (approximately 100 mV), the resulting current difference $i_{C 1}-i_{C 2}$ exhibits noticeable distortion. (The shaded waveforms in Fig. 5.44 depict the undistorted input voltage and the distorted output current.)\n- To achieve an undistorted current waveform, the input voltage must be predistorted according to the inverse of the hyperbolic tangent function. An approximation of this function is realized through the diode-connected BJT pair $D_{1}-D_{2}$ in Fig. 5.43b. Its effect, shown in Fig. 5.44 by the solid traces, is\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:The graph labeled \"(a)\" in Figure 5.44 displays a time-domain waveform comparison of two different voltage waveforms over a 2-millisecond period. The x-axis represents time in milliseconds (ms), ranging from 0 to 2 ms, while the y-axis shows the voltage difference $v_{B1} - v_{B2}$ in millivolts (mV), ranging from -50 mV to 50 mV.\n\nThe graph includes two waveforms: a shaded trace and a solid trace. The shaded trace represents the undistorted input voltage, whereas the solid trace depicts the predistorted voltage after processing by a diode-connected BJT pair to achieve an undistorted current waveform.\n\nBoth waveforms exhibit a triangular shape, indicating periodic linear increases and decreases in voltage. The peaks occur at approximately 0.5 ms, 1.0 ms, and 1.5 ms, with voltages reaching around +50 mV and -50 mV at these points.\n\nThe solid trace is slightly stretched compared to the shaded trace, particularly at the peaks, where the voltage extends to about ±60 mV. This stretching aligns with the diode-connected BJT pair's function, which modifies the input peaks to produce the desired undistorted current waveform.\n\nOverall, the graph illustrates the effect of predistortion on the voltage waveform to compensate for output current distortions, as intended by the circuit design in Figure 5.43b.\nimage_name:(b)\ndescription:The graph labeled \"(b)\" presents a time-domain waveform plot of the current difference ($i_{C1} - i_{C2}$) over time. The x-axis denotes time in milliseconds (ms), ranging from 0 to 2 ms, while the y-axis represents the current difference in milliamperes (mA), ranging from -1 to 1 mA.\n\nThe waveform is a distorted triangular shape, characterized by linear segments with sharp peaks and valleys. The general trend shows periodic oscillations, with peaks at approximately 0.5 ms and 1.5 ms and valleys at 1.0 ms and 2.0 ms, indicating a repeating cycle every 1 ms.\n\nTwo traces are present: a shaded trace and a solid trace. The shaded trace represents the distorted output current waveform from the circuit in Fig. 5.43a, while the solid trace shows the waveform after predistortion applied by the diode-connected BJT pair in Fig. 5.43b. The solid trace is less distorted, demonstrating the effectiveness of predistortion in achieving a more linear current waveform.\n\nKey features of the waveform include:\n- Periodicity with a 1-ms period.\n- Peaks at approximately ±1 mA, occurring at 0.5 ms and 1.5 ms.\n- Valleys at approximately 0 mA, occurring at 1.0 ms and 2.0 ms.\n\nThe graph effectively illustrates the improvement in waveform linearity through predistortion, as seen by comparing the solid trace to the shaded trace.\n\nFIGURE 5.44 Waveforms for the PSpice circuits of Fig. 5.43 (the shaded traces pertain to the circuit of Fig. 5.43a, the solid traces to that of Fig. 5.43b.)\nto modify the input peaks from about $\\pm 44 \\mathrm{mV}$ to about $\\pm 60 \\mathrm{mV}$, the values necessary for an undistorted current waveform."

Using KVL and $v_{BE} = V_{T} \\ln \\left(i_{C} / I_{s}\\right)$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nv_{X} &= v_{E10} - v_{E9} = \\left(V_{A} - v_{BE10}\\right) - \\left(V_{A} - v_{BE9}\\right) = v_{BE9} - v_{BE10} \\\\\n&= V_{T} \\ln \\frac{i_{C9}}{i_{C10}} = V_{T} \\ln \\frac{i_{C7}}{i_{C8}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHowever, KCL gives $i_{C7} = I_{X} + \\left(v_{X1} - v_{X2}\\right) / R_{X}$ and $i_{C8} = I_{X} - \\left(v_{X1} - v_{X2}\\right) / R_{X}$, so:\n\n$$\nv_{X} = V_{T} \\ln \\frac{I_{X} + \\left(v_{X1} - v_{X2}\\right) / R_{X}}{I_{X} - \\left(v_{X1} - v_{X2}\\right) / R_{X}} = V_{T} \\ln \\frac{1 + \\left(v_{X1} - v_{X2}\\right) / (R_{X} I_{X})}{1 - \\left(v_{X1} - v_{X2}\\right) / (R_{X} I_{X})}\n$$\n\nUsing the identity $\\ln \\left[(1 + x) / (1 - x)\\right] = 2 \\tan^{-1} x$, valid for $|x| < 1$, we get:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{X} = 2 V_{T} \\tan^{-1} \\frac{v_{X1} - v_{X2}}{R_{X} I_{X}} \\tag{5.77}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n- Substituting Eqs.

In essence, the $X$-input is first processed by the $Q_{9}-Q_{10}$ diodes in a $\\tanh^{-1}$ manner to generate a predistorted signal $v_{x}$; the $Q_{1}-Q_{2}$ and $Q_{3}-Q_{4}$ pairs then process $v_{X}$ in a tanh manner to produce an overall undistorted output. This output is subsequently modulated by the $Y$-input.\n\n- In practical applications, the output current difference $i_{O1} - i_{O2}$ is converted to a voltage. In the configuration shown in Fig. 5.46, this I-V conversion is achieved by terminating the cell's outputs on a pair of matched resistors $R$, resulting in the double-ended output voltage:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{O} = v_{O2} - v_{O1} = R \\left(i_{O1} - i_{O2}\\right) = \\frac{R}{0.5 R_{X} R_{Y} I_{X}} \\times \\left(v_{X1} - v_{X2}\\right) \\times \\left(v_{Y1} - v_{Y2}\\right) \\tag{5.79}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIf a single-ended voltage output is required, the I-V conversion can be implemented using an op amp configured as a differential amplifier. Alternatively, if a single-ended current output is needed, three Wilson current mirrors can be employed in the manner of the OTA in Fig. 5.42."

    "text": "The OTA depicted in Fig. 5.42 is termed an analog multiplier because, as per Eq. (5.72), $i_{o}$ is directly proportional to the product $I \\times (v_{p} - v_{n})$. Although the voltage difference $v_{p} - v_{n}$ can adopt either polarity, the current $I$ must always exit the differential pair (with $I \\geq 0$), thus classifying the OTA as a two-quadrant multiplier. Applications like communications necessitate full four-quadrant analog multiplication, which is achieved using the current-mode circuit shown in Fig. 5.45. This circuit, popularly known as the Gilbert Cell after its inventor Barrie Gilbert, is an elegant current-mode design comprising (a) two emitter-coupled (EC) differential pairs, $Q_{1}-Q_{2}$ and $Q_{3}-Q_{4}$, driven by the same voltage $v_{X}$ but in opposing phases, causing their output currents to subtract pairwise, and (b) a third EC pair, $Q_{5}-Q_{6}$, designed to direct the bias current $I$ to the two differential pairs in proportions governed by the voltage $v_{Y}$. Depending on the polarity of $v_{Y}$, the output of one pair will dominate the other, enabling the output current difference $i_{O1} - i_{O2}$ to achieve either polarity, thereby facilitating four-quadrant operation.\n\nTo derive a relationship between the output currents and the input voltages, we apply KCL to write:\n\n$$\ni_{O1} - i_{O2} = (i_{C1} + i_{C3}) - (i_{C2} + i_{C4}) = (i_{C1} - i_{C2}) - (i_{C4} - i_{C3})\n$$\n\nImage Description:\n- Figure 5.45 illustrates the Gilbert Cell.\n- Components include:\n  - Q1: NPN transistor with ports C: VCC, B: X1, E: VX-\n  - Q2: NPN transistor with ports C: X1, B: VX-, E: VY+\n  - Q3: NPN transistor with ports C: VK-, B: X2, E: VY+\n  - Q4: NPN transistor with ports C: VCC, B: VK+, E: X2\n  - Q5: NPN transistor with ports C: VY+, B: VY-, E: P\n  - Q6: NPN transistor with ports C: VY+, B: VY-, E: P\n  - I: Current source with value I, ports Np: P, Nn: VEE\n- The circuit functions as a four-quadrant multiplier using differential pairs of NPN transistors. The output current difference is controlled by voltage inputs VX and VY.\n\nAssuming negligible base currents, we modify Eq. (5.71) to write:\n\n$$\ni_{O1} - i_{O2} = i_{C5} \\tanh \\left(\\frac{v_{X}}{2 V_{T}}\\right) - i_{C6} \\tanh \\left(\\frac{v_{X}}{2 V_{T}}\\right) = (i_{C5} - i_{C6}) \\tanh \\left(\\frac{V_{X}}{2 V_{T}}\\right)\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{O1} - i_{O2} = I \\tanh \\left(\\frac{V_{Y}}{2 V_{T}}\\right) \\tanh \\left(\\frac{V_{X}}{2 V_{T}}\\right) \\tag{5.74}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWe identify three primary application categories for this cell:\n\n1. Both inputs are small-signal, i.e., $|v_{x}| \\ll 4 V_{T}$ and $|v_{y}| \\ll 4 V_{T}$, allowing us to approximate $\\tanh x \\approx x$ and write:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{o1} - i_{o2} \\approx I \\times \\frac{v_{x}}{2 V_{T}} \\times \\frac{v_{y}}{2 V_{T}} \\tag{5.75}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn this mode, the cell functions as a true four-quadrant multiplier.\n\n2. One input ($v_{x}$) is a small-signal continuous wave, such as a sine wave, while the other input ($v_{Y}$) is a square wave of sufficient amplitude to overdrive the $Q_{5}-Q_{6}$ pair, turning one of its BJTs off. For $v_{Y} > 0$, $Q_{6}$ is off and $Q_{5}$ directs all of $I$ to the $Q_{1}-Q_{2}$ pair, resulting in $i_{o1} - i_{o2} = +I v_{x} / (2 V_{T}) = +g_{m} v_{x}$. Conversely, for $v_{Y} < 0$, $Q_{5}$ is off and $Q_{6}$ directs all of $I$ to the $Q_{3}-Q_{4}$ pair, yielding $i_{o1} - i_{o2} = -I v_{x} / (2 V_{T}) = -g_{m} v_{x}$, with the negative sign arising from the anti-phase input connection. In this role, the cell is used in communications as a modulator/detector.\n\n3. Both inputs are large-signal. When $v_{X}$ and $v_{Y}$ have the same polarity, the cell outputs $i_{O1} - i_{O2} = I - 0 = I$, whereas with opposite polarities, it outputs $i_{O1} - i_{O2} = 0 - I = -I$. This function resembles the exclusive-or operation in digital circuits and is utilized as a phase detector in phase-locked loop systems.\n\nAs with OTAs, the small-signal constraint can limit certain multiplier applications, necessitating accommodations for larger input magnitudes while ensuring accurate multiplication. Figure 5.46 presents a popular Gilbert Cell application addressing these requirements. Key observations include:\n\n- The $Q_{5}-Q_{6}$ pair employs emitter degeneration via $R_{Y}$ to expand its input signal range. Ignoring base currents and applying KCL, Ohm's law, and KVL, we write:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ni_{C5} - i_{C6} &= \\left(I_{Y} + \\frac{v_{E5} - v_{E6}}{R_{Y}}\\right) - \\left(I_{Y} + \\frac{v_{E6} - v_{E5}}{R_{Y}}\\right) = 2 \\frac{v_{E5} - v_{E6}}{R_{Y}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\left(v_{Y1} - v_{BE5}\\right) - \\left(v_{Y2} - v_{BE6}\\right)}{0.5 R_{Y}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nReorganizing and using $v_{BE} = V_{T} \\ln \\left(i_{C} / I_{s}\\right)$, we obtain:\n\n$$\ni_{C5} - i_{C6} = \\frac{\\left(v_{Y1} - v_{Y2}\\right) - \\left(v_{BE5} - v_{BE6}\\right)}{0.5 R_{Y}} = \\frac{\\left(v_{Y1} - v_{Y2}\\right) - V_{T} \\ln \\left(i_{C5} / i_{C6}\\right)}{0.5 R_{Y}}\n$$\n\nImage Description:\n- Figure 5.46 depicts a four-quadrant analog multiplier.\n- Components include:\n  - Q1: NPN transistor with ports C: vO1, B: vX-, E: X1\n  - Q2: NPN transistor with ports C: vO1, B: vX-, E: X1\n  - Q3: NPN transistor with ports C: vO2, B: vX+, E: X2\n  - Q4: NPN transistor with ports C: vO2, B: vX+, E: X2\n  - Q5: NPN transistor with ports C: vX+, B: vY1, E: P3\n  - Q6: NPN transistor with ports C: vX+, B: vY2, E: P4\n  - Q7: NPN transistor with ports C: vX-, B: vX1, E: P1\n  - Q8: NPN transistor with ports C: vX-, B: vX2, E: P2\n  - Q9: NPN transistor with ports C: VA, B: vX-, E: VK-\n  - Q10: NPN transistor with ports C: VA, B: vX+, E: VK-\n  - R: Resistor with value R, ports N1: VCC, N2: vO1\n  - R: Resistor with value R, ports N1: VCC, N2: vO2\n  - RX: Resistor with value RX, ports N1: P1, N2: P2\n  - RY: Resistor with value RY, ports N1: P3, N2: P4\n  - IX: Current source with value IX, ports Np: P1, Nn: VEE\n  - IY: Current source with value IY, ports Np: P3, Nn: VEE\n- The circuit performs voltage-to-current conversions using pairs of NPN transistors. The Q5-Q6 pair and Q7-Q8 pair, along with emitter degeneration resistors RY and RX, respectively, control the output currents iO1 and iO2.\n\nIn a well-designed circuit, the last numerator term is negligible (see Problem 5.39), so we approximate:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{C5} - i_{C6} = \\frac{v_{Y1} - v_{Y2}}{0.5 R_{Y}} \\tag{5.76}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nindicating that the emitter-degenerated $Q_{5}-Q_{6}$ pair acts as a linear voltage-to-current (V-I) converter.\n\n- Similarly, the $Q_{7}-Q_{8}$ pair functions as a V-I converter, giving $i_{C7} - i_{C8} = \\left(v_{X1} - v_{X2}\\right) / (0.5 R_{X})$ and driving the diode-connected pair $Q_{9}-Q_{10}$.

We represent the combined effect of all noise sources with a single ground noise source $v_{1}$, as shown in Fig. 5.48a. Interference noise from adjacent circuits also impacts the signal line connecting the source to the amplifier, modeled by the line noise source $v_{2}$.\n\nDue to noise drops along the ground line, the notion of a reference node becomes unclear. For discussion purposes, let's arbitrarily select node $v_{P}$ as our ground reference, as illustrated in Fig. 5.48a. Applying KVL, we derive $v_{O}=\\left(-R_{2} / R_{1}\\right) \\times\\left(v_{1}+v_{I}+v_{2}\\right)$, indicating that both noise sources are amplified to the same extent as the useful signal $v_{I}$. This is particularly problematic in high-gain applications where the input signal strength may be comparable to noise levels. The most effective approach to eliminate ground noise is to treat $v_{1}$ as a common-mode signal and employ a differential amplifier with a high common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) to suppress it. As shown in Fig. 5.48b, this involves detaching node $v_{P}$ from ground and driving it via an additional dedicated line and an extra $R_{1}-R_{2}$ pair. This second line will also pick up noise, but if both lines are identical and closely routed to form balanced lines, the noise pickup will be identical on both, resulting in $^{7} v_{O}=\\left(R_{2} / R_{1}\\right)\\left[\\left(v_{1}+v_{2}\\right)-\\left(v_{1}+v_{I}+v_{2}\\right)\\right]=\\left(-R_{2} / R_{1}\\right) v_{I}$.

The biasing network details are excluded, displaying only the gate bias voltages $V_{G 78}$ and $V_{G 56}$. For balanced output, $M_{5}$ and $M_{7}$, previously connected as diodes, now function as current sources. This circuit is depicted as a fully differential CMOS operational amplifier of the folded-cascode variety, with the CMFN network composed of transistors M12 through M16, ensuring balanced outputs. The biasing network specifics are omitted, and only gate bias voltages VG78 and VG56 are shown. Transistors M5 and M7 function as current sources rather than being diode-connected, contributing to balanced output.\n\nThe CMFN is an all-transistor network consisting of $M_{12}$ through $M_{16}$. To understand its operation, consider the following:\n\n- Initially assume $v_{P}=v_{N}$, so $v_{O P}=v_{O N}$. Also, assume $v_{O P}=v_{O N}=V_{O C(\\mathrm{set})}$, causing the two $I$ sources to split equally between the SC pairs, resulting in $I_{D 12}=I_{D 13}=0.5 I$ and $I_{D 14}=I_{D 15}=0.5 I$. The diode-connected FET $M_{16}$ draws $I_{D 16}=I_{D 13}+I_{D 14}=I$, which $M_{9}$ and $M_{10}$ then mirror to provide the bias currents for $M_{3}$ and $M_{4}$ (refer also to Fig. 5.16). As we know, $v_{O P}$ and $v_{O N}$ represent the voltages at which the pull-up actions by $M_{5}$ and $M_{6}$ balance, respectively, the pull-down actions by $M_{3}$ and $M_{4}$.\n- Suppose now that for some reason $v_{O P}$ and $v_{O N}$ attempt to rise above $V_{O C(\\text { set })}$. Then, $M_{12}$ and $M_{15}$ will become less conductive, while $M_{13}$ and $M_{14}$ will conduct more, raising $I_{D 16}$. By mirror action, this will raise $I_{D 9}$ and $I_{D 10}$, enhancing the pulldown action by $M_{3}$ and $M_{4}$, forcing $v_{O P}$ and $v_{O N}$ to drop back to $V_{O C(\\mathrm{set})}$. By symmetric reasoning, if $v_{O P}$ and $v_{O N}$ attempt to drop below $V_{O C(\\mathrm{set})}, M_{13}$ and $M_{14}$ will conduct less, decreasing $I_{D 16}$ and thus reducing the pull-down action by $M_{3}$ and $M_{4}$. The pull-up action by $M_{5}$ and $M_{6}$ will now prevail, forcing $v_{O P}$ and $v_{O N}$ to rise back to $V_{O C(\\text { set })}$.\n- Now, applying an ac signal across the inputs generates symmetric swings $v_{O P}=V_{O C(\\mathrm{set})}+v_{O D} / 2$ and $v_{O N}=V_{O C(\\mathrm{set})}-v_{O D} / 2$. These swings will imbalance the differential pairs, resulting in $i_{D 15}=0.5 I-i$ and $i_{D 14}=0.5 I+i$, and $i_{D 12}=0.5 I+i$ and $i_{D 13}=0.5 I-i$, for some current change $i$. However, $M_{16}$ still draws\n\n$$\ni_{D 16}=i_{D 13}+i_{D 14}=0.5 I-i+0.5 I+i=I\n$$\n\nindicating that the servo loop provided by the CMFN maintains the value of $\\left(v_{O P}+v_{O N}\\right) / 2$ near $V_{O C(\\mathrm{set})}$ regardless of the ac signals present. This holds true as long as none of the transistors is forced out of its active region.\n\nDetermine the small-signal gain $v_{o d} / v_{i d}$ of the op amp of Fig. 5.51, assuming the parameters of Example 5.4. Compare with the example and comment.\n\n#### Solution\n\nThe circuit of Fig. 5.51 is symmetric about the vertical axis extending from node $V_{G 78}$, so we use the half-circuit ac equivalent of Fig. 5.52. By inspection, $R_{o}=R_{d 5} / / R_{d 3}$, where $R_{d 5}$ and $R_{d 3}$ are the ac resistances observed looking into the drains of $M_{5}$ and $M_{3}$. Using inspection again, we write\n\n$$\nR_{o}=\\left[r_{o 5}+r_{o 7}+\\left(g_{m 5}+g_{m b 5}\\right) r_{o 5} r_{o 7}\\right] / /\\left[r_{o 3}+\\left(r_{o 9} / / r_{o 1}\\right)+\\left(g_{m 3}+g_{m b 3}\\right) r_{o 3}\\left(r_{o 9} / / r_{o 1}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nThis is formally identical to Eq. (5.39), so we reuse Example 5.4 to write $R_{o} \\cong$ $5.22 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega$. We also have $i_{1}=g_{m 1}\\left(v_{i d} / 2\\right)=(0.4 \\mathrm{~mA} / \\mathrm{V}) \\times\\left(v_{i d} / 2\\right)$. Following the line of reasoning of Example 5.4, we can state that most of $i_{1}$ flows out of $M_{3}$, so\n\n$$\n-\\frac{v_{o d}}{2} \\cong-R_{o} i_{1}=-g_{m 1} R \\frac{v_{o d}}{2}\n$$\n\nConsequently, $v_{o d} / v_{i d}=g_{m 1} R_{o} \\cong 0.4 \\times 5,220=2,088 \\mathrm{~V} / \\mathrm{V}$. The single-ended signal $v_{o}$ of Example 5.4 now splits between the two opposite halves $v_{o p}$ and $v_{o n}$, so the gain remains unchanged.\n\nFigure 5.53 shows how the two-stage CMOS op amp of Fig. 5.13 can be transformed into a fully differential type (again, the biasing details are omitted for simplicity). In this version, the CMFN is the complement of that in Fig. 5.51, as it is designed to adjust the current of a $p$ MOSFET, specifically, the tail current supplied by $M_{9}$ (clearly, there are various ways to design a CMFN).\nThis is a fully differential two-stage CMOS operational amplifier. It incorporates a common-mode feedback network for differential operation. The circuit is designed to expand the input voltage range by biasing specific transistors at the edge of saturation.\n\n#### Expanding the Input Voltage Range\n\nIf we specify $V_{G 34}$ in the folded-cascode op amp of Fig. 5.51 to bias the $M_{9}-M_{10}$ pair precisely at the edge of saturation $\\left(V_{D S 9}=V_{O V 9}\\right.$ and $\\left.V_{D S 10}=V_{O V 10}\\right)$, then, the input voltage range (IVR) is defined by Eq. (5.41). For instance, suppose we have a single-supply system with $V_{S S}=0$ and $V_{D D}=3 \\mathrm{~V}$, and let $\\left|V_{t 1}\\right|=0.75 \\mathrm{~V}$ and $V_{O V}=0.25 \\mathrm{~V}$ throughout. Then, the common-mode input voltage $v_{I C}=1 / 2\\left(v_{P}+v_{N}\\right)$ is such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& v_{I C(\\min )}=V_{S S}+V_{O V 9}-\\left|V_{t \\mid}\\right|=0+0.25-0.75=-0.5 \\mathrm{~V} \\\\\n& v_{I C(\\max )}=V_{D D}-V_{O V 11}-V_{O V 1}-\\left|V_{t 1}\\right|=3-0.25-0.25-0.75=1.75 \\mathrm{~V}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWhile the lower limit is quite desirable because it allows us to lower the inputs all the way down to the ground rail, and even $0.5-\\mathrm{V}$ below, without causing any malfunction, the upper limit is generally too restrictive, especially in a low-supply situation such as the $3-\\mathrm{V}$ case considered here. Ideally, we want the IVR to extend from rail to rail and possibly beyond by, say, a $0.5-\\mathrm{V}$ margin (from -0.5 V to 3.5 V in our example). If we were to use the dual op amp realization by interchanging $p$ MOSFETs and $n$ MOSFETs as well as interchanging the power supplies (see Fig. P5.21), then the $n$-type input pair would exhibit the dual constraints $v_{I C(\\min )}=1.25 \\mathrm{~V}$ and $v_{I C(\\max )}=$ 3.5 V. In other words, while a $p$-type input stage works well near $V_{S S}$ but degrades near $V_{D D}$, an $n$-type works well near $V_{D D}$ but degrades near $V_{S S}$, just the opposite.\n\nThe above considerations provide the basis for the ingenious solution of Fig. 5.54, which uses both input-stage types to achieve the best of both. (The CMFN, not shown to avoid cluttering the schematic, can be made to adjust either $V_{G 78}$ or $V_{G 910}$, or both.) Assuming again $V_{t n}=-V_{t p}=0.75 \\mathrm{~V}$ and $V_{O V}=0.25 \\mathrm{~V}$ throughout, we note the following:\n\n- For $v_{I C}<V_{S S}+V_{O V 11 n}+V_{t n}\\left(=1 \\mathrm{~V}\\right.$ for $\\left.V_{S S}=0\\right)$ the $M_{1 n}-M_{2 n}$ pair is off, whereas the $M_{1 p}-M_{2 p}$ pair is fully operational, so we rewrite Eq. (5.38) as $G_{m}=g_{m 1 p}$.\n- Raising $v_{I C}$ above 1 V will gradually turn on the $M_{1 n}-M_{2 n}$ pair until both pairs are fully operational once we pass the $1.25-\\mathrm{V}$ mark. For $1.25 \\mathrm{~V} \\leq v_{I C} \\leq 1.75 \\mathrm{~V}$ the two pairs work in tandem, giving $G_{m}=g_{m 1 p}+g_{m 1 n}$.\n- Raising $v_{I C}$ above 1.75 V will gradually turn off the $M_{1 p}-M_{2 p}$ pair while the $M_{1 n}-M_{2 n}$ pair continues to be fully operational.\n- For $v_{I C}>V_{D D}-V_{O V 11 p}-\\left|V_{t p}\\right|\\left(=2 \\mathrm{~V}\\right.$ for $\\left.V_{D D}=3 \\mathrm{~V}\\right)$ the $M_{1 p}-M_{2 p}$ pair is totally off, so the circuit gives $G_{m}=g_{m 1 n}$.\n- So long as the $M_{7}-M_{8}$ and the $M_{9}-M_{19}$ pairs are biased at the edge of saturation, the output voltage swing (OVS) will extend to within two $V_{O V}$ of either supply rail. If a true rail-to-rail OVS is desired, then an ad-hoc output stage is required, such as the CS push-pull output stage of Section 4.11.\n\nFigure 5.55 shows the bipolar version of Fig. 5.54. To maximize the IVR, $V_{B 34}$ is set to bias the $Q_{9}-Q_{10}$ pair slightly above the edge of saturation, say at $V_{C E 9}=V_{C E 10} \\cong$ 0.25 V. Similarly, $V_{B 56}$ is set so that $V_{E C 7}=V_{E C 8} \\cong 0.25 \\mathrm{~V}$. Then, assuming B-E voltage drops of 0.65 V, we have $v_{I C(\\min )}=V_{E E}+2 \\times 0.25-0.65=V_{E E}-0.15 \\mathrm{~V}$\nand $v_{I C(\\max )}=V_{D D}+0.15 \\mathrm{~V}$. In some embodiments, the $Q_{7}-Q_{8}$ and $Q_{9}-Q_{10}$ pairs are replaced by resistor pairs ${ }^{1}$ to develop the voltage drops of about 0.25 V required to prevent the input pairs from saturating in the vicinity of the supply rails.\n\nA significant issue with the op amps of Figs. 5.54 and 5.55 is that near the lower end of the IVR, the input offset voltage of the $p$-type pair dominates, whereas near the upper end, that of the $n$-type pair dominates. So, as $v_{I C}$ changes from one end to the other of the IVR, the net input offset voltage will generally change in magnitude and possibly in polarity, depending on the magnitudes and directions of the individual mismatches. In the bipolar case, the input bias current may also pose problems: at the lower end, it coincides with the base current of the $p$-type pair, flowing out of the op amp, but at the higher end, it coincides with that of the $n$-type pair, flowing into the op amp. At intermediate IVR values, both pairs are on, and the base currents of the $p$-type pair tend to cancel those of the $n$-type pair. Consequently, input bias-current magnitude and direction are strong functions of $v_{I C}$."

(5.41). For instance, suppose we have a single-supply system with $V_{SS}=0$ and $V_{DD}=3 \\mathrm{~V}$, and let $|V_{t1}|=0.75 \\mathrm{~V}$ and $V_{OV}=0.25 \\mathrm{~V}$ throughout. Then, the common-mode input voltage $v_{IC}=1/2(v_{P}+v_{N})$ is such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& v_{IC(min)}=V_{SS}+V_{OV9}-|V_{t1}|=0+0.25-0.75=-0.5 \\mathrm{~V} \\\\\n& v_{IC(max)}=V_{DD}-V_{OV11}-V_{OV1}-|V_{t1}|=3-0.25-0.25-0.75=1.75 \\mathrm{~V}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWhile the lower limit is quite desirable because it allows us to lower the inputs all the way down to the ground rail, and even $0.5-\\mathrm{V}$ below, without causing any malfunction, the upper limit is generally too restrictive, especially in a low-supply situation such as the $3-\\mathrm{V}$ case considered here.

In other words, while a $p$-type input stage works well near $V_{SS}$ but goes off near $V_{DD}$, an $n$-type works well near $V_{DD}$ but goes off near $V_{SS}$, just the opposite.\n\nThe above considerations provide the basis for the ingenious solution of Figure 5.54, which uses both input-stage types to get the best of both. (The CMFN, not shown to avoid cluttering the schematic, can be made to adjust either $V_{G78}$ or $V_{G910}$, or both.) Assuming again $V_{tn}=-V_{tp}=0.75 \\mathrm{~V}$ and $V_{OV}=0.25 \\mathrm{~V}$ throughout, we note the following:\n\n- For $v_{IC}<V_{SS}+V_{OV11n}+V_{tn}$(=1 \\mathrm{~V} for $V_{SS}=0)$, the $M_{1n}-M_{2n}$ pair is off, whereas the $M_{1p}-M_{2p}$ pair is fully operational, so we rewrite Eq. (5.38) as $G_{m}=g_{m1p}$.\n- Raising $v_{IC}$ above 1 V will gradually turn on the $M_{1n}-M_{2n}$ pair until both pairs are fully operational once we pass the $1.25-\\mathrm{V}$ mark. For $1.25 \\mathrm{~V} \\leq v_{IC} \\leq 1.75 \\mathrm{~V}$, the two pairs work in tandem, giving $G_{m}=g_{m1p}+g_{m1n}$.\n- Raising $v_{IC}$ above 1.75 V will gradually turn off the $M_{1p}-M_{2p}$ pair while the $M_{1n}-M_{2n}$ pair continues to be fully operational.\n- For $v_{IC}>V_{DD}-V_{OV11p}-|V_{tp}|$(=2 \\mathrm{~V} for $V_{DD}=3 \\mathrm{~V}$), the $M_{1p}-M_{2p}$ pair is totally off, so the circuit gives $G_{m}=g_{m1n}$.\n- So long as the $M_{7}-M_{8}$ and the $M_{9}-M_{19}$ pairs are biased at the edge of saturation, the output voltage swing (OVS) will extend to within two $V_{OV}$ of either supply rail. If a true rail-to-rail OVS is desired, then an ad-hoc output stage is required, such as the CS push-pull output stage of Section 4.11.\n\nFigure 5.55 is the bipolar version of Figure 5.54. To maximize the IVR, $V_{B34}$ is set to bias the $Q_{9}-Q_{10}$ pair slightly above the edge of saturation, say at $V_{CE9}=V_{CE10} \\cong$ 0.25 V. Likewise, $V_{B56}$ is set so that $V_{EC7}=V_{EC8} \\cong 0.25 \\mathrm{~V}$. Then, assuming B-E voltage drops of 0.65 V, we have $v_{IC(min)}=V_{EE}+2 \\times 0.25-0.65=V_{EE}-0.15 \\mathrm{~V}$\nand $v_{IC(max)}=V_{DD}+0.15 \\mathrm{~V}$. In some embodiments, the $Q_{7}-Q_{8}$ and $Q_{9}-Q_{10}$ pairs are replaced by resistor pairs ${ }^{1}$ to develop the voltage drops of about 0.25 V that are required to prevent the input pairs from saturating in the vicinity of the supply rails.\n\nA notorious issue with the op amps of Figures 5.54 and 5.55 is that near the lower end of the IVR, the input offset voltage of the $p$-type pair dominates, whereas near the upper end, that of the $n$-type pair dominates. So, as $v_{IC}$ changes from one end to the other of the IVR, the net input offset voltage will generally change in magnitude and possibly in polarity, depending on the magnitudes and directions of the individual mismatches. In the bipolar case, the input bias current may also pose problems: at the lower end, it coincides with the base current of the $p$-type pair, flowing out of the op amp, but at the higher end, it coincides with that of the $n$-type pair, flowing into the op amp. At intermediate IVR values, both pairs are on, and the base currents of the $p$-type pair tend to cancel those of the $n$-type pair. Consequently, input bias-current magnitude and direction are strong functions of $v_{IC}$."
