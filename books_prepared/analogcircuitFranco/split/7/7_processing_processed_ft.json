Consider next the case in which the (initially discharged) capacitor is in the feedback path of the amplifier as in Fig. 6.18b. As we raise the left plate from 0 V to 1 mV, the amplifier will lower the right plate from 0 V to -99 mV, causing a $100-\\mathrm{mV}$ total change across the capacitor. The charge transfer is now $\\Delta Q=C \\Delta V=10^{-2} \\times(100 \\times 10^{-3})=100 \\mathrm{fC}$. Even though the physical capacitance of Fig. 6.18b is still 1 pF, the charge transfer is 100 times that of Fig. 6.18a. Yet, the applied voltage is still 1 mV. So if we regroup the terms as $\\Delta Q=(10^{-12} \\times 100) \\times 10^{-3}=(100 \\mathrm{pF})(1 \\mathrm{mV})=100 \\mathrm{fC}$, we can state that things go as if the input source were driving a fictitious capacitance 100 times as large, or $C_{M}=100 \\mathrm{pF}$!"

We can use the given data: $t_{S} = 25 \\mathrm{~ns}$, $I_{F} = 10 \\mathrm{~mA}$, and $I_{R} = -2 \\mathrm{~mA}$. The formula relating these quantities is $t_{S} = \\tau_{F} \\ln [(I_{F} + |I_{R}|) / |I_{R}|]$. Plugging in the values, we get $25 \\mathrm{~ns} = \\tau_{F} \\ln [(10 + 2) / 2]$. Solving for $\\tau_{F}$, we find $\\tau_{F} \\cong 14 \\mathrm{~ns}$. This method allows us to experimentally determine $\\tau_{F}$ through storage-time and current-drive measurements."

However, due to the logarithmic dependence, the reduction in $t_{S}$ is not very dramatic."
