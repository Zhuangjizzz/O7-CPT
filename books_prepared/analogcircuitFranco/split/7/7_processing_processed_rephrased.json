This assumption holds true only up to certain operating frequencies, beyond which various parasitic reactances become significant, limiting the circuit's frequency response and operating speed (collectively referred to as dynamics). Since diodes and transistors operate based on charge control, their internal parasitics are predominantly capacitive, with the junction capacitance $C_{j}$ from Chapter 1 being a well-known example.

These parasitics are typically small, meaning that at lower operating frequencies, stray capacitances act as open circuits and stray inductances act as short circuits, and can thus be disregarded. However, as the circuit's operating frequency or speed increases, the roles of capacitances and inductances reverse, with capacitances behaving more like short circuits and inductances like open circuits.

Additionally, the MOSFET includes capacitances formed by the gate with the channel and with the source and drain regions, which have no equivalent in the BJT. Conversely, the BJT features a capacitance related to minority charge accumulation in the base region, absent in the MOSFET.

This assumption holds true only up to certain operating frequencies, beyond which various parasitic reactances become significant, limiting the circuit's frequency response and operating speed (collectively termed dynamics). Since diodes and transistors function based on charge control, their internal parasitics are predominantly capacitive, with the junction capacitance $C_{j}$ from Chapter 1 being a typical example. However, even in the absence of electronic devices, circuits inherently exhibit reactive parasitics due to their dimensions and layout. Considering a circuit as a network of nodes and branches, we can assert that:\n\n- Each node exhibits stray capacitance towards its neighboring nodes, including the reference or ground node.\n- Each branch exhibits stray self-inductance and inductive coupling to adjacent branches.\n\nA capacitance, whether deliberate or parasitic, resists changes in the voltage across it, while an inductance resists changes in the current through it. These parasitics are generally minor, meaning that at lower operating frequencies, stray capacitances act as open circuits and stray inductances as short circuits, and can thus be disregarded. However, as the circuit's operating frequency or speed increases, the roles of capacitances and inductances reverse, with capacitances behaving more like short circuits and inductances like open circuits. In the circuits we are examining, the most severe limitations are typically due to stray capacitances. To analyze their impact on circuit dynamics, we need to enhance the small-signal transistor models used so far with appropriate capacitances.\n\nBoth BJTs and MOSFETs contain pn junctions, necessitating the inclusion of corresponding junction capacitances in their models. Additionally, the MOSFET includes capacitances formed by the gate with the channel, as well as with the source and drain regions, which have no equivalent in the BJT. Conversely, the BJT features a capacitance related to minority charge accumulation in the base region, absent in the MOSFET. Thus, while there are similarities and differences in the parasitic origins of these two devices, the similarities are sufficient that mastering the high-frequency analysis of one type allows for significant application to the other.\n\nCHAPTER HIGHLIGHTS\n\nThe chapter initiates with the physical basis of parasitic capacitances in BJTs and MOSFETs, followed by the development of appropriate high-frequency models for both devices.\n\nThese models are then utilized to study the high-frequency behavior of fundamental single-transistor configurations (CE/CS, CC/CD, and CB/CG), as well as differential pairs, both passively and actively loaded. Given that the $\\mathrm{CC} / \\mathrm{CD}$ and $\\mathrm{CB} / \\mathrm{CG}$ configurations are notable for their impedance transformation capabilities, special emphasis is placed on terminal impedances and their modeling, particularly regarding inductive impedances due to their propensity to cause ringing or even oscillations.\n\nAs circuit complexity grows, frequency analysis can become excessively challenging. The open-circuit time-constant (OCTC) technique, discussed subsequently, simplifies this task by breaking it into several simpler sub-tasks, which we then use to estimate the circuit's bandwidth. The OCTC technique is especially valuable in analyzing multi-transistor circuits like the cascode configuration.\n\nFrequency response reveals only certain aspects of a circuit's dynamics. To fully understand the dynamics, the transient response, its dual, must also be considered. Operational amplifiers exemplify the utility of knowing both perspectives concurrently.\n\nIn some scenarios, particularly in highly nonlinear applications such as switches and logic gates, only the transient response is pertinent. The chapter concludes with discussions on the switching transients of pn junctions and BJTs, the propagation delays of CMOS logic gates, and the response times of voltage comparators.\n\nEffective frequency analysis necessitates proficiency in manipulating transfer functions and constructing Bode plots. For ease of reference, these topics are succinctly reviewed in Appendix 6A at the chapter's end. The chapter extensively employs PSpice, both for displaying Bode plots and transient responses as a software oscilloscope, and for verifying hand calculations."

This plot is presented on logarithmic scales, with frequency $\\omega$ on the horizontal axis and magnitude $|\\beta(j\\omega)|$ in decibels (dB) on the vertical axis.\n\nThe plot indicates a constant magnitude $\\beta_0$ at lower frequencies, followed by a decrease in magnitude as the frequency approaches $\\omega_\\beta$. The slope of $-20 \\text{ dB/dec}$ signifies a first-order system roll-off. Key features include the initial magnitude level $\\beta_0$, the pole frequency $\\omega_\\beta$, and the transition frequency $\\omega_T$.\n\nSince the denominator of $\\beta(s)$ becomes zero at $s=-\\omega_{\\beta}$, causing $\\beta(s)$ to approach infinity, $\\omega_{\\beta}$ is termed the pole frequency (refer to Bode plots in Appendix 6A).

Specifically, a decade increase (or decrease) in $\\omega$ results in a corresponding decade decrease (or increase) in $|\\beta(j \\omega)|$, or 20 dB. Alternatively, an octave increase (or decrease) in $\\omega$ leads to a 6-dB decrease (or increase) in $|\\beta(j \\omega)|$.\n\nThe frequency $\\omega_{T}$ at which $|\\beta(j \\omega)|$ decreases to unity, or 0 dB, is known as the transition frequency, marking the point where the BJT ceases to provide current gain and starts attenuating.

Using the fact that $C_{\\mu} \\ll C_{\\pi}$, demonstrate that for frequencies up to at least $\\omega_{T}$, $\\left|I_{\\mu}\\right| \\ll\\left|g_{m} V_{\\pi}\\right|$, thereby justifying the approximation $I_{c} \\cong g_{m} V_{\\pi}$.\n\nIf a certain BJT exhibits $|\\beta|=200$ at $f=1 \\mathrm{kHz}$ and $|\\beta|=10$ at $f=500 \\mathrm{MHz}$, determine $\\beta_{0}, f_{\\beta}$, and $f_{T}$.\n\n#### Solution\n\nGiven that 1 kHz is a very low frequency, the first data point corresponds to the low-frequency asymptote, implying $\\beta_{0}=200$. The second data point, significantly lower than $\\beta_{0}$, lies on the high-frequency asymptote, where the GBP is constant. Therefore, $f_{T}=\\mathrm{GBP}=$ $10 \\times 500=5 \\mathrm{GHz}$. Consequently, $f_{\\beta}=f_{T} / \\beta_{0}=5000 / 200=25 \\mathrm{MHz}$.\n\nA closer examination of the transition frequency $f_{T}$ reveals its dependence on the bias current $I_{C}$. By combining Eqs. (6.5), (6.6), and (6.12), we can express $f_{T}$ as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nf_{T}=\\frac{1 / 2 \\pi}{\\frac{C_{j e}+C_{\\mu}}{I_{C}} V_{T}+\\tau_{F}} \\tag{6.13}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis equation explicitly shows the influence of the bias current $I_{C}$. At low collector currents, $f_{T}$ is primarily determined by $C_{j e}+C_{\\mu}$ and increases with $I_{C}$. For sufficiently high $I_{C}$, $f_{T}$ saturates at\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nf_{T(\\max )}=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\tau_{F}} \\tag{6.14}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nindicating that $\\tau_{F}$ imposes the ultimate limit on $f_{T}$. Figure 6.7 illustrates a decrease in $f_{T}$ at high collector currents, attributed to the increase in $\\tau_{F}$ due to high-level injection and other high collector-current effects.\n\nFIGURE 6.7 Dependence of $f_{T}$ on the bias current $I_{C}$.\n\nThe graph in Figure 6.7 depicts the relationship between the transition frequency $f_{T}$ and the collector current $I_{C}$ for a bipolar junction transistor (BJT). The graph employs a logarithmic scale for the $I_{C}$ axis, while the $f_{T}$ axis appears to be linear.\n\nThe graph reveals a linear increase in $f_{T}$ with $I_{C}$ at low current levels, followed by a plateau at higher currents, marking the saturation point. This plateau corresponds to $f_{T(\\max)} = 1/(2\\pi\\tau_F)$, where $\\tau_F$ is the forward transit time. At very high $I_{C}$ levels, $f_{T}$ exhibits a decline due to the rise in $\\tau_F$ caused by high-level injection and other effects.\n\nKey features include the transition from an increasing trend to a saturation region, followed by a decline, showcasing the behavior of $f_{T}$ across different $I_{C}$ levels. The plateau at $1/(2\\pi\\tau_F)$ is a critical feature, indicating the maximum achievable $f_{T}$ due to the limitations imposed by $\\tau_F$.\n\nAnnotations and specific data points highlight the regions dominated by $C_{je} + C_\\mu$ and $\\tau_F$, emphasizing the factors influencing $f_{T}$ in different regions of $I_{C}$. The decline in $f_{T}$ at high $I_{C}$ levels is also annotated, underscoring the impact of increased $\\tau_F$ due to high-level injection.\n\nUsing Eq. (6.4) and Einstein's relation $D_{n}=\\mu_{n} V_{T}$, we can express, for an $n p n$ BJT,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nf_{T(\\max )}=\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\frac{\\mu_{n}}{W_{B}^{2}} V_{T} \\tag{6.15}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n(For a pnp BJT, replace $\\mu_{n}$ with $\\mu_{p}$.) It is clear that for fast operation, a BJT should be fabricated with a very narrow base and should be of the npn type, as electrons are 2 to 3 times more mobile than holes.\n\nEXAMPLE 6.3 Find $f_{T}$ for the BJT of Example 6.1. How does this compare with $f_{T(\\max )}$? Which parasitic dominates $f_{T}$ in this example? Which dominates the least?\n\n#### Solution\n\nEquation (6.13) yields\n\n$$\nf_{T}=\\frac{1 / 2 \\pi}{\\frac{(2+0.2) 10^{-12}}{0.1} 26+200 \\times 10^{-12}}=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi(520+52+200) 10^{-12}}=206 \\mathrm{MHz}\n$$\n\nEquation (6.14) gives\n\n$$\nf_{T(\\max )}=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi 200 \\times 10^{-12}}=796 \\mathrm{MHz}\n$$\n\nIn this example, $C_{j e}$ is the primary factor affecting $f_{T}$.

The magnitude of the current gain is plotted on logarithmic scales, as shown in Fig. 6.6.\n\nThe Bode plot reveals several key observations. At low frequencies (\\( \\omega \\ll \\omega_\\beta \\)), the current gain remains at its low-frequency value \\( \\beta_0 \\). As the frequency increases beyond \\( \\omega_\\beta \\), the gain decreases at a rate of \\( -20 \\text{ dB/dec} \\).

For example, a process with $t_{o x}=10 \\mathrm{~nm}$ results in $C_{o x}=34.5 / 10=3.45 \\mathrm{fF} / \\mu \\mathrm{m}^{2}$. The gate length as drawn on the mask before fabrication is denoted as $L_{\\text {drawn }}$. During the fabrication of the $n^{+}$source and drain regions via ion implantation, ions diffuse laterally, causing some overlap between the inner edges of these regions and the outer edges of the gate electrode. Denoting the amount of overlap as $L_{o v}$ (in PSpice this is denoted as Ld), we thus have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nL=L_{d r a w n}-2 L_{o v} \\tag{6.18}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nTypically, $L_{o v}$ is around 10-20% of $L_{\\text {drawn }}$. (Note that when calculating the device transconductance parameter $k=k^{\\prime}(W / L)$, we must use $L$ as given above, and also include the multiplicative factor $\\left(1+\\lambda v_{D S}\\right)$ to account for the channel length modulation $\\Delta L$. When referring to a specific fabrication process, engineers use $L$ to denote what is actually $L_{\\text {drawn }}$. This is also the convention used by PSpice, where statements like $\\mathrm{L}=1$. 0u $L d=0.15 \\mathrm{u}$ imply a fabrication process with $L_{\\text {drawn }}=1.0 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ and $L_{o v}=0.15 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$, resulting in $L=1-2 \\times 0.15=$ $0.7 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$.

This asymmetry causes $(2 / 3)$ of $C_{g c}$ to be on the source side, and none on the drain side. ${ }^{2}$ Based on these considerations, the complete high-frequency model of the MOSFET is as shown in Fig. 6.9. As usual, small-signal voltages and currents, now frequency-dependent, are represented in terms of their Laplace transforms (upper-case letters with lower-case subscripts).

Recall from Chapter 3 that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{o x}=\\frac{\\varepsilon_{o x}}{t_{o x}}=\\frac{34.5}{t_{o x}} \\mathrm{fF} / \\mu \\mathrm{m}^{2} \\tag{6.17}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $t_{o x}$ is the oxide thickness, in nm. For instance, a process with $t_{o x}=10 \\mathrm{~nm}$ gives $C_{o x}=34.5 / 10=3.45 \\mathrm{fF} / \\mu \\mathrm{m}^{2}$. The gate length as drawn on the mask before fabrication is denoted as $L_{\\text {drawn }}$. During fabrication of the $n^{+}$source and drain regions via ion implantation, ions diffuse laterally, resulting in some overlap between the inner edges of these regions and the outer edges of the gate electrode. Denoting the amount of overlap as $L_{o v}$ (in PSpice this is denoted as Ld), we thus have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nL=L_{d r a w n}-2 L_{o v} \\tag{6.18}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nTypically, $L_{o v}$ is on the order of 10-20% of $L_{\\text {drawn }}$. (Note that when calculating the device transconductance parameter $k=k^{\\prime}(W / L)$, we must use $L$ as given above, and also use the multiplicative factor $\\left(1+\\lambda v_{D S}\\right)$ to account for the channel length modulation $\\Delta L$. When referring to a particular fabrication process, engineers use $L$ to denote what is actually $L_{\\text {drawn }}$. This is also the convention used by PSpice, where statements of the type $\\mathrm{L}=1$. 0u $L d=0.15 \\mathrm{u}$ imply a fabrication process with $L_{\\text {drawn }}=1.0 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ and $L_{o v}=0.15 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$, and thus $L=1-2 \\times 0.15=$ $0.7 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$. For consistency with previous chapters, we shall continue using $L$ to denote the distance between the inner edges of the source and drain regions.)\n\n- The channel-body depletion capacitance $C_{c b}$. In saturation operation, which is the region of greatest interest in analog applications, this capacitance is shielded from the gate by the inversion layer and therefore plays a negligible role.\n- The overlap capacitances at the source and drain edges of the gate electrode, each of which is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{o v} \\cong W L_{o v} C_{o x} \\tag{6.19}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n- The junction capacitances $C_{s b}$ and $C_{d b}$ between the $n^{+}$regions of the source and drain, and the $p^{-}$body, also called bulk or substrate.

This asymmetry causes $(2 / 3)$ of $C_{g c}$ to be allocated to the source side, and none to the drain side. ${ }^{2}$ Based on these considerations, the complete high-frequency model of the MOSFET is as shown in Fig. 6.9. As usual, small-signal voltages and currents, now frequency-dependent, are represented in terms of their Laplace transforms (upper-case letters with lower-case subscripts). We shall see that the capacitances most influential in the frequency response of a FET are $C_{g s}$ and $C_{g d}$, which take on the forms\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{g s} \\cong \\frac{2}{3} W L C_{o x}+W L_{o v} C_{o x} \\quad C_{g d} \\cong W L_{o v} C_{o x} \\tag{6.21}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe model also includes the stray capacitance $C_{g b}$, not immediately evident from the structure of Fig. 6.8, to account for the capacitive coupling between the gate interconnections and the underlying substrate outside the active device area.

Recall from Chapter 3 that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{o x}=\\frac{\\varepsilon_{o x}}{t_{o x}}=\\frac{34.5}{t_{o x}} \\mathrm{fF} / \\mu \\mathrm{m}^{2} \\tag{6.17}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $t_{o x}$ is the oxide thickness, in nm. For example, a process with $t_{o x}=10 \\mathrm{~nm}$ results in $C_{o x}=34.5 / 10=3.45 \\mathrm{fF} / \\mu \\mathrm{m}^{2}$. The gate length as drawn on the mask before fabrication is denoted as $L_{\\text {drawn }}$. During the fabrication of the $n^{+}$source and drain regions via ion implantation, ions diffuse laterally, leading to some overlap between the inner edges of these regions and the outer edges of the gate electrode. Denoting the amount of overlap as $L_{o v}$ (in PSpice this is denoted as Ld), we thus have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nL=L_{d r a w n}-2 L_{o v} \\tag{6.18}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nTypically, $L_{o v}$ is about 10-20% of $L_{\\text {drawn }}$. (Note that when calculating the device transconductance parameter $k=k^{\\prime}(W / L)$, we must use $L$ as given above, and also include the multiplicative factor $\\left(1+\\lambda v_{D S}\\right)$ to account for the channel length modulation $\\Delta L$. When referring to a specific fabrication process, engineers use $L$ to denote what is actually $L_{\\text {drawn }}$. This is also the convention used by PSpice, where statements like $\\mathrm{L}=1$. 0u $L d=0.15 \\mathrm{u}$ imply a fabrication process with $L_{\\text {drawn }}=1.0 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ and $L_{o v}=0.15 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$, and thus $L=1-2 \\times 0.15=$ $0.7 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$. For consistency with previous chapters, we will continue using $L$ to denote the distance between the inner edges of the source and drain regions.)\n\n- The channel-body depletion capacitance $C_{c b}$. In saturation operation, which is the region of primary interest in analog applications, this capacitance is shielded from the gate by the inversion layer and hence plays a negligible role.\n- The overlap capacitances at the source and drain edges of the gate electrode, each of which is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{o v} \\cong W L_{o v} C_{o x} \\tag{6.19}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n- The junction capacitances $C_{s b}$ and $C_{d b}$ between the $n^{+}$regions of the source and drain, and the $p^{-}$body, also referred to as bulk or substrate. As we know, these capacitances take the forms\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{s b}=\\frac{C_{s b 0}}{\\left(1+v_{S B} / \\phi_{0}\\right)^{m}} \\quad C_{d b}=\\frac{C_{d b 0}}{\\left(1+v_{D B} / \\phi_{0}\\right)^{m}} \\tag{6.20}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe role of each of the above capacitances varies with the operating conditions of the MOSFET. ${ }^{2}$ In analog applications, FETs are operated in saturation, where the channel assumes the familiar tapered shape (see Fig. 6.8), with $\\Delta L$ being the SCL portion extending into the channel side. This asymmetry results in $(2 / 3)$ of $C_{g c}$ being allocated to the source side, and none to the drain side. ${ }^{2}$ Based on these considerations, the complete high-frequency model of the MOSFET is as shown in Fig. 6.9. As usual, small-signal voltages and currents, now frequency-dependent, are represented in terms of their Laplace transforms (upper-case letters with lower-case subscripts). We will see that the capacitances most influential in the frequency response of a FET are $C_{g s}$ and $C_{g d}$, which take the forms\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{g s} \\cong \\frac{2}{3} W L C_{o x}+W L_{o v} C_{o x} \\quad C_{g d} \\cong W L_{o v} C_{o x} \\tag{6.21}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe model also includes the stray capacitance $C_{g b}$, not immediately apparent from the structure of Fig. 6.8, to account for the capacitive coupling between the gate interconnections and the underlying substrate outside the active device area. In current technology, the various capacitances in a MOSFET's small-signal model are in the femtofarad range $\\left(1 \\mathrm{fF}=10^{-15} \\mathrm{~F}\\right)$.\nimage_name:FIGURE 6.9 Complete high-frequency small-signal model for the MOSFET\ndescription:\n[\nname: Cgs, type: Capacitor, value: Cgs, ports: {Np: G, Nn: S}\nname: Cgd, type: Capacitor, value: Cgd, ports: {Np: G, Nn: D}\nname: Cgb, type: Capacitor, value: Cgb, ports: {Np: G, Nn: B}\nname: Csb, type: Capacitor, value: Csb, ports: {Np: S, Nn: B}\nname: Cdb, type: Capacitor, value: Cdb, ports: {Np: D, Nn: B}\nname: gmVgs, type: VoltageControlledCurrentSource, ports: {Np: D, Nn: S}\nname: gmbVbs, type: VoltageControlledCurrentSource, ports: {Np: D, Nn: S}\nname: ro, type: Resistor, value: ro, ports: {N1: D, N2: S}\n]\nextrainfo:This is a complete high-frequency small-signal model for a MOSFET, including capacitive couplings and controlled current sources.\n\nFIGURE 6.9 Complete high-frequency small-signal model for the MOSFET.\nimage_name:FIGURE 6.9 Complete high-frequency small-signal model for the MOSFET\ndescription:\n[\nname: Cgs, type: Capacitor, value: Cgs, ports: {Np: G, Nn: S}\nname: Cgd, type: Capacitor, value: Cgd, ports: {Np: G, Nn: D}\nname: g_mVgs, type: VoltageControlledCurrentSource, value: g_mVgs, ports: {Np: D, Nn: S}\nname: ro, type: Resistor, value: ro, ports: {N1: D, N2: S}\nname: Cdb, type: Capacitor, value: Cdb, ports: {Np: D, Nn: S}\n]\nextrainfo:This is a high-frequency small-signal model for a MOSFET with capacitive couplings and a voltage-controlled current source representing transconductance.

For fast operation, a MOSFET should have a very short channel and be of the n type, as electrons are 2 to 3 times as mobile as holes in p-type. This is similar to the BJT limit in Eq.

Since $V_{S}=10 \\times 0.1=1 \\mathrm{~V}$ and $V_{D S}=3-1=2 \\mathrm{~V}$, it follows that $V_{D S}>V_{O V}$, indicating a saturated FET. We have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\lambda & =\\lambda^{\\prime} / L=0.02 / 1=0.02 \\mathrm{~V}^{-1} \\\\\nr_{o} & =\\frac{1}{\\lambda I_{D}}=\\frac{1}{0.02 \\times 0.1}=500 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega \\\\\ng_{m} & =\\sqrt{2 k I_{D}}=\\sqrt{2 \\times 2.5 \\times 0.1}=\\frac{1}{1.41 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega} \\\\\ng_{m b} & =\\frac{\\gamma g_{m}}{2 \\sqrt{V_{S B}+2\\left|\\phi_{p}\\right|}}=\\frac{0.5 / 1.41}{2 \\sqrt{1+2 \\times 0.3}}=\\frac{1}{7.16 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n#### EXAMPLE 6.4\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& C_{s b}=\\frac{C_{s b 0}}{\\left(1+v_{S B} / \\phi_{0}\\right)^{m}}=\\frac{10}{(1+1 / 0.6)^{0.5}} \\cong 6 \\mathrm{fF} \\\\\n& C_{d b}=\\frac{C_{d b 0}}{\\left(1+v_{D B} / \\phi_{0}\\right)^{m}}=\\frac{10}{(1+3 / 0.6)^{0.5}} \\cong 4 \\mathrm{fF} \\\\\n& C_{g s} \\cong \\frac{2}{3} W L C_{o x}+W L_{o v} C_{o x}=\\frac{2}{3} 10 \\times 1 \\times 4+10 \\times 0.025 \\times 4 \\cong 27+1=28 \\mathrm{fF} \\\\\n& C_{g d}=1 \\mathrm{fF}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe complete small-signal model is depicted in Fig. 6.13b.\n(b) To find $f_{T}$ using Eq. (6.24b), but with $C_{g s}$ as in Eq. (6.22), namely, $C_{g s}=27+1+5=33 \\mathrm{fF}$, we get\n\n$$\nf_{T}=\\frac{g_{m}}{2 \\pi\\left(C_{g s}+C_{g d}\\right)}=\\frac{1 /\\left(1.41 \\times 10^{3}\\right)}{2 \\pi(33+1) 10^{-15}}=3.31 \\mathrm{GHz}\n$$\n\nAs in the BJT case, it is instructive to delve deeper into $f_{T}$, which we now express as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nf_{T}=\\frac{\\sqrt{2 k I_{D}}}{2 \\pi\\left(C_{g s}+C_{g d}\\right)} \\tag{6.25}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nClearly, the $f_{T}$ of a MOSFET increases with the square root of the bias current $I_{D}$. By contrast, at sufficiently low bias currents, the $f_{T}$ of a BJT increases directly with $I_{C}$ until it saturates at $f_{T}=1 /\\left(2 \\pi \\tau_{F}\\right)$ due to minority-charge diffusion. In contrast, the current in a FET is due to majority-charge drift, so the limiting factors are exclusively the stray capacitances.\n\nOf all the capacitances in a MOSFET, the dominant one is usually the first component on the right-hand side of Eq. (6.21). If we approximate Eq. (6.24b) as $f_{T} \\cong g_{m} /\\left(2 \\pi C_{g s}\\right)$ with $C_{g s} \\cong(2 / 3) W L C_{o x}$, then\n\n$$\nf_{T} \\cong \\frac{g_{m}}{2 \\pi(2 / 3) W L C_{o x}}=\\frac{0.75}{\\pi} \\frac{g_{m}}{W L C_{o x}}\n$$\n\nLetting $g_{m}=k V_{O V}=\\left[(W / L) \\mu_{n} C_{o x}\\right] V_{O V}$ and simplifying, we can place an upper limit on the $f_{T}$ of an $n$ MOSFET for a given $V_{O V}$ by writing\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nf_{T(\\max )}=\\frac{0.75}{\\pi} \\frac{\\mu_{n}}{L^{2}} V_{O V} \\tag{6.26}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n(For a $p$ MOSFET, replace $\\mu_{n}$ with $\\mu_{p}$.) It is evident that for rapid operation, a MOSFET should have a very short channel and be of the $n$ type, as electrons are 2 to 3 times as mobile as holes in a $p$-type. Note the striking similarity to the BJT limit of Eq. (6.15), except for the substitution of the (fixed) thermal voltage $V_{T}$ with the (user-imposed) overdrive voltage $V_{O V}$: the higher $V_{O V}$, the faster the MOSFET is likely to operate."

In fact, through simple circuit transformations, we can reduce them to a unified form, enabling a single analysis to avoid redundancy (fortunately, such opportunities will frequently arise as we progress).\n\n- Starting with the BJT equivalent in Fig. $6.14 b$, we simplify the left side using Thévenin's theorem and the right side by combining the two parallel resistances into one,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{i}=\\frac{r_{\\pi}}{R_{s i g}+r_{b}+r_{\\pi}} V_{s i g} \\quad R_{1}=\\left(R_{s i g}+r_{b}\\right) / / r_{\\pi} \\quad R_{2}=R_{C} / / r_{o} \\tag{6.27}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFollowing this, the circuit in Fig. $6.14 b$ simplifies to that in Fig. 6.16, where the input-node capacitance $C_{1}$ corresponds to $C_{\\pi}$, the feedback capacitance $C_{f}$ to $C_{\\mu}$, and $V_{1}$ to $V_{\\pi}$.\n\n- Similarly, for the MOS equivalent in Fig. $6.15 b$, with\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{i}=V_{s i g} \\quad R_{1}=R_{s i g} \\quad R_{2}=R_{D} / / r_{o} \\tag{6.28}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwe reduce it to the same equivalent circuit in Fig. 6.16, where now the input-node capacitance $C_{1}$ corresponds to $C_{g s}$, the feedback capacitance $C_{f}$ to $C_{g d}$, and $V_{1}$ to $V_{g s}$.\n\n**FIGURE 6.14 (a)** AC equivalent of the CE amplifier, and **(b)** its high-frequency small-signal model.\n\n- **FIGURE 6.14 (a)**: This AC equivalent circuit of a common-emitter amplifier includes a voltage source Vsig, resistors Rsig, rb, rπ, ro, and RC, capacitors Cπ and Cμ, and a voltage-controlled current source gmVπ.

Capacitor Ct is connected from V1 to ground.\n\nThe circuit in (b) is a simplified equivalent circuit using the Miller approximation. It consists of a voltage source, a resistor, a capacitor, a voltage-controlled current source, and another resistor. This configuration is utilized to analyze the frequency response and gain of the circuit.\n\nFIGURE 6.19 displays equivalent-circuit simplifications using the Miller approximation.\n\nThe graph in FIGURE 6.20 is a Bode plot depicting the magnitude gain of a circuit as a function of frequency. The plot is presented on a logarithmic scale, with the x-axis representing frequency (ω) in decades and the y-axis representing magnitude |a(jω)| in decibels (dB).\n\n- **X-axis:** Frequency (ω) in decades.\n- **Y-axis:** Magnitude |a(jω)| in decibels (dB).\n\nThe plot begins with a flat region at low frequencies where the gain remains constant at |a₀| dB. As the frequency increases, the plot exhibits a break point at a specific frequency, denoted as ωₚ. Beyond this break point, the gain starts to decrease at a rate of -20 dB/decade, indicating a first-order low-pass filter behavior.\n\n- **Initial Gain:** The initial magnitude gain is denoted as |a₀|.\n- **Break Point (ωₚ):** At the frequency ωₚ, the gain decreases by 3 dB from its initial value, marking the cutoff frequency.\n- **Slope:** Post ωₚ, the slope of the plot is -20 dB/decade, characteristic of a single-pole roll-off.\n\nThe plot includes a marker at the 3 dB point, which serves as a standard reference for identifying the cutoff frequency. A reference line is drawn to indicate the -20 dB/decade slope, emphasizing the linear decrease in gain on the logarithmic scale.\n\nFIGURE 6.20 illustrates the magnitude gain plot for the circuit of Fig. 6.19b.\n\nThe magnitude Bode plot is depicted in Fig. 6.20 (refer to Bode plots in Appendix 6A). It is instructive to rationalize this plot using physical insight. Referring to Fig. 6.19b, we observe that the frequency response is dictated by the ac voltage divider formed by $C_{t}$ with $R_{1}$, the equivalent resistance seen by $C_{t}$ itself. The impedance presented by $C_{t}$ is $Z_{t}(j \\omega)=1 /\\left(j \\omega C_{t}\\right)$, and depending on how its magnitude $\\left|Z_{t}(j \\omega)\\right|=1 /\\left(\\omega C_{t}\\right)$ compares with $R_{1}$, we have three significant cases:\n\n- At low frequencies, $\\left|Z_{t}(\\omega)\\right| \\gg R_{1}$, implying that $C_{t}$ behaves like an open circuit compared to $R_{1}$. Consequently, $V_{1} \\rightarrow V_{i}$, and thus $|a| \\rightarrow a_{0}$. This scenario is consistent with our previous discussions before embarking upon the present chapter.\n- At high frequencies, $\\left|Z_{t}(\\omega)\\right| \\ll R_{1}$, suggesting that $C_{t}$ now acts like a short circuit compared to $R_{1}$. Consequently, $V_{1} \\rightarrow 0$, and $|a|$ decreases with frequency, as depicted.\n- The transition between the two limiting cases occurs when $\\omega=\\omega_{p}$. Rearranging Eq. (6.35b) as $1 /\\left(\\omega_{p} C_{t}\\right)=R_{1}$, we see that at this frequency we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left|Z_{t}\\left(\\omega_{p}\\right)\\right|=R_{1} \\tag{6.36}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis provides a physical interpretation for $\\omega_{p}$: it represents the frequency at which the capacitance's impedance matches, in magnitude, the equivalent resistance seen by the capacitance itself. In the MOS case of Fig. 6.15, this resistance is simply $R_{s i g}$, but in the bipolar case of Fig. 6.14, it is $r_{\\pi} /\\left(R_{s i g}+r_{b}\\right)$. A circuit designer will always leverage physical insight to verify the results of mathematical derivations and to gain a deeper understanding of the circuit's behavior.\n\n- Due to the frequency-dependent gain reduction, an amplifier effectively acts as a lowpass filter. This is why $\\omega_{p}$ is also known as the corner frequency, cutoff frequency, or break frequency. At $\\omega=\\omega_{p}$, $\\left|V_{1}\\right|$ drops to $1 / \\sqrt{2}(=0.707$, or $-3-\\mathrm{dB})$ of its low-frequency value, so $\\omega_{p}$ is also referred to as the $-3-d B$ frequency. Since the power of an ac signal is proportional to the square of its magnitude, another name for $\\omega_{p}$ is half-power frequency. The gain-bandwidth product is defined as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{GBP}=\\left|a_{0}\\right| \\times f_{p} \\tag{6.37}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWe are now prepared to apply our findings to the specific circuits in Figs. 6.14 and 6.15.

Referring to FIGURE 6.19b, the frequency response is influenced by the ac voltage divider formed by $C_{t}$ and $R_{1}$, the equivalent resistance encountered by $C_{t}$. The impedance presented by $C_{t}$ is $Z_{t}(j \\omega)=1 /\\left(j \\omega C_{t}\\right)$, and depending on the magnitude $\\left|Z_{t}(j \\omega)\\right|=1 /\\left(\\omega C_{t}\\right)$ relative to $R_{1}$, we identify three pivotal scenarios:\n\n- At low frequencies, $\\left|Z_{t}(\\omega)\\right| \\gg R_{1}$, suggesting that $C_{t}$ behaves akin to an open circuit compared to $R_{1}$. Consequently, $V_{1} \\rightarrow V_{i}$, and thus $|a| \\rightarrow a_{0}$.\n- At high frequencies, $\\left|Z_{t}(\\omega)\\right| \\ll R_{1}$, indicating that $C_{t}$ now behaves like a short circuit compared to $R_{1}$. Consequently, $V_{1} \\rightarrow 0$, and $|a|$ diminishes with increasing frequency.\n- The transition between these two extremes occurs at $\\omega=\\omega_{p}$. Rearranging Eq. (6.35b) as $1 /\\left(\\omega_{p} C_{t}\\right)=R_{1}$, we observe that at this frequency\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left|Z_{t}\\left(\\omega_{p}\\right)\\right|=R_{1} \\tag{6.36}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis interpretation of $\\omega_{p}$: it signifies the frequency where the capacitance's impedance, in magnitude, equals the resistance encountered by the capacitance. In the MOS case of Fig. 6.15, this resistance is simply $R_{s i g}$, while in the bipolar case of Fig. 6.14, it is $r_{\\pi} /\\left(R_{s i g}+r_{b}\\right)$. Circuit designers habitually leverage physical insight to verify mathematical derivations and to comprehend the circuit's behavior.\n\n- Owing to the frequency-dependent gain reduction, an amplifier effectively functions as a lowpass filter. Hence, $\\omega_{p}$ is also known as the corner frequency, cutoff frequency, or break frequency. At $\\omega=\\omega_{p}$, $\\left|V_{1}\\right|$ diminishes to $1 / \\sqrt{2}$ (or 0.707, equivalent to -3 dB) of its low-frequency value, leading to the alternate name of $\\omega_{p}$ as the -3 dB frequency.

It is instructive to justify this plot using physical insight. With reference to Fig. 6.19b, we observe that the frequency response is governed by the ac voltage divider formed by $C_{t}$ with $R_{1}$, the equivalent resistance seen by $C_{t}$ itself. The impedance presented by $C_{t}$ is $Z_{t}(j \\omega)=1 /\\left(j \\omega C_{t}\\right)$, and depending on how its magnitude $\\left|Z_{t}(j \\omega)\\right|=1 /\\left(\\omega C_{t}\\right)$ compares with $R_{1}$, we have three significant cases:\n\n- At low frequencies we have $\\left|Z_{t}(\\omega)\\right| \\gg R_{1}$, indicating that $C_{t}$ approximates an open circuit compared to $R_{1}$. Consequently, $V_{1} \\rightarrow V_{i}$, and thus $|a| \\rightarrow a_{0}$. This is the situation we have been dealing with before embarking upon the present chapter.\n- At high frequencies we have $\\left|Z_{t}(\\omega)\\right| \\ll R_{\\mathrm{l}}$, indicating that $C_{t}$ now approximates a short circuit compared to $R_{1}$. Consequently, $V_{1} \\rightarrow 0$, and $|a|$ rolls off with frequency, as shown.\n- The borderline between the two limiting cases occurs when $\\omega=\\omega_{p}$. Rewriting Eq. (6.35b) as $1 /\\left(\\omega_{p} C_{t}\\right)=R_{1}$, we see that at this frequency we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left|Z_{t}\\left(\\omega_{p}\\right)\\right|=R_{1} \\tag{6.36}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWe now have a physical interpretation for $\\omega_{p}$ : this is the frequency at which the capacitance's impedance equals, in magnitude, the equivalent resistance seen by the capacitance itself. In the MOS case of Fig. 6.15 this resistance is simply $R_{s i g}$, but in the bipolar case of Fig. 6.14 it is $r_{\\pi} /\\left(R_{s i g}+r_{b}\\right)$. A circuit designer will always use physical insight to check the results of mathematical derivations as well as to develop a feel for the workings of the circuit at hand.\n\n- Because of the gain roll-off with frequency, an amplifier effectively acts as a lowpass filter, this being the reason why $\\omega_{p}$ is also variously known as corner frequency, cutoff frequency, or also break frequency.

Beyond this point, the gain decreases at a rate of -20 dB/decade, indicative of a first-order low-pass filter characteristic.\n\nThe initial gain is |a₀|, the break point (ωₚ) marks the cutoff frequency where the gain drops by 3 dB, and the slope after ωₚ is -20 dB/decade, characteristic of a single-pole roll-off.

It is instructive to rationalize this plot using physical insight. With reference to Fig. 6.19b, we observe that the frequency response is dictated by the ac voltage divider composed of $C_{t}$ and $R_{1}$, the equivalent resistance encountered by $C_{t}$ itself. The impedance presented by $C_{t}$ is $Z_{t}(j \\omega)=1 /\\left(j \\omega C_{t}\\right)$, and depending on how its magnitude $\\left|Z_{t}(j \\omega)\\right|=1 /\\left(\\omega C_{t}\\right)$ compares with $R_{1}$, we encounter three pivotal scenarios:\n\n- At low frequencies, $\\left|Z_{t}(\\omega)\\right| \\gg R_{1}$, suggesting that $C_{t}$ behaves akin to an open circuit relative to $R_{1}$. As a result, $V_{1} \\rightarrow V_{i}$, and thus $|a| \\rightarrow a_{0}$. This is the scenario we have dealt with prior to the current chapter.\n- At high frequencies, $\\left|Z_{t}(\\omega)\\right| \\ll R_{1}$, implying that $C_{t}$ now behaves like a short circuit in comparison to $R_{1}$. Consequently, $V_{1} \\rightarrow 0$, and $|a|$ diminishes with frequency, as depicted.\n- The boundary between the two extreme cases occurs when $\\omega=\\omega_{p}$. Rewriting Eq. (6.35b) as $1 /\\left(\\omega_{p} C_{t}\\right)=R_{1}$, we observe that at this frequency\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left|Z_{t}\\left(\\omega_{p}\\right)\\right|=R_{1} \\tag{6.36}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWe now have a physical interpretation for $\\omega_{p}$: this is the frequency at which the capacitance's impedance, in magnitude, equals the equivalent resistance faced by the capacitance itself. In the MOS case of Fig. 6.15, this resistance is simply $R_{s i g}$, but in the bipolar case of Fig. 6.14, it is $r_{\\pi} /\\left(R_{s i g}+r_{b}\\right)$. A circuit designer will consistently utilize physical insight to corroborate the outcomes of mathematical derivations as well as to foster an understanding of the circuit's operation at hand.\n\n- Due to the frequency-dependent gain reduction, an amplifier effectively acts as a lowpass filter, which is why $\\omega_{p}$ is also referred to as the corner frequency, cutoff frequency, or break frequency. At $\\omega=\\omega_{p}$, $\\left|V_{1}\\right|$ drops to $1 / \\sqrt{2}(=0.707$, or $-3-\\mathrm{dB})$ of its low-frequency value, hence $\\omega_{p}$ is also termed the $-3-d B$ frequency. Since the power of an ac signal is proportional to the square of its magnitude, another name for $\\omega_{p}$ is half-power frequency.

The input voltage source Vi is connected to a resistor R1 and capacitors C1 and CM. The output is measured across the resistor R2, which is connected to the voltage-controlled current source gmV1. In the simplified circuit (b), capacitor Ct is connected from V1 to ground.\n\nFIGURE 6.19 depicts the equivalent-circuit simplifications using the Miller approximation.\n\nThe Bode plot in FIGURE 6.20 represents the magnitude gain of a circuit as a function of frequency. The graph is plotted on a logarithmic scale, with the x-axis labeled as frequency (ω) in decades and the y-axis labeled as magnitude |a(jω)| in decibels (dB).\n\nThe plot starts with a flat region at low frequencies where the gain is constant at |a₀| dB. As frequency increases, the plot exhibits a break point at a specific frequency, labeled as ωₚ. Beyond this break point, the gain begins to decrease at a rate of -20 dB/decade, indicating a first-order low-pass filter behavior.\n\nThe initial gain is denoted as |a₀|. The break point (ωₚ) marks the cutoff frequency, where the gain drops by 3 dB from its initial value. After ωₚ, the slope of the plot is -20 dB/decade, characteristic of a single-pole roll-off.\n\nThe Bode plot in Fig. 6.20 (see also Bode plots in Appendix 6A) provides a visual representation of the frequency response. By analyzing the circuit in Fig. 6.19b, we observe that the frequency response is governed by the ac voltage divider formed by $C_{t}$ with $R_{1}$, the equivalent resistance seen by $C_{t}$ itself. The impedance presented by $C_{t}$ is $Z_{t}(j \\omega)=1 /\\left(j \\omega C_{t}\\right)$, and depending on how its magnitude $\\left|Z_{t}(j \\omega)\\right|=1 /\\left(\\omega C_{t}\\right)$ compares with $R_{1}$, we have three significant cases:\n\n- At low frequencies, $\\left|Z_{t}(\\omega)\\right| \\gg R_{1}$, indicating that $C_{t}$ approximates an open circuit compared to $R_{1}$. Consequently, $V_{1} \\rightarrow V_{i}$, and thus $|a| \\rightarrow a_{0}$. This is the situation we have been dealing with before embarking upon the present chapter.\n- At high frequencies, $\\left|Z_{t}(\\omega)\\right| \\ll R_{1}$, indicating that $C_{t}$ now approximates a short circuit compared to $R_{1}$. Consequently, $V_{1} \\rightarrow 0$, and $|a|$ rolls off with frequency, as shown.\n- The borderline between the two limiting cases occurs when $\\omega=\\omega_{p}$. Rewriting Eq. (6.35b) as $1 /\\left(\\omega_{p} C_{t}\\right)=R_{1}$, we see that at this frequency we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left|Z_{t}\\left(\\omega_{p}\\right)\\right|=R_{1} \\tag{6.36}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWe now have a physical interpretation for $\\omega_{p}$: this is the frequency at which the capacitance's impedance equals, in magnitude, the equivalent resistance seen by the capacitance itself. In the MOS case of Fig. 6.15 this resistance is simply $R_{sig}$, but in the bipolar case of Fig. 6.14 it is $r_{\\pi} /\\left(R_{sig}+r_{b}\\right)$. A circuit designer will always use physical insight to check the results of mathematical derivations as well as to develop a feel for the workings of the circuit at hand.\n\nBecause of the gain roll-off with frequency, an amplifier effectively acts as a lowpass filter. This is why $\\omega_{p}$ is also known as the corner frequency, cutoff frequency, or break frequency. At $\\omega=\\omega_{p}$, $\\left|V_{1}\\right|$ is reduced to $1 / \\sqrt{2}(=0.707$, or $-3-\\mathrm{dB})$ of its low-frequency value, so $\\omega_{p}$ is also called the $-3-dB$ frequency. Since the power of an ac signal is proportional to the square of its magnitude, another name for $\\omega_{p}$ is half-power frequency. The gain-bandwidth product is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{GBP}=\\left|a_{0}\\right| \\times f_{p} \\tag{6.37}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWe are now ready to apply our results to the specific circuits of Figs. 6.14 and 6.15.

    "text": "To evaluate the precision of the Miller approximation and gain deeper insights into the circuit's behavior, let's conduct an exact analysis of the small-signal circuit depicted in Fig. 6.16. While doing so, we'll also generalize the analysis by incorporating the output node capacitance $C_{2}$, as shown in Fig. 6.21. It is known that the collector of a monolithic BJT exhibits a collector-to-substrate capacitance $C_{s}$, and the drain of a FET exhibits a drain-to-body capacitance $C_{d b}$. Furthermore, in practical applications, the output node is often loaded by an external capacitance $C_{L}$. Therefore, generally, $C_{2}=C_{s}+C_{L}$ for BJTs and $C_{2}=C_{d b}+C_{L}$ for FETs.\n\nApplying Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at the node to the left of $C_{f}$ yields\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{i}-V_{1}}{R_{1}}=\\frac{V_{1}}{1 /\\left(s C_{1}\\right)}+\\frac{V_{1}-V_{o}}{1 /\\left(s C_{f}\\right)}\n$$\n\nimage_name:FIGURE 6.21\ndescription:\n[\nname: Vi, type: VoltageSource, value: Vi, ports: {Np: Vi, Nn: GND}\nname: R1, type: Resistor, value: R1, ports: {N1: Vi, N2: V1}\nname: C1, type: Capacitor, value: C1, ports: {Np: V1, Nn: GND}\nname: Cf, type: Capacitor, value: Cf, ports: {Np: V1, Nn: Vo}\nname: gmV1, type: VoltageControlledCurrentSource, value: gmV1, ports: {Np: Vo, Nn: GND}\nname: R2, type: Resistor, value: R2, ports: {N1: Vo, N2: GND}\nname: C2, type: Capacitor, value: C2, ports: {Np: Vo, Nn: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit is an AC small-signal model for analyzing common-emitter/common-source amplifiers with feedback capacitance Cf.

Denoting the corresponding pole frequencies as $\\omega_{1}$ and $\\omega_{2}$, we express the gain more succinctly in the standard form of Eq. (6A.1) in the Appendix,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\na(s)=a_{0} \\frac{1-s / \\omega_{0}}{\\left(1+s / \\omega_{1}\\right)\\left(1+s / \\omega_{2}\\right)} \\tag{6.41}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\na_{0}=-g_{m} R_{2} \\tag{6.42}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nis the well-known low-frequency gain, and\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\omega_{0}=\\frac{g_{m}}{C_{f}} \\tag{6.43}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nis the zero frequency of $a(s)$. Physically, at this frequency, the current fed forward through $C_{f}$ equals the current drawn by the dependent source, resulting in zero net current through the parallel combination of $R_{2}$ and $C_{2}$. Consequently, $V_{o}$ drops to zero, implying a gain of zero at this frequency. As a physical check, when $V_{o}=0$, we have $I_{f}=\\left(V_{\\pi}-0\\right) /\\left(1 / s C_{f}\\right)=s C_{f} V_{\\pi}$, so imposing $s C_{f} V_{\\pi}=g_{m} V_{\\pi}$ yields $s=g_{m} / C_{f}$. In the $s$ plane, this zero is located on the positive real axis. Note that for $\\omega>\\omega_{0}$, the current through $C_{f}$ exceeds that of the dependent source, indicating a reversal of gain polarity. This provides a physical justification for the negative sign in the numerator of Eq. (6.41); combined with the negative sign of Eq. (6.42), it causes the gain to become positive for $\\omega>\\omega_{0}$. By Eqs. (6.12) and (6.24), $\\omega_{0} \\gg \\omega_{T}$.\n\nWe now aim to derive expressions for the pole frequencies $\\omega_{1}$ and $\\omega_{2}$. Based on the Miller approximation, we expect $\\omega_{1}$ to be close to $\\omega_{p}$, and $\\omega_{2}$ to be much higher than $\\omega_{p}$. Therefore, expanding the denominator of Eq.

    "text": "To evaluate the precision of the Miller approximation and gain deeper insights into circuit behavior, let's conduct an exact analysis of the small-signal circuit depicted in Fig. 6.16. While doing so, we'll also generalize by incorporating the output node capacitance $C_{2}$, as illustrated in Fig. 6.21. It's known that the collector of a monolithic BJT exhibits a collector-to-substrate capacitance $C_{s}$, and the drain of a FET exhibits a drain-to-body capacitance $C_{d b}$. Furthermore, in practical applications, the output node is often loaded by an external capacitance $C_{L}$. Therefore, generally, $C_{2}=C_{s}+C_{L}$ for BJTs and $C_{2}=C_{d b}+C_{L}$ for FETs.\n\nApplying KCL at the node to the left of $C_{f}$ yields\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{i}-V_{1}}{R_{1}}=\\frac{V_{1}}{1 /\\left(s C_{1}\\right)}+\\frac{V_{1}-V_{o}}{1 /\\left(s C_{f}\\right)}\n$$\n\nimage_name:FIGURE 6.21\ndescription:\n[\nname: Vi, type: VoltageSource, value: Vi, ports: {Np: Vi, Nn: GND}\nname: R1, type: Resistor, value: R1, ports: {N1: Vi, N2: V1}\nname: C1, type: Capacitor, value: C1, ports: {Np: V1, Nn: GND}\nname: Cf, type: Capacitor, value: Cf, ports: {Np: V1, Nn: Vo}\nname: gmV1, type: VoltageControlledCurrentSource, value: gmV1, ports: {Np: Vo, Nn: GND}\nname: R2, type: Resistor, value: R2, ports: {N1: Vo, N2: GND}\nname: C2, type: Capacitor, value: C2, ports: {Np: Vo, Nn: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit is an AC small-signal model for analyzing common-emitter/common-source amplifiers with feedback capacitance Cf. It includes input voltage Vi, resistors R1 and R2, capacitors C1, Cf, and C2, and a voltage-controlled current source gmV1.\n\nFIGURE 6.21 Ac circuit for a more accurate analysis of the CE/CS amplifiers.\n\nSimilarly, KCL at the node to the right of $C_{f}$ results in\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{1}-V_{o}}{1 / s C_{f}}=g_{m} V_{1}+\\frac{V_{o}}{R_{2}}+\\frac{V_{o}}{1 / s C_{2}}\n$$\n\nBy eliminating $V_{1}$ and solving for the ratio $V_{o} / V_{i}$, we obtain, after some algebraic manipulation,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\na(s) & =\\frac{V_{o}}{V_{i}} \\\\\n& =\\frac{\\left(-g_{m} R_{2}\\right) \\times\\left(1-s C_{f} / g_{m}\\right)}{1+s\\left\\{R_{1}\\left[C_{1}+C_{f}\\left(1+g_{m} R_{2}\\right)\\right]+R_{2}\\left(C_{f}+C_{2}\\right)\\right\\}+s^{2} R_{1} R_{2}\\left(C_{1} C_{f}+C_{1} C_{2}+C_{f} C_{2}\\right)} \\tag{6.40}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe denominator is a quadratic polynomial in $s$, so $a(s)$ has two poles. Denoting the corresponding pole frequencies as $\\omega_{1}$ and $\\omega_{2}$, we express the gain more succinctly in the standard form of Eq. (6A.1) in the Appendix,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\na(s)=a_{0} \\frac{1-s / \\omega_{0}}{\\left(1+s / \\omega_{1}\\right)\\left(1+s / \\omega_{2}\\right)} \\tag{6.41}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\na_{0}=-g_{m} R_{2} \\tag{6.42}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nis the well-known low-frequency gain, and\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\omega_{0}=\\frac{g_{m}}{C_{f}} \\tag{6.43}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nis the zero frequency of $a(s)$. Physically, at this frequency, the current fed forward via $C_{f}$ equals the current drawn by the dependent source, resulting in zero net current through the parallel combination of $R_{2}$ and $C_{2}$. Consequently, $V_{o}$ drops to zero, implying a gain of zero at this frequency. As a physical check, when $V_{o}=0$, we have $I_{f}=\\left(V_{\\pi}-0\\right) /\\left(1 / s C_{f}\\right)=s C_{f} V_{\\pi}$, so imposing $s C_{f} V_{\\pi}=g_{m} V_{\\pi}$ yields $s=g_{m} / C_{f}$. In the $s$ plane, this zero lies on the positive real axis. Note that for $\\omega>\\omega_{0}$, the current through $C_{f}$ exceeds that of the dependent source, indicating gain-polarity reversal. This provides a physical justification for the negative sign in the numerator of Eq. (6.41); combined with the negative sign of Eq. (6.42), it causes the gain to become positive for $\\omega>\\omega_{0}$. By Eqs. (6.12) and (6.24), $\\omega_{0} \\gg \\omega_{T}$.\n\nWe now aim to derive expressions for the pole frequencies $\\omega_{1}$ and $\\omega_{2}$. Based on the Miller approximation, we expect $\\omega_{1}$ to be close to $\\omega_{p}$, and $\\omega_{2}$ to be much higher than $\\omega_{p}$. Thus, expanding the denominator of Eq. (6.41) and anticipating $\\omega_{2} \\gg \\omega_{1}$, we write\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\na(s)=a_{0} \\frac{1-s / \\omega_{0}}{1+s\\left(1 / \\omega_{1}+1 / \\omega_{2}\\right)+s^{2} /\\left(\\omega_{1} \\omega_{2}\\right)} \\cong a_{0} \\frac{1-s / \\omega_{0}}{1+s / \\omega_{1}+s^{2} /\\left(\\omega_{1} \\omega_{2}\\right)} \\tag{6.44}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquating the coefficients of $s$ in the denominators of Eqs.

However, $R_{2} / R_{1} \\ll g_{m} R_{2}$, so $\\omega_{1} \\cong \\omega_{p}$, confirming the excellent accuracy of the Miller approximation, especially considering its quicker derivation. Similarly, equating the coefficients of $s^{2}$ in the denominators of Eqs.

(Physical intuition, rather than formulas, predominantly guides IC designers in their routine tasks.)\n\nAs is well understood, the function of a differential amplifier is to amplify the voltage disparity between two signals, disregarding their common-mode component. The common-mode rejection ratio\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{CMRR}=\\left|\\frac{a_{d m}(j f)}{a_{c m}(j f)}\\right| \\tag{6.47}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nserves as a key performance metric for the differential amplifier, ideally aiming to be as large as possible (preferably infinite). In practical scenarios, we observe that the CMRR, despite being initially high, diminishes with increasing frequency, primarily because both the differential-mode gain $a_{d m}(j f)$ and the common-mode gain $a_{c m}(j f)$ also degrade with frequency."

At sufficiently low frequencies $C_{E E} / 2$ acts as an open circuit compared to $2 R_{E E}$, so $a_{c m}(\\mathrm{ff})$ starts out low and CMRR starts out high. As the operating frequency is increased, the impedance provided by $C_{E E} / 2$ decreases, causing $Z_{E E}$ to decrease as well. This, in turn, causes $a_{c m}(j f)$ to increase and CMRR to decrease with frequency. Clearly, $a_{c m}(j f)$ exhibits a zero frequency $f_{z(\\mathrm{~cm})}$. This is the frequency at which the impedance provided by $C_{E E} / 2$ equals, in magnitude, $2 R_{E E}$. This condition yields the familiar result $f_{z(\\mathrm{~cm})}=$ $1 /\\left[2 \\pi\\left(2 R_{E E}\\right)\\left(C_{E E} / 2\\right)\\right]$, or\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nf_{z(c m)}=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi R_{E E} C_{E E}} \\tag{6.49}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince $R_{E E}$ is usually quite high, $f_{z(\\mathrm{~cm})}$ is usually lower than $f_{p(\\mathrm{dm})}$. We can thus state the following:\n\n- The CMRR starts out high for $f \\ll f_{z(\\mathrm{~cm})}$.\n- At $f=f_{z(\\mathrm{~mm})}$ the CMRR begins to roll off with frequency. Clearly, the zero frequency of $a_{c m}$ is a pole frequency for CMRR.\n- For $f_{z(\\mathrm{~cm})}<f<f_{p(\\mathrm{dm})}$ the CMRR rolls off with $f$ at a rate of $-20 \\mathrm{db} / \\mathrm{dec}$.\n- At $f=f_{p(\\mathrm{dm})}$ the CMRR picks up an additional roll-off rate of $-20-\\mathrm{dB} / \\mathrm{dec}$. Clearly, the first pole frequency of $a_{d m}$ is a second pole frequency for CMRR.\n- For $f>f_{p(\\mathrm{dm})}$ the CMRR rolls off with $f$ at a rate of $-40 \\mathrm{db} / \\mathrm{dec}$.\n- This roll-off with $f$ continues until higher-order poles and zeros come into play, by which point the CMRR has already deteriorated to fairly low values.\n(a) Let the EC pair of Fig. $6.24 a$ use BJTs having $\\beta_{0}=200, V_{A}=50 \\mathrm{~V}, r_{b}=$ $200 \\Omega, C_{\\pi}=25 \\mathrm{pF}, C_{\\mu}=0.3 \\mathrm{pF}$, and $C_{s}=1 \\mathrm{pF}$.

This is achieved using the differential-mode and common-mode half circuits. Although the analysis is conducted for the EC pair, the results are easily applied to the SC pair. To calculate $a_{d m}(j f)$, the half-circuit equivalent of Fig. 6.25 is utilized.

    "text": "Figure 6.24 depicts the fundamental emitter-coupled (EC) and source-coupled (SC) pairs. Recollect from Chapter 4 that the parameter $a_{c m}$ varies inversely with the equivalent resistance $R_{E E}$ (or $R_{S S}$) presented by the external biasing circuit to the pair. Consequently, to enhance the CMRR, designers aim to increase $R_{E E}$ (or $R_{S S}$). For this purpose, the current-sinking transistor $Q_{3}$ (or $M_{3}$), whose biasing specifics have been omitted for clarity, is likely part of a high-output-resistance topology such as the Wilson or cascode types. Generally, the impedance $Z_{E E}$ (or $Z_{S S}$) presented to the EC (or SC) pair comprises a resistive part $R_{E E}$ (or $R_{S S}$) in parallel with a capacitive part $C_{E E}$ (or $C_{S S}$). As we are about to observe, it is the capacitive part that leads to the degradation of $a_{c m}(j f)$, and thus CMRR, with increasing frequency.\n\nTo examine the CMMR, we must first determine the differential-mode and common-mode gains $a_{d m}(j f)$ and $a_{c m}(j f)$.

Referring back to Chapter 4, the parameter $a_{c m}$ is inversely proportional to the equivalent resistance $R_{E E}$ (or $R_{S S}$) presented by the external biasing circuit to the pair. Therefore, to enhance the CMRR, designers aim to maximize $R_{E E}$ (or $R_{S S}$). For this reason, the current-sinking transistor $Q_{3}$ (or $M_{3}$), whose biasing details have been omitted for clarity\nsimplicity, is likely part of a high-output-resistance topology such as the Wilson or cascode types. Generally, the impedance $Z_{E E}$ (or $Z_{S S}$) presented to the EC (or SC) pair consists of a resistive part $R_{E E}$ (or $R_{S S}$) in parallel with a capacitive part $C_{E E}$ (or $C_{S S}$). As we will soon observe, it is the capacitive part that leads to the degradation of $a_{c m}(j f)$, and consequently\nthus CMRR, with increasing frequency.\n\nTo examine the CMMR, we must first determine the differential-mode and common-mode gains $a_{d m}(j f)$ and $a_{c m}(j f)$. We will do this using the differential-mode and common-mode half circuits. Although the analysis will be conducted for the EC pair, the results can be adapted adapted to the SC pair. To find $a_{d m}(j f)$ we use the half-circuit equivalent of Fig. 6.25. This is the familiar CE configuration, whose gain contains a dominant pole due primarily to the Miller capacitance. Adapting Eq. (6.45),\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nf_{p(\\mathrm{dm})} \\cong \\frac{1 / 2 \\pi}{\\left[\\left(R_{B}+r_{b}\\right) / / r_{\\pi}\\right] \\times\\left\\{C_{\\pi}+C_{\\mu}\\left[1+g_{m}\\left(R_{C} / / r_{o}\\right)\\right]\\right\\}+\\left(R_{C} / / r_{o}\\right) \\times C_{s}} \\tag{6.48}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nTo find $a_{c m}(j f)$ we use the half-circuit equivalent of Fig. 6.26. Note that as we split the impedance $Z_{E E}$ into two identical parts, $R_{E E}$ must be doubled to give $\\left(2 R_{E E}\\right) / /\\left(2 R_{E E}\\right)=$ $R_{E E}$, whereas $C_{E E}$ must be halved to give $\\left(C_{E E} / 2\\right) / /\\left(C_{E E} / 2\\right)=C_{E E} / 2+C_{E E} / 2=C_{E E}$.\n\nThe circuit of Fig. 6.26 is the familiar CE-ED configuration, but with degeneration now provided by the impedance $2 Z_{E E}=\\left(2 R_{E E}\\right) / /\\left[1 / s\\left(C_{E E} / 2\\right)\\right]$. At sufficiently low frequencies $C_{E E} / 2$ acts as an open circuit compared to $2 R_{E E}$, so $a_{c m}(\\mathrm{ff})$ starts out low and CMRR starts out high. As the operating frequency is increased, the impedance provided by $C_{E E} / 2$ decreases, causing $Z_{E E}$ to decrease as well. This, in turn, causes $a_{c m}(j f)$ to increase and CMRR to decrease with frequency. Clearly, $a_{c m}(j f)$ exhibits a zero frequency $f_{z(\\mathrm{~cm})}$. This is the frequency at which the impedance provided by $C_{E E} / 2$ equals, in magnitude, $2 R_{E E}$. This condition yields the familiar result $f_{z(\\mathrm{~cm})}=$ $1 /\\left[2 \\pi\\left(2 R_{E E}\\right)\\left(C_{E E} / 2\\right)\\right]$, or\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nf_{z(c m)}=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi R_{E E} C_{E E}} \\tag{6.49}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince $R_{E E}$ is usually quite high, $f_{z(\\mathrm{~cm})}$ is usually lower than $f_{p(\\mathrm{dm})}$. We can thus state the following:\n\n- The CMRR starts out high for $f \\ll f_{z(\\mathrm{~cm})}$.\n- At $f=f_{z(\\mathrm{~mm})}$ the CMRR begins to roll off with frequency. Clearly, the zero frequency of $a_{c m}$ is a pole frequency for CMRR.\n- For $f_{z(\\mathrm{~cm})}<f<f_{p(\\mathrm{dm})}$ the CMRR rolls off with $f$ at a rate of $-20 \\mathrm{db} / \\mathrm{dec}$.\n- At $f=f_{p(\\mathrm{dm})}$ the CMRR picks up an additional roll-off rate of $-20-\\mathrm{dB} / \\mathrm{dec}$. Clearly, the first pole frequency of $a_{d m}$ is a second pole frequency for CMRR.\n- For $f>f_{p(\\mathrm{dm})}$ the CMRR rolls off with $f$ at a rate of $-40 \\mathrm{db} / \\mathrm{dec}$.\n- This roll-off with $f$ continues until higher-order poles and zeros come into play, by which point the CMRR has already deteriorated to fairly low values.\n\n(a) Let the EC pair of Fig. $6.24 a$ use BJTs having $\\beta_{0}=200, V_{A}=50 \\mathrm{~V}, r_{b}=$ $200 \\Omega, C_{\\pi}=25 \\mathrm{pF}, C_{\\mu}=0.3 \\mathrm{pF}$, and $C_{s}=1 \\mathrm{pF}$. Moreover, let $R_{B}=2 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$ and $R_{C}=10 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$, and let the emitter-biasing current sink have $I_{E E}=1 \\mathrm{~mA}, R_{E E}=$ $1 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega$, and $C_{E E}=1.5 \\mathrm{pF}$. Estimate the low-frequency value of the CMRR as well as its two principal poles.\n\n(b) Use PSpice to display the Bode plots of $\\left|a_{d m}\\right|,\\left|a_{c m}\\right|$, and $\\left|a_{d m} / a_{c m}\\right|$, and comment.\n\n#### Solution\n\n(a) We have $g_{m}=(200 / 201) \\times(0.5) / 26=19.1 \\mathrm{~mA} / \\mathrm{V}, r_{\\pi}=10.5 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega, r_{o}=$ $100 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega, 2 R_{E E}=2 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega$, and $C_{E E} / 2=0.75 \\mathrm{pF}$. Also, $\\left(R_{B}+r_{b}\\right) / / r_{\\pi}=1.82 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$ and $R_{C} / / r_{o}=9.09 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$. Then, Eqs. (6.48) and (6.49) give\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{p(\\mathrm{dm})} & \\cong \\frac{1}{2 \\pi 1.82 \\times 10^{3}[25+0.3 \\times(1+19.1 \\times 9.09)+(9.09 / 1.82) \\times 1] 10^{-12}} \\\\\n& =1.06 \\mathrm{MHz}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nf_{z(\\mathrm{~cm})} \\cong \\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\times 1 \\times 10^{6} \\times 1.5 \\times 10^{-12}}=106 \\mathrm{kHz}\n$$\n\nAt low frequencies, $\\mathrm{CMRR}=\\left|a_{d m 0} / a_{c m 0}\\right| \\cong\\left|-g_{m}\\left(R_{C} / / r_{o}\\right) /\\left(-R_{C} / 2 R_{E E}\\right)\\right|=$ $174 / 0.005=34,800=90.8 \\mathrm{~dB}$.\n\n(b) To generate the Bode plot of $\\left|a_{d m}\\right|$ we reuse the PSpice circuit of Fig. 6.22, but with the present parameter values.
