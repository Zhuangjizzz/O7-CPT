This is due to the inductor's property of storing energy in its magnetic field, which interacts with the changing current. The term 'resistance-like' helps to conceptualize the opposition to current flow but highlights the key difference that reactance is not constant and increases with frequency."

This variation allows the circuit to act as different types of filters. For example, if \\( \\mathbf{Z}_1 \\) is capacitive and \\( \\mathbf{Z}_2 \\) is resistive, the circuit behaves as a high-pass filter, allowing high frequencies to pass while attenuating low frequencies. Conversely, if \\( \\mathbf{Z}_1 \\) is resistive and \\( \\mathbf{Z}_2 \\) is capacitive, it acts as a low-pass filter. The specific frequency response depends on the values and types of the impedances used."

It visually depicts the relationship between the resistive and reactive components of the circuit. The diagram consists of a horizontal line labeled with vectors representing resistive elements.

            "value": "Avalanche breakdown occurs when the reverse voltage across a diode increases to a point where the electric field in the depletion region becomes strong enough to accelerate free electrons to high energies. These high-energy electrons collide with lattice atoms, knocking off more electrons and creating an avalanche effect. This rapid increase in free electrons results in a sudden surge of current, which can damage the diode if not limited by external circuitry."
