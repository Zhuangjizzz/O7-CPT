    "text": "In electronic circuits, we monitor two key quantities: voltage and current. These typically vary over time; otherwise, no significant activity occurs.\n\nVoltage (denoted as $V$ or sometimes $E$). Officially, the voltage between two points is the energy cost (work required) to move a unit of positive charge from the more negative (lower potential) to the more positive (higher potential) point. Alternatively, it represents the energy released when a unit charge moves from a higher to a lower potential. ${ }^{2}$ Voltage is also known as potential difference or electromotive force (EMF). The unit of measurement is the volt, with voltages commonly expressed in volts $(\\mathrm{V})$, kilovolts $\\left(1 \\mathrm{kV}=10^{3} \\mathrm{~V}\\right)$, millivolts $\\left(1 \\mathrm{mV}=10^{-3} \\mathrm{~V}\\right)$, or microvolts $\\left(1 \\mu \\mathrm{~V}=10^{-6} \\mathrm{~V}\\right)$ (refer to the box on prefixes). One joule (J) of work is performed when moving one coulomb (C) of charge through a potential difference of 1 V. (The coulomb is the unit of electric charge, equivalent to the charge of approximately $6 \\times 10^{18}$ electrons.) For reasons that will become evident later, discussions involving nanovolts $\\left(1 \\mathrm{nV}=10^{-9} \\mathrm{~V}\\right)$ and megavolts $\\left(1 \\mathrm{MV}=10^{6} \\mathrm{~V}\\right)$ are infrequent.\n\nCurrent (symbol $I$). Current is the rate at which electric charge flows past a point. The unit of measurement is the ampere, or amp, with currents typically expressed in amperes $(\\mathrm{A})$, milliamperes $\\left(1 \\mathrm{~mA}=10^{-3} \\mathrm{~A}\\right)$, microamperes $\\left(1 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}=10^{-6} \\mathrm{~A}\\right)$, nanoamperes $\\left(1 \\mathrm{nA}=10^{-9} \\mathrm{~A}\\right)$, or occasionally picoamperes $\\left(1 \\mathrm{pA}=10^{-12} \\mathrm{~A}\\right)$. A current of 1 amp corresponds to a flow of 1 coulomb of charge per second. By convention, current in a circuit is considered to flow from a more positive to a more negative point, despite the actual electron flow being in the opposite direction.\n\nImportant: from these definitions, it's clear that currents flow through components, while voltages are applied (or appear) across them. Proper terminology is crucial: always refer to the voltage between or across two points in a circuit, and always refer to current through a device or connection in a circuit.\n\nPhrases like \"the voltage through a resistor\" are nonsensical. However, we often speak of the voltage at a point in a circuit, which is understood to mean the voltage between that point and \"ground,\" a universally recognized point in the circuit. Soon, you will become familiar with this concept.\n\nVoltages are generated by doing work on charges in devices such as batteries (converting electrochemical energy), generators (converting mechanical energy via magnetic forces), solar cells (photovoltaic conversion of photon energy), etc. Currents are produced by applying voltages across components.\n\nYou might wonder how to observe voltages and currents. The oscilloscope is the most useful electronic instrument for this purpose, allowing you to visualize voltages (or occasionally currents) in a circuit over time. ${ }^{3}$ We will discuss oscilloscopes and voltmeters when we cover signals shortly; for a preview, see Appendix O and the multimeter section later in this chapter.\n\n[^2]In real circuits, components are connected with wires (metallic conductors), which maintain the same voltage throughout (relative to ground). ${ }^{4}$ This is mentioned now so you understand that an actual circuit's layout can differ from its schematic diagram due to wire rearrangements.\n\nHere are some basic rules about voltage and current:\n\n1. The sum of the currents entering a point in a circuit equals the sum of the currents exiting it (conservation of charge). This is known as Kirchhoff's current law (KCL). Engineers often call such a point a node. Consequently, in a series circuit (where components are connected end-to-end), the current remains constant throughout.\nimage_name:Figure 1.1\ndescription:The circuit comprises two devices connected in parallel between nodes A and B.\n\nFigure 1.1. Parallel connection.\n2. Components connected in parallel (Figure 1.1) exhibit the same voltage across them. Alternatively, the sum of the \"voltage drops\" from $A$ to $B$ via one path in a circuit equals the sum via any other path, which is simply the voltage between $A$ and $B$. Another way to express this is that the sum of the voltage drops around any closed circuit is zero, known as Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL).\n3. The power (energy per unit time) consumed by a circuit device is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nP=V I \\tag{1.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis is essentially (energy/charge) $\\times$ (charge/time). For $V$ in volts and $I$ in amps, $P$ is measured in watts. A watt equals a joule per second ( $1 \\mathrm{~W}=1 \\mathrm{~J} / \\mathrm{s}$ ). For instance, the current through a 60 W lightbulb operating on 120 V is 0.5 A.\n\nPower typically converts to heat, but can also result in mechanical work (motors), radiated energy (lamps, transmitters), or stored energy (batteries, capacitors, inductors). Managing heat in complex systems (e.g., large computers converting many kilowatts of electrical energy to heat, with the minor byproduct of computational results) is a critical aspect of system design.\n\n[^3]image_name:Figure 1.2\ndescription:Figure 1.2 displays various common resistor types arranged in three rows.\n\n1. **Identification of Components and Structure:**\n- **Top Row:** This row includes wirewound ceramic power resistors. From left to right: a 20W vitreous enamel resistor with leads, a 20W resistor with mounting studs, a 30W vitreous enamel resistor, and two resistors (5W and 20W) with mounting studs. These are used in high-power dissipation applications.\n\n- **Middle Row:** This row features wirewound power resistors in different configurations, including 1W, 3W, and 5W axial ceramic resistors, followed by conduction-cooled resistors (often called \"Dale-type\") with power ratings of 5W, 10W, 25W, and 50W. These resistors are known for their robust construction and high power-handling capability.\n\n- **Bottom Row:** This row consists of smaller resistors with lower power ratings, such as 2W, 1W, 1/2W, 1/4W, and 1/8W resistors, used in circuits requiring less power dissipation.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- Each resistor is a standalone component with two leads for electrical connections, enabling integration into circuits for current flow and resistance.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- Resistors are marked with power ratings and manufacturer names, like \"Ohmite\" and \"Dale,\" which are essential for identifying their specifications and suitable applications.\n- A scale indicating 1 cm is located at the bottom right of the image, providing a size reference for the components.\n\nOverall, the image serves as a visual guide to different resistor types, highlighting their physical attributes and typical power ratings.\n\nFigure 1.2. A selection of common resistor types. Top row (wirewound ceramic power resistors): 20W vitreous enamel with leads, 20W with mounting studs, 30W vitreous enamel, 5W and 20W with mounting studs. Middle row (wirewound power resistors): 1W, 3W, and 5W axial ceramic; $5 \\mathrm{~W}, 10 \\mathrm{~W}, 25 \\mathrm{~W}$, and 50W conduction-cooled (\"Dale-type\"). Bottom row: $2 \\mathrm{~W}, 1 \\mathrm{~W}, \\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{~W}, \\frac{1}{4} \\mathrm{~W}$, and $\\frac{1}{8} \\mathrm{~W}$ carbon composition; surface-mount thick-film (2010, 1206, 0805, 0603, and 0402 sizes); surface-mount resistor array; 6-, 8-, and 10-pin single in-line package arrays; dual in-line package array. The resistor at the bottom is the common RN55D $\\frac{1}{4} \\mathrm{~W}, 1 \\%$ metal-film type; and the pair above are Victoreen high-resistance types (glass, $2 \\mathrm{G} \\Omega$; ceramic, $5 \\mathrm{G} \\Omega$ ).\n\nLater, when we address periodically varying voltages and currents, we will need to generalize the simple equation $P=V I$ to account for average power, but it remains accurate for instantaneous power.\n\nBy the way, avoid calling current \"amperage\"; that's amateurish. ${ }^{5}$ The same caution applies to the term \"ohmage\" ${ }^{6}$ when we discuss resistance in the next section."

    "text": "This story is both lengthy and captivating, detailing the core of electronic devices. The essence is to create and utilize gadgets with intriguing and practical current-voltage ($I$-versus-$V$) characteristics. Examples include resistors (current directly proportional to voltage), capacitors (current proportional to voltage's rate of change), diodes (current flows in one direction), thermistors (resistance dependent on temperature), photoresistors (resistance dependent on light), strain gauges (resistance dependent on strain), and more. Particularly fascinating are three-terminal devices, like transistors, where the current between two terminals is governed by the voltage at a third terminal. We will progressively delve into some of these complex devices; initially, we will focus on the most ordinary (and widely used) circuit component, the resistor (Figure 1.3).\nFigure 1.3 illustrates a simple resistor with two nodes connected.\n\n#### A. Resistance and resistors\n\nAn intriguing fact is that the current through a metallic conductor (or other semi-conducting material) is directly proportional to the voltage across it. (In the case of wire conductors in circuits, we usually select a sufficiently thick gauge of wire so that these \"voltage drops\" will be negligible.) This is by no means a universal law for all objects. For instance, the current through a neon bulb is a highly nonlinear function of the applied voltage (it is zero up to a critical voltage, at which point it rises dramatically). The same applies to a variety of interesting special devices - diodes, transistors, light bulbs, etc. (If you are interested in understanding why metallic conductors behave this way, read Sections 4.4-4.5 in Purcell and Morin's excellent text Electricity and Magnetism).\n\nA resistor is made from some conducting material (carbon, or a thin metal or carbon film, or wire of poor conductivity), with a wire or contacts at each end. It is defined by its resistance:\n\n$$\nR=V / I\n$$\n\n$R$ is in ohms for $V$ in volts and $I$ in amps. This is known as Ohm's law. Typical resistors of the most frequently used type (metal-oxide film, metal film, or carbon film) come in values from 1 ohm ($1 \\Omega$) to about 10 megohms (10M $\\Omega$). Resistors are also defined by how much power they can safely dissipate (the most commonly used ones are rated at $1 / 4$ or $1 / 8 \\mathrm{~W}$), their physical size, and by other parameters such as tolerance (accuracy), temperature coefficient, noise, voltage coefficient (the extent to which $R$ depends on applied $V$), stability with time, inductance, etc. See the box on resistors, Chapter $1 x$, and Appendix C for further details. Figure 1.2 shows a collection of resistors, with most of the available forms represented.\n\nIn essence, resistors are used to convert a voltage to a current, and vice versa. This may sound overly simplistic, but you will soon understand its significance.\n\n#### B. Resistors in series and parallel\n\nFrom the definition of $R$, some simple results follow:\n\n1. The resistance of two resistors in series (Figure 1.4) is\n\n$$\nR=R_{1}+R_{2}\n$$\n\nBy putting resistors in series, you always get a larger resistor.\n2. The resistance of two resistors in parallel (Figure 1.5) is\n\n$$\nR=\\frac{R_{1} R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} \\quad \\text { or } \\quad R=\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\\frac{1}{R_{2}}}\n$$\n\nBy putting resistors in parallel, you always get a smaller resistor. Resistance is measured in ohms $(\\Omega)$, but in practice we frequently omit the $\\Omega$ symbol when referring to resistors that are more than $1000 \\Omega(1 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega)$. Thus, a $4.7 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$ resistor is often referred to as a 4.7 k resistor, and a $1 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega$ resistor as a 1 M resistor (or 1 meg). If these preliminaries bore you, please have patience - we'll soon get to numerous interesting applications.\nExercise 1.1. You have a 5 k resistor and a 10 k resistor. What is their combined resistance (a) in series and (b) in parallel?\nExercise 1.2. If you place a 1 ohm resistor across a 12 volt car battery, how much power will it dissipate?\n\nExercise 1.3. Prove the formulas for series and parallel resistors.\n\nExercise 1.4. Show that several resistors in parallel have resistance\n\n$$\nR=\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\\frac{1}{R_{2}}+\\frac{1}{R_{3}}+\\cdots}\n$$\n\nBeginners tend to get carried away with complicated algebra in designing or trying to understand electronics. Now is the time to begin learning intuition and shortcuts. Here are a couple of good tricks:\n\nShortcut \\#1 A large resistor in series (parallel) with a small resistor has the resistance of the larger (smaller) one, roughly. So you can \"trim\" the value of a resistor up or down by connecting a second resistor in series or parallel: to trim up, choose an available resistor value below the target value, then add a (much smaller) series resistor to make up the difference; to trim down, choose an available resistor value above the target value, then connect a (much larger) resistor in parallel. For the latter you can approximate with proportions - to lower the value of a resistor by $1 \\%$, say, put a resistor 100 times as large in parallel.\nShortcut \\#2 Suppose you want the resistance of 5k in parallel with 10 k. If you think of the 5 k as two 10 k's in parallel, then the whole circuit is like three 10k's in parallel. Because the resistance of $n$ equal resistors in parallel is $1 / n$th the resistance of the individual resistors, the answer in this case is $10 \\mathrm{k} / 3$, or 3.33 k. This trick is handy because it allows you to analyze circuits quickly in your head, without distractions. We want to encourage mental designing, or at least \"back-of-the-envelope\" designing, for idea brainstorming.\n\nSome more home-grown philosophy: there is a tendency among beginners to want to compute resistor values and other circuit component values to many significant places, particularly with calculators and computers that readily oblige. There are two reasons you should try to avoid falling into this habit: (a) the components themselves are of finite precision (resistors typically have tolerances of $\\pm 5 \\%$ or $\\pm 1 \\%$; for capacitors it's typically $\\pm 10 \\%$ or $\\pm 5 \\%$; and the parameters that characterize transistors, say, frequently are known only to a factor of 2); (b) one mark of a good circuit design is insensitivity of the finished circuit to precise values of the components (there are exceptions, of course). You'll also learn circuit intuition more quickly if you get into the habit of doing approximate calculations in your head, rather than watching meaningless numbers pop up on a calculator display. We believe strongly that reliance on formulas and equations early in your electronic circuit education is a fine way to prevent you from understanding what's really going on.\n\nIn trying to develop intuition about resistance, some people find it helpful to think about conductance, $G=1 / R$. The current through a device of conductance $G$ bridging a voltage $V$ is then given by $I=G V$ (Ohm's law). A small resistance is a large conductance, with correspondingly large current under the influence of an applied voltage. Viewed in this light, the formula for parallel resistors is obvious: when several resistors or conducting paths are connected across the same voltage, the total current is the sum of the individual currents. Therefore the net conductance is simply the sum of the individual conductances, $G=G_{1}+G_{2}+G_{3}+\\cdots$, which is the same as the formula for parallel resistors derived earlier.\n\nEngineers are fond of defining reciprocal units, and they have designated as the unit of conductance the siemens $(\\mathrm{S}=1 / \\Omega$), also known as the mho (that's ohm spelled backward, given the symbol $\\mho$). Although the concept of conductance is helpful in developing intuition, it is not used widely; most people prefer to talk about resistance instead.\n\n#### C. Power in resistors\n\nThe power dissipated by a resistor (or any other device) is $P=I V$. Using Ohm's law, you can get the equivalent forms $P=I^{2} R$ and $P=V^{2} / R$.\nExercise 1.5.

Its resistance is $0.05 \\mu \\Omega\\left(5 \\times 10^{-8}\\right.$ ohms) per foot. Calculate (a) the power lost per foot from \"$I^{2} R$ losses,\" (b) the length of cable over which you will lose all $10^{10}$ watts, and (c) how hot the cable will get, if you know the physics involved ($\\sigma=6 \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{~W} / \\mathrm{K}^{4} \\mathrm{~cm}^{2}$).

Input and output\n\nNearly all electronic circuits accept some sort of applied input (usually a voltage) and produce some sort of corresponding output (which again is often a voltage). For example, an audio amplifier might produce a (varying) output voltage that is 100 times as large as a (similarly varying) input voltage. When describing such an amplifier, we imagine measuring the output voltage for a given applied input voltage. Engineers speak of the transfer function $\\mathbf{H}$, the ratio of (measured) output divided by (applied) input; for the audio amplifier above, $\\mathbf{H}$ is simply a constant $(\\mathbf{H}=100)$. We'll get to amplifiers soon enough, in the next chapter. However, with only resistors we can already look at a very important circuit fragment, the voltage divider (which you might call a \"de-amplifier\")."

    "text": "Here lies an extensive and engaging narrative at the core of electronic components. Essentially, the objective is to create and manipulate gadgets with intriguing and practical current-voltage ($I$-$V$) properties. Examples include resistors (where current $I$ is directly proportional to voltage $V$), capacitors (where $I$ relates to the rate of change of $V$), diodes (current flows in one direction), thermistors (resistance varies with temperature), photoresistors (light-dependent), and strain gauges (responsive to strain). Even more captivating are three-terminal devices, such as transistors, where the current between two terminals is governed by the voltage at a third terminal. We will progressively delve into some of these intricate devices; initially, we will focus on the most common and extensively utilized circuit element, the resistor (Figure 1.3).\n\n[Image Description: Figure 1.3 illustrates a straightforward resistor configuration with two nodes connected.]\n\nFigure 1.3. Resistor.\n\n#### A. Understanding Resistance and Resistors\n\nAn intriguing fact is that the current flowing through a metallic conductor (or another partially conductive material) is directly proportional to the voltage across it. (In the case of conductors used in circuits, we typically select a sufficiently thick wire gauge to ensure that \"voltage drops\" are insignificant.) This is not a universal rule for all materials. For example, the current through a neon bulb is highly nonlinearly related to the applied voltage (it remains zero until a critical voltage is reached, after which it spikes). This also applies to various other intriguing devices - diodes, transistors, light bulbs, etc. (For an explanation of why metallic conductors behave in this manner, refer to Sections 4.4-4.5 in the excellent text \"Electricity and Magnetism\" by Purcell and Morin.)\n\nA resistor is crafted from a conductive material (carbon, or a thin metal or carbon film, or wire with low conductivity), with wire or contact points at each end. It is defined by its resistance:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR = \\frac{V}{I} \\tag{1.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHere, $R$ is in ohms when $V$ is in volts and $I$ is in amps. This is known as Ohm's law. Common resistors, such as metal-oxide film, metal film, or carbon film types, come in values ranging from 1 ohm ($1 \\Omega$) to about 10 megohms (10M $\\Omega$). Resistors are also defined by the power they can safely dissipate (commonly used ones are rated at $1/4$ or $1/8 \\mathrm{~W}$), their physical size, and other parameters like tolerance (accuracy), temperature coefficient, noise, voltage coefficient (how $R$ depends on applied $V$), stability over time, inductance, etc. See the box on resistors in Chapter 1x and Appendix C for more details. Figure 1.2 displays a variety of resistors, showcasing most of the common forms.\n\nIn essence, resistors are employed to transform voltage into current and vice versa. This may seem simplistic, but its significance will soon become apparent.\n\n#### B. Resistors in Series and Parallel\n\nFrom the definition of $R$, some straightforward conclusions can be drawn:\n\n1. The resistance of two resistors in series (Figure 1.4) is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR = R_1 + R_2 \\tag{1.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nConnecting resistors in series always results in a higher resistance.\n2. The resistance of two resistors in parallel (Figure 1.5) is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR = \\frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad R = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2}} \\tag{1.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nPutting resistors in parallel always yields a lower resistance. Resistance is measured in ohms $(\\Omega)$, but in practice, the $\\Omega$ symbol is often omitted when referring to resistors of more than $1000 \\Omega (1 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega)$. Thus, a $4.7 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$ resistor is frequently called a 4.7 k resistor, and a $1 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega$ resistor is referred to as a 1 M resistor (or 1 meg). If these basics seem tedious, please be patient - we will soon explore numerous fascinating applications.\n\nExercise 1.1. You have a 5 k resistor and a 10 k resistor. What is their combined resistance (a) in series and (b) in parallel?\nExercise 1.2. If you place a 1 ohm resistor across a 12 volt car battery, how much power will it dissipate?\n\nExercise 1.3. Prove the formulas for series and parallel resistors.\n\nExercise 1.4. Show that several resistors in parallel have resistance:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2} + \\frac{1}{R_3} + \\cdots} \\tag{1.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nNovices often get caught up in complex algebra when designing or attempting to understand electronics. Now is the time to start developing intuition and shortcuts. Here are a couple of useful tricks:\n\nShortcut #1: A large resistor in series (or parallel) with a small resistor has a resistance approximately equal to the larger (or smaller) one. Thus, you can \"tweak\" a resistor's value by connecting a second resistor in series or parallel: to increase the value, select a resistor with a value less than the target and add a smaller series resistor to make up the difference; to decrease the value, choose a resistor with a value greater than the target and connect a larger resistor in parallel. For the latter, you can approximate using proportions - to decrease a resistor's value by $1 \\%$, for instance, add a resistor 100 times as large in parallel.\nShortcut #2: Imagine you want a resistance of 5k in parallel with 10 k. If you consider the 5 k as two 10 k's in parallel, then the entire circuit behaves like three 10k's in parallel. Since the resistance of $n$ equal resistors in parallel is $1/n$th the resistance of one resistor, the answer in this case is $10 \\mathrm{k} / 3$, or 3.33 k. This trick is useful because it allows for quick mental circuit analysis without distractions. We encourage this kind of mental designing, or at least \"back-of-the-envelope\" designing, for generating ideas.\n\nSome additional insights: beginners often have a tendency to calculate resistor and other component values to many significant figures, especially with calculators and computers that make this easy. There are two reasons to avoid this habit: (a) the components themselves have finite precision (resistors typically have tolerances of $\\pm 5 \\%$ or $\\pm 1 \\%$; for capacitors, it's usually $\\pm 10 \\%$ or $\\pm 5 \\%$; and parameters characterizing transistors, for example, are often known only to within a factor of 2); (b) a good circuit design is one that is insensitive to the precise values of its components (with some exceptions, of course). You'll also learn circuit intuition faster if you get into the habit of doing rough calculations in your head instead of relying on a calculator. We firmly believe that an overreliance on formulas and equations early in your electronic circuit education can hinder your true understanding.\n\nIn developing an intuition about resistance, some individuals find it helpful to think about conductance, $G = 1/R$. The current through a device with conductance $G$ bridging a voltage $V$ is then given by $I = GV$ (Ohm's law). A low resistance corresponds to high conductance, resulting in a high current under the influence of an applied voltage. Seen in this light, the formula for parallel resistors is intuitive: when several resistors or conducting paths are connected across the same voltage, the total current is the sum of the individual currents. Hence, the total conductance is simply the sum of the individual conductances, $G = G_1 + G_2 + G_3 + \\cdots$, which is identical to the formula for parallel resistors derived earlier.\n\nEngineers like to define reciprocal units and have designated the siemens $(\\mathrm{S} = 1/\\Omega)$ as the unit of conductance, also known as the mho (ohm spelled backward, denoted by $\\mho$). Although the concept of conductance aids in developing intuition, it is not widely used; most people prefer to discuss resistance instead.\n\n#### C. Power Dissipation in Resistors\n\nThe power dissipated by a resistor (or any other device) is given by $P = IV$. Using Ohm's law, you can derive the equivalent forms $P = I^2 R$ and $P = V^2/R$.\n\nExercise 1.5. Show that it is impossible to exceed the power rating of a $1/4$ watt resistor with a resistance greater than 1 k, regardless of how it is connected in a circuit powered by a 15 volt battery.\n\nExercise 1.6.

If you've done your calculations correctly, the result should seem absurd. What is the solution to this puzzle?\n\n#### D.

    "text": "We now address the topic of the voltage divider, one of the most prevalent fragments in electronic circuits. Present us with any real-world circuit, and we'll identify numerous voltage dividers within it. Simply put, a voltage divider is a circuit that, given a specific input voltage, yields a predictable portion of that input as the output voltage. The most basic voltage divider is depicted in Figure 1.6.\n\nimage_name: Figure 1.6 Voltage divider\ndescription:\n[\n'name': 'R1', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'R1', 'ports': {'N1': 'Vin', 'N2': 'Vout'}\n'name': 'R2', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'R2', 'ports': {'N1': 'N1', 'N2': 'Vout'}\n]\nextrainfo: This circuit is a voltage divider where the output voltage Vout is a fraction of the input voltage Vin, determined by the resistor values R1 and R2.

An applied voltage $V_{\\text{in}}$ results in a (smaller) output voltage $V_{\\text{out}}$.\n\nAn important clarification: when engineers sketch such a circuit, it's generally understood that the $V_{\\text{in}}$ on the left is the voltage being applied to the circuit, and the $V_{\\text{out}}$ on the right is the resulting output voltage (produced by the circuit) that you are measuring or interested in. You are expected to grasp this (a) due to the convention of signals flowing from left to right, (b) from the indicative names (\"in,\" \"out\") of the signals, and (c) from familiarity with similar circuits. This might be confusing initially, but it becomes straightforward with experience.\n\nWhat is $V_{\\text{out}}$? The current (consistent throughout, assuming no \"load\" on the output; i.e., nothing connected across the output) is\n\n$$\nI = \\frac{V_{\\text{in}}}{R_{1} + R_{2}}\n$$\n\nimage_name: A\ndescription:\n[\nname: R1, type: Resistor, value: R1, ports: {N1: Vin, N2: Vout}\nname: R2, type: Resistor, value: R2 (adjustable), ports: {N1: Vout, N2: GND}\n]\nextrainfo: The circuit in diagram A is an adjustable voltage divider using a fixed resistor R1 and an adjustable resistor R2.

An adjustable voltage divider can be constructed from a fixed and variable resistor, or from a potentiometer. In some modern circuits, you'll find a series chain of equal-value resistors with electronic switches that allow selection of any junction as the output; this may sound complex, but it offers the advantage of electrical voltage ratio adjustment (rather than mechanical).\n\n(We've applied the definition of resistance and the series law.)

This isn't as far-fetched as it sounds; devices with negative \"incremental\" resistances (e.g., tunnel diodes) or true negative resistances (e.g., negative-impedance converters, discussed later in §6.2.4B) are possible. However, these applications are specialized and not immediately relevant.\n\nVoltage dividers are frequently employed in circuits to derive a specific voltage from a larger, fixed or variable voltage. For example, if $V_{\\text{in}}$ is a variable voltage and $R_{2}$ is an adjustable resistor (Figure 1.7A), you have a \"volume control\"; alternatively, the combination $R_{1} R_{2}$ can be a single variable resistor, or potentiometer (Figure 1.7B). Such applications are common, and potentiometers are available in various styles, as shown in Figure 1.8.\n\nThe unassuming voltage divider is even more valuable as a conceptual tool for understanding circuits: the input voltage and upper resistance might represent an amplifier's output, while the lower resistance might represent the input of the following stage. In this scenario, the voltage-divider equation indicates how much signal reaches the input of that next stage. This will become clearer after learning about a significant principle (Thévenin's theorem), which will be discussed later.

The current (consistent throughout, assuming no \"load\" on the output; i.e., nothing connected across the output) is\n\n$$\nI=\\frac{V_{\\text{in}}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}\n$$\n\nimage_name: A\ndescription:\n[\nname: R1, type: Resistor, value: R1, ports: {N1: Vin, N2: Vout}\nname: R2, type: Resistor, value: R2 (adjustable), ports: {N1: Vout, N2: GND}\n]\nextrainfo: The circuit in diagram A is an adjustable voltage divider using a fixed resistor R1 and an adjustable resistor R2. Signal in is applied across R1 and R2, and signal out is taken from the junction of R1 and R2 to ground.\nimage_name: B\ndescription:\n[\nname: R1, type: Resistor, value: R1, ports: {N1: signal in, N2: signal out}\nname: R2, type: Resistor, value: R2, ports: {N1: signal out, N2: GND}\n]\nextrainfo: This circuit is a basic adjustable voltage divider using a fixed resistor R1 and an adjustable resistor R2. The input is 'signal in' and the output is 'signal out'. The output voltage can be adjusted by changing the resistance of R2.\n\nFigure 1.7. An adjustable voltage divider can be constructed from a fixed and variable resistor, or from a potentiometer. In some modern circuits, you'll find a series chain of equal-value resistors with an arrangement of electronic switches that allows selection of any junction as the output; this may sound complex, but it offers the advantage of electrical voltage ratio adjustment (rather than mechanical).\n\n(We've applied the definition of resistance and the series law.) Then, for $R_{2}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\mathrm{out}}=I R_{2}=\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} V_{\\mathrm{in}} \\tag{1.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nNote that the output voltage is always less than or equal to the input voltage; hence the term \"divider.\" Amplification (output greater than input) could be achieved if one of the resistances were negative. This isn't as far-fetched as it sounds; devices with negative \"incremental\" resistances (e.g., tunnel diodes) or true negative resistances (e.g., negative-impedance converters, discussed later in §6.2.4B) exist. However, these applications are specialized and not immediately relevant.\n\nVoltage dividers are frequently employed in circuits to derive a specific voltage from a larger fixed or varying voltage. For example, if $V_{\\text{in}}$ is a variable voltage and $R_{2}$ is an adjustable resistor (Figure 1.7A), you have a \"volume control\"; alternatively, the combination $R_{1} R_{2}$ can be a single variable resistor, or potentiometer (Figure 1.7B). Such applications are common, and potentiometers are available in various styles, as shown in Figure 1.8.\n\nThe unassuming voltage divider is even more valuable as a conceptual tool for understanding circuits: the input voltage and upper resistance might represent an amplifier's output, while the lower resistance might represent the input of the subsequent stage. In this scenario, the voltage-divider equation indicates how much signal reaches the input of that final stage. This will become clearer after learning about Thévenin's theorem, which will be discussed later. First, though, a brief digression on voltage sources and current sources.\n\nimage_name: Figure 1.8\ndescription: The image labeled \"Figure 1.8\" illustrates various common potentiometer styles, arranged in three rows.

    "text": "We now address the topic of the voltage divider, one of the most prevalent fragments in electronic circuits. Present any real-world circuit, and we can identify numerous voltage dividers within it. Simply put, a voltage divider is a circuit that, given a specific input voltage, generates a predictable portion of that input as the output voltage. The most basic voltage divider is depicted in Figure 1.6.\n\n**Figure 1.6. Voltage Divider**\n- **Description:**\n  - **R1:** Resistor, value: R1, connected between Vin and Vout.\n  - **R2:** Resistor, value: R2, connected between N1 and Vout.\n- **Extra Info:** This circuit functions as a voltage divider where Vout is a fraction of Vin, determined by the resistor values R1 and R2. The formula for Vout is Vout = Vin * (R2 / (R1 + R2)).\n\n**Figure 1.6. Voltage Divider.** An applied voltage $V_{\\text{in}}$ results in a reduced output voltage $V_{\\text{out}}$.\n\nAn important clarification: when engineers sketch such a circuit, it's generally understood that $V_{\\text{in}}$ on the left is the voltage applied to the circuit, and $V_{\\text{out}}$ on the right is the resulting output voltage (produced by the circuit) that you are measuring or interested in. This understanding comes from (a) the convention of signal flow from left to right, (b) the suggestive names (\"in,\" \"out\") of the signals, and (c) familiarity with similar circuits. Initially, this might be confusing, but it becomes straightforward with experience.\n\nWhat is $V_{\\text{out}}$? The current (uniform throughout, assuming no load on the output; i.e., nothing connected across the output) is:\n\n$$\nI = \\frac{V_{\\text{in}}}{R1 + R2}\n$$\n\n**Figure A**\n- **Description:**\n  - **R1:** Resistor, value: R1, ports: {N1: Vin, N2: Vout}.\n  - **R2:** Resistor, value: R2 (adjustable), ports: {N1: Vout, N2: GND}.\n- **Extra Info:** This diagram shows an adjustable voltage divider using a fixed resistor R1 and an adjustable resistor R2.

In some modern circuits, you'll find a series chain of equal-value resistors with electronic switches to select any junction as the output. This may sound complex, but it allows for electrical adjustment of the voltage ratio.\n\n(Using resistance definition and series law), for $R2$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\mathrm{out}} = I R2 = \\frac{R2}{R1 + R2} V_{\\mathrm{in}} \\tag{1.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nNote that the output voltage is always less than or equal to the input voltage, hence the term \"divider.\" Amplification (output greater than input) could occur if one resistance were negative, which isn't as implausible as it sounds.

    "text": "Thévenin's theorem asserts that any two-terminal network composed of resistors and voltage sources can be represented by a single resistor \\( R \\) in series with a single voltage source \\( V \\). This simplification is remarkable because it means that even the most complex arrangements of batteries and resistors can be replicated by just one battery and one resistor (as illustrated in Figure 1.11). It is also worth noting that Norton's theorem provides a similar simplification using a current source in parallel with a resistor.\n\nDetermining the Thévenin equivalent \\( R_{\\mathrm{Th}} \\) and \\( V_{\\mathrm{Th}} \\) for a circuit is straightforward. \\( V_{\\mathrm{Th}} \\) corresponds to the open-circuit voltage of the Thévenin equivalent circuit, which should match the open-circuit voltage of the original circuit, whether calculated or measured.

The diagram illustrates how a voltage divider's output voltage is influenced when a load is connected.\n\nIt is evident from this example that a voltage divider is not an ideal voltage source, as its output voltage significantly decreases when a load is attached. For instance, Exercise 1.10 will demonstrate how to calculate the exact drop in output voltage for a given load resistance using the Thévenin equivalent circuit.\n\n#### MULTIMETERS\n\nMany instruments exist for measuring voltages and currents in a circuit. The oscilloscope is highly versatile, allowing visualization of voltage versus time at various points in a circuit. Logic probes and logic analyzers are specialized tools for debugging digital circuits. The multimeter, simple yet effective, is used for measuring voltage, current, and resistance with considerable precision, although it is slower and cannot replace the oscilloscope for observing changing voltages. Multimeters come in two forms: those with a moving pointer on a conventional scale and those with a digital display.\n\nThe traditional VOM (volt-ohmmilliammeter) multimeter, now largely obsolete, employs a meter movement that measures current (usually \\( 50 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\) full scale). To measure voltage, the VOM incorporates a resistor in series with the meter movement. For example, one type of VOM achieves a 1 V (full-scale) range by adding a \\( 20 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega \\) resistor in series with the standard \\( 50 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\) movement; higher voltage ranges use proportionally larger resistors. Such a VOM is specified as \\( 20,000 \\Omega / \\mathrm{V} \\), indicating that it behaves like a resistor whose value is \\( 20 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega \\) multiplied by the full-scale voltage of the selected range. The full scale on any voltage range is \\( 1 / 20,000 \\mathrm{amps} \\), or \\( 50 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\). It is clear that one of these voltmeters distur less disturbance on a circuit at higher ranges, since it appears as a higher resistance (consider the voltmeter as the lower resistor in a voltage divider, with the Thévenin resistance of the measured circuit as the upper resistor). Ideally, a voltmeter should have infinite input resistance.\n\nModern\nThévenin's theorem asserts\nThévenin's theorem asserts\nThévenin's theorem is a fundamental concept in electrical engineering that simplifies the analysis of complex circuits networks.

For instance, Exercise 1.10 demonstrates how to calculate the exact voltage drop for a specific load resistance using the Thévenin equivalent circuit.\n\n#### MULTIMETERS\n\nThere are various instruments for measuring voltages and currents in a circuit. The oscilloscope is particularly versatile, allowing you to visualize voltage versus time at multiple points in a circuit. Logic probes and logic analyzers are specialized tools for troubleshooting digital circuits. The simple multimeter offers a convenient way to measure voltage, current, and resistance with good precision, though it responds slowly and is not suitable for tracking changing voltages, unlike an oscilloscope. Multimeters come in two types: those with a moving pointer on a conventional scale and those with a digital display.\n\nThe traditional VOM (volt-ohmmilliammeter) multimeter uses a meter movement that measures current (typically \\( 50 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\) full scale). To measure voltage, the VOM places a resistor in series with the basic movement. For example, one type of VOM will achieve a 1 V (full-scale) range by placing a 20 k\\(\\Omega\\) resistor in series with the standard \\( 50 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\) movement; higher voltage ranges use proportionally larger resistors. Such a VOM is specified as \\( 20,000 \\Omega / \\mathrm{V} \\), indicating that it appears as a resistor whose value is 20 k\\(\\Omega\\) multiplied by the full-scale voltage of the selected range. The full scale on any voltage range is \\( 1 / 20,000 \\mathrm{amps} \\), or \\( 50 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\). It is clear that one of these voltmeters disturbs a circuit less on a higher range since it presents a higher resistance (consider the voltmeter as the lower leg of a voltage divider, with the Thévenin resistance of the circuit being measured as the upper resistor). Ideally, a voltmeter should have infinite input resistance.\n\nMost modern multimeters use electronic amplification and have an input resistance of \\( 10 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega \\) to \\( 1000 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega \\) when measuring voltage; they display results digitally and are known as digital multimeters (DMMs). Caution: the input resistance of these meters can be very high on the most sensitive ranges, dropping to a lower resistance for the higher ranges. For example, you might typically have an input resistance of \\( 10^9 \\Omega \\) on the 0.2 V and 2 V ranges, and \\( 10^7 \\Omega \\) on all higher ranges. Read the specifications carefully! However, for most circuit measurements, these high input resistances will produce negligible loading effects. In any case, it is straightforward to calculate the impact using the voltage-divider equation. Typically, multimeters offer voltage ranges from a volt (or less) to a kilovolt (or more), full scale.\n\nA multimeter usually includes current-measuring capability, with switchable ranges. Ideally, a current-measuring meter should have zero resistance to avoid disturbing the circuit under test, as it must be placed in series with the circuit. In practice, a small voltage drop (sometimes called \"voltage burden\") is tolerated with both VOMs and digital multimeters. For either type of meter, selecting a current range places a small resistor across the meter's input terminals, typically of a resistance value to create a voltage drop of 0.1 V to 0.25 V for the chosen full-scale current; the voltage drop is then converted to a corresponding current indication. Typically, multimeters provide current ranges from \\( 50 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\) (or less) to an amp (or more), full scale.\n\nMultimeters also include one or more batteries to power the resistance measurement. By supplying a small current and measuring the voltage drop, they measure resistance, with several ranges to cover values from \\( 1 \\Omega \\) (or less) to \\( 10 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega \\) (or more).\n\nImportant: do not attempt to measure \"the current of a voltage source\" by placing the meter across a wall plug; the same applies for ohms. This is a common cause of damaged meters.\n\nExercise 1.7. What will a \\( 20,000 \\Omega / \\mathrm{V} \\) meter read on its 1 V scale when connected to a 1 V source with an internal resistance of 10 k\\(\\Omega\\)? What will it read when connected to a \\( 10 \\mathrm{k}-10 \\mathrm{k} \\) voltage divider driven by a \"stiff\" (zero source resistance) 1 V source?\n\nExercise 1.8. A \\( 50 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\) meter movement has an internal resistance of 5 k\\(\\Omega\\). What shunt resistance is needed to convert it to a \\( 0-1 \\) A meter? What series resistance will convert it to a \\( 0-10 \\mathrm{~V} \\) meter?\n\nExercise 1.9. The very high internal resistance of digital multimeters in their voltage-measuring ranges can be used to measure extremely low currents (even though the DMM may not offer a low current range explicitly). For instance, if you want to measure the small current that flows through a \\( 1000 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega \\) \"leakage\" resistance (a term used to describe a small current that ideally should be absent entirely, for example through the insulation of an underground cable), you can use a standard DMM whose 2 V dc range has \\( 10 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega \\) internal resistance and a dc source of +10 V. How can you use these tools to measure the leakage resistance accurately?\n\nExercise 1.10. For the circuit shown in Figure 1.12, with \\( V_{\\text{in}} = 30 \\mathrm{~V} \\) and \\( R_1 = R_2 = 10 \\mathrm{k} \\), find (a) the output voltage with no load attached (the open-circuit voltage); (b) the output voltage with a 10 k\\(\\Omega\\) load (treat as a voltage divider, with \\( R_2 \\) and \\( R_{\\text{load}} \\) combined into a single resistor); (c) the Thévenin equivalent circuit; (d) the same as in part (b), but using the Thévenin equivalent circuit [again, you wind up with a voltage divider; the answer should agree with the result in part (b)]; (e) the power dissipated in each of the resistors.\n\n#### A. Equivalent source resistance and circuit loading\n\nAs we have seen, a voltage divider powered from a fixed voltage is equivalent to a smaller voltage source in series with a resistor. For example, the output terminals of a \\( 10 \\mathrm{k}-10 \\mathrm{k} \\) voltage divider driven by a perfect 30 volt battery are precisely equivalent to a perfect 15 volt battery in series with a 5 k\\(\\Omega\\) resistor (Figure 1.13). Connecting a load resistor causes the voltage divider's output to drop due to the finite source resistance (Thévenin equivalent resistance of the voltage divider output, viewed as a source of voltage). This is often undesirable. One solution to creating a stiff voltage source (\"stiff\" in this context refers to something that doesn't bend under load) might be to use much smaller resistors in a voltage divider.偶尔这种简单粗暴的方法是有用的。 However, it is usually best to construct a voltage source, or power supply, using active components like transistors or operational amplifiers, which we will cover in Chapters 2-4. In this way, you can easily create a voltage source with an internal (Thévenin equivalent) resistance as small as milliohms (thousandths of an ohm), without the large currents and power dissipation characteristic of a low-resistance voltage divider delivering the same performance. Additionally, with an active power supply, it is easy to make the output voltage adjustable. These topics are discussed in detail in Chapter 9.\n\nThe concept of equivalent internal resistance applies to all sorts of sources, not just batteries and voltage dividers. Signal sources (e.g., oscillators, amplifiers, and sensing devices) all have an equivalent internal resistance. Connecting a load whose resistance is less than or even comparable to the internal resistance will significantly reduce the output. This undesirable reduction of the open-circuit voltage (or signal) by the load is called \"circuit loading.\" Therefore, you should aim to make \\( R_{\\text{load}} \\gg R_{\\text{internal}} \\), as a high-resistance load has minimal attenuating effect on the source (Figure 1.14). We will see numerous circuit examples in the following chapters. This high-resistance condition ideally characterizes measuring instruments such as voltmeters and oscilloscopes.\n\nRegarding language, it is common to hear phrases like \"the resistance looking into the voltage divider\" or \"the output sees a load of so-and-so many ohms,\" as if circuits had eyes. It is acceptable (and actually a good way to keep track of which resistance you're referring to) to specify what part of the circuit is doing the \"looking.\"\n\nFigure 1.14 shows a dual-axis plot with the x-axis labeled as \\( R_{\\text{LOAD}} / R_{\\text{OUT}} \\), representing the ratio of load resistance to output resistance on a logarithmic scale ranging from 0.1 to 100. The left y-axis is labeled \\( V_{\\text{OUT}} / V_{\\text{OPEN}} \\), indicating the ratio of output voltage to open-circuit voltage, with a linear scale from 0 to 1. The right y-axis is labeled as \\( \\% \\text{Reduction from} \\, V_{\\text{OPEN}} \\), with a linear scale from 0 to 10%.\n\nThe graph shows two curves. The first curve, plotted against the left y-axis, starts low at \\( R_{\\text{LOAD}} / R_{\\text{OUT}} = 0.1 \\) with a value of about 0.2 and increases steadily, approaching a value close to 1 as \\( R_{\\text{LOAD}} / R_{\\text{OUT}} \\) reaches 100. This indicates that as the load resistance increases compared to the output resistance, the output voltage approaches the open-circuit voltage, minimizing attenuation.\n\nThe second curve, plotted against the right y-axis, shows the percentage reduction from the open-circuit voltage. It starts at a higher percentage when \\( R_{\\text{LOAD}} / R_{\\text{OUT}} \\) is low, decreases to a minimum around \\( R_{\\text{LOAD}} / R_{\\text{OUT}} = 10 \\), and then increases again, indicating that the percentage reduction in voltage is minimized when the load resistance is significantly larger than the output resistance.\n\nThe intersection point of the two curves occurs around \\( R_{\\text{LOAD}} / R_{\\text{OUT}} = 10 \\), where the percentage reduction is minimized, and the output voltage is approximately 0.7 of the open-circuit voltage. This point represents an optimal balance between load and output resistances for minimizing signal attenuation.\n\nFigure 1.14. To minimize the attenuation of a signal source below its open-circuit voltage, keep the load resistance large compared with the output resistance.\n\n#### B. Power transfer\n\nAn interesting problem is: what load resistance will result in maximum power being transferred to the load for a given source resistance? (The terms source resistance, internal resistance, and Thévenin equivalent resistance all mean the same thing.) It is clear that either \\( R_{\\text{load}} = 0 \\) or \\( R_{\\text{load}} = \\infty \\) results in zero power transferred, because \\( R_{\\text{load}} = 0 \\) means that \\( V_{\\text{load}} = 0 \\) and \\( I_{\\text{load}} = V_{\\text{source}} / R_{\\text{source}} \\), so that \\( P_{\\text{load}} = V_{\\text{load}} I_{\\text{load}} = 0 \\). But \\( R_{\\text{load}} = \\infty \\) means that \\( V_{\\text{load}} = V_{\\text{source}} \\) and \\( I_{\\text{load}} = 0 \\), so that again \\( P_{\\text{load}} = 0 \\). There must be a maximum somewhere in between.\n\nExercise 1.11. Show that \\( R_{\\text{load}} = R_{\\text{source}} \\) maximizes the power in the load for a given source resistance. Note: skip this exercise if you are not familiar with calculus, and accept that the answer is true.\n\nTo reiterate, circuits are generally designed so that the load resistance is much greater than the source resistance of the signal that drives the load."

    "text": "Thévenin's theorem asserts that any two-terminal network composed of resistors and voltage sources can be simplified to an equivalent circuit consisting of a solitary resistor \\( R \\) in series with a solitary voltage source \\( V \\). This simplification is remarkable, as it allows any complex arrangement of batteries and resistors to be represented by a single battery and resistor (Figure 1.11). It's worth noting that Norton's theorem offers a similar simplification using a current source in parallel with a resistor.\n\nDetermining the Thévenin equivalent \\( R_{\\mathrm{Th}} \\) and \\( V_{\\mathrm{Th}} \\) for a particular circuit is straightforward. \\( V_{\\mathrm{Th}} \\) corresponds to the open-circuit voltage of the Thévenin equivalent circuit; hence, if the two circuits behave identically, it must also be the open-circuit voltage of the given circuit, which can be determined through calculation or measurement. To find \\( R_{\\mathrm{Th}} \\), observe that the short-circuit current of the equivalent circuit is \\( V_{\\mathrm{Th}} / R_{\\mathrm{Th}} \\). This can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{\\mathrm{Th}} & = V(\\text{open circuit}), \\\\\nR_{\\mathrm{Th}} & = \\frac{V(\\text{open circuit})}{I(\\text{short circuit})} . \\tag{1.7}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nApplying this method to a voltage divider yields its Thévenin equivalent:\n\n1. The open-circuit voltage is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   V = V_{\\text{in}} \\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1} + R_{2}}.\n   \\]\n\n2. The short-circuit current is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{V_{\\text{in}}}{R_{1}}.\n   \\]\n\nThus, the Thévenin equivalent circuit consists of a voltage source,\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\mathrm{Th}} = V_{\\mathrm{in}} \\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1} + R_{2}}, \\tag{1.8}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\nin series with a resistor,\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{\\mathrm{Th}} = \\frac{R_{1} R_{2}}{R_{1} + R_{2}} \\tag{1.9}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\nThis equivalent resistance is not coincidentally the parallel resistance of \\( R_{1} \\) and \\( R_{2} \\), a fact that will become clearer later.\n\nThe accompanying circuit diagram illustrates the Thévenin equivalent of a voltage divider. \\( V_{\\text{in}} \\) represents the input voltage, and \\( V_{\\mathrm{Th}} \\) is the Thévenin equivalent voltage. \\( R_{1} \\) and \\( R_{2} \\) form the original voltage divider, while \\( R_{\\mathrm{Th}} \\) is the equivalent resistance as seen by the load \\( R_{\\text{load}} \\). The diagram demonstrates how the output voltage of a voltage divider is affected when a load is connected.\n\nFigure 1.12 depicts the Thévenin equivalent of a voltage divider. This example highlights that a voltage divider is not an ideal battery, as its output voltage significantly drops when a load is attached. As an illustration, consider Exercise 1.10. With the knowledge gained, one can now calculate precisely how much the output voltage will drop for a given load resistance by using the Thévenin equivalent circuit, attaching a load, and calculating the new output, noting that the new circuit is simply another voltage divider (Figure 1.12).\n\n#### MULTIMETERS\n\nA variety of instruments exist for measuring voltages and currents in a circuit. The oscilloscope is the most versatile, allowing visualization of voltages versus time at one or more points in a circuit. Logic probes and logic analyzers are specialized tools for troubleshooting digital circuits. The multimeter provides a convenient means of measuring voltage, current, and resistance, often with good precision, but it responds slowly and cannot replace the oscilloscope when dealing with changing voltages. Multimeters come in two types: those with a moving pointer on a conventional scale and those with a digital display.\n\nThe traditional VOM (volt-ohmmilliammeter) multimeter, now largely obsolete, uses a meter movement that measures current (typically \\( 50 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\) full scale). To measure voltage, the VOM places a resistor in series with the basic movement. For instance, a VOM might use a \\( 20 \\, k\\Omega \\) resistor in series with the standard \\( 50 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\) movement to generate a 1 V (full-scale) range; higher voltage ranges use correspondingly larger resistors. Such a VOM is specified as \\( 20,000 \\Omega / \\mathrm{V} \\), indicating that it behaves like a resistor whose value is 20 k times the full-scale voltage of the selected range. The full-scale current on any voltage range is \\( 1 / 20,000 \\mathrm{amps} \\), or \\( 50 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\). It's evident that a voltmeter disturbs a circuit less on a higher range since it appears as a higher resistance. Ideally, a voltmeter should have infinite input resistance.\n\nMost modern multimeters use electronic amplification and have an input resistance of \\( 10 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega \\) to \\( 1000 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega \\) when measuring voltage, displaying results digitally and collectively known as digital multimeters (DMMs). Caution is advised: the input resistance of these meters can be very high on the most sensitive ranges, decreasing to a lower resistance for higher ranges. For example, an input resistance of \\( 10^{9} \\Omega \\) might be typical on the 0.2 V and 2 V ranges, and \\( 10^{7} \\Omega \\) on all higher ranges. Carefully read the specifications! However, for most circuit measurements, these high input resistances will produce negligible loading effects. In any case, it's straightforward to calculate the impact using the voltage-divider equation. Typically, multimeters offer voltage ranges from a volt (or less) to a kilovolt (or more), full scale.\n\nA multimeter usually includes current-measuring capability with switchable ranges. Ideally, a current-measuring meter should have zero resistance to avoid disturbing the circuit under test, since it must be placed in series with the circuit. In practice, a small voltage drop (sometimes called \"voltage burden\") is tolerated with both VOMs and digital multimeters. For either type of meter, selecting a current range places a small resistor across the meter's input terminals, typically of a resistance value to create a voltage drop of 0.1 V to 0.25 V for the chosen full-scale current; the voltage drop is then converted to a corresponding current indication. Typically, multimeters provide current ranges from \\( 50 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\) (or less) to an amp (or more), full scale.\n\nMultimeters also include one or more batteries to power the resistance measurement. By supplying a small current and measuring the voltage drop, they measure resistance, with several ranges to cover values from \\( 1 \\Omega \\) (or less) to \\( 10 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega \\) (or more).\n\nImportant: do not attempt to measure \"the current of a voltage source\" by connecting the meter across a wall plug; the same caution applies to ohm measurements. This is a common cause of damaged meters.\n\n#### A. Equivalent source resistance and circuit loading\n\nAs we've seen, a voltage divider powered from a fixed voltage is equivalent to a smaller voltage source in series with a resistor. For example, the output terminals of a \\( 10 \\mathrm{k}-10 \\mathrm{k} \\) voltage divider driven by a perfect 30 volt battery are precisely equivalent to a perfect 15 volt battery in series with a 5 k resistor (Figure 1.13). Connecting a load resistor causes the voltage divider's output to drop due to the finite source resistance (the Thévenin equivalent resistance of the voltage divider output, viewed as a voltage source). This is often undesirable. One solution to creating a stiff voltage source (\"stiff\" describes something that doesn't bend under load) might be to use much smaller resistors in a voltage divider. Occasionally, this brute-force approach is useful. However, it's usually best to construct a voltage source, or power supply, using active components like transistors or operational amplifiers, which we will cover in Chapters 2-4. This way, you can easily create a voltage source with an internal (Thévenin equivalent) resistance as small as milliohms, without the large currents and power dissipation associated with a low-resistance voltage divider delivering the same performance.

Connecting a load whose resistance is less than or even comparable to the internal resistance will significantly reduce the output. This undesirable reduction of the open-circuit voltage (or signal) by the load is called \"circuit loading.\" Therefore, you should aim to make \\( R_{\\text{load}} \\gg R_{\\text{internal}} \\), as a high-resistance load has minimal attenuating effect on the source (Figure 1.14). We will encounter numerous circuit examples in the upcoming chapters. This high-resistance condition ideally characterizes measuring instruments such as voltmeters and oscilloscopes.\n\nRegarding language, you often hear phrases like \"the resistance looking into the voltage divider\" or \"the output sees a load of so-and-so many ohms,\" as if circuits had eyes. It's acceptable (and actually a good way to keep track of which resistance is being discussed) to specify what part of the circuit is doing the \"looking.\"\n\nFigure 1.14 illustrates that to minimize the attenuation of a signal source below its open-circuit voltage, the load resistance should be kept large compared to the output resistance.\n\n#### B.

Equivalent source resistance and circuit loading\n\nAs we have just seen, a voltage divider powered from some fixed voltage is equivalent to some smaller voltage source in series with a resistor. For example, the output terminals of a \\( 10 \\mathrm{k}-10 \\mathrm{k} \\) voltage divider driven by a perfect 30 volt battery are precisely equivalent to a perfect 15 volt battery in series with a 5 k resistor (Figure 1.13). Connecting a load resistor causes the voltage divider's output to drop, due to the finite source resistance (Thévenin equivalent resistance of the voltage divider output, viewed as a source of voltage). This is often undesirable. One solution to the problem of creating a stiff voltage source (\"stiff\" is used in this context to describe something that doesn't bend under load) might be to use much smaller resistors in a voltage divider. Occasionally, this brute-force approach is useful. However, it is usually best to construct a voltage source, or power supply, using active components like transistors or operational amplifiers, which we will discuss in Chapters 2-4. In this way, you can easily create a voltage source with an internal (Thévenin equivalent) resistance as small as milliohms (thousandths of an ohm), without the large currents and power dissipation characteristic of a low-resistance voltage divider delivering the same performance. In addition, with an active power supply, it is easy to make the output voltage adjustable. These topics are covered extensively in Chapter 9.\n\nThe concept of equivalent internal resistance applies to all sorts of sources, not just batteries and voltage dividers. Signal sources (e.g., oscillators, amplifiers, and sensing devices) all have an equivalent internal resistance. Connecting a load whose resistance is less than or even comparable to the internal resistance will reduce the output significantly. This undesirable reduction of the open-circuit voltage (or signal) by the load is called \"circuit loading.\" Therefore, you should strive to make \\( R_{\\text {load }} \\gg R_{\\text {internal }} \\), because a high-resistance load has little attenuating effect on the source (Figure 1.14). We will see numerous circuit examples in the chapters ahead. This high-resistance condition ideally characterizes measuring instruments such as voltmeters and oscilloscopes.\n\nA word on language: you frequently hear things like \"the resistance looking into the voltage divider\" or \"the output sees a load of so-and-so many ohms,\" as if circuits had eyes. It's OK (in fact, it's a rather good way of keeping straight which resistance you're talking about) to say what part of the circuit is doing the \"looking.\"\n\n#### B. Power transfer\n\nHere is an interesting problem: what load resistance will result in maximum power being transferred to the load for a given source resistance? (The terms source resistance, internal resistance, and Thévenin equivalent resistance all mean the same thing.) It is easy to see that either \\( R_{\\text {load }}=0 \\) or \\( R_{\\text {load }}=\\infty \\) results in zero power transferred, because \\( R_{\\text {load }}=0 \\) means that \\( V_{\\text {load }}=0 \\) and \\( I_{\\text {load }}=V_{\\text {source }} / R_{\\text {source }} \\), so that \\( P_{\\text {load }}=V_{\\text {load }} I_{\\text {load }}=0 \\). But \\( R_{\\text {load }}=\\infty \\) means that \\( V_{\\text {load }}=V_{\\text {source }} \\) and \\( I_{\\text {load }}=0 \\), so that again \\( P_{\\text {load }}=0 \\). There has to be a maximum in between.\n\nExercise 1.11. Show that \\( R_{\\text {load }}=R_{\\text {source }} \\) maximizes the power in the load for a given source resistance. Note: skip this exercise if you don't know calculus, and take it on faith that the answer is true.\n\nLest this example leave the wrong impression, we would like to emphasize again that circuits are ordinarily designed so that the load resistance is much greater than the source resistance of the signal that drives the load."

With the knowledge acquired, you can now precisely calculate the drop in output voltage for a given load resistance by using the Thévenin equivalent circuit, connecting a load, and computing the new output voltage, recognizing that the new circuit is fundamentally another voltage divider.\n\n#### MULTIMETERS\n\nCircuits can be analyzed using various instruments to measure voltages and currents. The oscilloscope is particularly versatile, enabling the visualization of voltage versus time at selected points within a circuit. Logic probes and analyzers are tailored for troubleshooting digital circuits, while the multimeter offers a convenient means of measuring voltage, current, and resistance with considerable precision, albeit with a slower response, making it unsuitable for tracking rapidly changing voltages. Multimeters come in two forms: those with a moving pointer on a conventional scale and those with a digital display.\n\nThe vintage VOM (volt-ohmmilliammeter) multimeter utilizes a meter movement that measures current, typically \\( 50 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\) at full scale. To measure voltage, a resistor is placed in series with the meter movement. For example, one type of VOM achieves a 1 V full-scale range using a \\( 20 \\text{k} \\Omega \\) resistor in series with the standard \\( 50 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\) movement; higher voltage ranges employ proportionally larger resistors. Such a VOM is specified as \\( 20,000 \\Omega / \\mathrm{V} \\), signifying that it resembles a resistor whose value is 20 k times the full-scale voltage of the chosen range. Full scale on any voltage range is \\( 1 / 20,000 \\mathrm{amps} \\), or \\( 50 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\). Evidently, one of these voltmeters disturbs a circuit less on a higher range since it presents a higher resistance (consider the voltmeter as the lower leg of a voltage divider, with the Thévenin resistance of the measured circuit as the upper resistor). Ideally, a voltmeter should have infinite input resistance.\n\nModern multimeters typically employ electronic amplification and possess an input resistance of \\( 10 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega \\) to \\( 1000 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega \\) when measuring voltage, displaying results digitally and collectively known as digital multimeters (DMMs). Caution is advised: the input resistance of these meters can be very high on the most sensitive ranges, decreasing to a lower resistance for higher ranges. For instance, on the 0.2 V and 2 V ranges, the input resistance might typically be \\( 10^{9} \\Omega \\), and \\( 10^{7} \\Omega \\) on all higher ranges. Carefully read the specifications! However, for most circuit measurements, these high input resistances will induce negligible loading effects. In any case, it is straightforward to calculate the impact using the voltage-divider equation. Generally, multimeters offer voltage ranges from a volt (or less) to a kilovolt (or more), full scale.\n\nMultimeters also include current-measuring functionality, with switchable ranges. Ideally, a current-measuring meter should have zero resistance to avoid disrupting the circuit under test, as it must be placed in series with the circuit. Practically, a voltage drop of a few tenths of a volt (有时称为\"电压负担\") is tolerable with both VOMs and digital multimeters. For either type of meter, selecting a current range places a small resistor across the meter's input terminals, typically creating a voltage drop of 0.1 V to 0.25 V for the chosen full-scale current; this voltage drop is then converted to the corresponding current indication. Generally, multimeters provide current ranges from \\( 50 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\) (or less) to an amp (or more), full scale.\n\nMultimeters also incorporate one or more batteries to power the resistance measurement. By supplying a small current and measuring the voltage drop, they determine resistance, offering several ranges to cover values from \\( 1 \\Omega \\) (or less) to \\( 10 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega \\) (or more).\n\nCritical: avoid attempting to measure \"the current of a voltage source\" by placing the meter across a wall plug; the same caution applies to ohms measurements. This is a frequent cause of damaged meters.\n\nExercise 1.7. What will a \\( 20,000 \\Omega / \\mathrm{V} \\) meter read on its 1 V scale when connected to a 1 V source with an internal resistance of 10 k? What will it read when connected to a \\( 10 \\mathrm{k} - 10 \\mathrm{k} \\) voltage divider driven by a \"stiff\" (zero source resistance) 1 V source?\n\nExercise 1.8. A \\( 50 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\) meter movement has an internal resistance of 5 k. What shunt resistance is required to convert it to a \\( 0-1 \\) A meter? What series resistance will convert it to a \\( 0-10 \\mathrm{~V} \\) meter?\n\nExercise 1.9. The very high internal resistance of digital multimeters in their voltage-measuring ranges can be exploited to measure extremely low currents (even though the DMM may not explicitly offer a low current range). For instance, suppose you wish to measure the tiny current flowing through a \\( 1000 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega \\) \"leakage\" resistance (a term used to describe a small current that ideally should be absent entirely, such as through the insulation of an underground cable). You have access to a standard DMM, whose 2 V dc range has \\( 10 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega \\) internal resistance, and a dc source of +10 V. How can you accurately measure the leakage resistance using what you have?\n\nExercise 1.10. For the circuit depicted in Figure 1.12, with \\( V_{\\text{in}} = 30 \\mathrm{~V} \\) and \\( R_{1} = R_{2} = 10 \\mathrm{k} \\), determine (a) the output voltage with no load attached (the open-circuit voltage); (b) the output voltage with a 10 k load (consider as a voltage divider, with \\( R_{2} \\) and \\( R_{\\text{load}} \\) combined into a single resistor); (c) the Thévenin equivalent circuit; (d) the same as in part (b), but using the Thévenin equivalent circuit [once, you wind up with a voltage divider; the answer should agree with the result in part (b)]; (e) the power dissipated in each of the resistors.\n\n#### A. Equivalent source resistance and circuit loading\n\nAs observed, a voltage divider powered by a fixed voltage is equivalent to a smaller voltage source in series with a resistor. For example, the output terminals of a \\( 10 \\mathrm{k} - 10 \\mathrm{k} \\) voltage divider driven by a perfect 30 volt battery are precisely equivalent to a perfect 15 volt battery in series with a 5 k resistor (Figure 1.13). Connecting a load resistor causes the voltage divider's output to drop due to the finite source resistance (Thévenin equivalent resistance of the voltage divider output, viewed as a voltage source). This is often undesirable. One solution to creating a stiff\nThévenin's theorem posits that any two-terminal network composed of resistors and voltage sources can be reduced to a single resistor \\( R \\) in series with a single voltage source \\( V \\).

Thévenin equivalent of a voltage divider.\nIt is evident from this example that a voltage divider is not a proficient battery, as its output voltage plummet when a load is connected.

Connecting a load resistor reduces the voltage divider's output due to the finite source resistance (Thévenin equivalent resistance of the voltage divider output, viewed as a source of voltage). This is often unwanted. One solution to creating a stiff voltage source might be to use smaller resistors in a voltage divider. However, it is generally better to construct a voltage source or power supply using active components such as transistors or operational amplifiers, which we will discuss in Chapters 2-4. In this manner, a voltage source with internal (Thévenin equivalent) resistance as low as milliohms can be easily created without the large currents and power dissipation of a low-resistance voltage divider delivering the same performance. Additionally, with an active power supply, it is easy to adjust the output voltage. These topics are extensively covered in Chapter 9.\n\nThe concept of equivalent internal resistance applies to various types of sources, not just batteries and voltage dividers. Signal sources (e.g., oscillators, amplifiers, and sensing devices) all have an equivalent internal resistance. Attaching a load with a resistance less than or similar to the internal resistance significantly reduces the output. This reduction in open-circuit voltage or signal by the load is known as \"circuit loading.\" Therefore, it is advisable to make $R_{\\text {load }} \\gg R_{\\text {internal }}$ since a high-resistance load has little attenuating effect on the source (Figure 1.14). ${ }^{15}$ We will encounter numerous circuit examples in the upcoming chapters. Ideally, a high-resistance load characterizes measuring instruments such as voltmeters and oscilloscopes.\n\nWhen discussing circuits, it is common to hear terms like \"the resistance looking into the voltage divider\" or \"the output sees a load of so-and-so many ohms,\" as if circuits had eyes. It's acceptable (and quite helpful) to clarify which part of the circuit is referred to when using such expressions. ${ }^{16}$\nimage_name:Figure 1.14\ndescription:The graph in Figure 1.14 is a dual-axis plot with the x-axis labeled as \\( R_{\\text{LOAD}} / R_{\\text{OUT}} \\), representing the ratio of load resistance to output resistance on a logarithmic scale ranging from 0.1 to 100. The left y-axis is labeled \\( V_{\\text{OUT}} / V_{\\text{OPEN}} \\), indicating the ratio of output voltage to open-circuit voltage, with a linear scale from 0 to 1. The right y-axis is labeled as \\( \\% \\text{Reduction from} \\, V_{\\text{OPEN}} \\), with a linear scale from 0 to 10%.\n\nThe graph shows two curves. The first curve, plotted against the left y-axis, starts low at \\( R_{\\text{LOAD}} / R_{\\text{OUT}} = 0.1 \\) with a value of about 0.2 and increases steadily, approaching a value close to 1 as \\( R_{\\text{LOAD}} / R_{\\text{OUT}} \\) reaches 100. This indicates that as the load resistance increases compared to the output resistance, the output voltage approaches the open-circuit voltage, minimizing attenuation.\n\nThe second curve, plotted against the right y-axis, shows the percentage reduction from the open-circuit voltage. It starts at a higher percentage when \\( R_{\\text{LOAD}} / R_{\\text{OUT}} \\) is low, decreases to a minimum around \\( R_{\\text{LOAD}} / R_{\\text{OUT}} = 10 \\), and then increases again, indicating that the percentage reduction in voltage is minimized when the load resistance is significantly larger than the output resistance.\n\nThe intersection point of the two curves occurs around \\( R_{\\text{LOAD}} / R_{\\text{OUT}} = 10 \\), where the percentage reduction is minimized, and the output voltage is approximately 0.7 of the open-circuit voltage. This point represents an optimal balance between load and output resistances for minimizing signal attenuation.\n\nFigure 1.14. To minimize the attenuation of a signal source below its open-circuit voltage, maintain the load resistance large compared to the output resistance.\n\n#### B. Power transfer\n\nConsider the intriguing question: What load resistance will yield maximum power transfer to the load for a given source resistance? (Terms such as source resistance, internal resistance, and Thévenin equivalent resistance are synonymous.) It is clear that either $R_{\\text {load }}=0$ or $R_{\\text {load }}=\\infty$ results in zero power transfer, as $R_{\\text {load }}=0$ implies $V_{\\text {load }}=0$ and $I_{\\text {load }}=V_{\\text {source }} / R_{\\text {source }}$, so $P_{\\text {load }}=V_{\\text {load }} I_{\\text {load }}=0$. But $R_{\\text {load }}=\\infty$ means that $V_{\\text {load }}=V_{\\text {source }}$ and $I_{\\text {load }}=0$, resulting in $P_{\\text {load }}=0$. There must be a maximum in between.\n\nExercise 1.11. Prove that $R_{\\text {load }}=R_{\\text {source }}$ maximizes the power in the load for a given source resistance. Note: Skip this exercise if you are unfamiliar with calculus, and accept the answer at face value.\n```"

This principle is particularly significant because it enables the replication of a complex arrangement of batteries and resistors using just one battery and resistor (refer to Figure 1.11). By the way, Norton's theorem proposes a similar concept, albeit using a current source in parallel with a resistor.\n\nDetermining the Thévenin equivalent resistance \\( R_{\\mathrm{Th}} \\) and voltage \\( V_{\\mathrm{Th}} \\) for a specific circuit is straightforward. \\( V_{\\mathrm{Th}} \\) represents the voltage across the Thévenin equivalent when no external circuit is connected; hence, it should correspond to the open-circuit voltage of the original circuit, whether obtained through calculation or measurement. To identify \\( R_{\\mathrm{Th}} \\), observe that the short-circuit current in the equivalent circuit is \\( V_{\\mathrm{Th}} / R_{\\mathrm{Th}} \\). This can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{\\mathrm{Th}} & =V(\\text { open circuit }), \\\\\nR_{\\mathrm{Th}} & =\\frac{V(\\text { open circuit })}{I(\\text { short circuit })} . \\tag{1.7}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nLet's utilize this approach to analyze a voltage divider, which inherently possesses a Thévenin equivalent:\n\n1. The open-circuit voltage is\n\n$$\nV=V_{\\text {in }} \\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} .\n$$\n\n2. The short-circuit current is\n\n$$\nV_{\\text {in }} / R_{1}\n$$\n\nConsequently, the Thévenin equivalent circuit comprises a voltage source,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\mathrm{Th}}=V_{\\mathrm{in}} \\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}, \\tag{1.8}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nfollowed by a resistor,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{\\mathrm{Th}}=\\frac{R_{1} R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} \\tag{1.9}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe parallel combination of \\( R_{1} \\) and \\( R_{2} \\) naturally results in this equivalent resistance value, and this will become clearer in subsequent explanations.\nimage_name:Figure 1.12\ndescription:\n[\n'name': 'R1', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'R1', 'ports': {'N1': 'Vin', 'N2': 'V1'\n'name': 'R2', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'R2', 'ports': {'N1': 'V1', 'N2': 'GND'\n'name': 'Rload', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'Rload', 'ports': {'N1': 'V1', 'N2': 'GND'\n'name': 'RTh', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'RTh', 'ports': {'N1': 'VTh', 'N2': 'V2'\n'name': 'Rload', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'Rload', 'ports': {'N1': 'V2', 'N2': 'GND'\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit diagram depicts the Thévenin equivalent of a voltage divider. Vin is the input voltage, and VTh is the Thévenin equivalent voltage. R1 and R2 form the original voltage divider, while RTh is the equivalent resistance that the load Rload encounters. The diagram illustrates how a voltage divider's output voltage is impacted upon the attachment of a load.\n\nFigure 1.12. Thévenin equivalent of a voltage divider.\nOne can easily deduce from this example that a voltage divider is not an ideal battery in terms of its ability to maintain output voltage when a load is connected. Consider Exercise 1.10 as an illustration. With this knowledge, you are equipped to precisely determine the extent to which the output voltage will decrease due to the presence of a specific load resistance: utilize the Thévenin equivalent circuit, connect the load, and calculate the new output, recognizing that the resultant circuit is essentially a voltage divider (Figure 1.12).\n\nExercise 1.10. For the circuit displayed in Figure 1.12, with \\( V_{\\text {in }}=30 \\mathrm{~V} \\) and \\( R_{1}=R_{2}=10 \\mathrm{k}\\Omega \\), determine (a) the output voltage when no load is connected (the open-circuit voltage); (b) the output voltage when a 10 k\\(\\Omega \\) load is attached (consider it as a voltage divider, with \\( R_{2} \\) and \\( R_{\\text {load }} \\) combined into a single resistor); (c) the Thévenin equivalent circuit; (d) as per part (b), but using the Thévenin equivalent circuit [again, this results in a voltage divider; the answer should align with the result in part (b)]; (e) the power dissipated in each resistor.\n\n#### MULTIMETERS\n\nA variety of instruments are available for measuring voltages and currents in circuits. The oscilloscope is the most versatile, enabling the visualization of voltage fluctuations over time at various points within a circuit. Logic probes and logic analyzers are specialized tools for debugging digital circuits. The basic multimeter is an effective method for measuring voltage, current, and resistance with precision, albeit it has a slower response time and cannot replace the oscilloscope when fluctuating voltages are of interest. Multimeters come in two types: those with a conventional scale and a moving pointer, and those equipped with a digital display.\n\nThe outdated VOM (volt-ohmmilliammeter) multimeter employs a meter movement that measures current (usually 50 microamperes full scale). (For a more detailed exploration of the inner workings of meter movements, consult a less design-focused electronics textbook.) To measure voltage, the VOM adds a resistor in series with the basic movement. For example, one type of VOM achieves a 1 V full-scale range by串联一个20 k\\(\\Omega \\)电阻与标准的50 microamperes movement; higher voltage ranges utilize correspondingly larger resistors. Such a VOM is described as \\( 20,000 \\Omega / \\mathrm{V} \\), indicating that it behaves like a resistor with a value of 20 k\\(\\Omega \\) multiplied by the full-scale voltage of the selected range. Full scale on any voltage range is \\( 1 / 20,000 \\) amps, or 50 microamperes. It is evident that these voltmeters have a lesser impact on a circuit at higher ranges, as they appear as higher resistances (consider the voltmeter as the lower leg of a voltage divider, with the Thévenin resistance of the circuit being measured as the upper resistor). Ideally, a voltmeter should possess infinite input resistance.\n\nMost modern multimeters utilize electronic amplification and exhibit an input resistance of \\( 10 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega \\) to \\( 1000 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega \\) when measuring voltage, with digital displays showcasing their results. Collectively referred to as digital multimeters (DMMs), these meters sometimes have very high input resistances at the most sensitive ranges, which drop to lower resistances at higher ranges. For example, you may typically observe an input resistance of \\( 10^9 \\Omega \\) on the 0.2 V and 2 V ranges, and \\( 10^7 \\Omega \\) on all other ranges. Carefully read the specifications! However, for most circuit measurements, these high input resistances produce negligible loading effects. In any case, the severity of the effect can be calculated using the voltage-divider equation. Typically, multimeters provide voltage ranges from 1 volt (or less) to a kilovolt (or more), full scale.\n\nMultimeters commonly incorporate the ability to measure current, with switchable ranges. Ideally, a current-measuring meter should have zero resistance to minimize disturbance to the circuit being tested, as it must be inserted in series with the circuit. Practically, a small voltage drop (referred to as \"voltage burden\") is tolerated with both VOMs and digital multimeters. When selecting a current range, a small resistor is placed across the meter's input terminals, typically chosen to create a voltage drop of 0.1 V to 0.25 V for the chosen full-scale current; the voltage drop is then converted to a corresponding current indication. Typically, multimeters offer current ranges from 50 microamperes (or less) to an ampere (or more), full scale.\n\nMultimeters also contain one or more batteries to power the resistance measurement function. By delivering a small current and measuring the voltage drop, they can assess resistance, with multiple ranges to accommodate values from 1 \\(\\Omega \\) (or less) to 10 \\(\\mathrm{M} \\Omega \\) (or more).\n\nImportant: do not attempt to measure \"the current of a voltage source\" by placing the meter across the wall plug; the same applies for ohms measurement. This is a common cause of meter failure.\n\nExercise 1.7. What will a \\( 20,000 \\Omega / \\mathrm{V} \\) meter read on its 1 V scale when attached to a 1 V source with an internal resistance of 10 k\\(\\Omega \\)? What will it read when attached to a \\( 10 \\mathrm{k}\\Omega -10 \\mathrm{k}\\Omega \\) voltage divider powered by a \"stiff\" (zero source resistance) 1 V source?\n\nExercise 1.8. A \\( 50 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\) meter movement has an internal resistance of 5 k\\(\\Omega \\). What shunt resistance is required to convert it into a \\( 0-1 \\) A meter? What series resistance is needed to convert it into a \\( 0-10 \\mathrm{~V} \\) meter?\n\nExercise 1.9. The exceptionally high internal resistance of digital multimeters in their voltage-measuring ranges allows for the measurement of extremely low currents, even if the DMM does not explicitly offer a low current range. Suppose, for instance, that you wish to measure the tiny current that flows through a \\( 1000 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega \\) \"leakage\" resistance (used to describe a small current that ideally should be absent, such as through the insulation of an underground cable). You have a standard DMM with a 2 V dc range that has \\( 10 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega \\) internal resistance, and you have access to a dc source of +10 V. How can you accurately measure the leakage resistance using what you have?\n\nExercise 1.10. To calculate the output voltage drop for a given load resistance: use the Thévenin equivalent circuit, attach a load, and calculate the new output, noting that the new circuit is nothing but a voltage divider (Figure 1.12).\n\nExercise 1.11. Prove that \\( R_{\\text {load }}=R_{\\text {source }} \\) maximizes the power transferred to the load for a given source resistance. Note: skip this exercise if you are not familiar with calculus, and accept the answer at face value.\n\nExercise 1.12. We would like to reiterate that circuits are typically designed such that the load resistance is significantly greater than the source resistance of the signal driving the load.\n```"

The oscilloscope is the most versatile, enabling the visualization of voltages versus time at one or more points in a circuit. Logic probes and logic analyzers are specialized tools for troubleshooting digital circuits. The simple multimeter offers a convenient method to measure voltage, current, and resistance, often with good precision; however, it responds slowly, making it unsuitable for tracking changing voltages, where an oscilloscope is essential. Multimeters come in two varieties: those that display measurements on a traditional scale with a moving pointer and those that use a digital display.\n\nThe traditional (and now largely obsolete) VOM (volt-ohmmilliammeter) multimeter employs a meter movement that measures current (typically \\( 50 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\) full scale). To measure voltage, the VOM incorporates a resistor in series with the basic movement. For example, one type of VOM achieves a 1 V (full-scale) range by placing a 20 k resistor in series with the standard \\( 50 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\) movement; higher voltage ranges use correspondingly larger resistors. Such a VOM is specified as \\( 20,000 \\Omega / \\mathrm{V} \\), indicating that it behaves like a resistor whose value is 20 k multiplied by the full-scale voltage of the specific range selected. Full scale on any voltage range is \\( 1 / 20,000 \\mathrm{amps} \\), or \\( 50 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\). It should be noted that one of these voltmeters disturbs a circuit less on a higher range, as it appears as a higher resistance (consider the voltmeter as the lower leg of a voltage divider, with the Thévenin resistance of the circuit being measured as the upper resistor). Ideally, a voltmeter should have infinite input resistance.\n\nMost modern multimeters utilize electronic amplification and possess an input resistance of \\( 10 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega \\) to \\( 1000 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega \\) when measuring voltage; they present their findings digitally and are collectively referred to as digital multimeters (DMMs). A word of caution: sometimes the input resistance of these meters is very high on the most sensitive ranges, decreasing to a lower resistance for the higher ranges. For instance, you might typically have an input resistance of \\( 10^{9} \\Omega \\) on the 0.2 V and 2 V ranges, and \\( 10^{7} \\Omega \\) on all higher ranges. Read the specifications carefully! However, for most circuit measurements, these high input resistances will produce negligible loading effects. In any case, it is easy to calculate the severity of the effect by using the voltage-divider equation. Typically, multimeters offer voltage ranges from a volt (or less) to a kilovolt (or more), full scale.\n\nA multimeter usually includes current-measuring capability, with a set of switchable ranges. Ideally, a current-measuring meter should have zero resistance to avoid disturbing the circuit under test, as it must be placed in series with the circuit. In practice, a few tenths of a volt drop (sometimes called \"voltage burden\") is tolerated with both VOMs and digital multimeters. For either type of meter, selecting a current range places a small resistor across the meter's input terminals, typically of a resistance value to create a voltage drop of 0.1 V to 0.25 V for the chosen full-scale current; the voltage drop is then converted to a corresponding current indication. Typically, multimeters provide current ranges from \\( 50 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\) (or less) to an amp (or more), full scale.\n\nMultimeters also contain one or more batteries to power the resistance measurement. By supplying a small current and measuring the voltage drop, they measure resistance, with several ranges to cover values from \\( 1 \\Omega \\) (or less) to \\( 10 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega \\) (or more).\n\nImportant: do not attempt to measure \"the current of a voltage source\" by connecting the meter across the wall plug; the same applies for ohms. This is a leading cause of blown-out meters.\n\nExercise 1.7. What will a \\( 20,000 \\Omega / \\mathrm{V} \\) meter read, on its 1 V scale, when connected to a 1 V source with an internal resistance of 10 k? What will it read when connected to a \\( 10 \\mathrm{k}-10 \\mathrm{k} \\) voltage divider driven by a \"stiff\" (zero source resistance) 1 V source?\n\nExercise 1.8. A \\( 50 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\) meter movement has an internal resistance of 5 k. What shunt resistance is needed to convert it to a \\( 0-1 \\) A meter? What series resistance will convert it to a \\( 0-10 \\mathrm{~V} \\) meter?\n\nExercise 1.9. The very high internal resistance of digital multimeters, in their voltage-measuring ranges, can be used to measure extremely low currents (even though the DMM may not offer a low current range explicitly). Suppose, for example, you want to measure the small current that flows through a \\( 1000 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega \\) \"leakage\" resistance (that term is used to describe a small current that ideally should be absent entirely, for example through the insulation of an underground cable). You have available a standard DMM, whose 2 V dc range has \\( 10 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega \\) internal resistance, and you have available a dc source of +10 V. How can you use what you've got to measure accurately the leakage resistance?\n\ndrop for a given load resistance: use the Thévenin equivalent circuit, attach a load, and calculate the new output, noting that the new circuit is nothing but a voltage divider (Figure 1.12).\n\nExercise 1.10. For the circuit shown in Figure 1.12, with \\( V_{\\text{in}} = 30 \\text{ V} \\) and \\( R_{1} = R_{2} = 10 \\text{ k} \\), find (a) the output voltage with no load attached (the open-circuit voltage); (b) the output voltage with a 10 k load (treat as a voltage divider, with \\( R_{2} \\) and \\( R_{\\text{load}} \\) combined into a single resistor); (c) the Thévenin equivalent circuit; (d) the same as in part (b), but using the Thévenin equivalent circuit [again, you wind up with a voltage divider; the answer should agree with the result in part (b)]; (e) the power dissipated in each of the resistors.\n\n#### A. Equivalent source resistance and circuit loading\n\nAs we have just seen, a voltage divider powered from some fixed voltage is equivalent to some smaller voltage source in series with a resistor. For example, the output terminals of a \\( 10 \\mathrm{k}-10 \\mathrm{k} \\) voltage divider driven by a perfect 30 volt battery are precisely equivalent to a perfect 15 volt battery in series with a 5 k resistor (Figure 1.13). Attaching a load resistor causes the voltage divider's output to drop, due to the finite source resistance (Thévenin equivalent resistance of the voltage divider output, viewed as a source of voltage). This is often undesirable. One solution to the problem of making a stiff voltage source (\"stiff\" is used in this context to describe something that doesn't bend under load) might be to use much smaller resistors in a voltage divider. Occasionally this brute-force approach is useful. However, it is usually best to construct a voltage source, or power supply, as it's commonly called, using active components like transistors or operational amplifiers, which we will treat in Chapters 2-4. In this way, you can easily make a voltage source with internal (Thévenin equivalent) resistance as small as milliohms (thousandths of an ohm), without the large currents and dissipation of power characteristic of a low-resistance voltage divider delivering the same performance. In addition, with an active power supply, it is easy to make the output voltage adjustable. These topics are treated extensively in Chapter 9.\n\nThe concept of equivalent internal resistance applies to all sorts of sources, not just batteries and voltage dividers. Signal sources (e.g., oscillators, amplifiers, and sensing devices) all have an equivalent internal resistance. Attaching a load whose resistance is less than or even comparable to the internal resistance will reduce the output considerably. This undesirable reduction of the open-circuit voltage (or signal) by the load is called \"circuit loading.\" Therefore, you should strive to make \\( R_{\\text{load}} \\gg R_{\\text{internal}} \\), because a high-resistance load has little attenuating effect on the source (Figure 1.14). We will see numerous circuit examples in the chapters ahead. This high-resistance condition ideally characterizes measuring instruments such as voltmeters and oscilloscopes.\n\nA word on language: you frequently hear things like \"the resistance looking into the voltage divider\" or \"the output sees a load of so-and-so many ohms,\" as if circuits had eyes. It's OK (in fact, it's a rather good way of keeping straight which resistance you're talking about) to say what part of the circuit is doing the \"looking.\"\n\nFigure 1.14. To minimize the attenuation of a signal source below its open-circuit voltage, keep the load resistance large compared with the output resistance.\n\n#### B. Power transfer\n\nHere is an interesting problem: what load resistance will result in maximum power being transferred to the load for a given source resistance? (The terms source resistance, internal resistance, and Thévenin equivalent resistance all mean the same thing.) It is easy to see that either \\( R_{\\text{load}} = 0 \\) or \\( R_{\\text{load}} = \\infty \\) results in zero power transferred, because \\( R_{\\text{load}} = 0 \\) means that \\( V_{\\text{load}} = 0 \\) and \\( I_{\\text{load}} = V_{\\text{source}} / R_{\\text{source}} \\), so that \\( P_{\\text{load}} = V_{\\text{load}} I_{\\text{load}} = 0 \\). But \\( R_{\\text{load}} = \\infty \\) means that \\( V_{\\text{load}} = V_{\\text{source}} \\) and \\( I_{\\text{load}} = 0 \\), so that again \\( P_{\\text{load}} = 0 \\). There has to be a maximum in between.\n\nExercise 1.11. Show that \\( R_{\\text{load}} = R_{\\text{source}} \\) maximizes the power in the load for a given source resistance. Note: skip this exercise if you don't know calculus, and take it on faith that the answer is true.\n\nLest this example leave the wrong impression, we would like to emphasize again that circuits are ordinarily designed so that the load resistance is much greater than the source resistance of the signal that drives the load."

    "text": "Thévenin's theorem asserts that any two-terminal network comprising resistors and voltage sources can be represented by a solitary resistor \\( R \\) in series with a single voltage source \\( V \\). This is striking, as even the most complex arrangements of batteries and resistors can be mimicked by just one battery and one resistor (refer to Figure 1.11). Furthermore, there exists a counterpart to this theorem, Norton's theorem, which states that the same simplification can be achieved with a current source in parallel with a resistor.\n\nDetermining the Thévenin equivalent resistance \\( R_{\\mathrm{Th}} \\) and voltage \\( V_{\\mathrm{Th}} \\) for a specific circuit is straightforward. \\( V_{\\mathrm{Th}} \\) corresponds to the open-circuit voltage of the Thévenin equivalent circuit; hence, if two circuits behave identically, this must also be the open-circuit voltage of the original circuit, which can be calculated if the circuit's details are known, or measured if they are not. To find \\( R_{\\mathrm{Th}} \\), observe that the short-circuit current of the equivalent circuit is \\( V_{\\mathrm{Th}} / R_{\\mathrm{Th}} \\). This translates to:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{\\mathrm{Th}} &= V(\\text{open circuit}), \\\\\nR_{\\mathrm{Th}} &= \\frac{V(\\text{open circuit})}{I(\\text{short circuit})}. \\tag{1.7}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nLet's apply this approach to the voltage divider, which also has a Thévenin equivalent:\n\n1. The open-circuit voltage is\n\\[\nV = V_{\\text{in}} \\frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}.\n\\]\n\n2. The short-circuit current is\n\\[\n\\frac{V_{\\text{in}}}{R_1}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the Thévenin equivalent circuit consists of a voltage source,\n\\[\nV_{\\mathrm{Th}} = V_{\\text{in}} \\frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}, \\tag{1.8}\n\\]\nin series with a resistor,\n\\[\nR_{\\mathrm{Th}} = \\frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2}. \\tag{1.9}\n\\]\n\nThis is no coincidence, as this resistor value happens to be the parallel resistance of \\( R_1 \\) and \\( R_2 \\), a fact that will be further elucidated later.\n\nFigure 1.12 depicts the Thévenin equivalent of a voltage divider. Here, \\( V_{\\text{in}} \\) represents the input voltage, and \\( V_{\\mathrm{Th}} \\) is the Thévenin equivalent voltage. \\( R_1 \\) and \\( R_2 \\) constitute the original voltage divider, whereas \\( R_{\\mathrm{Th}} \\) is the equivalent resistance as perceived by the load \\( R_{\\text{load}} \\). The diagram illustrates how a voltage divider's output voltage is influenced when a load is connected.\n\nIt's evident from this example that a voltage divider does not act as a reliable battery since its output voltage significantly drops when a load is attached. As an instance, consider Exercise 1.10. With the knowledge acquired, you can now precisely calculate the output voltage drop for a specified load resistance using the Thévenin equivalent circuit. Attach a load and compute the new output, recognizing that the new circuit is fundamentally a voltage divider (refer to Figure 1.12).\n\n#### MULTIMETERS\n\nMany instruments are available for measuring voltages and currents within a circuit. The oscilloscope stands out as the most versatile, allowing visualization of voltage versus time at one or more points in a circuit. Logic probes and logic analyzers are specialized tools for debugging digital circuits. The humble multimeter offers a convenient method for measuring voltage, current, and resistance, often with considerable precision, although it responds slowly and hence cannot substitute for an oscilloscope in scenarios involving fluctuating voltages. Multimeters come in two types: those with a moving pointer on a conventional scale and those with a digital display.\n\nThe vintage VOM (volt-ohmmilliammeter) multimeter, now largely obsolete, employs a meter movement that measures current (usually \\( 50 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\) full scale). To measure voltage, the VOM incorporates a resistor in series with the basic movement. For example, one type of VOM achieves a 1 V (full-scale) range by placing a \\( 20 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega \\) resistor in series with the standard \\( 50 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\) movement; higher voltage ranges utilize proportionally larger resistors. Such a VOM is specified as \\( 20,000 \\Omega / \\mathrm{V} \\), implying that it behaves like a resistor whose value is \\( 20 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega \\) multiplied by the full-scale voltage of the chosen range. The full scale on any voltage range is \\( 1 / 20,000 \\mathrm{amps} \\), or \\( 50 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\). It's apparent that one of these voltmeters disturbs a circuit less on a higher range because it presents a higher resistance (consider the voltmeter as the lower leg of a voltage divider, with the Thévenin resistance of the measured circuit as the upper resistor). Ideally, a voltmeter should have infinite input resistance.\n\nMost modern multimeters employ electronic amplification and exhibit an input resistance of \\( 10 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega \\) to \\( 1000 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega \\) when measuring voltage; they present their findings digitally and are collectively known as digital multimeters (DMMs). A word of caution: the input resistance of these meters can be very high on the most sensitive ranges, decreasing to a lower resistance for higher ranges. For example, you might typically encounter an input resistance of \\( 10^9 \\Omega \\) on the 0.2 V and 2 V ranges, and \\( 10^7 \\Omega \\) on all higher ranges. Carefully read the specifications! However, for most circuit measurements, these high input resistances will yield negligible loading effects. In any event, it's straightforward to calculate the severity of the effect using the voltage-divider equation. Generally, multimeters offer voltage ranges from a volt (or less) to a kilovolt (or more), full scale.\n\nA multimeter typically includes current-measuring functionality, complete with switchable ranges. Ideally, a current-measuring meter should have zero resistance to avoid disturbing the circuit under test, as it must be placed in series with the circuit. In practice, a small voltage drop (sometimes referred to as \"voltage burden\") of a few tenths of a volt is tolerated with both VOMs and digital multimeters. For either type of meter, selecting a current range places a small resistor across the meter's input terminals, typically of a resistance value that generates a voltage drop of 0.1 V to 0.25 V for the chosen full-scale current; this voltage drop is then translated into a corresponding current reading. Typically, multimeters provide current ranges from \\( 50 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\) (or less) to an amp (or more), full scale.\n\nMultimeters also contain one or more batteries to power the resistance measurement. By supplying a small current and measuring the voltage drop, they calculate resistance, with several ranges to cover values from \\( 1 \\Omega \\) (or less) to \\( 10 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega \\) (or more).\n\nCaution: do not attempt to measure \"the current of a voltage source\" by connecting the meter across a wall outlet; the same warning applies to ohm measurements. This is a common cause of damaged meters.\n\n#### A. Equivalent source resistance and circuit loading\n\nAs discussed, a voltage divider driven by a fixed voltage is analogous to a smaller voltage source in series with a resistor. For instance, the output terminals of a \\( 10 \\mathrm{k}-10 \\mathrm{k} \\) voltage divider powered by a perfect 30-volt battery are precisely equivalent to a perfect 15-volt battery in series with a \\( 5 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega \\) resistor (refer to Figure 1.13). Connecting a load resistor causes the voltage divider's output to decline due to the finite source resistance (Thévenin equivalent resistance of the voltage divider output, regarded as a voltage source). This is often undesirable. One solution to creating a stiff voltage source (\"stiff\" in this context refers to something that doesn't yield under load) might involve using much smaller resistors in a voltage divider. Occasionally, this straightforward approach is effective. However, it's generally preferable to construct a voltage source, or power supply, using active components like transistors or operational amplifiers, which will be covered in Chapters 2-4. This method allows for the creation of a voltage source with an internal (Thévenin equivalent) resistance as low as milliohms, without the substantial currents and power dissipation associated with a low-resistance voltage divider delivering similar performance. Moreover, with an active power supply, it's easy to make the output voltage adjustable. These topics are explored in detail in Chapter 9.\n\nThe concept of equivalent internal resistance applies to all sorts of sources, not just batteries and voltage dividers. Signal sources (e.g., oscillators, amplifiers, and sensing devices) all possess an equivalent internal resistance. Connecting a load with a resistance less than or comparable to the internal resistance will significantly reduce the output. This unwanted reduction of the open-circuit voltage (or signal) by the load is known as \"circuit loading.\" Therefore, it is advisable to ensure \\( R_{\\text{load}} \\gg R_{\\text{internal}} \\), as a high-resistance load minimizes the attenuating effect on the source (refer to Figure 1.14). Numerous circuit examples will be presented in the following chapters. This high-resistance condition ideally characterizes measuring instruments like voltmeters and oscilloscopes.\n\nRegarding terminology: it's common to hear phrases such as \"the resistance looking into the voltage divider\" or \"the output sees a load of so-and-so many ohms,\" implying that circuits possess sight. It's acceptable (and actually a helpful way to keep track of which resistance is being discussed) to specify which part of the circuit is doing the \"observing.\"\n\nFigure 1.14 demonstrates that to minimize the attenuation of a signal source below its open-circuit voltage, the load resistance should be much larger compared to the output resistance.\n\n#### B. Power transfer\n\nAn intriguing question arises: what load resistance will result in maximum power transfer to the load for a given source resistance? (The terms source resistance, internal resistance, and Thévenin equivalent resistance are synonymous.) It's clear that either \\( R_{\\text{load}} = 0 \\) or \\( R_{\\text{load}} = \\infty \\) yields zero power transfer, because \\( R_{\\text{load}} = 0 \\) implies \\( V_{\\text{load}} = 0 \\) and \\( I_{\\text{load}} = V_{\\text{source}} / R_{\\text{source}} \\), resulting in \\( P_{\\text{load}} = V_{\\text{load}} I_{\\text{load}} = 0 \\). Conversely, \\( R_{\\text{load}} = \\infty \\) means \\( V_{\\text{load}} = V_{\\text{source}} \\) and \\( I_{\\text{load}} = 0 \\), again leading to \\( P_{\\text{load}} = 0 \\). A maximum must exist between these extremes.\n\nExercise 1.11. Prove that \\( R_{\\text{load}} = R_{\\text{source}} \\) maximizes the power in the load for a given source resistance. Note: skip this exercise if you're unfamiliar with calculus and accept the answer as accurate.\n\nIt's important to reiterate that circuits are typically designed such that the load resistance is significantly greater than the source resistance of the signal driving the load."

    "text": "We frequently encounter electronic devices where the current $I$ is not directly proportional to the voltage $V$. In such scenarios, discussing resistance is less meaningful because the ratio $V / I$ varies with $V$, rather than remaining a constant independent of $V$. For these devices, it is often more insightful to consider the slope of the $V-I$ curve, which is the ratio of a minor change in applied voltage to the corresponding change in current through the device, denoted as $\\Delta V / \\Delta I$ (or $d V / d I$). This measure, possessing units of resistance (ohms), serves as a substitute for resistance in various calculations and is termed the small-signal resistance, incremental resistance, or dynamic resistance.\n\n#### A. Zener Diodes\n\nAn illustrative example is the zener diode, characterized by the $I-V$ curve depicted in Figure 1.15. Zener diodes are utilized to maintain a constant voltage within a circuit by supplying them with a roughly constant current derived from a higher voltage within the circuit. For instance, the zener diode in Figure 1.15 transforms an applied current within a specified range into a slightly narrower range of voltages. Understanding how the resulting zener voltage changes with the applied current is crucial, as it gauges the diode's \"regulation\" against variations in the driving current. The dynamic resistance of a zener diode, specified at a particular current, is a key specification. For example, a zener diode might have a dynamic resistance of $10 \\Omega$ at 10 mA, at its designated zener voltage of 5 V. By the definition of dynamic resistance, a $10 \\%$ change in applied current leads to a voltage change of\n\n$$\n\\Delta V=R_{\\mathrm{dyn}} \\Delta I=10 \\times 0.1 \\times 0.01=10 \\mathrm{mV}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\Delta V / V=0.002=0.2 \\%\n$$\n\nThis demonstrates the diode's effective voltage-regulating capability. In such applications, the zener current is often sourced through a resistor from a higher voltage available in the circuit, as illustrated in Figure 1.16.\nimage_name:Figure 1.15. I-V curves: A.

Thus, for voltage changes, the circuit acts like a voltage divider, with the zener replaced by a resistor equal to its dynamic resistance at the operating current. This illustrates the utility of incremental resistance. For example, consider a circuit with an input voltage ranging from 15 to 20 V, using a 1 N 4733 (5.1 V, 1 W zener diode) to generate a stable 5.1 V power supply. Choosing $R=300 \\Omega$ results in a maximum zener current of 50 mA: $(20 \\mathrm{~V}-5.1 \\mathrm{~V}) / 300 \\Omega$. Knowing the zener's specified maximum dynamic resistance is $7.0 \\Omega$ at 50 mA, we can estimate the output-voltage regulation. The zener current varies from 50 mA to 33 mA over the input-voltage range, causing a 17 mA change in current, which in turn produces a 0.12 V change in output voltage: $\\Delta V=R_{\\mathrm{dyn}} \\Delta I$.\n\nA useful fact about zener diodes is that their dynamic resistance varies roughly inversely with current. Additionally, there are ICs designed to replace zener diodes, known as \"two-terminal voltage references,\" offering superior performance with much lower dynamic resistance (less than $1 \\Omega$ even at 0.1 mA, a thousand times better than the zener used here) and excellent temperature stability (better than $0.01 \\% / \\mathrm{C}$). These will be discussed further in $\\S \\S 2.2 .4$ and 9.10.\n\nIn practical applications, a zener diode provides better regulation when driven by a current source, which has an incremental resistance of $R_{\\text {incr }}=\\infty$ (delivering the same current regardless of voltage). However, current sources are more complex, so we often use resistors instead. It's important to note that low-voltage zener diodes (e.g., 3.3 V) exhibit poor voltage constancy with current variations (Figure 1.17). If a low-voltage zener is needed, a two-terminal reference should be used instead (§9.10)."

    "text": "We frequently encounter electronic devices where the current $I$ is not directly proportional to the voltage $V$. In such scenarios, discussing resistance is less meaningful because the ratio $V / I$ varies with $V$ rather than remaining a constant independent of $V$. For these devices, it is often more informative to consider the slope of the $V-I$ curve, which is the ratio of a small change in voltage to the corresponding change in current, denoted as $\\Delta V / \\Delta I$ (or $d V / d I$). This parameter, having units of resistance (ohms), serves as a substitute for resistance in many calculations and is known as the small-signal resistance, incremental resistance, or dynamic resistance.\n\n#### A. Zener Diodes\n\nConsider the zener diode as an example, with its $I-V$ curve depicted in Figure 1.15. Zener diodes are employed to maintain a constant voltage within a circuit by supplying them with a roughly constant current from a higher voltage source within the circuit. For instance, the zener diode in Figure 1.15 transforms an applied current within a specified range into a corresponding, albeit slightly narrower, range of voltages. Understanding how the zener voltage changes with the applied current is crucial, as it measures the diode's \"regulation\" against variations in the driving current. The dynamic resistance of a zener diode, specified at a particular current, is included in its specifications. For example, a zener diode might have a dynamic resistance of $10 \\Omega$ at 10 mA, at its designated zener voltage of 5 V. Using the definition of dynamic resistance, a $10 \\%$ change in applied current results in a voltage change of\n\n$$\n\\Delta V = R_{\\mathrm{dyn}} \\Delta I = 10 \\times 0.1 \\times 0.01 = 10 \\mathrm{mV}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\Delta V / V = 0.002 = 0.2 \\%\n$$\n\nThis demonstrates the diode's effective voltage-regulating capability. In such applications, the zener current is often obtained through a resistor from a higher voltage available in the circuit, as illustrated in Figure 1.16.\n\nZener diodes belong to the broader category of diodes and rectifiers, which are significant devices discussed later in the chapter (§1.6) and throughout the book. An ideal diode acts as a perfect conductor for current flowing in one direction and a perfect insulator for current flowing in the opposite direction, functioning as a \"one-way valve\" for current.\n\n**Figure 1.15.

Thus, for voltage variations, the circuit acts like a voltage divider, with the zener replaced by a resistor equal to its dynamic resistance at the operating current. This exemplifies the utility of incremental resistance. For instance, in the preceding circuit, if the input voltage ranges between 15 and 20 V and a 1 N 4733 (5.1 V, 1 W zener diode) is used to generate a stable 5.1 V power supply, choosing $R=300 \\Omega$ results in a maximum zener current of 50 mA: $(20 \\mathrm{~V}-5.1 \\mathrm{~V}) / 300 \\Omega$. We can estimate the output-voltage regulation (variation in output voltage) knowing this zener has a specified maximum dynamic resistance of $7.0 \\Omega$ at 50 mA. The zener current varies from 50 mA to 33 mA over the input-voltage range, causing a voltage change at the output of $\\Delta V=R_{\\mathrm{dyn}} \\Delta I$, or 0.12 V.\n\nIt's noteworthy that the dynamic resistance of a zener diode varies approximately inversely with current. Additionally, there are ICs designed to replace zener diodes; these \"two-terminal voltage references\" offer superior performance with much lower dynamic resistance (less than $1 \\Omega$, even at currents as low as 0.1 mA; a thousand times better than the zener just discussed) and excellent temperature stability (better than $0.01 \\% / \\mathrm{C}$). We will delve deeper into zeners and voltage references in $\\S \\S 2.2 .4$ and 9.10.\n\nIn practical applications, a zener diode provides better regulation when driven by a current source, which has, by definition, $R_{\\text {incr }}=\\infty$ (delivering the same current regardless of voltage). However, current sources are more complex, so we often rely on resistors. When considering zener diodes, it's important to remember that low-voltage units (e.g., 3.3 V) exhibit poor performance in terms of voltage constancy versus current (Figure 1.17). If a low-voltage zener is needed, it's advisable to use a two-terminal reference instead (§9.10)."

This parameter, measured in ohms, serves as a substitute for resistance in many calculations and is known as the small-signal resistance, incremental resistance, or dynamic resistance.\n\n#### A. Zener Diodes\n\nTake the zener diode as an example, with its \\(I-V\\) curve depicted in Figure 1.15. Zener diodes are utilized to maintain a constant voltage within a circuit by supplying them with a roughly constant current from a higher voltage source within the circuit. For instance, the zener diode shown in Figure 1.15 transforms an applied current within a specified range into a corresponding, albeit slightly narrower, range of voltages. Understanding how the zener voltage changes with the applied current is crucial, as it measures the diode's regulation against variations in the driving current.

Thus, for voltage changes, the circuit behaves like a voltage divider, with the zener replaced by a resistor equal to its dynamic resistance at the operating current. This demonstrates the utility of incremental resistance. For example, if the input voltage ranges between 15 and 20 V, and a 1N4733 (5.1 V, 1 W zener diode) is used to generate a stable 5.1 V power supply, choosing \\(R = 300 \\Omega\\) results in a maximum zener current of 50 mA: \\((20 \\text{ V} - 5.1 \\text{ V}) / 300 \\Omega\\). Knowing the zener's specified maximum dynamic resistance of \\(7.0 \\Omega\\) at 50 mA, the zener current varies from 50 mA to 33 mA over the input voltage range, producing a voltage change at the output of \\(\\Delta V = R_{\\mathrm{dyn}} \\Delta I\\), or 0.12 V.\n\nA useful fact about zener diodes is that their dynamic resistance varies roughly inversely with current. Additionally, there are ICs designed to replace zener diodes, known as \"two-terminal voltage references,\" which offer superior performance with much lower dynamic resistance (less than \\(1 \\Omega\\) even at 0.1 mA) and excellent temperature stability (better than \\(0.01\\% / \\text{C}\\)). More on zeners and voltage references will be covered in §§ 2.2.4 and 9.10.\n\nIn practical applications, a zener diode provides better regulation when driven by a current source, which has an infinite incremental resistance (constant current regardless of voltage). However, current sources are more complex, so resistors are often used instead. It's important to note that low-voltage zener diodes (e.g., 3.3 V) exhibit poor voltage constancy versus current (Figure 1.17); in such cases, a two-terminal reference is preferable (§9.10)."

Zener Regulator**\ndescription: This circuit is a basic Zener diode voltage regulator. The resistor R limits the current through the Zener diode, and the diode maintains a stable output voltage Vout.\n\nThen,\n\n$$\nI = \\frac{V_{\\text{in}} - V_{\\text{out}}}{R}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\Delta I = \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{in}} - \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{out}}}{R}\n$$\n\nso\n\n$$\n\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{out}} = R_{\\mathrm{dyn}} \\Delta I = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{dyn}}}{R} \\left(\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{in}} - \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{out}}\\right)\n$$\n\nand finally\n\n$$\n\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{out}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{dyn}}}{R + R_{\\mathrm{dyn}}} \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{in}}\n$$\n\nAha - the voltage-divider equation again! Thus, for voltage changes, the circuit behaves like a voltage divider, with the zener replaced by a resistor equal to its dynamic resistance at the operating current. This demonstrates the utility of incremental resistance. For instance, suppose we have an input voltage ranging between 15 and 20 V and use a 1N4733 (5.1 V, 1 W zener diode) to generate a stable 5.1 V power supply. We choose $R = 300 \\Omega$ for a maximum zener current of 50 mA: $(20 \\mathrm{~V} - 5.1 \\mathrm{~V}) / 300 \\Omega$. Knowing this zener has a specified maximum dynamic resistance of $7.0 \\Omega$ at 50 mA, we can estimate the output-voltage regulation. The zener current varies from 50 mA to 33 mA over the input-voltage range; this 17 mA change in current produces a voltage change at the output of $\\Delta V = R_{\\mathrm{dyn}} \\Delta I$, or 0.12 V.\n\nIt's useful to know that the dynamic resistance of a zener diode varies roughly inversely with current. Additionally, there are ICs designed to replace zener diodes, known as \"two-terminal voltage references,\" which offer superior performance with much lower dynamic resistance (less than $1 \\Omega$ even at currents as low as 0.1 mA, a thousand times better than the zener used here) and excellent temperature stability (better than $0.01 \\% / \\mathrm{C}$). We will discuss zeners and voltage references further in §§ 2.2.4 and 9.10.\n\nIn practical applications, a zener diode provides better regulation when driven by a current source, which has an infinite incremental resistance ($R_{\\text{incr}} = \\infty$), ensuring constant current regardless of voltage. However, since current sources are more complex, we often use resistors instead. When considering zener diodes, it's important to note that low-voltage units (e.g., 3.3 V) exhibit poor voltage constancy versus current (Figure 1.17); if a low-voltage zener is needed, a two-terminal reference should be used instead (§9.10)."

The temperature sensor is $R_{4}$, whose resistance decreases by approximately $4 \\% /{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ and is $10 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$ at $25^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. Consequently, we've positioned it as the lower segment of a voltage divider $\\left(R_{3} R_{4}\\right)$, with its output compared to the temperature-independent divider $R_{1} R_{2}$. When the temperature surpasses $30^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, point \"X\" exhibits a lower voltage than point \"Y,\" prompting the comparator to draw its output to ground.\n\nAt the output, an LED, which electrically mimics a 1.6 V zener diode, lights up when current flows through it. Its lower terminal then sits at $5 \\mathrm{~V}-1.6 \\mathrm{~V}$, or +3.4 V. To manage this, we've incorporated a series resistor, calculated to permit 5 mA when the comparator output is at ground: $R_{5}=3.4 \\mathrm{~V} / 5 \\mathrm{~mA}$, equating to $680 \\Omega$.\n\nFor added flexibility, you could make the setpoint adjustable by substituting $R_{2}$ with a 5 k potentiometer in series with a 5 k fixed resistor. Later, we'll discuss the benefits of adding hysteresis to ensure the comparator's decisiveness. It's worth noting that this circuit is unaffected by precise power supply voltage variations due to its reliance on ratio comparisons. Ratiometric techniques are highly effective, and we'll encounter them again in future discussions.\n\nimage_name:Figure 1.17\ndescription:The graph illustrates an I-V (Current vs. Voltage) relationship, showcasing the behavior of various zener diodes and voltage references. The x-axis measures Voltage from 0 to 6 volts, while the y-axis measures Current in milliamperes (mA) from 0 to 10 mA.\n\nFeatured in the graph are several component curves:\n- **1.25V reference**: Indicated by a vertical dashed line at 1.25 volts, signifying a stable voltage reference.\n- **2.4V zener**: This curve steeply rises just past 2 volts, exemplifying the zener breakdown characteristic of a 2.4V zener diode.\n- **2.50V reference**: Another vertical dashed line at 2.5 volts, marking another stable voltage reference.\n- **3.3V zener**: The curve for this zener diode begins its steep ascent around 3 volts, akin to the 2.4V zener but at a higher voltage.\n- **5.6V zener**: This diode shows a sharp current increase just after 5 volts, indicating its breakdown voltage is around 5.6 volts.\n\nThe graph effectively highlights how each zener diode experiences a sudden current surge at its specific breakdown voltage, illustrating the zener effect. The reference lines, in contrast, display stable voltage levels without such abrupt current increases. This plot clearly differentiates the performance and traits of low-voltage zeners and voltage references, with the zeners' steeper curves underscoring their utility in voltage regulation.\n\nFigure 1.17. Low-voltage zeners are notably inadequate, as evidenced by these measured $I$ vs. $V$ curves (for three models from the 1N522167 series), especially when compared to the superior performance of a pair of \"IC voltage references\" (LM385Z-1.2 and LM385Z-2.5, see $\\S 9.10$ and Table 9.7). However, zener diodes around 6 V (such as the 5.6 V 1 N 5232 B or 6.2 V 1N5234B) display impressively steep curves and are valuable components."

Decibels\n\nWhen comparing the relative amplitudes of two signals, you might state that signal $X$ is twice the size of signal $Y$. This is straightforward and useful in many contexts. However, due to the frequent handling of vast ratios, a logarithmic measure is preferable, introducing the decibel (one-tenth of a bel, a unit rarely used). By definition, the ratio of two signals in decibels (dB) is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{dB}=10 \\log _{10} \\frac{P_{2}}{P_{1}} \\tag{1.11}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ denote the power in the two signals. For signal amplitudes, particularly those with identical waveforms, the ratio can be expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{dB}=20 \\log _{10} \\frac{A_{2}}{A_{1}} \\tag{1.12}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwith $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ being the signal amplitudes. For example, a signal with double the amplitude of another is +6 dB relative to it, since $\\log _{10} 2=0.3010$. A signal ten times larger is +20 dB, while one ten times smaller is -20 dB.\n\nThough decibels typically measure the ratio between two signals, they can also serve as an absolute amplitude measure. This involves assuming a reference signal level and expressing other levels in decibels relative to it. Several standard reference levels, though unstated, are commonly understood, including (a) $0 \\mathrm{dBV}(1 \\mathrm{Vms})$; (b) 0 dBm (the voltage corresponding to 1 mW into a presumed load impedance, usually $50 \\Omega$ for radiofrequencies and $600 \\Omega$ for audio, resulting in 0.22 V rms and 0.78 V rms respectively); and (c) the minor noise voltage a resistor generates at room temperature (discussed in §8.1.1). Additional reference amplitudes are used in various engineering and scientific fields. For instance, in acoustics, 0 dB SPL (sound pressure level) corresponds to an rms pressure of $20 \\mu \\mathrm{~Pa}$ ($2 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{~atm}$); in audio communications, levels may be expressed in dBrnC (relative noise reference weighted by \"curve C\"). When stating amplitudes this way, clarity about the 0 dB reference amplitude is crucial; specify it, such as \"an amplitude of 27 decibels relative to 1 V rms,\" or abbreviate to \"27 dB re $1 \\mathrm{~V} \\mathrm{rms,\"}$ or define a term like \"dBV.\"19\n\nFor a sinewave, the relationship is $V_{\\mathrm{avg}}=V_{\\mathrm{rms}} / 1.11$.

A detailed discussion of noise and low-noise techniques will be provided in Chapter 8.\n\n#### D. Square wave\n\nA square wave signal varies over time, as shown in Figure 1.23, and is characterized by amplitude and frequency (and possibly phase). In linear circuits, a square wave input rarely results in a square wave output. For square waves, the peak amplitude and the root mean square (rms) amplitude are identical.\n\n#### E. Pulses\n\nA pulse signal, exemplified in Figure 1.25, is defined by its amplitude and pulse width. Periodic pulses can be generated, allowing for discussion of frequency or pulse repetition rate and the \"duty cycle,\" which is the ratio of pulse width to repetition period (ranging from 0% to 100%). Pulses can have positive or negative polarity and can be \"positive-going\" or \"negative-going.\" For example, the second pulse in Figure 1.25 is a negative-going pulse of positive polarity.\n\n#### F. Steps and spikes\n\nSteps and spikes are frequently discussed signal types, though less commonly used in practice. They offer a useful means of describing circuit behavior. If depicted, they would resemble the example in Figure 1.26. The step function is a component of a square wave, while the spike represents a fleeting, very short-duration jump."

B\ndescription:The graph depicted in Figure 1.20 B is a time-domain waveform known as a 'Ramp with Limit.' It is characterized by a linear increase in value followed by a sudden drop back to the initial level, forming a repetitive pattern. This waveform resembles a sawtooth wave but with a noticeable limit at its peak, after which it abruptly resets.\n\n1. **Type of Graph and Function:** This is a time-domain waveform graph illustrating a ramp function with a limiting reset point, similar to a sawtooth wave but with a distinct peak limit.\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:** The horizontal axis represents time, while the vertical axis represents amplitude or voltage.

The waveform does not display any inflection points or gradual transitions, emphasizing the abruptness of the reset.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:** There are no specific annotations, markers, or numerical values on the graph, suggesting a theoretical representation focusing on the fundamental behavior of the waveform rather than precise measurements.\nimage_name:Figure 1.20. C\ndescription:### Type of Graph and Function:\nThe graph depicted is a time-domain waveform representing a sawtooth wave. This type of waveform is characterized by a linear rise over time followed by a sudden drop, repeating periodically.\n\nAxes Labels and Units:\nThe horizontal axis represents time, though it is not explicitly labeled in the image. The vertical axis represents amplitude or voltage, also not labeled. Both axes appear to use a linear scale.\n\nOverall Behavior and Trends:\nThe sawtooth wave shown has a consistent, repeating pattern.

Noise\ndescription:The graph labeled as \"Figure 1.22. Noise\" depicts a time-domain waveform representing noise. The horizontal axis is labeled 't', indicating time, while the vertical axis is labeled 'V', representing voltage. The graph does not specify units or scales for these axes, suggesting a theoretical or conceptual representation of noise rather than a precise measurement.\n\nIn terms of overall behavior, the waveform exhibits a random, irregular pattern typical of noise signals. There are no discernible periodic trends or repeating patterns, which is characteristic of noise. The amplitude fluctuates erratically above and below the zero-voltage line, indicating a mixture of positive and negative voltages over time.\n\nKey features of the graph include numerous peaks and valleys throughout the waveform, but without any specific annotations or numerical values provided, it is difficult to quantify these features. The waveform appears to be a visual representation of band-limited white Gaussian noise, as described in the context, where the power per hertz is equal across a certain frequency band, and the amplitude distribution follows a Gaussian curve.\n\nThere are no specific markers, gridlines, or reference lines on the graph, emphasizing its role as an illustrative example of noise rather than a detailed analytical tool. The lack of annotations suggests that the focus is on understanding the general behavior and appearance of noise in a signal rather than analyzing specific data points.\n\nFigure 1.22. Noise.\nfrequency spectrum (power per hertz) or by their amplitude distribution. One of the most common kind of noise is band-limited white Gaussian noise, which means a signal with equal power per hertz in some band of frequencies and that exhibits a Gaussian (bell-shaped) distribution of amplitudes when many instantaneous measurements of its amplitude are made. This kind of noise is generated by a resistor (Johnson noise or Nyquist noise), and it plagues sensitive measurements of all kinds. On an oscilloscope it appears as shown in Figure 1.22. We will discuss noise and low-noise techniques in considerable detail in Chapter 8.\n\n#### D. Square wave\n\nA square wave is a signal that varies in time as shown in Figure 1.23. Like the sinewave, it is characterized by amplitude and frequency (and perhaps phase). A linear circuit driven by a square wave rarely responds with a square wave. For a square wave, the peak amplitude and the rms amplitude are the same.\nimage_name:Figure 1.23. Square wave\ndescription:The graph in Figure 1.23 represents a square wave signal plotted over time. The horizontal axis is labeled 't' which stands for time, and the vertical axis is labeled 'A' representing amplitude. The time axis is marked with fractions of the signal's period, specifically \\( \\frac{1}{2f} \\), \\( \\frac{1}{f} \\), \\( \\frac{2}{f} \\), and \\( \\frac{3}{f} \\), where \\( f \\) is the frequency of the square wave.\n\nThe square wave alternates between two amplitude levels symmetrically around zero. It has a constant amplitude of \\( A \\) and switches between the positive and negative amplitude levels at regular intervals, creating a series of rectangular pulses. Each complete cycle of the square wave consists of a high level for half the period and a low level for the other half, demonstrating a 50% duty cycle.\n\nThe transitions between the high and low states are vertical lines, indicating instantaneous changes in amplitude, which is characteristic of an ideal square wave. However, in practical scenarios, these transitions would have finite rise and fall times.\n\nOverall, the graph shows a periodic waveform with sharp transitions, illustrating the fundamental characteristics of a square wave signal in the time domain.\n\nFigure 1.23. Square wave.\nimage_name:Figure 1.24. Rise time of a step waveform.\ndescription:The graph depicted in Figure 1.24 is a time-domain waveform illustrating the rise time of a step waveform. The x-axis represents time, while the y-axis represents amplitude, both in arbitrary units. The graph is linear in both axes, showing a single transition from a low to a high state.\n\nThe waveform begins at a stable low amplitude, marked as 0%, and transitions to a high amplitude, marked as 100%. The rise time, denoted as \\( t_r \\), is defined as the interval during which the amplitude rises from 10% to 90% of its maximum value. This is indicated by dashed horizontal lines at the 10% and 90% levels, with a vertical line marking the rise time interval.\n\nThe waveform exhibits a smooth, S-shaped curve during the rise, indicating a finite rise time typical of real-world electronic signals. This curve suggests that the transition is not instantaneous, unlike an ideal square wave. The graph also shows slight overshoot beyond the 100% level before stabilizing, which is common in practical circuits due to inductive or capacitive effects.\n\nOverall, the graph highlights the concept of rise time, emphasizing the non-instantaneous nature of signal transitions in electronic circuits and the typical behavior of step waveforms in such contexts.\n\nFigure 1.24. Rise time of a step waveform.\n\nThe edges of a square wave are not perfectly square; in typical electronic circuits the rise time $t_{r}$ ranges from a few nanoseconds to a few microseconds. Figure 1.24 shows the sort of thing usually seen. The rise time is conventionally defined as the time required for the signal to go from $10 \\%$ to $90 \\%$ of its total transition.\nimage_name:Figure 1.25\ndescription:The graph in Figure 1.25 illustrates various pulse waveforms, depicting both positive and negative polarities. The graph is a time-domain waveform, with the horizontal axis labeled as 't' representing time, and the vertical axis labeled as 'V' representing voltage. The vertical axis shows positive and negative voltage levels, indicating the polarity of the pulses.\n\nThe graph consists of four distinct pulse waveforms:\n\n1. **Positive Pulse:** The first waveform is a positive-going pulse. It begins at zero voltage, rises sharply to a positive voltage level, remains constant for a specific pulse width, and then returns to zero. This waveform demonstrates a typical positive pulse with a defined amplitude and pulse width.\n\n2. **Negative Pulse:** The second waveform illustrates a negative-going pulse. It starts at zero voltage, drops sharply to a negative voltage level, maintains this level for a certain duration, and then returns to zero. This waveform represents a typical negative pulse.\n\n3. **Negative Pulse (Inverted):** The third waveform is similar to the second but inverted. It starts at zero, dips into the negative voltage region, stays constant for the pulse width, and then goes back to zero.\n\n4. **Positive Pulse (Inverted):** The fourth waveform mirrors the first one but in an inverted manner, starting at zero, rising to a positive level, maintaining this level, and then returning to zero.\n\nThese waveforms demonstrate the concept of pulses with both positive and negative polarities, highlighting the amplitude and pulse width as key characteristics. There are no specific annotations or numerical values provided in the graph, but the illustration effectively shows the basic structure and behavior of pulse waveforms in electronic circuits.\n\nFigure 1.25. Positive- and negative-going pulses of both polarities.\n\n#### E. Pulses\n\nA pulse is a signal that resembles the objects shown in Figure 1.25 . It is defined by amplitude and pulse width. You can generate a train of periodic (equally spaced) pulses, in which case you can talk about the frequency, or pulse repetition rate, and the \"duty cycle,\" the ratio of pulse width to repetition period (duty cycle ranges from zero to $100 \\%$ ). Pulses can have positive or negative polarity; in addition, they can be \"positive-going\" or \"negative-going.\" For\ninstance, the second pulse in Figure 1.25 is a negativegoing pulse of positive polarity.\n\n#### F. Steps and spikes\n\nSteps and spikes are signals that are talked about a lot but are not so often used. They provide a nice way of describing what happens in a circuit. If you could draw them, they would look something like the example in Figure 1.26. The step function is part of a square wave; the spike is simply a jump of vanishingly short duration.\nimage_name:step\ndescription:The graph in Figure 1.26 consists of two separate diagrams labeled as 'step' and 'spike.' These diagrams illustrate fundamental signal types often referenced in circuit analysis.\n\n1. **Type of Graph and Function:**\n- The graph consists of two time-domain waveforms: a step function and a spike function.\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n- The axes are not explicitly labeled, but it can be inferred that the horizontal axis represents time, while the vertical axis represents amplitude or voltage. There are no visible scales or units provided.\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- **Step Function:** The step function shows a sudden change in voltage. It begins at a low level, abruptly jumps to a higher level, and then remains constant. This behavior is characteristic of a step input in electrical circuits, often used to test the transient response.\n- **Spike Function:** The spike function features a rapid, short-duration increase in voltage, returning immediately to the baseline level. This is indicative of a transient spike, which might represent noise or a sudden disturbance in a circuit.\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- **Step Function:** The key feature is the vertical jump from one level to another, representing an instantaneous change. This is often used to simulate a switch turning on.\n- **Spike Function:** The primary feature is the narrow, tall spike, suggesting a brief, high-amplitude event, often used to model impulses or glitches in a system.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- The diagrams are labeled directly beneath each waveform as 'step' and 'spike,' respectively. There are no numerical values or additional annotations present.\n\nOverall, these diagrams serve as basic representations of two common signal types used in analyzing circuit behavior, particularly in understanding how circuits respond to sudden changes or disturbances.\nimage_name:spike\ndescription:The graph titled \"spike\" in Figure 1.26 consists of two distinct parts: a step function and a spike. The graph is a time-domain waveform, typically used in digital electronics to describe signal transitions.\n\n**Axes Labels and Units:**\n- The horizontal axis represents time, though specific units are not labeled.\n- The vertical axis represents voltage or signal amplitude, also without specific units.\n\n**Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- **Step Function (left side):** This part of the graph shows a sudden"

The fastest models can reach gigahertz pulse rates. Many also allow the generation of pulse pairs with configurable spacing and repetition rates, or even programmable patterns (sometimes termed pattern generators). Most modern pulse generators feature logic-level outputs for easy integration with digital circuits and come in programmable variants.\n\n#### C. Function Generators\n\nFunction generators are among the most adaptable signal sources. They can produce sine, triangle, and square waves across a vast frequency range (typically 0.01 Hz to 30 MHz), with adjustable amplitude and DC offset (a constant DC voltage added to the signal). Many offer frequency sweeping in various modes (linear or logarithmic). They also provide pulse outputs (though less flexible than dedicated pulse generators) and some support modulation.\n\nTraditional function generators relied on analog circuitry, but modern versions are typically synthesized digital function generators, combining the flexibility of function generators with the stability and accuracy of frequency synthesizers. Additionally, they allow programming of \"arbitrary\" waveforms by specifying amplitude at evenly spaced points. An example is the Tektronix AFG3102, capable of generating sine and square waves up to 100 MHz, pulses and \"noise\" up to 50 MHz, and arbitrary waveforms (up to 128 k points) up to 50 MHz. It features five types of modulation, linear and logarithmic sweep, and burst modes (1 to $10^6$ cycles), with everything programmable, including frequency, pulse width, rise times, modulation, and amplitude (20 mV to 10 Vpp). It even includes unique built-in waveforms like $\\sin(x)/x$, exponential rise and fall, Gaussian, and Lorentzian. It has two independent outputs and costs approximately $5,000. For general purposes, if you can only have one signal source, a function generator is the ideal choice."

    "text": "A capacitor (Figure 1.27), formerly known as a condenser, is a device featuring two protruding wires and possesses the property\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nQ=C V \\tag{1.13}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIts fundamental structure consists of two closely spaced metal plates, separated by an insulating material, as exemplified by the rolled-up \"axial-film capacitor\" in Figure 1.28. A capacitor with a capacitance of $C$ farads and a voltage of $V$ volts across its terminals holds $Q$ coulombs of charge on one plate and $-Q$ on the other. The capacitance is directly proportional to the plate area and inversely proportional to the separation distance. For a simple parallel-plate capacitor with separation $d$ and plate area $A$ (where $d$ is much smaller than the plate dimensions), the capacitance $C$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC=8.85 \\times 10^{-14} \\varepsilon A / d \\mathrm{~F} \\tag{1.14}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\varepsilon$ represents the dielectric constant of the insulator, with dimensions measured in centimeters. Achieving commonly used capacitances in circuits requires substantial area and minimal spacing. For instance, two $1 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ plates separated by 1 mm form a capacitor slightly below $10^{-12} \\mathrm{~F}$ (a picofarad); you would need 100,000 such capacitors to create the $0.1 \\mu \\mathrm{F}$ capacitor shown in Figure 1.28 (which is not exceptional; we frequently use capacitors with several microfarads of capacitance). Typically, you don't need to calculate capacitances since capacitors are purchased as electronic components.\n\nTo a first approximation, capacitors can be viewed as frequency-dependent resistors.\n\n[^16]image_name:Figure 1.28\ndescription:This image illustrates a detailed diagram of an axial-lead Mylar capacitor, highlighting its internal structure. The capacitor is displayed as a rolled-up assembly, a common design to maximize surface area within a compact form.\n\n1. **Identification of Components and Structure:**\n- **Inside Foil and Outside Foil:** These are the conductive layers of the capacitor, typically made of metallized plastic films. The diagram shows these foils rolled together, a standard method to increase capacitance by maximizing the area of conductive surfaces in contact with the dielectric.\n- **Dielectric (Insulator):** Located between the foils, this layer is crucial for storing electrical energy by maintaining an electric field between the conductive layers without allowing current to pass.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- The rolled structure forms a cylindrical shape with leads extending from each end, enabling the capacitor to be integrated into an electronic circuit. The leads connect to the inside and outside foils, allowing the capacitor to store and release electrical energy.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- The capacitor is labeled \"0.1 µF 100 VDC,\" indicating its capacitance of 0.1 microfarads and a voltage rating of 100 volts DC. This provides information on the maximum voltage the capacitor can handle and its storage capacity.\n- Annotations point to the \"dielectric (insulator),\" \"inside foil,\" and \"outside foil,\" clarifying the function of each component within the capacitor structure.\n\nFigure 1.28. Rolling up a pair of metallized plastic films increases the surface area significantly. Unrolling an axial-lead Mylar capacitor can be quite amusing (similar to unraveling the lengthy rubber band in old-style golf balls).\n\nCapacitors enable the creation of frequency-dependent voltage dividers. For some applications (bypass, coupling), this basic understanding suffices, but for others (filtering, energy storage, resonant circuits), a deeper insight is necessary. For example, ideal capacitors cannot dissipate power despite current flow, as the voltage and current are $90^{\\circ}$ out of phase.\n\nBefore delving into the detailed analysis of capacitors over the next dozen pages (including essential mathematics describing their behavior over time and frequency), we emphasize the first two applications - bypass and coupling - due to their prevalence and simplicity. These will be explored in detail later (\\$§1.7.1C and 1.7.16A), but there's no need to wait; they are intuitive. Since a capacitor appears as an open circuit at DC, it can couple a varying signal while blocking its average DC level, functioning as a blocking (or coupling) capacitor, as shown in Figure 1.93. Similarly, at high frequencies, a capacitor appears as a short circuit, suppressing (\"bypassing\") unwanted signals, such as on DC supply voltages in circuits, as depicted in Figure 8.80A (where capacitors suppress signals on the +5 V and -5 V DC supply voltages, and on the base terminal of transistor $Q_{2}$). These two applications dominate the capacitors used in global circuits.\n\nTaking the derivative of equation 1.13 yields\n\n[^17]\\$\\$\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI=C \\frac{d V}{d t} \\tag{1.15}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n\\$\\$\n\nThus, a capacitor is more complex than a resistor: the current is not merely proportional to the voltage but to the rate of voltage change. Changing the voltage across a farad by 1 volt per second requires an amp. Conversely, supplying an amp changes its voltage by 1 volt per second. A farad is an enormous capacitance, so we typically use microfarads ( $\\mu \\mathrm{F}$ ), nanofarads ( nF ), or picofarads $(\\mathrm{pF}) .{ }^{23}$ For example, supplying 1 mA to $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~F}$ increases the voltage at 1000 volts per second. A 10 ms pulse of this current raises the capacitor voltage by 10 volts (Figure 1.29).\n\n[^18]image_name:Figure 1.29\ndescription:Figure 1.29 presents a graph in two parts, depicting the relationship between current and voltage across a capacitor over time.\n\n1. **Type of Graph and Function:**\n- The top graph shows a time-domain waveform of current (I) versus time (t).\n- The bottom graph displays a time-domain waveform of voltage (V) versus time (t).\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n- **Top Graph:**\n- The vertical axis represents current (I) in milliamperes (mA).\n- The horizontal axis represents time (t) in milliseconds (ms).\n- The current is depicted as a rectangular pulse with a magnitude of 1 mA and a duration of 10 ms.\n- **Bottom Graph:**\n- The vertical axis represents voltage (V) in volts (V).\n- The horizontal axis represents time (t) in milliseconds (ms).\n- The voltage increases linearly during the current pulse and then remains constant.\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- **Top Graph:**\n- The current starts at zero, rises to 1 mA for 10 ms, and then returns to zero.\n- **Bottom Graph:**\n- The voltage across the capacitor starts at an initial value \\( V_{before} \\), increases linearly by 10 V during the 10 ms pulse, and then stabilizes at \\( V_{after} \\).\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The capacitor has a capacitance of 1 microfarad (\\( \\mu F \\)).\n- The voltage increase corresponds to the integral of the current over time, consistent with \\( V = \\frac{1}{C} \\int I \\, dt \\).\n- During the 10 ms pulse, the voltage increases by 10 V, reflecting the capacitor's charging by the constant current.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- The current pulse is clearly marked with a height of 1 mA and a width of 10 ms.\n- The voltage increase is annotated with a change of 10 V, indicating the effect of the current pulse on the capacitor's voltage.\n- The graph effectively demonstrates that a constant current through a capacitor results in a linear voltage increase over time.\n\nFigure 1.29. The voltage across a capacitor changes in response to current flow.\n\nCharging a capacitor involves supplying energy. The capacitor does not heat up; instead, it stores energy in its internal electric fields. It's straightforward to determine that the energy stored in a charged capacitor is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nU_{\\mathrm{C}}=\\frac{1}{2} C V^{2} \\tag{1.16}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $U_{\\mathrm{C}}$ is in joules for $C$ in farads and $V$ in volts. This is a significant result, frequently encountered.\n\nExercise 1.14. Take the energy challenge: consider charging a capacitor of capacitance $C$ from 0 V to a final voltage $V_{\\mathrm{f}}$. The result should be independent of the charging method,\n\n[^18]image_name:Figure 1.30\ndescription:Figure 1.30 displays a diverse array of capacitors, showcasing the various shapes, sizes, and types available. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n1. **Components and Structure:**\n- **Large Electrolytic Capacitors:** At the top left, large-value polarized aluminum electrolytic capacitors are shown, including radial and axial lead types, and one with screw terminals, often termed a computer electrolytic.\n- **Film Capacitors:** A low-inductance film capacitor is visible, notable for its wide strap terminals.\n- **Variable Capacitors:** Small-value variable capacitors are located in the lower left, including one air and three ceramic types.\n- **Disc Capacitors:** Various disc capacitors, typically ceramic, are present, often used in high-frequency applications.\n- **Tantalum Capacitors:** Smaller tantalum capacitors are included, known for their stability and reliability.\n- **Other Types:** Other capacitor types, such as glass, mica, and polyester, are shown, each with unique properties suited to different applications.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- The capacitors are displayed without connections, emphasizing the components themselves. However, the leads and terminals indicate potential connection methods in a circuit.\n- The arrangement highlights the variety of terminal types, including axial leads, radial leads, and screw terminals, influencing how they are mounted on a circuit board.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- Capacitors are labeled with visible indicators of voltage ratings, capacitance values, and manufacturer markings.\n- A scale at the bottom right shows \"1 cm,\" providing a size reference for each component.\n- Some capacitors bear specific markings like \"LO-HENRY,\" indicating manufacturer or series names, relevant for component selection in specific applications.\n\nThis collection effectively illustrates the versatility and range of capacitors used in electronic circuits, from small signal applications to high-power systems.\n\nFigure 1.30. Capacitors come in various forms! This collection represents a broad spectrum. In the lower left are small-value variable capacitors (one air, three ceramic), with large-value polarized aluminum electrolytics above them (three radial-lead types, three axial-lead types, and a screw-terminal type at the top, often called a computer electrolytic). Across the top, a low-inductance film capacitor is next (note the wide strap terminals), followed by an oil-filled paper capacitor, and finally a set of disc ceramic capacitors on the right. The four rectangular objects below are film capacitors (polyester, polycarbonate, or polypropylene). The D-subminiature connector appears out of place but is a filtered connector with a 1000 pF capacitor from each pin to the shell. To its left is a group of seven polarized tantalum electrolytics (five axial-lead, one radial-lead, and one surface-mount). Above them are three axial-film capacitors. The ten capacitors at the bottom center are all ceramic types (four radial-lead, two axial-lead, and four surface-mount chip capacitors); above them are high-voltage capacitors - an axial-glass capacitor and a ceramic transmitting capacitor with screw terminals. Finally, to the left are four mica capacitors and a pair of diode-like varactors, which are voltage-variable capacitors made from diode junctions.\n\nso you don't need to assume constant current charging (though you may do so). At any instant, the energy flow rate into the capacitor is VI (joules/s); thus, you must integrate $d U=$ VIdt from start to finish. Proceed from there.\n\nCapacitors are available in a remarkable variety of shapes and sizes (Figure 1.30 illustrates many types); with experience, you'll recognize their common forms. For the smallest capacitances, you might see examples of the basic parallel-plate or cylindrical piston construction. For higher capacitance, more area and closer spacing are needed; typically, a conductor is plated onto a thin insulating material (the dielectric), such as aluminized plastic film rolled into a small cylinder. Other popular types include thin ceramic wafers (ceramic chip capacitors), metal foils with oxide insulators (electrolytic capacitors), and metallized mica. Each type has unique properties; for a brief overview, see the capacitor section in Chapter $1 x$. Generally, ceramic and polyester capacitors are used for most noncritical applications; capacitors with polycarbonate, polystyrene, polypropylene, Teflon, or glass dielectrics are chosen for demanding applications; tantalum capacitors are used where greater capacitance is required; and aluminum electrolytics are employed for power-supply filtering.\n\n#### A. Capacitors in Parallel and Series\n\nThe total capacitance of capacitors in parallel is the sum of their individual capacitances. This is straightforward: apply voltage $V$ across the parallel combination; then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nC_{\\text {total }} V & =Q_{\\text {total }}=Q_{1}+Q_{2}+Q_{3}+\\cdots \\\\\n& =C_{1} V+C_{2} V+C_{3} V+\\cdots \\\\\n& =\\left(C_{1}+C_{2}+C_{3}+\\cdots\\right) V\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{\\text {total }}=C_{1}+C_{2}+C_{3}+\\cdots \\tag{1.17}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor capacitors in series, the formula resembles that for resistors in parallel:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{\\text {total }}=\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{C_{1}}+\\frac{1}{C_{2}}+\\frac{1}{C_{3}}+\\cdots} \\tag{1.18}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nor (for two capacitors only)\n\n$$\nC_{\\text {total }}=\\frac{C_{1} C_{2}}{C_{1}+C_{2}} .\n$$\n\nExercise 1.15. Derive the formula for the capacitance of two capacitors in series. Hint: since there's no external connection at the junction of the two capacitors, they must have equal stored charges.\n\nThe current flowing in a capacitor during charging $(I=C d V / d t)$ exhibits unique characteristics. Unlike resistive current, it isn't proportional to voltage but to the rate of voltage change. Moreover, unlike in a resistor, the power $(V \\times I)$ associated with capacitive current doesn't convert to heat but is stored as energy in the capacitor's internal electric field. This energy is fully recovered when the capacitor discharges. We'll explore these intriguing properties further when discussing reactance, starting in §1.7."

The diagram shows these foils rolled together, a method to increase capacitance by maximizing the contact area of the conductive surfaces with the dielectric.\n- **Dielectric (Insulator):** Situated between the foils, this layer is crucial for storing electrical energy by maintaining an electric field between the conductive layers without allowing current flow.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- The rolled structure forms a cylindrical shape with leads extending from each end, enabling the capacitor to be integrated into an electronic circuit. The leads connect to the inside and outside foils, allowing the capacitor to store and release electrical energy.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- The capacitor is labeled \"0.1 µF 100 VDC,\" indicating its capacitance of 0.1 microfarads and voltage rating of 100 volts DC. This provides information on the maximum voltage it can handle and its storage capacity.\n- Annotations point to the \"dielectric (insulator),\" \"inside foil,\" and \"outside foil,\" clarifying the function of each component within the capacitor structure.\n\nFigure 1.28. Rolling up metallized plastic films significantly increases the surface area. Unrolling an axial-lead Mylar capacitor (or old-style golf balls with lengthy wound rubber bands) can be quite amusing.\n\nCapacitors enable the creation of frequency-dependent voltage dividers. For applications like bypassing and coupling, this basic understanding suffices, but deeper knowledge is required for filtering, energy storage, and resonant circuits. Ideal capacitors cannot dissipate power despite current flow, as the voltage and current are $90^{\\circ}$ out of phase.\n\nBefore delving into the detailed behavior of capacitors over the next dozen pages (including necessary mathematics describing their behavior over time and frequency), we emphasize the initial two applications - bypassing and coupling - as they are the most prevalent uses and are straightforward to grasp. These will be explored in detail later (\\$§1.7.1C and 1.7.16A), but there's no need to wait; they are intuitive. Since a capacitor appears as an open circuit at DC, it can couple a varying signal while blocking its average DC level, functioning as a blocking (or coupling) capacitor, as shown in Figure 1.93. Similarly, at high frequencies, a capacitor appears as a short circuit, suppressing (\"bypassing\") unwanted signals, such as on DC power supply voltages in Figure 8.80A (where capacitors suppress signals on the +5 V and -5 V DC supply voltages and the base terminal of transistor $Q_{2}$). These applications dominate the capacitors used in global circuits.\n\nDifferentiating the defining equation 1.13 yields\n\n[^17]\\$\\$\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI=C \\frac{d V}{d t} \\tag{1.15}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n\\$\\$\n\nThus, a capacitor is more complex than a resistor: the current is proportional not to the voltage, but to the voltage's rate of change. Changing the voltage across a farad by 1 volt per second supplies an amp. Conversely, supplying an amp changes the voltage by 1 volt per second. A farad is an enormous capacitance, so microfarads ( $\\mu \\mathrm{F}$ ), nanofarads (nF), or picofarads (pF) are commonly used. For example, supplying 1 mA to $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~F}$ increases the voltage at 1000 volts per second. A 10 ms pulse of this current raises the voltage by 10 volts (Figure 1.29).\n\nimage_name:Figure 1.29\ndescription:Figure 1.29 consists of two graphs illustrating the relationship between current and voltage across a capacitor over time.\n\n1. **Type of Graph and Function:**\n- The top graph is a time-domain waveform of current (I) versus time (t).\n- The bottom graph is a time-domain waveform of voltage (V) versus time (t).\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n- **Top Graph:**\n- The vertical axis represents current (I) in milliamperes (mA).\n- The horizontal axis represents time (t) in milliseconds (ms).\n- The current is depicted as a rectangular pulse of 1 mA lasting 10 ms.\n- **Bottom Graph:**\n- The vertical axis represents voltage (V) in volts (V).\n- The horizontal axis represents time (t) in milliseconds (ms).\n- The voltage increases linearly during the current pulse and then stabilizes.\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- **Top Graph:**\n- The current starts at zero, rises to 1 mA for 10 ms, and returns to zero.\n- **Bottom Graph:**\n- The voltage across the capacitor starts at \\( V_{before} \\), increases linearly by 10 V during the 10 ms pulse, and stabilizes at \\( V_{after} \\).\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The capacitor has a capacitance of 1 microfarad (\\( \\mu F \\)).\n- The voltage increase corresponds to the integral of the current over time, consistent with \\( V = \\frac{1}{C} \\int I \\, dt \\).\n- During the 10 ms pulse, the voltage rises by 10 V, reflecting the capacitor's charging by the constant current.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- The current pulse is clearly marked at 1 mA and 10 ms.\n- The voltage increase is annotated as 10 V, indicating the effect of the current pulse on the capacitor's voltage.\n- The graph effectively demonstrates that a constant current through a capacitor results in a linear voltage increase over time.\n\nFigure 1.29. The voltage across a capacitor changes in response to current flow.\n\nCharging a capacitor involves supplying energy. The capacitor does not heat up; instead, it stores energy in its internal electric fields. It's straightforward to determine that the energy stored in a charged capacitor is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nU_{\\mathrm{C}}=\\frac{1}{2} C V^{2} \\tag{1.16}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $U_{\\mathrm{C}}$ is in joules for $C$ in farads and $V$ in volts. This is a significant result, frequently encountered.\n\nExercise 1.14. Take the energy challenge: consider charging a capacitor of capacitance $C$ from 0 V to a final voltage $V_{\\mathrm{f}}$. The result should be independent of the charging method,\n\n[^18]image_name:Figure 1.30\ndescription:Figure 1.30 displays a diverse array of capacitors, showcasing the wide variety of shapes, sizes, and types available.\n\n1. **Components and Structure:**\n- **Large Electrolytic Capacitors:** At the top left, large-value polarized aluminum electrolytic capacitors are shown, including radial and axial lead types, and one with screw terminals, often termed a computer electrolytic.\n- **Film Capacitors:** A low-inductance film capacitor is present, distinguished by its wide strap terminals.\n- **Variable Capacitors:** Small-value variable capacitors are located in the lower left, including one air and three ceramic types.\n- **Disc Capacitors:** Various ceramic disc capacitors are shown, typically used in high-frequency applications.\n- **Tantalum Capacitors:** Smaller tantalum capacitors are included, known for their stability and reliability.\n- **Other Types:** Other capacitor types, such as glass, mica, and polyester, are visible, each with unique properties for different applications.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- The capacitors are displayed without connections, but their leads and terminals indicate how they would be integrated into a circuit.\n- The arrangement highlights the variety of terminal types, including axial leads, radial leads, and screw terminals, affecting their mounting on a circuit board.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- Capacitors are labeled with visible indicators of voltage ratings, capacitance values, and manufacturer markings.\n- A scale at the bottom right shows \"1 cm,\" providing a size reference for each component.\n- Some capacitors have specific markings like \"LO-HENRY,\" indicating manufacturer or series names relevant for selecting components for specific applications.\n\nThis collection effectively illustrates the versatility and range of capacitors used in electronic circuits, from small signal applications to high-power systems.\n\nFigure 1.30. Capacitors come in various forms! This image presents a representative selection. In the lower left are small-value variable capacitors (one air, three ceramic), with large-value polarized aluminum electrolytics above them (three with radial leads, three with axial leads, and one with screw terminals at the top, often called a computer electrolytic). Across the top are a low-inductance film capacitor (note the wide strap terminals), an oil-filled paper capacitor, and a set of disc ceramic capacitors running down the right. The four rectangular objects below are film capacitors (polyester, polycarbonate, or polypropylene). The D-subminiature connector appears out of place but is a filtered connector with a 1000 pF capacitor from each pin to the shell. To its left are seven polarized tantalum electrolytics (five axial, one radial, and one surface-mount). Above them are three axial-film capacitors. The ten capacitors at the bottom center are all ceramic types (four radial, two axial, and four surface-mount chip capacitors); above them are high-voltage capacitors - an axial-glass capacitor and a ceramic transmitting capacitor with screw terminals. Finally, to the left are four mica capacitors and a pair of diode-like varactors, which are voltage-variable capacitors made from diode junctions.\n\nso you don't need to assume constant current charging (though you may). At any instant, the energy flow rate into the capacitor is VI (joules/s); thus, you must integrate $d U=$ VIdt from start to finish. Proceed from there.\n\nCapacitors are available in an astonishing variety of shapes and sizes (Figure 1.30 illustrates many types); with experience, you'll recognize their common forms. For the smallest capacitances, you might see examples of the basic parallel-plate or cylindrical piston construction. For larger capacitance, more area and closer spacing are needed; a common approach is to plate a conductor onto a thin insulating material (the dielectric), such as aluminized plastic film rolled into a small cylinder. Other popular types include thin ceramic wafers (ceramic chip capacitors), metal foils with oxide insulators (electrolytic capacitors), and metallized mica. Each type has unique properties; for a brief overview, see the capacitor section in Chapter $1 x$. Generally, ceramic and polyester capacitors are used for most noncritical applications; capacitors with polycarbonate, polystyrene, polypropylene, Teflon, or glass dielectrics are used in demanding applications; tantalum capacitors are chosen for higher capacitance needs; and aluminum electrolytics are used for power-supply filtering.\n\n#### A. Capacitors in Parallel and Series\n\nThe total capacitance of capacitors in parallel is the sum of their individual capacitances. This is easily understood: apply voltage $V$ across the parallel combination, then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nC_{\\text {total }} V & =Q_{\\text {total }}=Q_{1}+Q_{2}+Q_{3}+\\cdots \\\\\n& =C_{1} V+C_{2} V+C_{3} V+\\cdots \\\\\n& =\\left(C_{1}+C_{2}+C_{3}+\\cdots\\right) V\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{\\text {total }}=C_{1}+C_{2}+C_{3}+\\cdots \\tag{1.17}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor capacitors in series, the formula is analogous to that for resistors in parallel:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{\\text {total }}=\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{C_{1}}+\\frac{1}{C_{2}}+\\frac{1}{C_{3}}+\\cdots} \\tag{1.18}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nor, for two capacitors,\n\n$$\nC_{\\text {total }}=\\frac{C_{1} C_{2}}{C_{1}+C_{2}} .\n$$\n\nExercise 1.15. Derive the formula for the capacitance of two capacitors in series. Hint: the point where the two capacitors connect has no external connection, so they must have equal stored charges.\n\nThe current flowing in a capacitor during charging $(I=C d V / d t)$ has unique characteristics. Unlike resistive current, it is not proportional to voltage but to the rate of voltage change. Additionally, the power $(V \\times I)$ associated with capacitive current does not convert to heat but is stored as energy in the capacitor's internal electric field. This energy is fully recovered when the capacitor discharges. We'll explore these intriguing properties further when discussing reactance, starting in §1.7."

A 10 ms pulse of this current raises the capacitor voltage by 10 volts (Figure 1.29).\n\nimage_name:Figure 1.29\ndescription:Figure 1.29 comprises two graphs depicting the relationship between current and voltage across a capacitor over time.\n\n1. **Type of Graph and Function:**\n- The top graph is a time-domain waveform of current (I) versus time (t).\n- The bottom graph is a time-domain waveform of voltage (V) versus time (t).\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n- **Top Graph:**\n- The vertical axis represents current (I) in milliamperes (mA).\n- The horizontal axis represents time (t) in milliseconds (ms).\n- The current is depicted as a rectangular pulse of 1 mA lasting 10 ms.\n- **Bottom Graph:**\n- The vertical axis represents voltage (V) in volts (V).\n- The horizontal axis represents time (t) in milliseconds (ms).\n- The voltage increases linearly during the current pulse and then stabilizes.\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- **Top Graph:**\n- The current starts at zero, rises to 1 mA for 10 ms, then returns to zero.\n- **Bottom Graph:**\n- The voltage across the capacitor starts at \\( V_{before} \\), increases linearly by 10 V during the 10 ms pulse, and then stabilizes at \\( V_{after} \\).\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The capacitor has a capacitance of 1 microfarad (\\( \\mu F \\)).\n- The voltage increase corresponds to the integral of the current over time, consistent with \\( V = \\frac{1}{C} \\int I \\, dt \\).\n- During the 10 ms pulse, the voltage rises by 10 V, reflecting the capacitor's charging by the constant current.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- The current pulse is marked with a height of 1 mA and width of 10 ms.\n- The voltage increase is annotated as 10 V, indicating the effect of the current pulse on the capacitor's voltage.\n- The graph demonstrates the principle that a constant current through a capacitor results in a linear voltage increase over time.\n\nFigure 1.29. The voltage across a capacitor changes in response to current flow.\n\nCharging a capacitor involves supplying energy. The capacitor does not heat up; instead, it stores energy in its internal electric fields. It's straightforward to determine that the energy stored in a charged capacitor is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nU_{\\mathrm{C}}=\\frac{1}{2} C V^{2} \\tag{1.16}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $U_{\\mathrm{C}}$ is in joules for $C$ in farads and $V$ in volts. This is a crucial result, frequently encountered.\n\nExercise 1.14. Take the energy challenge: imagine charging a capacitor of capacitance $C$ from 0 V to a final voltage $V_{\\mathrm{f}}$. The result should be independent of the charging method,\n\n[^18]image_name:Figure 1.30\ndescription:Figure 1.30 displays a diverse array of capacitors, highlighting the variety of shapes, sizes, and types available. Key elements include:\n\n1. **Components and Structure:**\n- **Large Electrolytic Capacitors:** At the top left, large-value polarized aluminum electrolytic capacitors are shown, including radial and axial lead types, and one with screw terminals, often termed a computer electrolytic.\n- **Film Capacitors:** A low-inductance film capacitor is visible, distinguished by its wide strap terminals.\n- **Variable Capacitors:** Small-value variable capacitors are located in the lower left, including one air and three ceramic types.\n- **Disc Capacitors:** Various ceramic disc capacitors are shown, commonly used in high-frequency applications.\n- **Tantalum Capacitors:** Smaller tantalum capacitors, known for stability and reliability, are also present.\n- **Other Types:** Other capacitor types, such as glass, mica, and polyester, are displayed, each with unique properties suited for different applications.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- The capacitors are shown without connections, but the leads and terminals indicate how they would be integrated into a circuit.\n- The arrangement showcases various terminal types, including axial leads, radial leads, and screw terminals, influencing how they are mounted on a circuit board.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- Capacitors are labeled with voltage ratings, capacitance values, and manufacturer markings.\n- A scale at the bottom right shows \"1 cm,\" providing a size reference for each component.\n- Some capacitors bear specific markings like \"LO-HENRY,\" indicating manufacturer or series names relevant for selecting components for specific applications.\n\nThis collection effectively illustrates the versatility and range of capacitors used in electronic circuits, from small signal applications to high-power systems.\n\nFigure 1.30. Capacitors come in various forms! This collection showcases a representative sample. In the lower left are small-value variable capacitors (one air, three ceramic), with large-value polarized aluminum electrolytics above them (three with radial leads, three with axial leads, and one with screw terminals at the top, often called a computer electrolytic). Across the top are a low-inductance film capacitor (note the wide strap terminals), an oil-filled paper capacitor, and a set of disc ceramic capacitors on the right. The four rectangular objects below are film capacitors (polyester, polycarbonate, or polypropylene). The D-subminiature connector appears out of place but is a filtered connector with a 1000 pF capacitor from each pin to the shell. To its left are seven polarized tantalum electrolytics (five with axial leads, one radial, and one surface-mount). Above them are three axial-film capacitors. The ten capacitors at the bottom center are all ceramic types (four with radial leads, two axial, and four surface-mount chip capacitors); above them are high-voltage capacitors - an axial-glass capacitor and a ceramic transmitting capacitor with screw terminals. Finally, to the left are four mica capacitors and a pair of diode-like varactors, which are voltage-variable capacitors made from a diode junction.\nso you don't need to assume constant current charging (though you can). At any instant, the energy flow rate into the capacitor is VI (joules/s); integrate $d U=$ VIdt from start to finish. Proceed from there.\n\nCapacitors are available in a remarkable variety of shapes and sizes (Figure 1.30 illustrates many types); with experience, you'll recognize their common forms. For the smallest capacitances, you might see examples of the basic parallel-plate or cylindrical piston construction. For larger capacitance, more area and closer spacing are needed; typically, a conductor is plated onto a thin insulating material (the dielectric), such as aluminized plastic film rolled into a compact cylindrical shape. Other popular types include thin ceramic wafers (ceramic chip capacitors), metal foils with oxide insulators (electrolytic capacitors), and metallized mica. Each type has unique properties; for a brief overview, see the section on capacitors in Chapter $1 x$. Generally, ceramic and polyester capacitors are used for most noncritical applications; capacitors with polycarbonate, polystyrene, polypropylene, Teflon, or glass dielectrics are chosen for demanding applications; tantalum capacitors are used where higher capacitance is required; and aluminum electrolytics are employed for power-supply filtering.\n\n#### A. Capacitors in Parallel and Series\n\nThe total capacitance of capacitors in parallel is the sum of their individual capacitances. This is straightforward: apply voltage $V$ across the parallel combination, then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nC_{\\text {total }} V & =Q_{\\text {total }}=Q_{1}+Q_{2}+Q_{3}+\\cdots \\\\\n& =C_{1} V+C_{2} V+C_{3} V+\\cdots \\\\\n& =\\left(C_{1}+C_{2}+C_{3}+\\cdots\\right) V\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{\\text {total }}=C_{1}+C_{2}+C_{3}+\\cdots \\tag{1.17}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor capacitors in series, the formula resembles that for resistors in parallel:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{\\text {total }}=\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{C_{1}}+\\frac{1}{C_{2}}+\\frac{1}{C_{3}}+\\cdots} \\tag{1.18}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nor, for two capacitors:\n\n$$\nC_{\\text {total }}=\\frac{C_{1} C_{2}}{C_{1}+C_{2}} .\n$$\n\nExercise 1.15. Derive the formula for the capacitance of two capacitors in series. Hint: the lack of an external connection to the junction point means they must have equal stored charges.\n\nThe current flowing in a capacitor during charging $(I=C d V / d t)$ exhibits unique characteristics. Unlike resistive current, it is not directly proportional to voltage but to the rate of voltage change. Additionally, the power $(V \\times I)$ associated with capacitive current does not convert to heat but is stored as energy in the capacitor's internal electric field. This energy is fully recovered when the capacitor discharges. We will explore these intriguing properties further when discussing reactance in §1.7."

    "text": "A capacitor (referred to as a condenser in older terminology) is a device featuring two protruding wires and possesses the property\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nQ=C V \\tag{1.13}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIts fundamental structure consists of two closely spaced metal plates, separated by an insulating material, as exemplified by the \"axial-film capacitor\" shown in Figure 1.28. A capacitor with a capacitance of $C$ farads and a voltage of $V$ volts across its terminals holds $Q$ coulombs of charge on one plate and $-Q$ on the other. The capacitance is directly proportional to the plate area and inversely proportional to the distance between them. For a simple parallel-plate capacitor with separation $d$ and plate area $A$ (where $d$ is much smaller than the plate dimensions), the capacitance $C$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC=8.85 \\times 10^{-14} \\varepsilon A / d \\mathrm{~F} \\tag{1.14}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\varepsilon$ represents the dielectric constant of the insulator, with dimensions measured in centimeters. Achieving commonly used capacitances in circuits requires substantial area and minimal spacing. For instance, two $1 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ plates separated by 1 mm form a capacitor slightly less than $10^{-12} \\mathrm{~F}$ (a picofarad); creating a $0.1 \\mu \\mathrm{F}$ capacitor like the one in Figure 1.28 would necessitate 100,000 such units. Typically, you don't need to calculate capacitances since capacitors are purchased as electronic components.\n\nTo a first approximation, capacitors can be viewed as frequency-dependent resistors.\n\n[^16]image_name:Figure 1.28\ndescription:This image illustrates a detailed diagram of an axial-lead Mylar capacitor, highlighting its internal structure. The capacitor is displayed as a rolled-up assembly, a common design to maximize surface area within a compact form.\n\n1. **Identification of Components and Structure:**\n- **Inside Foil and Outside Foil:** These are the conductive layers, usually made of metallized plastic films. The diagram shows these foils rolled together, a typical method to increase capacitance by maximizing the contact area between the conductive surfaces and the dielectric.\n- **Dielectric (Insulator):** Located between the foils, this layer is essential for storing electrical energy by maintaining an electric field without allowing current to pass.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- The rolled structure forms a cylindrical shape with leads extending from each end, enabling the capacitor to be integrated into an electronic circuit. The leads connect to the inside and outside foils, allowing the capacitor to store and release electrical energy.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- The capacitor is labeled \"0.1 µF 100 VDC,\" indicating its capacitance of 0.1 microfarads and voltage rating of 100 volts DC. This provides information on the maximum voltage it can handle and its storage capacity.\n- Annotations point to the \"dielectric (insulator),\" \"inside foil,\" and \"outside foil,\" clarifying the function of each component within the capacitor structure.\n\nFigure 1.28. Rolling up metallized plastic films significantly increases the surface area. Unrolling an axial-lead Mylar capacitor is quite enjoyable (similar to unraveling old-style golf balls with their long rubber bands).\n\nCapacitors enable the creation of frequency-dependent voltage dividers. For applications like bypassing and coupling, this basic understanding suffices, but deeper knowledge is required for filtering, energy storage, and resonant circuits. For example, ideal capacitors cannot dissipate power despite current flow, as the voltage and current are $90^{\\circ}$ out of phase.\n\nBefore delving into the detailed behavior of capacitors over the next dozen pages (including necessary mathematics describing their behavior over time and frequency), we emphasize the first two applications - bypassing and coupling - due to their prevalence and simplicity. These will be discussed in detail later (\\$§1.7.1C and 1.7.16A), but there's no need to wait, as they are intuitive. A capacitor appears as an open circuit at DC, allowing coupling of varying signals while blocking the average DC level, as seen in Figure 1.93. Similarly, at high frequencies, it appears as a short circuit, suppressing unwanted signals, as demonstrated in Figure 8.80A (where capacitors suppress signals on the +5 V and -5 V DC supply voltages and the base terminal of transistor $Q_{2}$). These applications dominate the use of capacitors in global circuits.\n\nDifferentiating the defining equation 1.13 yields\n\n[^17]\\$\\$\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI=C \\frac{d V}{d t} \\tag{1.15}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n\\$\\$\n\nThus, a capacitor is more complex than a resistor: the current is proportional not to the voltage, but to the rate of voltage change. A 1-volt-per-second change across a farad equals an ampere. Conversely, supplying an ampere results in a 1-volt-per-second change. A farad is an extremely large capacitance, so microfarads ( $\\mu \\mathrm{F}$ ), nanofarads ( nF ), or picofarads $(\\mathrm{pF})$ are commonly used. For example, a 1 mA current to $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~F}$ causes a 1000 volts-per-second voltage rise. A 10 ms pulse of this current increases the voltage by 10 volts (Figure 1.29).\n\nimage_name:Figure 1.29\ndescription:Figure 1.29 comprises two graphs depicting the relationship between current and voltage across a capacitor over time.\n\n1. **Type of Graph and Function:**\n- The top graph shows current (I) as a function of time (t).\n- The bottom graph shows voltage (V) as a function of time (t).\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n- **Top Graph:**\n- The vertical axis represents current (I) in milliamperes (mA).\n- The horizontal axis represents time (t) in milliseconds (ms).\n- The current is depicted as a rectangular pulse of 1 mA lasting 10 ms.\n- **Bottom Graph:**\n- The vertical axis represents voltage (V) in volts (V).\n- The horizontal axis represents time (t) in milliseconds (ms).\n- The voltage increases linearly during the current pulse and then stabilizes.\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- **Top Graph:**\n- The current starts at zero, rises to 1 mA for 10 ms, and returns to zero.\n- **Bottom Graph:**\n- The voltage across the capacitor starts at \\( V_{before} \\), increases linearly by 10 V during the 10 ms pulse, and then stabilizes at \\( V_{after} \\).\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The capacitor has a capacitance of 1 microfarad (\\( \\mu F \\)).\n- The voltage increase corresponds to the integral of the current over time, consistent with \\( V = \\frac{1}{C} \\int I \\, dt \\).\n- During the 10 ms pulse, the voltage increases by 10 V, reflecting the capacitor's charging by the constant current.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- The current pulse is marked with a height of 1 mA and width of 10 ms.\n- The voltage increase is annotated as 10 V, indicating the effect of the current pulse on the capacitor's voltage.\n- The graph effectively demonstrates that a constant current through a capacitor results in a linear voltage increase over time.\n\nFigure 1.29.

Here's a detailed description:\n\n1. **Components and Structure:**\n- **Large Electrolytic Capacitors:** At the top left are large-value polarized aluminum electrolytic capacitors, including radial and axial lead types, and one with screw terminals, often termed a computer electrolytic.\n- **Film Capacitors:** A low-inductance film capacitor is shown, characterized by its wide strap terminals.\n- **Variable Capacitors:** Small-value variable capacitors are located in the lower left, including one air and three ceramic types.\n- **Disc Capacitors:** Various ceramic disc capacitors are visible, commonly used in high-frequency applications.\n- **Tantalum Capacitors:** Smaller tantalum capacitors are present, known for their stability.\n- **Other Types:** Other capacitors, such as glass, mica, and polyester, are also displayed, each with unique properties for different applications.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- The capacitors are shown without connections, but their leads and terminals indicate how they would be integrated into a circuit.\n- The variety of terminal types, including axial leads, radial leads, and screw terminals, affects their mounting on a circuit board.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- Capacitors are labeled with voltage ratings, capacitance values, and manufacturer markings.\n- A scale at the bottom right shows \"1 cm,\" providing a size reference.\n- Some capacitors have specific markings like \"LO-HENRY,\" indicating manufacturer or series names relevant for specific applications.\n\nThis collection illustrates the versatility of capacitors in electronic circuits, ranging from small signal applications to high-power systems.\n\nFigure 1.30. Capacitors come in various forms! This collection represents most types. In the lower left are small-value variable capacitors (one air, three ceramic), with large-value polarized aluminum electrolytics above them (three with radial leads, three with axial leads, and one with screw terminals at the top, often called a computer electrolytic). Across the top are a low-inductance film capacitor (note the wide strap terminals), an oil-filled paper capacitor, and a set of disc ceramic capacitors on the right. The four rectangular objects below are film capacitors (polyester, polycarbonate, or polypropylene). The D-subminiature connector appears out of place but is a filtered connector with a 1000 pF capacitor from each pin to the shell. To its left are seven polarized tantalum electrolytics (five with axial leads, one radial, and one surface-mount). Above them are three axial-film capacitors. The ten capacitors at bottom center are all ceramic types (four with radial leads, two axial, and four surface-mount chip capacitors); above them are high-voltage capacitors - an axial-glass capacitor and a ceramic transmitting capacitor with screw terminals. Finally, to the left are four mica capacitors and a pair of diode-like varactors, which are voltage-variable capacitors made from a diode junction.\nso you don't need to assume constant current charging (though you can if you prefer). At any instant, the energy flow rate into the capacitor is VI (joules/s); thus, you need to integrate $d U=$ VIdt from start to finish. Proceed from there.\n\nCapacitors are available in a remarkable variety of shapes and sizes (Figure 1.30 shows a representative selection); with experience, you'll recognize their common forms. For the smallest capacitances, you might see examples of the basic parallel-plate or cylindrical piston construction. For higher capacitance, more area and closer spacing are needed; a typical approach is to plate a conductor onto a thin insulating material (the dielectric), such as aluminized plastic film rolled into a small cylindrical shape. Other popular types include thin ceramic wafers (ceramic chip capacitors), metal foils with oxide insulators (electrolytic capacitors), and metallized mica. Each type has unique properties; for a brief overview, see the section on capacitors in Chapter $1 x$. Generally, ceramic and polyester capacitors are used for most noncritical applications; capacitors with polycarbonate, polystyrene, polypropylene, Teflon, or glass dielectrics are used in demanding applications; tantalum capacitors are chosen for higher capacitance needs; and aluminum electrolytics are used for power-supply filtering.\n\n#### A. Capacitors in Parallel and Series\n\nThe total capacitance of capacitors in parallel is the sum of their individual capacitances. This is easily understood: apply voltage $V$ across the parallel combination; then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nC_{\\text {total }} V & =Q_{\\text {total }}=Q_{1}+Q_{2}+Q_{3}+\\cdots \\\\\n& =C_{1} V+C_{2} V+C_{3} V+\\cdots \\\\\n& =\\left(C_{1}+C_{2}+C_{3}+\\cdots\\right) V\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{\\text {total }}=C_{1}+C_{2}+C_{3}+\\cdots \\tag{1.17}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor capacitors in series, the formula is analogous to that for resistors in parallel:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{\\text {total }}=\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{C_{1}}+\\frac{1}{C_{2}}+\\frac{1}{C_{3}}+\\cdots} \\tag{1.18}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nor (for two capacitors)\n\n$$\nC_{\\text {total }}=\\frac{C_{1} C_{2}}{C_{1}+C_{2}} .\n$$\n\nExercise 1.15. Derive the formula for the capacitance of two capacitors in series. Hint: since there is no external connection to the junction of the two capacitors, they must have equal stored charges.\n\nThe current flowing through a capacitor during charging $(I=C d V / d t)$ exhibits unique characteristics. Unlike resistive current, it is not directly proportional to voltage but to the rate of voltage change (the \"time derivative\"). Additionally, the power $(V \\times I)$ associated with capacitive current does not convert to heat but is stored as energy in the capacitor's internal electric field. This energy is fully recovered when the capacitor is discharged. We will explore these intriguing properties further when discussing reactance, starting in §1.7."

    "text": "An electrical component known as a capacitor (refer to Figure 1.27), historically termed a condenser, features two protruding wires and possesses the characteristic relationship\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nQ=C V \\tag{1.13}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEssentially, a capacitor comprises two closely positioned metal plates separated by a dielectric material, exemplified by the rolled-up \"axial-film capacitor\" in Figure 1.28. With a capacitance of $C$ farads and a voltage of $V$ across its terminals, a capacitor holds $Q$ coulombs of stored charge on one plate and $-Q$ on the other. The capacitance is directly related to the plate area and inversely related to the distance between the plates. For a basic parallel-plate capacitor featuring a separation of $d$ and a plate area $A$ (where the spacing is significantly less than the plate dimensions), the capacitance $C$ is calculated as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC=8.85 \\times 10^{-14} \\varepsilon A / d \\mathrm{~F} \\tag{1.14}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\varepsilon$ represents the dielectric constant of the insulator, and the dimensions are expressed in centimeters. To achieve capacitances commonly employed in circuits, substantial area and extremely close spacing are required. For example, a pair of $1 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ plates with a separation of 1 mm constitutes a capacitor of approximately $10^{-12} \\mathrm{~F}$ (a picofarad); it would take 100,000 of such capacitors to create a $0.1 \\mu \\mathrm{~F}$ capacitor like the one shown in Figure 1.28. Typically, capacitance values are not calculated manually since capacitors are purchased as pre-assembled electronic components.\n\nAt a fundamental level, capacitors can be likened to resistors that are frequency-dependent.\n\n[^16]image_name:Figure 1.28\ndescription:Figure 1.28 presents a detailed illustration of an axial-lead Mylar capacitor, highlighting its internal structure. The capacitor is depicted as a rolled-up structure, a typical design that enhances surface area within a compact space.\n\n1. **Identification of Components and Structure:**\n- **Inside Foil and Outside Foil:** These are the conductive layers of the capacitor, commonly composed of metallized plastic films. The diagram illustrates these foils as rolled together, a standard construction for maximizing the area of the conductive surfaces in contact with the dielectric.\n- **Dielectric (Insulator):** Situated between the foils, this layer is essential for storing electrical energy by preserving an electric field between the conductive layers without enabling current flow.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- The rolled structure results in a cylindrical shape, with leads extending from each end, facilitating the capacitor's integration into an electronic circuit. These leads connect to the inside and outside foils, allowing the capacitor to act as a component that stores and releases electrical energy.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- The capacitor is labeled \"0.1 µF 100 VDC,\" signifying its capacitance of 0.1 microfarads and a voltage rating of 100 volts DC. This indicates the maximum voltage the capacitor can withstand and its storage capacity.\n- The diagram includes annotations identifying the \"dielectric (insulator),\" \"inside foil,\" and \"outside foil,\" aiding in the understanding of each component's function within the capacitor structure.\n\nFigure 1.28. Rolling up metallized plastic films significantly increases the area. Unrolling an axial-lead Mylar capacitor is quite amusing, much like unwinding rubber bands on old-fashioned golf balls.\n\nThey are useful for creating frequency-dependent voltage dividers, for instance. For certain applications (bypass, coupling), this fundamental knowledge is sufficient, but for others (filtering, energy storage, resonant circuits), a deeper comprehension is necessary. For instance, ideal capacitors cannot dissipate power, although current can pass through them, due to the voltage and current being $90^{\\circ}$ out of phase.\n\nWe plan to delve into the intricacies of capacitors over the following pages (including some essential mathematics describing their behavior over time and in frequency), yet wish to first emphasize the two primary applications - bypass and coupling - as they are the most prevalent uses of capacitors and can be easily grasped at a basic level. We will explore these applications in detail later (\\$§1.7.1C and 1.7.16A), but there's no need to wait, as they are straightforward and intuitive. Since a capacitor behaves like an open circuit at DC, it allows the passage of a varying signal while blocking its average DC level. This is referred to as a blocking capacitor (or a coupling capacitor), as shown in Figure 1.93. Similarly, as a capacitor behaves like a short circuit at high frequencies, it suppresses (\"bypasses\") unwanted signals, such as those on the DC voltages that power circuits, as depicted in Figure 8.80A (where capacitors are suppressing signals on the +5 V and -5 V DC supply voltages, as well as on the base terminal of transistor $Q_{2}$ ). ${ }^{22}$ Demographically, these two applications account for the majority of capacitors integrated into global circuits.\n\nBy taking the derivative of the defining equation 1.13, we obtain\n\n[^17]\\$\\$\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI=C \\frac{d V}{d t} \\tag{1.15}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n\\$\\$\n\nConsequently, a capacitor is more complex than a resistor: current is not directly proportional to voltage but rather to the voltage's rate of change. If you vary the voltage across a farad by 1 volt per second, you provide an amp. Conversely, if you supply an amp, the voltage changes by 1 volt per second. A farad is an extremely high capacitance, and one usually deals with microfarads ( $\\mu \\mathrm{F}$ ), nanofarads ( nF ), or picofarads $(\\mathrm{pF})$. For example, if you supply a current of 1 mA to $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~F}$, the voltage will increase at 1000 volts per second. A 10 ms pulse of this current will raise the voltage across the capacitor by 10 volts (Figure 1.29).\nimage_name:Figure 1.29\ndescription:Figure 1.29 comprises two segments, illustrating the current-voltage relationship across a capacitor over time.\n\n1. **Type of Graph and Function:**\n- The upper graph is a time-domain waveform depicting current (I) as a function of time (t).\n- The lower graph is a time-domain waveform depicting voltage (V) as a function of time (t).\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n- **Top Graph:**\n- The vertical axis represents current (I) in milliamperes (mA).\n- The horizontal axis represents time (t) in milliseconds (ms).\n- The current is depicted as a rectangular pulse with a magnitude of 1 mA and a duration of 10 ms.\n- **Bottom Graph:**\n- The vertical axis represents voltage (V) in volts (V).\n- The horizontal axis represents time (t) in milliseconds (ms).\n- The voltage rises linearly during the current pulse and then remains constant.\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- **Top Graph:**\n- The current begins at zero, rises to 1 mA for a duration of 10 ms, and then returns to zero.\n- **Bottom Graph:**\n- The voltage across the capacitor starts at an initial value \\( V_{before} \\), rises linearly by 10 V during the 10 ms pulse, and then stabilizes at \\( V_{after} \\).\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The capacitor has a capacitance of 1 microfarad (\\( \\mu F \\)).\n- The voltage change corresponds to the integral of the current over time, consistent with the relationship \\( V = \\frac{1}{C} \\int I \\, dt \\).\n- During the 10 ms pulse, the voltage increases by 10 V, reflecting the capacitor's charging by a constant current.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- The current pulse is clearly marked with a height of 1 mA and a width of 10 ms.\n- The voltage increase is annotated with a change of 10 V, indicating the current pulse's impact on the capacitor's voltage.\n- The graph effectively demonstrates the principle that a constant current through a capacitor results in a linear voltage increase over time.\n\nFigure 1.29. The voltage across a capacitor varies as current passes through it.\n\nWhen charging a capacitor, you are providing energy. Unlike resistors, capacitors do not heat up; instead, they store energy within their internal electric fields. A simple experiment can reveal that the amount of stored energy in a charged capacitor is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nU_{\\mathrm{C}}=\\frac{1}{2} C V^{2} \\tag{1.16}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $U_{\\mathrm{C}}$ is in joules for $C$ in farads and $V$ in volts. This is a crucial outcome; we will encounter it frequently.\n\nExercise 1.14. Tackle the energy challenge: suppose you charge a capacitor of capacitance $C$ from 0 V to a final voltage $V_{\\mathrm{f}}$. If done correctly, the outcome will not depend on the charging method.\n\nWhen you charge a capacitor, you are delivering energy. Capacitors do not generate heat; instead, they store energy in their electric fields. By performing an experiment, you can easily discover that the energy stored in a capacitor is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nU_{\\mathrm{C}}=\\frac{1}{2} C V^{2} \\tag{1.16}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $U_{\\mathrm{C}}$ is in joules for $C$ in farads and $V$ in volts. This is a vital result that will appear repeatedly in our discussions.\n\nExercise 1.14. Accept the energy challenge: imagine charging a capacitor with capacitance $C$ from 0 V to a final voltage $V_{\\mathrm{f}}$. The outcome should not depend on the charging process.\n\nCapacitors come in an astonishing variety of shapes and sizes (Figure 1.30 illustrates numerous examples); over time, you will recognize their most common forms. For the smallest capacitances, basic parallel-plate (or cylindrical piston) configurations are typically observed. For higher capacitances, more area and closer spacing are needed; a common approach involves applying a conductor onto a thin insulating material (the dielectric), for example, aluminized plastic film rolled into a small cylindrical form. Other popular types include thin ceramic wafers (ceramic chip capacitors), metal foils with oxide insulators (electrolytic capacitors), and metallized mica. Each of these types has distinct characteristics; a brief overview can be found in the section on capacitors in Chapter $1 x$. Generally, ceramic and polyester capacitors are used for noncritical circuit applications; capacitors with polycarbonate, polystyrene, polypropylene, Teflon, or glass dielectric are employed in demanding applications; tantalum capacitors are used when higher capacitance is necessary; and aluminum electrolytics are used for power-supply filtering.\n\n#### A. Capacitors in parallel and series\n\nWhen capacitors are connected in parallel, the total capacitance is the sum of their individual capacitances. This is straightforward to understand: apply voltage $V$ to the parallel combination; then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nC_{\\text {total }} V & =Q_{\\text {total }}=Q_{1}+Q_{2}+Q_{3}+\\cdots \\\\\n& =C_{1} V+C_{2} V+C_{3} V+\\cdots \\\\\n& =\\left(C_{1}+C_{2}+C_{3}+\\cdots\\right) V\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{\\text {total }}=C_{1}+C_{2}+C_{3}+\\cdots \\tag{1.17}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor capacitors connected in series, the formula resembles that for resistors in parallel:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{\\text {total }}=\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{C_{1}}+\\frac{1}{C_{2}}+\\frac{1}{C_{3}}+\\cdots} \\tag{1.18}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nor (for two capacitors)\n\n$$\nC_{\\text {total }}=\\frac{C_{1} C_{2}}{C_{1}+C_{2}} .\n$$\n\nExercise 1.15. Derive the formula for the capacitance of two capacitors in series. Hint: since there is no external connection to the point where the two capacitors are joined, they must possess equal stored charges.\n\nThe current that flows through a capacitor during charging is characterized by some unusual aspects. Unlike resistive current, it is not directly proportional to voltage but rather to the rate of change of voltage. Moreover, unlike a resistor, the power associated with capacitive current is not converted into heat but is instead stored as energy in the capacitor's internal electric field.

    "text": "In the analysis of alternating current (AC) circuits, there are two primary methods of description. One can describe voltage and current as functions of time, or one can describe amplitude in relation to signal frequency. Both methods have their advantages, and engineers often switch between them depending on the situation's convenience. Our exploration of AC circuits starts in the time domain and will transition to the frequency domain beginning with §1.7.\n\nTo understand the characteristics of circuits containing capacitors, we can start with a basic RC circuit (Figure 1.31). Applying the rules for capacitors yields the differential equation:\n\n$$\nC \\frac{d V}{d t}=I=-\\frac{V}{R} \\tag{1.19}\n$$\n\nThe solution to this equation is:\n\n$$\nV=A e^{-t / R C} \\tag{1.20}\n$$\n\nThus, a charged capacitor connected across a resistor will discharge as shown in Figure 1.32. Intuitively, the current flowing is proportional to the remaining voltage across the resistor, and the rate of discharge (from the capacitor equation) is proportional to that current. Consequently, the discharge curve must be an exponential function.\n\nThe RC circuit's time constant, denoted as \\( RC \\), is the product of the resistance \\( R \\) in ohms and the capacitance \\( C \\) in farads, and it determines the rate of discharge. For instance, a microfarad capacitor across a 1.0 kΩ resistor has a time constant of 1 ms; if initially charged to 1.0 V, the initial current is 1.0 mA.\n\nWhen the switch in an RC charging circuit (Figure 1.33) is closed at \\( t=0 \\), the voltage across the capacitor follows the equation:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text {out }}=V_{\\mathrm{f}}\\left(1-e^{-t / R C}\\right) \\tag{1.21}\n$$\n\nHere, the slope of the charging curve (proportional to current) decreases in proportion to the voltage remaining to be reached, reflecting an exponential behavior.\n\nBy manipulating equation (1.21), one can determine the time required to reach a specific voltage \\( V \\) during the charging process towards the final voltage \\( V_{\\mathrm{f}} \\):\n\n$$\nt=R C \\log _{e}\\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{f}}}{V_{\\mathrm{f}}-V}\\right) \\tag{1.22}\n$$\n\nThe circuit eventually reaches equilibrium when \\( t \\gg RC \\), and the voltage \\( V \\) approaches \\( V_{\\mathrm{f}} \\). The \"5 RC rule\" is a useful guideline: a capacitor charges or decays to within 1% of its final value in five time constants.\n\nFor an arbitrary input voltage \\( V_{\\text {in }}(t) \\), the solution involves an inhomogeneous differential equation, which can be solved using standard methods. The RC circuit effectively averages the past history of the input with a weighting factor of \\( e^{-\\Delta t / RC} \\).\n\nIn practical applications, engineers often analyze circuits in the frequency domain, examining how each frequency component of the input passes through the circuit. This topic will be explored further in §1.7.\n\nBefore diving into frequency domain analysis, we can simplify more complex circuits using the Thévenin equivalent, as demonstrated in Figure 1.36. This approach allows us to analyze the output \\( V(t) \\) produced by a step input for \\( V_{\\text {in }} \\) using the Thévenin equivalent of the voltage divider formed by \\( R_{1} \\) and \\( R_{2} \\).\n\nFigures 1.37 and 1.38 illustrate real-world applications of RC circuits, such as producing delayed waveforms and timing circuits. For example, an RC circuit with CMOS buffers can create a time-delayed digital waveform, as shown in Figure 1.37. In Figure 1.38, an RC timing circuit generates a delayed output that can control various loads, such as LEDs, buzzers, or relays.\n\nThese simple RC circuits demonstrate the practical utility of theoretical concepts in electronics. By understanding the behavior of capacitors and resistors in circuits, engineers can design a wide range of applications, from timing circuits to signal processing systems."

Our exploration of AC circuits commences in the time domain, transitioning to the frequency domain starting from §1.7.\n\nCharacteristics of circuits that incorporate capacitors can be illuminated by examining a basic RC circuit (Figure 1.31). Utilizing the rules governing capacitors yields the equation:\n\n$$\nC \\frac{d V}{d t}=I=-\\frac{V}{R} \\tag{1.19}\n$$\n\nThis is a differential equation, and its solution is:\n\n$$\nV=A e^{-t / R C} \\tag{1.20}\n$$\n\nHence, a charged capacitor connected across a resistor will discharge as depicted in Figure 1.32. Intuitively, the current, governed by the resistor equation, is proportional to the remaining voltage, while the capacitor equation indicates that the slope of the discharge is proportional to the current. Thus, the discharge curve is an exponential function.\n\nFigure 1.31 portrays the simplest RC circuit, featuring a capacitor C discharging through a resistor R. The circuit's time constant, RC, governs the discharge rate.\n\nFigure 1.32. RC discharge waveform, depicted with linear (A) and logarithmic (B) voltage axes.\n\n#### A. Time Constant\n\nThe product RC is known as the circuit's time constant. For R in ohms and C in farads, RC is measured in seconds. A microfarad across 1.0 k has a time constant of 1 ms; if initially charged to 1.0 V, the initial current is 1.0 mA.\n\nFigure 1.33 exhibits a slightly different circuit. At t=0, the battery is connected. The circuit's equation is:\n\n$$\nI=C \\frac{d V}{d t}=\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{f}}-V_{\\mathrm{out}}}{R}\n$$\n\nwith the solution:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text {out }}=V_{\\mathrm{f}}+A e^{-t / R C}\n$$\n\n(Please disregard any confusion with the mathematics. The focus is on the significant results to remember. We will frequently apply these results later without delving into the mathematical derivation.) The constant A is dictated by the initial conditions (Figure 1.34): V=0 at t=0; hence, A=-V_{\\mathrm{f}}, and:\n\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{out}}=V_{\\mathrm{f}}\\left(1-e^{-t / R C}\\right) \\tag{1.21}\n$$\n\nOnce more, intuition aids understanding: as the capacitor charges, the slope (proportional to current due to the capacitor) is proportional to the remaining voltage (since it appears across the resistor, generating the current); thus, the waveform's slope decreases in proportion to the voltage remaining, which describes an exponential function.\n\nFigure 1.34. RC charging waveform.\n\n#### B. Decay to Equilibrium\n\nUltimately (when t ≫ RC), V approaches V_{\\mathrm{f}}. (Here's the \"5 RC rule of thumb\": a capacitor charges or decays to within 1% of its final value in five time constants.) If we then alter the battery voltage (e.g., to 0 V), V will exponentially decay toward the new value with an exponential e^{-t / RC}. For instance, replacing the battery's step input from 0 to +V_{\\mathrm{f}} with a square-wave input V_{\\mathrm{in}}(t) would yield the output in Figure 1.35.\n\nFigure 1.35. Output (lower waveforms) across a capacitor, when driven by square waves through a resistor.\n\n#### C. Simplification by Thévenin Equivalents\n\nAnalyzing more intricate circuits using similar methods, such as formulating differential equations and seeking solutions, is often impractical. The circuit in Figure 1.36, for instance, can be reduced to a simpler form using the Thévenin equivalent of the voltage divider formed by R1 and R2, allowing determination of the output V(t) produced by a step input for V_{\\text {in }}.\n\nFigure 1.36. A seemingly complex circuit simplified using Thévenin equivalents.\n\n#### D. A Circuit Example: Time-Delay Circuit\n\nWe will briefly apply these theoretical concepts to real circuits. Figure 1.37 demonstrates the use of capacitors to generate a delayed pulse. The triangular symbols represent CMOS buffers, which output HIGH if the input is HIGH and vice versa. The first buffer delivers a replica of the input signal with low source resistance, preventing input loading by the RC circuit. The RC output exhibits characteristic decays, causing the output buffer to switch 10 μs after input transitions. This delay circuit is useful for ensuring certain actions occur before others in a sequence.\n\nFigure 1.37. Generating a delayed digital waveform using an RC circuit and CMOS buffers.\n\n#### E. Another Circuit Example: \"One Minute of Power\"\n\nFigure 1.38 showcases another application of simple RC timing circuits. The triangular symbol is a comparator, an IC that drives its output to either +V_{+} or ground depending on the input voltages. The circuit operates by charging C1 upon pressing the START button, causing the comparator's output to switch to +5 V. After releasing the button, the capacitor discharges exponentially, and the comparator's output returns to ground after approximately 1 minute.\n\nFigure 1.38. RC timing circuit: one push yields one minute of power.\n\nThe output can be used to drive various loads, such as an LED, a piezo beeper, or a relay, as shown in Figures 1.40A-D. These examples demonstrate the versatility of RC timing circuits in practical applications.\n\nFigure 1.40. Driving various loads from the output of the timing circuit in Figure 1.38.\n\nFor more robust applications, solid-state relays (SSRs) are employed, which contain an infrared LED coupled to a triac for switching high currents while providing electrical isolation. The example shows SSR controlling an air compressor, offering a minute of air after inserting a quarter, akin to a home \"gas station.\"\n\nFigure 1.39. Generating a delayed digital waveform for the circuit in Figure 1.38.\n\nAdditional considerations include limiting transient currents, mitigating output bounce using hysteresis, and bypassing the DC supply with capacitors for noise reduction.\n\nBeyond on/off control, binary logic signals from circuits like comparators enable or disable other circuits. For example, a car door trigger could activate a security code keypad for starting the car, ensuring operator readiness.\n\nFigure 1.41. Differentiators. A.

We can either observe voltage and current as they vary over time, or we can study their amplitude in relation to the frequency of the signal. Both methods have their advantages, and engineers often switch between them depending on the specific situation. We commence our exploration of AC circuits in the time domain. However, beginning with section 1.7, we will delve into the frequency domain.\n\nConsidering circuits with capacitors, a simple RC circuit (refer to Figure 1.31) can illustrate their characteristics. Applying the capacitor's governing rules yields a differential equation, the solution to which is an exponential function that describes the discharge of a capacitor connected to a resistor. This discharge follows a specific curve as depicted in Figure 1.32, where the slope of the curve corresponds to the current flow and is proportional to the remaining voltage.\n\nThe product of the resistance \\( R \\) and the capacitance \\( C \\) defines the time constant of the circuit.

    "text": "When analyzing alternating current (AC) circuits, where voltages and currents vary over time, two primary methods can be employed. One involves discussing voltage (V) and current (I) as functions of time, while the other focuses on amplitude in relation to signal frequency. Both methods have their advantages, and engineers often switch between them depending on the context. Our exploration of AC circuits commences in the time domain before transitioning to the frequency domain in §1.7.\n\nTo understand the characteristics of circuits containing capacitors, we start with a straightforward RC circuit (Figure 1.31). Applying the capacitor rules yields the differential equation:\n\n$$\nC \\frac{d V}{d t}=I=-\\frac{V}{R} \\tag{1.19}\n$$\n\nSolving this equation gives us:\n\n$$\nV=A e^{-t / R C} \\tag{1.20}\n$$\n\nThis indicates that a charged capacitor connected across a resistor will discharge exponentially, as depicted in Figure 1.32. Intuitively, the current through the resistor is proportional to the remaining voltage, while the rate of discharge is proportional to the current, resulting in an exponential discharge curve.\n\nFigures 1.31 and 1.32 illustrate the RC circuit and its discharge waveform. Figure 1.31 is a simple RC discharge circuit, and Figure 1.32 shows the voltage across the capacitor over time, which follows an exponential decay pattern. The time constant (RC) of the circuit determines the rate of discharge, with the voltage dropping to about 37% of its initial value after one time constant.\n\nThe product RC is known as the time constant of the circuit, measured in seconds. For example, a microfarad capacitor across a 1.0 kΩ resistor has a time constant of 1 ms. If the capacitor starts at 1.0 V, the initial current would be 1.0 mA.\n\nIn the case of an RC charging circuit (Figure 1.33), when a battery is connected at t=0, the circuit equation becomes:\n\n$$\nI=C \\frac{d V}{d t}=\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{f}}-V_{\\mathrm{out}}}{R}\n$$\n\nThe solution to this equation is:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text {out }}=V_{\\mathrm{f}}+A e^{-t / R C}\n$$\n\nThe constant A is determined by initial conditions, such as V=0 at t=0, leading to:\n\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{out}}=V_{\\mathrm{f}}\\left(1-e^{-t / R C}\\right) \\tag{1.21}\n$$\n\nThis equation shows that as the capacitor charges, the current slope decreases proportionally to the remaining voltage difference, forming an exponential waveform.\n\nFigures 1.34 and 1.35 depict the RC charging waveform and the response of an RC circuit to square wave inputs, respectively. The charging curve in Figure 1.34 shows an exponential rise in voltage over time, reaching about 63% of the final voltage after one time constant. Figure 1.35 demonstrates how the RC circuit responds to square wave inputs of different frequencies, with the output waveform showing the effect of the time constant on the shape and amplitude.\n\nIn practice, engineers often analyze circuits using the frequency domain, focusing on how each frequency component of the input signal is affected by the circuit. This approach will be discussed further in §1.7.\n\nFor more complex circuits, simplification methods such as Thévenin equivalents can be employed. An example is the circuit in Figure 1.36, which can be reduced to an equivalent form to analyze the output V(t) produced by a step input for Vin.\n\nFigures 1.37 and 1.38 show practical applications of RC circuits. Figure 1.37 demonstrates a time-delay circuit using CMOS buffers and an RC network, introducing a delay of 10 microseconds between the input and output signals. Figure 1.38 shows an RC timing circuit that generates a delayed digital waveform, with the duration of the output pulse determined by the RC time constant.\n\nThese examples illustrate the versatility of RC circuits in various applications, from signal processing to timing circuits."

    "text": "When analyzing alternating current (AC) circuits, where voltages and currents vary over time, we can choose to describe the circuit behavior either in terms of voltage and current as functions of time or in terms of amplitude in relation to signal frequency. Each method has its advantages, and engineers often switch between them depending on which provides the most convenient description for a given situation. We start our exploration of AC circuits by examining behavior over time. However, beginning with section 1.7, we will transition to examining behavior in the frequency domain.\n\nTo understand the characteristics of circuits containing capacitors, we can begin by studying a simple RC circuit, as shown in Figure 1.31. By applying the rules governing capacitors, we derive the differential equation:\n\n$$\nC \\frac{d V}{d t}=I=-\\frac{V}{R} \\tag{1.19}\n$$\n\nSolving this equation gives us:\n\n$$\nV=A e^{-t / R C} \\tag{1.20}\n$$\n\nThus, a charged capacitor connected across a resistor will discharge in a manner depicted in Figure 1.32. Intuitively, the current flowing through the resistor is proportional to the remaining voltage, and the rate of discharge (the slope of the voltage curve) is proportional to the current. This results in a discharge curve that is exponential in nature.\n\nIn the context of the RC circuit, the product RC is known as the time constant of the circuit. For a resistor with resistance R in ohms and a capacitor with capacitance C in farads, the time constant RC is measured in seconds. As an example, a microfarad capacitor connected across a 1.0 kΩ resistor has a time constant of 1 ms; if the capacitor is initially charged to 1.0 V, the initial current is 1.0 mA.\n\nMoving on to an RC charging circuit (Figure 1.33), when a battery is connected at time t=0, the circuit equation becomes:\n\n$$\nI=C \\frac{d V}{d t}=\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{f}}-V_{\\mathrm{out}}}{R}\n$$\n\nThe solution to this equation is:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text {out }}=V_{\\mathrm{f}}+A e^{-t / R C}\n$$\n\nThe constant A is determined by the initial conditions, leading to:\n\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{out}}=V_{\\mathrm{f}}\\left(1-e^{-t / R C}\\right) \\tag{1.21}\n$$\n\nHere, the intuition is similar to the discharging scenario: as the capacitor charges, the slope (proportional to current) decreases in proportion to the remaining voltage difference to the final voltage \\( V_{\\mathrm{f}} \\).\n\nBy rearranging the equation, we can determine the time required for the voltage to reach a certain value \\( V \\) on its way to the final voltage \\( V_{\\mathrm{f}} \\):\n\n$$\nt=R C \\log _{e}\\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{f}}}{V_{\\mathrm{f}}-V}\\right) \\tag{1.22}\n$$\n\nFor an RC circuit driven by a square wave input, the output voltage waveform is shown in Figure 1.35. The circuit's response to the input waveform is affected by the time constant, leading to a shape that differs from the input, especially at higher frequencies.\n\nIn practical applications, we often use Thévenin equivalents to simplify the analysis of more complex circuits. For instance, the circuit in Figure 1.36 can be reduced to a simpler form using the Thévenin equivalent of the voltage divider formed by \\( R_{1} \\) and \\( R_{2} \\).\n\nCircuits with capacitors can be employed in various practical applications. For example, Figure 1.37 demonstrates the use of an RC circuit with CMOS buffers to produce a delayed digital waveform. The delay is determined by the RC time constant and is evident in the waveform graphs.\n\nAnother application of RC timing circuits is illustrated in Figure 1.38, where a simple circuit generates a one-minute duration pulse. The circuit uses a comparator to switch its output based on the voltage across a capacitor. The time it takes for the capacitor to charge and discharge is controlled by the RC network, resulting in the desired timing.\n\nThe waveforms in Figure 1.39 show the behavior of the timing circuit, with the voltage across the capacitor \\( C_{1} \\) rising quickly upon the closure of a switch and then decaying exponentially. The comparator's output switches states based on the voltage across the capacitor crossing a reference voltage.\n\nUsing the output of such timing circuits, various devices can be controlled, as shown in Figures 1.40A-D. For instance, an LED, a piezo buzzer, or a relay can be activated to perform tasks such as illuminating a flashlight, producing sound, or controlling an air compressor.\n\nIn more advanced applications, solid-state relays (SSRs) can be used to control heavy loads, such as industrial machinery, as shown in Figure 1.40D. These relays are electrically isolated from the control circuit, making them suitable for high-power applications.\n\nIn electronic circuits, it is common practice to include bypass capacitors to filter out noise and ensure stable operation. These capacitors are connected between the power supply rails and ground, and their capacitance values typically range from 0.1 μF to 10 μF.\n\nLastly, electronic logic signals, such as those produced by comparators, can be used to enable or disable other circuits, as demonstrated in the example of a car security system. The logic signal activates a keypad for a certain duration, ensuring that the operator has enough time to enter a security code."

Our exploration of AC circuits starts with the time domain, and from section 1.7, we will delve into the frequency domain.\n\nTo understand the characteristics of circuits that include capacitors, we begin by examining a simple RC circuit (Figure 1.31). Applying the capacitor rules yields the equation:\n\n$$\nC \\frac{d V}{d t}=I=-\\frac{V}{R}\n$$\n\nThis is a differential equation, and its solution is:\n\n$$\nV=A e^{-t / R C}\n$$\n\nThus, a charged capacitor connected across a resistor will discharge exponentially, as shown in Figure 1.32. Intuition helps here: the current flowing is proportional to the remaining voltage (from the resistor equation), but the slope of the discharge is proportional to that current (from the capacitor equation). Therefore, the discharge curve must be a function whose derivative is proportional to its value, i.e., an exponential.\n\nFigure 1.31 depicts the simplest RC circuit, where the capacitor C discharges through the resistor R. The time constant of the circuit, given by the product RC, determines the rate of discharge.\n\nFigure 1.32 shows the RC discharge waveform, plotted with linear (A) and logarithmic (B) voltage axes.\n\nThe product RC is known as the time constant of the circuit. For R in ohms and C in farads, the product RC is in seconds. A microfarad across 1.0 k has a time constant of 1 ms; if the capacitor is initially charged to 1.0 V, the initial current is 1.0 mA.\n\nFigure 1.33 presents a slightly different circuit. At time t=0, someone connects the battery. The equation for the circuit is then:\n\n$$\nI=C \\frac{d V}{d t}=\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{f}}-V_{\\mathrm{out}}}{R}\n$$\n\nwith the solution:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text {out }}=V_{\\mathrm{f}}+A e^{-t / R C}\n$$\n\nThe constant A is determined by initial conditions (Figure 1.34): V=0 at t=0; therefore, A=-V_{\\mathrm{f}}, and:\n\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{out}}=V_{\\mathrm{f}}\\left(1-e^{-t / R C}\\right)\n$$\n\nOnce again, intuition serves us well: as the capacitor charges up, the slope (which is proportional to current, because it's a capacitor) is proportional to the remaining voltage (because that's what appears across the resistor, producing the current); so we have a waveform whose slope decreases proportionally to the vertical distance it has still to go - an exponential.\n\nYou can rearrange the last equation to figure out the time required to reach a voltage V on the way to the final voltage V_{\\mathrm{f}}. You should get:\n\n$$\nt=R C \\log _{e}\\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{f}}}{V_{\\mathrm{f}}-V}\\right)\n$$\n\nEventually (when t \\gg RC), V reaches V_{\\mathrm{f}}. (Here's the \"5 RC rule of thumb\": a capacitor charges or decays to within 1% of its final value in five time constants.) If we then change the battery voltage to some other value (say, 0 V), V will decay toward that new value with an exponential e^{-t / RC}. For example, replacing the battery's step input from 0 to +V_{\\mathrm{f}} with a square-wave input V_{\\mathrm{in}}(t) would produce the output shown in Figure 1.35.\n\nExercise 1.16. Show that the rise time (the time required for going from 10% to 90% of its final value) of this signal is 2.2 RC.\n\nYou might ask the obvious next question: what about V(t) for arbitrary V_{\\text {in }}(t)? The solution involves an inhomogeneous differential equation and can be solved by standard methods (which are, however, beyond the scope of this book). You would find:\n\n$$\nV(t)=\\frac{1}{R C} \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} V_{\\mathrm{in}}(\\tau) e^{-(t-\\tau) / R C} d \\tau\n$$\n\nThat is, the RC circuit averages past history at the input with a weighting factor of:\n\n$$\ne^{-\\Delta t / R C}\n$$\n\nIn practice, you seldom ask this question. Instead, you deal in the frequency domain, in which you ask how much of each frequency component present in the input gets through. We will get to this important topic soon (section 1.7). Before we do, though, there are a few other interesting circuits we can analyze simply with this time-domain approach.\n\nFigure 1.36 shows an RC low-pass filter with input voltage Vin and output across the capacitor C. It uses the Thévenin equivalent to simplify the analysis.\n\nExercise 1.17. In the circuit shown in Figure 1.36, R_{1}=R_{2}=10 k, and C=0.1 μF. Find V(t) and sketch it.\n\nFigure 1.37 depicts an RC circuit with CMOS buffers and an RC network. The waveform shows a delayed response at point B due to the RC time constant, with a delay of 10 microseconds between the input and output signals.\n\nFigure 1.38 illustrates a timing circuit using a comparator TLC 3702. It generates a delayed digital waveform with a rise time determined by the RC network of R1 and C1. The reference voltage for the comparator is set by the voltage divider R3 and R4.\n\nFigure 1.39 consists of two time-domain waveforms. The top waveform represents the voltage across capacitor C1 (V_{C1}) in volts, plotted against time. The bottom waveform shows the comparator output.\n\nFigure 1.40 shows various circuit diagrams driving different loads from the output of the timer circuit in Figure 1.38.\n\nFigure 1.41 shows differentiator circuits. Figure 1.41A is a perfect differentiator circuit with a capacitor connected to the input voltage Vin(t) and the ground. Figure 1.41B is an approximate differentiator circuit with a capacitor connected between the input node Vin(t) and an intermediate node N1, and a resistor connected between node N1 and ground. The output is taken from node N1."
