Netlist: [Q1: NPN, C: VDD, B: Vin, E: Vout; R1: Resistor, 1.0k, N1: Vout, N2: -10V; Rload: Resistor, 1.0k, N1: Vout, N2: GND]. Function: The graph in Figure 2.18 is a time-domain waveform illustrating the behavior of an npn emitter follower circuit. The x-axis represents time, while the y-axis represents voltage, with a range from -10 volts to +10 volts. Both axes are marked with linear scales. The graph shows two waveforms: an input sine wave and an output waveform. The input sine wave has a peak amplitude of 10 volts, oscillating symmetrically about the zero voltage line. The output waveform, however, shows a distinct asymmetry. In the positive half-cycle, the output waveform closely follows the input waveform but is offset by 0.6 volts below the input. This offset is likely due to the voltage drop across the base-emitter junction of the transistor. In the negative half-cycle, the output waveform is clipped at -5 volts, indicating the limit of the current sinking capability of the emitter follower. This clipping occurs because the transistor goes out of the active region, and the emitter resistor limits the current. The graph effectively demonstrates the asymmetrical current drive capability of the npn emitter follower, where it can source current effectively on the positive side but is limited in sinking current on the negative side. The annotations on the graph point out the 0.6V offset and the -5V clipping level, highlighting these critical features of the circuit's performance."

Additionally, the saturation voltage of a Darlington pair is at least one diode drop higher than that of a single transistor because the emitter of the first transistor must be at least one diode drop above the emitter of the second transistor for it to conduct. This means the Darlington pair cannot saturate to less than a diode drop, which can be a limitation in some applications."

The core principle involves comparing the voltage from an adjustable reference divider with the voltage from a divider formed by the thermistor and a resistor $R_{2}$ using a differential Darlington pair $Q_{1}-Q_{4}$. This comparison is done in a Wheatstone bridge configuration to minimize sensitivity to supply variations."

In this specific setup, the reference divider $R_{4}-R_{6}$ and the thermistor-$R_{2}$ divider both experience the same supply voltage changes, ensuring that the comparison remains accurate regardless of supply fluctuations."

When $Q_{12}$ turns on, it steals the base drive from $Q_{10} Q_{11}$, thereby reducing or cutting off the current to the heater. This prevents potential damage to the circuit due to excessive current."

This means that once the heater is turned on, the temperature must rise slightly above the set point before it turns off, and once it is off, the temperature must fall slightly below the set point before it turns back on. This hysteresis prevents rapid switching around the set point, which can cause instability."

Without hysteresis, minor fluctuations in temperature could cause the heater to repeatedly turn on and off, leading to instability and potential wear on the heater. By requiring a significant temperature change to trigger a state change, hysteresis ensures that the system remains in a stable state once it reaches the desired temperature."

This high current gain ensures that even a small base current can drive a large current through the heater, making the control more efficient. Additionally, the Darlington configuration provides better saturation characteristics, ensuring that the heater is fully turned on when required, which improves the overall performance of the temperature controller."
