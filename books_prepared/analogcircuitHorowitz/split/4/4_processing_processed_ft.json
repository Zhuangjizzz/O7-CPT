On the other hand, an amplitude-dependent feedback network can produce a nonlinear amplifier, such as a logarithmic amplifier. This is achieved by exploiting the logarithmic relationship between the base-emitter voltage ($V_{\\mathrm{BE}}$) and the collector current ($I_{\\mathrm{C}}$) in a diode or transistor, thereby creating a feedback loop that follows a logarithmic characteristic."

This derivation involves calculating the time (Δt) it takes for the voltage to change by a certain amount (ΔV) and then inverting this time to find the frequency. The supply voltage (Vs) cancels out in the derivation, making the frequency independent of the supply voltage. This independence is a result of the voltage levels being determined by the resistor ratios rather than the absolute supply voltage."

This feedback mechanism helps in stabilizing the gain and linearizing the amplifier's response. Practically, it means the amplifier can reliably amplify input signals without significant distortion, as long as the output remains within the supply voltage limits and the op-amp operates in its linear region. However, it also implies that the circuit's stability can be affected by the feedback network's design, necessitating careful selection of R1 and R2 values to avoid instability or oscillations."

For instance, the LMC6001A's guaranteed maximum bias current increases from 25 fA at 25°C to 2000 fA at 85°C. This dramatic rise in leakage current at higher temperatures can surpass the input bias currents of low-I_B bipolar types, as leakage currents increase exponentially with temperature, whereas transistor bias currents remain relatively constant or decrease slightly. In circuit designs where low input current is critical, it is essential to consider these temperature effects and potentially choose op-amps with guaranteed low bias current limits or screen units for the best performance at the expected operating temperatures."

By doing this, the gain reaches unity (1) at a frequency that is lower than the frequency at which additional unintended phase shifts could occur. These phase shifts can lead to instability and oscillations. Most op-amps incorporate this compensation internally, ensuring they remain stable across various closed-loop gains.
