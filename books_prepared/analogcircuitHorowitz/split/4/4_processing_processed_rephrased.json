    "text": "The operational amplifier is a high-gain dc-coupled differential amplifier with a single-ended output. Consider the classic long-tailed pair (§2.3.8), featuring two inputs and one output, as a basic model. However, actual opamps boast significantly higher gain (ranging from $10^{5}$ to $10^{6}$) and lower output impedance, allowing the output to span most or all of the supply voltage range (often using a split supply, such as $\\pm 5 \\mathrm{~V}$). Thousands of operational amplifier types exist, represented by the universal symbol in Figure 4.2. Here, the $(+)$ and $(-)$ inputs function predictably: the output becomes positive when the noninverting input $(+)$ exceeds the inverting input $(-)$, and vice versa. These symbols don't dictate that one input must remain positive relative to the other; they merely indicate the output's relative phase, crucial for maintaining negative feedback. Using \"noninverting\" and \"inverting\" instead of \"plus\" and \"minus\" helps prevent misunderstandings. Power-supply connections are often omitted in diagrams, and there is no ground terminal. Operational amplifiers possess immense voltage gain and are virtually never used without feedback. Think of an opamp as a foundation for feedback. The open-loop gain is so substantial that, for any practical closed-loop gain, the characteristics are primarily determined by the feedback network. This generalization has its limits, which we will explore later. We'll begin with a simplified view of op-amp behavior and delve into the nuances as needed.\n\nThousands of op-amps are available, each offering different performance trade-offs, which we will discuss later (refer to Tables 4.2a,b, 5.5, or 8.3 for a glimpse of the variety). A standout performer is the widely-used LF411 (commonly referred to as \"411\"), originally from National Semiconductor. Like many op-amps, it is compact, housed in a mini-DIP (dual in-line package) or SOIC (small-outline IC), as depicted in Figure 4.3. It is affordable (under \\$1) and user-friendly, available in an enhanced version (LF411A) and also in a dual-opamp configuration (LF412). \n\nThe image labeled \"Figure 4.3\" illustrates two IC packages: the mini-DIP and the SOIC. The larger component on the left, the LF411CN, is a mini-DIP package with eight pins, four on each side, measuring 3/8 inches in width and 1/4 inch in height. It is labeled \"LF411CN\" and bears a manufacturing code \"NSC ≈ 8926\".

Using batteries could be a solution. Other approaches to this issue are discussed in Chapter 9 (§9.3.14) under constant-current power supplies.\n\n#### A. Current Sources for Loads Returned to Ground\n\nUsing an op-amp and an external transistor, a straightforward yet high-quality current source for a grounded load can be created. With additional circuitry, a programming input referenced to ground can be utilized (Figure 4.12). In the initial circuit, feedback maintains a voltage $V_{\\mathrm{CC}} - V_{\\text{in}}$ across $R$, resulting in an emitter current (and thus an output current) $I_{E} = (V_{\\mathrm{CC}} - V_{\\text{in}}) / R$. There are no concerns about $V_{\\mathrm{BE}}$ offsets or their variations with temperature, $I_{\\mathrm{C}}$, $V_{\\mathrm{CE}}$, etc. The current source is only imperfect (ignoring op-amp errors like $I_{\\mathrm{B}}$, $V_{\\mathrm{OS}}$) due to the slight variation of the base current with $V_{\\mathrm{CE}}$ (assuming no input current from the op-amp), a minor trade-off for the convenience of a grounded load. Using a Darlington pair for $Q_{1}$ would significantly reduce this error. This error arises because the op-amp stabilizes the emitter current, while the load experiences the collector current. A variant of this circuit using a MOSFET instead of a bipolar transistor eliminates this issue entirely, as FETs do not draw DC gate current (though large power MOSFETs have significant input capacitance, which can cause problems; see the comment at the end of this subsection).\n\nIn this circuit, the output current is proportional to the voltage below $V_{\\mathrm{CC}}$ applied to the op-amp's noninverting input, meaning the programming voltage is referenced to $V_{\\mathrm{CC}}$. This is suitable if $V_{\\text{in}}$ is a fixed voltage from a voltage divider but inconvenient for an external input. The second circuit remedies this by using a similar current source with an npn transistor to convert a ground-referenced input voltage to a $V_{\\mathrm{CC}}$-referenced input for the final current source. This circuit employs a $p$-channel MOSFET for variety and to eliminate the small base-current error associated with bipolar transistors. Op-amps and transistors are cost-effective, so don't hesitate to add extra components to enhance performance or convenience in circuit design.\n\nAn important note: at low output currents, the voltage across the emitter (or source) resistors may be minimal, requiring the op-amps to operate with their inputs near or at the positive supply voltage. For example, in Figure 4.12B, $\\mathrm{IC}_{2}$ must function with its inputs close to the positive supply rail. Always verify this capability in the op-amp's datasheet. The LF411's datasheet is somewhat ambiguous but acknowledges that it can operate, albeit with reduced performance, with inputs at the positive rail. However, it cannot operate down to the negative rail. Using split supply voltages for $\\mathrm{IC}_{1}$ resolves this issue. Op-amps like the LMC7101 or LMC6482 guarantee proper operation up to and beyond the positive rail (see the \"Swing to supplies?\" column in Table 4.2a on page 271). Alternatively, the op-amp could be powered from a separate $V_{+}$ voltage higher than $V_{\\mathrm{CC}}$.\n\nExercise 4.2: Determine the output current in the last circuit for a given input voltage $V_{\\text{in}}$. (Was the figure correctly annotated?)\n\nFigure 4.13 presents an intriguing variation of the op-amp-transistor current source. While a simple power MOSFET can provide substantial current, high-current FETs' large interelectrode capacitances can pose issues. Combining a low-current MOSFET with a high-current npn power transistor offers the advantage of zero base current error (a feature of FETs) and significantly reduced input capacitance. This circuit, analogous to the \"complementary Darlington\" (or Sziklai circuit; see §2.4.2A), activates the bipolar transistor $Q_{2}$ when the output current exceeds about 20 mA.\n\nTo avoid misconceptions, it's important to note that the simpler MOSFET-only circuit (similar to Figure 4.12B) is often preferable, given the significant drawbacks of power BJTs, such as their susceptibility to \"second breakdown\" and limited safe operating area (as discussed in §3.5.1B, particularly Figure 3.95). Large power MOSFETs have substantial input capacitance, so using a network like Figure 4.13's $R_{3}C_{1}$ is advisable to prevent oscillation.\n\n#### B. Howland Current Source\n\nFigure 4.14 illustrates a classic \"textbook\" current source. If the resistors are selected such that $R_{3}/R_{2} = R_{4}/R_{1}$, it can be demonstrated that $I_{\\text{load}} = -V_{\\text{in}}/R_{2}$.\n\nExercise 4.3: Prove the correctness of the preceding result.\n\n[^19] Image Description: The circuit is a Howland current source. Precise resistor matching is crucial for ideal current source behavior. The output current is given by $I_{\\text{out}} = -V_{\\text{in}}/R_{2}$. The output impedance is sensitive to resistor ratio mismatches.\n\nFigure 4.14. Howland Current Source.\n\nWhile this concept is appealing, there is a caveat: the resistor ratios must be precisely matched; otherwise, the current source is not perfect. Additionally, its performance is constrained by the op-amp's common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR, see §2.3.8). For high output currents, the resistors must be low in value, limiting compliance. At high frequencies (where loop gain is low, as will be discussed shortly), the output impedance can drop from the ideal infinite value to as low as a few hundred ohms (the op-amp's open-loop output impedance). These limitations restrict the practicality of this otherwise clever circuit.\n\nBy grounding $R_{1}$ (where $V_{\\text{in}}$ is applied) and connecting the control input voltage $V_{\\text{in}}$ to $R_{2}$, this circuit can be converted into a noninverting current source.\n\nFigure 4.15 offers an enhancement to the Howland circuit by sourcing the output current through a sense resistor $R_{\\mathrm{S}}$, whose value can be independently chosen from the matched resistor array (comprising resistor pairs $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$). The best way to comprehend this circuit is to consider $\\mathrm{IC}_{1}$ as a difference amplifier that samples the voltage drop across $R_{\\mathrm{S}}$ (i.e., the current), which is then buffered by follower $\\mathrm{IC}_{2}$ to eliminate current error.\n\nFor this configuration, you can leverage the internal precision matched resistors of an integrated difference amplifier, such as an INA106 for $R_{1}$, $R_{2}$, and $\\mathrm{IC}_{1}$, wired \"backwards\" (for $G=0.1$) to minimize the voltage drop across the sense resistor.

Batteries might be a viable solution. Other approaches to this issue are discussed in Chapter 9 (§9.3.14) under constant-current power supplies.\n\n#### A. Current Sources for Loads Returned to Ground\n\nUtilizing an op-amp and an external transistor, one can create a straightforward, high-quality current source for a grounded load. With additional circuitry, a programming input referenced to ground can be incorporated (Figure 4.12). In the initial circuit, feedback maintains a voltage $V_{\\mathrm{CC}} - V_{\\text{in}}$ across $R$, resulting in an emitter current (and thus an output current) $I_{E} = (V_{\\mathrm{CC}} - V_{\\text{in}}) / R$. There are no concerns about $V_{\\mathrm{BE}}$ offsets or their variations with temperature, $I_{\\mathrm{C}}$, $V_{\\mathrm{CE}}$, etc. The current source is imperfect (disregarding op-amp errors: $I_{\\mathrm{B}}, V_{\\mathrm{OS}}$) primarily because the minor base current may vary slightly with $V_{\\mathrm{CE}}$ (assuming the op-amp draws no input current), a small compromise for the convenience of a grounded load. Using a Darlington pair for $Q_{1}$ would significantly reduce this error. This error arises because the op-amp stabilizes the emitter current, whereas the load experiences the collector current. A variant using a MOSFET instead of a bipolar transistor eliminates this issue entirely, as FETs do not draw dc gate current (though large power MOSFETs have substantial input capacitance, which can pose problems; see the comment at the end of this subsection).\n\nIn this circuit, the output current is proportional to the voltage drop below $V_{\\mathrm{CC}}$ applied to the op-amp's noninverting input, meaning the programming voltage is referenced to $V_{\\mathrm{CC}}$. This is suitable if $V_{\\text{in}}$ is a fixed voltage from a voltage divider but inconvenient for an external input. The second circuit remedies this by using a similar current source with an npn transistor to convert an input voltage (referenced to ground) to a $V_{\\mathrm{CC}}$-referenced input for the final current source. This circuit employs a $p$-channel MOSFET for variety and to eliminate the small base-current error inherent in bipolar transistors. Op-amps and transistors are cost-effective, so don't hesitate to use extra components to enhance performance or convenience in circuit design.\n\nAn important note: at low output currents, the voltage across the emitter (or source) resistors may be minimal, necessitating op-amps capable of operating with their inputs near or at the positive supply voltage. For example, in Figure 4.12B, $\\mathrm{IC}_{2}$ must function with its inputs close to the positive supply rail. Always verify this capability in the op-amp's datasheet. The LF411's datasheet is somewhat ambiguous but acknowledges limited functionality at the positive rail. Conversely, op-amps like the LMC7101 or LMC6482 guarantee proper operation up to and beyond the positive rail. Alternatively, the op-amp could be powered by a separate $V_{+}$ voltage higher than $V_{\\mathrm{CC}}$.\n\nFigure 4.13 showcases a unique variation of the op-amp-transistor current source. While a simple power MOSFET can provide substantial current, high-current FETs' large interelectrode capacitances can cause issues. Combining a low-current MOSFET with a high-current npn power transistor offers zero base current error (a FET advantage) and significantly reduced input capacitance. This circuit, akin to the \"complementary Darlington\" (or Sziklai circuit; see §2.4.2A), activates the bipolar transistor $Q_{2}$ when the output current exceeds about 20 mA.\n\nTo avoid misconceptions, it's essential to note that the simpler MOSFET-only circuit (as in Figure 4.12B) is often preferable, considering the significant drawback of power BJTs—susceptibility to \"second breakdown\" and limited safe operating area (as discussed in §3.5.1B, particularly Figure 3.95). Large power MOSFETs have high input capacitance, so incorporating a network like Figure 4.13's $R_{3}C_{1}$ is advisable to prevent oscillation.\n\n#### B. Howland Current Source\n\nFigure 4.14 illustrates a classic \"textbook\" current source. If the resistors are selected such that $R_{3} / R_{2} = R_{4} / R_{1}$, it can be demonstrated that $I_{\\text{load}} = -V_{\\text{in}} / R_{2}$.\n\nA notable challenge with this circuit is the necessity for precise resistor ratio matching; otherwise, it fails to function as an ideal current source. Additionally, its performance is constrained by the op-amp's common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR, §2.3.8). For high output currents, the resistors must be low in value, limiting compliance. At high frequencies, where loop gain is low, the output impedance can drop from the ideal infinite value to as low as a few hundred ohms (the op-amp's open-loop output impedance), restricting the circuit's applicability.\n\nThis circuit can be transformed into a noninverting current source by grounding $R_{1}$ (where $V_{\\text{in}}$ is applied) and instead applying the control input voltage $V_{\\text{in}}$ to $R_{2}$.\n\nFigure 4.15 presents an enhancement of the Howland circuit, as the output current is sourced through a sense resistor $R_{\\mathrm{S}}$, whose value can be independently chosen from the matched resistor array (comprising resistor pairs $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$).

    "text": "The circuit depicted in Figure 4.10 emulates an ideal current source without the $V_{\\mathrm{BE}}$ offset inherent in transistor-based current sources. Negative feedback ensures that $V_{\\text{in}}$ is present at the inverting input, resulting in a current $I = V_{\\text{in}} / R$ through the load. A significant drawback of this configuration is the \"floating\" load, which is not grounded on either side. This precludes the generation of a functional sawtooth wave relative to ground using this current source. One potential solution is to float the entire circuit, including power supplies, allowing one side of the load to be grounded (as shown in Figure 4.11). The boxed circuit represents the prior current source, with its power supplies explicitly illustrated. $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ constitute a voltage divider to establish the current. If this setup appears confusing, recall that \"ground\" is a relative concept; any point in a circuit can be designated as ground. This circuit is beneficial for producing currents into a load that returns to ground, but it has the drawback of a floating control input, preventing the output current from being programmed with an input voltage referenced to ground. Additionally, ensuring the floating power supply is genuinely isolated is crucial. For instance, using a standard wall-plug-powered dc power supply could introduce reactive currents at the 60 Hz line frequency due to transformer winding capacitance, potentially exceeding the desired microamp output current. A viable alternative could be using batteries. Other approaches to this issue are discussed in Chapter 9 (§9.3.14) under constant-current power supplies.\n\n#### A. Current Sources for Loads Returned to Ground\n\nUtilizing an op-amp and an external transistor, it is feasible to create a straightforward yet high-quality current source for a load returned to ground. With some additional circuitry, it becomes possible to employ a programming input referenced to ground (Figure 4.12). In the initial circuit, feedback ensures a voltage $V_{\\mathrm{CC}} - V_{\\text{in}}$ across $R$, yielding an emitter current (and thus an output current) $I_{E} = (V_{\\mathrm{CC}} - V_{\\text{in}}) / R$. There are no concerns about $V_{\\mathrm{BE}}$ offsets or their variations with temperature, $I_{\\mathrm{C}}$, $V_{\\mathrm{CE}}$, etc. The current source is only imperfect (disregarding op-amp errors like $I_{\\mathrm{B}}$, $V_{\\mathrm{OS}}$) due to the slight variation in base current with $V_{\\mathrm{CE}}$ (assuming the op-amp draws no input current), a minor trade-off for the convenience of a grounded load. Using a Darlington pair for $Q_{1}$ would significantly reduce this error. This error arises because the op-amp stabilizes the emitter current, while the load experiences the collector current. A variant of this circuit using a MOSFET instead of a bipolar transistor eliminates this issue entirely, as FETs do not draw dc gate current (though large power MOSFETs have substantial input capacitance, which can pose problems; see the comment at the end of this subsection).\n\nIn this circuit, the output current is proportional to the voltage drop below $V_{\\mathrm{CC}}$ applied to the op-amp's noninverting input; in other words, the programming voltage is referenced to $V_{\\mathrm{CC}}$. This is acceptable if $V_{\\text{in}}$ is a fixed voltage from a voltage divider but inconvenient if an external input is used. The second circuit remedies this by employing a similar current source with an npn transistor to convert an input voltage (referenced to ground) to a $V_{\\mathrm{CC}}$-referenced input for the final current source. For this, a $p$-channel MOSFET is used for variety and to eliminate the small base-current error associated with bipolar transistors. Op-amps and transistors are cost-effective, so don't hesitate to use extra components to enhance performance or convenience in circuit design.\n\nAn important note about these circuits: at low output currents, the voltage across the emitter (or source) resistors may be minimal, necessitating op-amps capable of operating with their inputs near or at the positive supply voltage. For instance, in Figure 4.12B, $\\mathrm{IC}_{2}$ must function with its inputs close to the positive supply rail. Always verify this capability in the op-amp's datasheet. The LF411's datasheet is somewhat ambiguous but acknowledges that it can operate, albeit with reduced performance, with inputs at the positive rail (though it cannot work down to the negative rail). Conversely, op-amps like the LMC7101 or LMC6482 guarantee proper operation up to and beyond the positive rail. Alternatively, the op-amp could be powered from a higher $V_{+}$ voltage than $V_{\\mathrm{CC}}$.\n\nExercise 4.2: Determine the output current in the last circuit for a given input voltage $V_{\\text{in}}$. Verify if the figure is correct.\n\nFigure 4.13 showcases a unique variation of the op-amp-transistor current source. While a simple power MOSFET can provide substantial current, high-current FETs' large interelectrode capacitances can cause issues. Combining a low-current MOSFET with a high-current npn power transistor offers the benefits of zero base current error (typical of FETs) and significantly reduced input capacitance. This circuit, analogous to the \"complementary Darlington\" (or Sziklai circuit; see §2.4.2A), activates the bipolar transistor $Q_{2}$ when the output current exceeds about 20 mA.\n\nTo avoid misconceptions, it's important to note that the simpler MOSFET-only circuit (similar to Figure 4.12B) is often preferable, given the significant drawbacks of power BJTs, such as susceptibility to \"second breakdown\" and limitations on the safe operating area (as discussed in §3.5.1B, particularly Figure 3.95). Large power MOSFETs have high input capacitance, so using a network like Figure 4.13's $R_{3}C_{1}$ is advisable to prevent oscillation.\n\n#### B. Howland Current Source\n\nFigure 4.14 illustrates a classic \"textbook\" current source. If the resistors are selected such that $R_{3}/R_{2} = R_{4}/R_{1}$, it can be demonstrated that $I_{\\text{load}} = -V_{\\text{in}}/R_{2}$.\n\nExercise 4.3: Prove the correctness of the preceding result.\n\n[^19] Image Name: Figure 4.14.

Precise matching of resistor ratios is crucial for it to function as an ideal current source. The output current is given by $I_{\\text{out}} = -V_{\\text{in}}/R_{2}$. The output impedance is affected by any mismatch in resistor ratios.\n\nFigure 4.14. Howland Current Source.\n\nWhile this sounds ideal, there's a catch: the resistor ratios must be precisely matched; otherwise, the current source is not perfect. Even with exact matching, its performance is constrained by the op-amp's common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR, see §2.3.8). For large output currents, the resistors must be small, limiting compliance. Additionally, at high frequencies (where loop gain is low), the output impedance can drop significantly from the desired infinite value to as low as a few hundred ohms (the op-amp's open-loop output impedance). These limitations restrict the circuit's applicability.\n\nThis circuit can be converted to a noninverting current source by grounding $R_{1}$ (where $V_{\\text{in}}$ is shown) and applying the control input voltage $V_{\\text{in}}$ to $R_{2}$ instead.\n\nFigure 4.15 presents an enhancement of the Howland circuit, as the output current is sourced through a sense resistor $R_{\\mathrm{S}}$, whose value can be independently chosen from the matched resistor array (with resistor pairs $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$). The best way to understand this circuit is to consider $\\mathrm{IC}_{1}$ as a difference amplifier that samples the voltage drop across $R_{\\mathrm{S}}$ (i.e., the current), which is then buffered by follower $\\mathrm{IC}_{2}$, ensuring no current error.\n\nFor this configuration, leveraging the internal precision matched resistors of an integrated difference amplifier, such as an INA106 for $R_{1}$, $R_{2}$, and $\\mathrm{IC}_{1}$, wired \"backwards\" (for $G=0.1$), can reduce the voltage drop across the sense resistor.

Even with $V_{\\text{in}}$ exactly at zero volts, the output tends to drift due to op-amp imperfections like non-zero input current and \"offset voltage.\" These issues can be minimized by carefully selecting the op-amp and circuit values, but typically, a method to reset the integrator is necessary.

Using a feedback resistor (Figure 4.18D) provides stable biasing by restoring dc feedback (making the circuit behave like a high-gain inverting amplifier), but this reduces the integrator's effectiveness at very low frequencies, $f < 1 / R_f C$. An additional series analog switch at the input (Figure 4.18C) enables control over the integrator's active intervals; when open, the integrator output remains at its last value.\n\nIf the integrator is part of a larger circuit that appropriately manages it, reset concerns are unnecessary.

These flaws, though minor (with bias currents often in picoamps and offset voltages below a millivolt), can problematic in integrator circuits, where small errors amplify over time.

Remarkably, the circuit performs calculus without formal instruction!\n\nObservant readers may have noticed the absence of feedback at dc in this circuit, meaning there's no stable quiescent point: any nonzero $V_{\\text{in}}$ causes the output to drift. Even with $V_{\\text{in}}$ precisely at zero volts, the output tends to drift due to op-amp imperfections (non-zero input current and \"offset voltage\"). These issues can be minimized by carefully selecting the op-amp and circuit values; however, you typically need a method to reset the integrator. Figure 4.18 demonstrates common reset methods, either using a reset switch (with both discrete JFET and integrated CMOS analog switch examples)\nimage_name:Figure 4.17. Integrator waveforms\ndescription:The graph titled \"Figure 4.17. Integrator waveforms\" displays time-domain waveforms for an integrator circuit. It consists of two plots: an input and an output waveform.\n\n1. **Type of Graph and Function:**\n- This is a time-domain waveform graph depicting the behavior of an integrator circuit.\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n- The horizontal axis represents time, with a scale of 10 milliseconds per division.\n- The vertical axis for the input waveform is labeled as \"input\" with a scale of 0.5 volts per division.\n- The vertical axis for the output waveform is labeled as \"output\" with a scale of 5 volts per division.\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- **Input Waveform:** The input shows a step-like behavior, with initial low voltage, followed by a rise, a plateau, a drop, and another rise.\n- **Output Waveform:** The output demonstrates integration of the input signal. It starts at a low level, rises linearly corresponding to the positive step in the input, reaches a peak, then decreases with a negative slope during the input plateau, and rises again with the final input rise.\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The output waveform integrates the input signal, resulting in a linear increase or decrease in voltage corresponding to the positive or negative steps in the input.\n- The output voltage changes are significantly larger in magnitude than the input changes, reflecting the integrative function of the circuit.\n- The waveform shows characteristic integration behavior with smooth transitions and slopes correlating to the input signal changes.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- There are no specific annotations or markers on the graph, but the division scales provide reference points for measuring voltage and time changes.\n- The graph effectively illustrates how the integrator circuit responds to step changes in the input signal.\n\nFigure 4.17. Integrator waveforms. The output can drift arbitrarily, unlike our simple $R C$ \"integrator\" of §1.4.4. Horizontal: $10 \\text{ms/div}$.\nor by incorporating a large-value feedback resistor across the integrating capacitor. Closing the reset switch (Figures 4.18A,B) quickly discharges the capacitor, resetting the integrator, while allowing perfect integration when open. Using a feedback resistor (Figure 4.18D) provides stable biasing by restoring feedback at dc (making the circuit behave like a high-gain inverting amplifier), but this affects the integrator action at very low frequencies, $f < 1 / R_f C$. An additional series analog switch at the input (Figure 4.18C) allows control over the integrator's active intervals; when open, the integrator output remains at its last value.\n\nIf the integrator is part of a larger circuit that appropriately manages it, resetting is unnecessary. We will soon explore a sophisticated example (§4.3.3), a triangle-wave generator, where an uncontrolled integrator is ideal.\n\nThis initial examination of the op-amp integrator assumes an ideal op-amp, specifically that (a) the inputs draw no current, and (b) both inputs are at exactly the same voltage. In reality, op-amps have some input current (known as \"bias current,\" $I_B$) and exhibit some voltage imbalance (called \"offset voltage,\" $V_{OS}$). These imperfections, though small—bias currents of picoamps and offset voltages less than a millivolt—are significant in circuits like integrators, where small errors accumulate over time. We will address these crucial topics later in the chapter (§4.4), once the basics are well understood.\n\n[^20]image_name:A.\ndescription:\n[\nname: JFET, type: Other, ports: {N1: InN1(A1), N2: Out(A1)}\nname: C, type: Capacitor, value: C, ports: {Np: InN1(A1), Nn: Out(A1)}\nname: A1, type: OpAmp, value: A1, ports: {InP: GND, InN: InN(A1), OutP: Out(A1), OutN:}\nname: R, type: Resistor, value: R, ports: {N1: InN(A1), N2: InN1(A1)}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit is an op-amp integrator with a reset switch using a JFET for resetting.

The circuit utilizes a capacitor to enhance the input impedance, thereby improving the op-amp's performance with AC-coupled inputs.\n\nFigure 4.21. Op-amp follower with bootstrap.\n\n#### Follower with Bootstrap\n\nSimilar to transistor amplifiers, the biasing path can hinder the high input impedance achievable with an op-amp, especially with ac-coupled inputs that necessitate a resistor connected to ground. In such cases, the bootstrap circuit shown in Figure 4.21 may be an appropriate solution. Similar to the transistor bootstrap circuit (\\$2.4.3\\$), the $0.1 \\mu \\mathrm{~F}$ capacitor causes the upper 1 M resistor to appear as a high-impedance current source for input signals. The low-frequency cutoff for this circuit occurs at roughly 10 Hz, dropping at 12 dB per octave for frequencies below this level. ${ }^{9}$ The circuit may exhibit some frequency peaking, akin to the Sallen-and-Key circuit in §4.3.6; this can be addressed by incorporating a resistor of $1-10 \\mathrm{k}$ in series with the feedback capacitor.\n\nFET-input op-amps typically have an extremely low input current, leading to high input impedance, rendering bootstrapping unnecessary. In ac-coupled amplifiers, you can use 10 M or higher resistors for the input bias path.\n\n#### Ideal Current-to-Voltage Converter\n\nRecall that the simple resistor serves as the most basic converter from current to voltage. However, it has the drawback of presenting a non-zero impedance to the source of input current, which can be detrimental if the source device offers limited compliance or does not maintain a constant current as output voltage changes. A typical example is a photovoltaic cell, a diode junction optimized for light detection. Even the common signal diodes used in circuits exhibit a minor photovoltaic effect (there are intriguing stories of circuit anomalies traced back to this phenomenon). Figure 4.22 illustrates the proper method to convert current to voltage while maintaining the input at ground. The inverting input is a virtual ground, which is beneficial, as a photovoltaic diode can produce only a few tenths\n\n[^22]image_name:Figure 4.22 Photodiode amplifier\ndescription:\n[\nname: Rf, type: Resistor, value: 1M, ports: {N1: Vout, N2: InN(A1)}\nname: A1, type: OpAmp, ports: {InP: GND, InN: InN(A1), OutP: Vout}\nname: D1, type: Diode, ports: {Na: InN(A1), Nc: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:Figure 4.22 features a photodiode amplifier circuit with a transresistance configuration. It converts the current from the photodiode into a voltage output, where Vout = Rf * ID = 1 volt/μA.\n\nFigure 4.22. Photodiode amplifier.\n\nOf course, this transresistance configuration is equally suitable for devices sourcing current from a positive excitation voltage, such as $V_{\\mathrm{CC}}$. Photodiodes and phototransistors (devices sourcing current from a positive supply when exposed to light) are often utilized this way (Figure 4.23). The photodiode exhibits lower photocurrent but excels in linearity and speed; extremely fast photodiodes can operate at gigahertz speeds. Conversely, the phototransistor has a higher photocurrent (due to the transistor beta, which increases the natural collector-to-base photocurrent), with poorer linearity and speed. Photo-Darlingtons, which extend this trend, can also be obtained.\n\nIn practical applications, it is usually necessary to include a small capacitor across the feedback resistor to ensure stability (i.e., to prevent oscillation or ringing). This is because the capacitance of the detector, combined with the feedback resistor, forms a low-pass filter; the resulting lagging phase shift at high frequencies, combined with the op-amp's own lagging phase shift, can accumulate to $180^{\\circ}$, leading to overall positive feedback and, consequently, oscillation. This intriguing issue is addressed in detail in Chapter $4 x$ (\"Transresistance amplifiers\"); be sure to carefully read that section if you are constructing amplifiers for photodiodes. (Similar stability issues arise when driving capacitive loads with op-amps; see §4.6.1B).\n\nExercise 4.5: Design a \"perfect\" current meter (one with zero input impedance) with a 5 mA full scale using a 411 and a 1 mA (full scale) meter.

Point $X$ is a virtual ground, thus the input current is $V_{1} / R_{1}+V_{2} / R_{2}+V_{3} / R_{3}$. With identical resistor values, you obtain $V_{\\text {out }}=-\\left(V_{1}+V_{2}+V_{3}\\right)$. Note that the inputs can be either positive or negative. Additionally, the input resistors do not need to be equal; if they are not, you get a weighted sum. For instance, with four inputs, each could be +1 volt or zero, representing binary values $1,2,4$, and 8. By employing input resistors of $10 \\mathrm{k}, 5 \\mathrm{k}, 2.5 \\mathrm{k}$, and 1.25 k, you will receive a negative output in volts equivalent to the binary count input. This arrangement can be easily expanded to several digit-\n\nimage_name:Figure 4.24. Summing amplifier\ndescription:\n[\nname: R1, type: Resistor, value: 10k, ports: {N1: V1, N2: X}\nname: R2, type: Resistor, value: 10k, ports: {N1: V2, N2: X}\nname: R3, type: Resistor, value: 10k, ports: {N1: V3, N2: X}\nname: Rf, type: Resistor, value: 10k, ports: {N1: X, N2: Vout}\nname: A1, type: OpAmp, value: A1, ports: {InP: GND, InN: X, OutP: Vout, OutN: ''}\n]\nextrainfo:This is a summing amplifier circuit. The output voltage Vout is given by the equation Vout = -Rf * (V1/R1 + V2/R2 + V3/R3), where Rf is the feedback resistor and R1, R2, R3 are the input resistors.\n\nFigure 4.24. Summing amplifier.\n\nits. It is the foundation of digital-to-analog conversion, though a different input circuit (an $R-2 R$ ladder) is usually employed.\n\nExercise 4.6: Explain how to create a two-digit digital-to-analog converter (DAC) by appropriately scaling the input resistors in a summing amplifier. The digital input represents two digits, each consisting of four lines that depict the values $1,2,4$, and 8 for the respective digits. An input line is either at +1 volt or ground, i.e., the eight input lines represent $1,2,4,8,10,20,40$, and 80. With $\\pm 15 \\mathrm{~V}$ supplies, the op-amp's outputs typically cannot exceed $\\pm 13$ volts; hence, you must accept an output in volts equal to one-tenth the value of the input number.\n\n#### Power Booster\n\nFor achieving high output current, a power transistor follower can be connected to an op-amp output (Figure 4.25). In this case, a non-inverting amplifier is depicted, although a follower can be added to any op-amp configuration. Note that feedback is taken from the emitter; therefore, feedback enforces the desired output voltage despite the $V_{\\mathrm{BE}}$ drop. This circuit experiences the usual issue that the follower output can only source current. As with transistor circuits, the solution is a push-pull booster (Figure 4.26). We will see later that the op-amp's limited speed at which it can move its output (slew rate) significantly restricts the booster's speed in the crossover region, causing distortion. For slow-speed applications, it is not necessary to bias the push-pull pair into quiescent conduction, as feedback will handle most of the crossover distortion. Complete power booster ICs are available, such as the LT1010 and BUF633/4.

Op-amp follower with bootstrap.\n\n#### Follower with Bootstrap\n\nBiasing paths can degrade the high input impedance typically associated with op-amps, especially with AC-coupled inputs, where a resistor to ground is necessary. If this poses a challenge, the bootstrap circuit in Figure 4.21 can be employed as a solution. The 0.1 µF capacitor makes the upper 1 M resistor appear as a high-impedance current source for input signals. The circuit's low-frequency cutoff is approximately 10 Hz, with a 12 dB per octave roll-off for frequencies below this. Frequency peaking, similar to the Sallen-and-Key circuit in §4.3.6, may occur and can be mitigated by adding a resistor of 1-10 kΩ in series with the feedback capacitor.\n\nLow-input current (and correspondingly high input impedance) of FET-input op-amps often makes bootstrapping redundant; for AC-coupled amplifiers, 10 MΩ or larger resistors can be used for the input bias path.\n\n#### Ideal Current-to-Voltage Converter\n\nThe simple resistor serves as the most basic current-to-voltage (I-to-V) converter. However, it introduces non-zero impedance to the current source, which can be detrimental if the source lacks compliance or maintains a constant current as the output voltage changes. A photovoltaic cell, a diode junction optimized as a light detector, is an example. Standard signal diodes also exhibit a minor photovoltaic effect. Figure 4.22 illustrates the proper method to convert current to voltage while keeping the input grounded, with the inverting input functioning as a virtual ground.\n\nFigure 4.22.

The inputs can be positive or negative, and the input resistors do not need to be equal; an unequal resistor value results in a weighted sum. For example, with four inputs representing binary values 1, 2, 4, and 8, using input resistors of 10 kΩ, 5 kΩ, 2.5 kΩ, and 1.25 kΩ yields an output voltage in volts equal to the binary count input.\n\n---\n\n#### (Continued) ...\n\n---\n\n(image_name:Figure 4.24.

An input line is either at +1 volt or at ground, representing binary values 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 20, 40, and 80. With ±15 V supplies, the op-amp's outputs generally cannot swing beyond ±13 volts; an output in volts equal to one-tenth the value of the input number must be used.\n\n---\n\n#### (Continued) ...\n\n---\n\n#### Power Booster\n\nFor high output current, a power transistor follower can be added to an op-amp output (Figure 4.25). Although a noninverting amplifier is depicted, a follower can be added to any op-amp configuration. Feedback is taken from the emitter, ensuring the desired output voltage despite the VBE drop. The main issue is that the follower output can only source current.

    "text": "#### A. Optional Inverter\n\nIn Figure 4.19, the circuits permit inversion or amplification without inversion by toggling a switch. The voltage gain can be either +1 or -1, depending on the switch's position. These \"switches\" can be CMOS analog switches ${ }^{8}$, which allow control of the inversion sense through a digital signal. The innovative variation in Figure 4.20 enables continuous adjustment of gain from follower to inverter. When the potentiometer $R_{1}$ is at its midpoint, the circuit remains inactive.\n\nExercise 4.4. Demonstrate that the circuits in Figure 4.19 function as described.\n\n#### B. Follower with Bootstrap\n\nSimilar to transistor amplifiers, the bias path in op-amps can compromise the high input impedance, particularly with AC-coupled inputs that require a resistor to ground. The bootstrap circuit in Figure 4.21 offers a solution to this issue. Like the transistor bootstrap circuit (\\$2.4.3\\), the $0.1 \\mu \\mathrm{~F}$ capacitor makes the upper 1 M resistor appear as a high-impedance current source to input signals. The low-frequency rolloff for this circuit begins at around 10 Hz, decreasing at 12 dB per octave for frequencies below this. The circuit may exhibit frequency peaking, similar to the Sallen-and-Key circuit of §4.3.6; this can be mitigated by adding a resistor of $1-10 \\mathrm{k}$ in series with the feedback capacitor.\n\nThe very low input current (and thus high input impedance) of FET-input op-amps generally renders bootstrapping unnecessary; you can use 10 M or larger resistors for the input bias path in AC-coupled amplifiers.\n\n#### C. Ideal Current-to-Voltage Converter\n\nRecall that the resistor is the simplest $I$-to-$V$ converter. However, it has the disadvantage of presenting a non-zero impedance to the source of input current; this can be detrimental if the device providing the input current has very little compliance or does not produce a constant current as the output voltage changes. A good example is a photovoltaic cell, a diode junction optimized as a light detector. Even common signal diodes used in circuits have a small photovoltaic effect (there are amusing stories of bizarre circuit behavior finally traced to this effect). Figure 4.22 shows the proper way to convert current to voltage while keeping the input strictly at ground. The inverting input is a virtual ground; this is fortunate because a photovoltaic diode can generate only a few tenths of a volt.\n\nThis particular circuit has an output of 1 volt per microamp of input current. (With BJT-input op-amps, you sometimes see a resistor connected between the non-inverting input and ground; its function will be explained shortly in connection with op-amp shortcomings.)\n\nOf course, this transresistance configuration can be used equally well for devices that source their current from some positive excitation voltage, such as $V_{\\mathrm{CC}}$. Photodiodes and phototransistors (both devices that source current from a positive supply when exposed to light) are often used this way (Figure 4.23). The photodiode has lower photocurrent but excels in linearity and speed; very fast photodiodes can operate at gigahertz speeds. By contrast, the phototransistor has a considerably higher photocurrent (owing to transistor beta, which boosts the native collector-to-base photocurrent), with poorer linearity and speed. You can even get photo-Darlingtons, which extend this trend.\n\nIn real-world applications, it is usually necessary to include a small capacitor across the feedback resistor to ensure stability (i.e., prevent oscillation or ringing). This is because the capacitance of the detector, in combination with the feedback resistor, forms a lowpass filter; the resulting lagging phase shift at high frequencies, combined with the op-amp's own lagging phase shift (see §4.9.3), can add up to $180^{\\circ}$, thus producing overall positive feedback and causing oscillation. We treat this interesting problem in some detail in Chapter $4 x$ (\"Transresistance amplifiers\"); be sure to read that section carefully if you are building amplifiers for photodiodes. (And analogous stability problems occur, for similar reasons, when you drive capacitive loads with op-amps; see §4.6.1B).\n\nExercise 4.5. Use a 411 and a 1 mA (full scale) meter to construct a \"perfect\" current meter (i.e., one with zero input impedance) with 5 mA full scale. Design the circuit so that the meter will never be driven more than $\\pm 150 \\%$ full scale. Assume that the 411 output can swing to $\\pm 13$ volts ( $\\pm 15 \\mathrm{~V}$ supplies) and that the meter has $500 \\Omega$ internal resistance.\n\n#### D. Summing Amplifier\n\nThe circuit shown in Figure 4.24 is a variation of the inverting amplifier. Point $X$ is a virtual ground, so the input current is $V_{1} / R_{1}+V_{2} / R_{2}+V_{3} / R_{3}$. With equal resistor values, you get $V_{\\text {out }}=-\\left(V_{1}+V_{2}+V_{3}\\right)$. Note that the inputs can be positive or negative. Also, the input resistors need not be equal; if they're unequal, you get a weighted sum. For instance, you could have four inputs, each of which is +1 volt or zero, representing binary values $1,2,4$, and 8 . By using input resistors of $10 \\mathrm{k}, 5 \\mathrm{k}, 2.5 \\mathrm{k}$, and 1.25 k , you will get a negative output in volts equal to the binary count input. This scheme can be easily expanded to several digits. It is the basis of digital-to-analog conversion, although a different input circuit (an $R-2 R$ ladder) is usually used.\n\nExercise 4.6. Show how to make a two-digit digital-to-analog converter (DAC) by appropriately scaling the input resistors in a summing amplifier. The digital input represents two digits, each consisting of four lines that represent the values $1,2,4$, and 8 for the respective digits. An input line is either at +1 volt or at ground, i.e., the eight input lines represent $1,2,4,8,10,20,40$, and 80 . With $\\pm 15 \\mathrm{~V}$ supplies, the op-amp's outputs generally cannot swing beyond $\\pm 13$ volts; you will have to settle for an output in volts equal to one-tenth the value of the input number.\n\n#### E. Power Booster\n\nFor high output current, a power transistor follower can be hung on an op-amp output (Figure 4.25). In this case, a non-inverting amplifier has been drawn, though a follower can be added to any op-amp configuration. Notice that feedback is taken from the emitter; thus feedback enforces the desired output voltage in spite of the $V_{\\mathrm{BE}}$ drop. This circuit has the usual problem that the follower output can only source current. As with transistor circuits, the remedy is a push-pull booster (Figure 4.26). We'll see later that the limited speed with which the op-amp can move its output (slew rate) seriously limits the speed of this booster in the crossover region, creating distortion. For slow-speed applications, you don't need to bias the push-pull pair into quiescent conduction because feedback will take care of most of the crossover distortion. Complete power booster ICs are available, e.g., the LT1010 and BUF633/4. These are unity-gain push-pull amplifiers capable of 200 mA of output current, and operation to $20-100 \\mathrm{MHz}$ (see $\\S 5.8 .4$, and also the discussion (and table) of unity-gain buffers in Chapter $4 x$.); they are carefully biased for low open-loop crossover distortion and include on-chip protection (current limit, and often thermal shutdown as well). As long as you ensure that the op-amp driving them has significantly less bandwidth, you can include them inside the feedback loop without any worries. ${ }^{10}$\n\n#### Feedback and the Push-Pull Booster\n\nThe push-pull booster circuit illustrates the linearizing effect of negative feedback nicely. We hooked up an LF411 op-amp as a non-inverting unity-gain follower, driving a BJT push-pull output stage, and loaded the output with a $10 \\Omega$ resistor to ground. Figure 4.27 shows the output signals at the op-amp and at the load, with an input sinewave of 1 V amplitude at 125 Hz . For the upper pair of traces, we (foolishly) took the feedback from the op-amp's output, which produced a fine replica of the input signal; but the load sees severe crossover distortion (from the $2 V_{\\mathrm{BE}}$ dead zone). With the feedback coming from the push-pull output (where the load is connected), we get what we want, as seen in the lower pair of traces. The op-amp cleverly creates an exaggerated waveform to drive the push-pull follower, with precisely the right shape to compensate for the crossover.\n\nFigure 4.28 shows what these waveforms look like when we try driving an actual loudspeaker, a load that is more complicated than a resistor (because it's both a \"motor\" and a \"generator,\" it exhibits resonances and other nasty properties; it's also got a reactive crossover network, and an inductive coil to propel the cone). Once again, the magic of feedback does the job, this time with an op-amp output that is charmingly unsymmetrical. ${ }^{11}$\n\n#### F. Power Supply\n\nAn op-amp can provide the gain for a feedback voltage regulator (Figure 4.29). The op-amp compares a sample of the output with the zener reference, changing the drive to the Darlington \"pass transistor\" as needed. This circuit supplies a stable 10-volt output (\"regulated\") at up to 1-amp load current. Some notes about this circuit:\n\n- The voltage divider that samples the output could be a potentiometer, for adjustable output voltage.\n- For reduced ripple at the zener, the 10 k resistor should be replaced with a current source. Another approach is to bias the zener from the output; that way, you take advantage of the regulator you have built. Caution: when using this trick, you must analyze the circuit carefully to be sure it will start up when power is first applied.\n- We used a rail-to-rail op-amp, which can swing its output to the positive rail, ${ }^{12}$ so that the input voltage can go as low as +12 V without putting the Darlington pass transistor into saturation. With a 411, by contrast, you would have to allow another $1.5-2 \\mathrm{~V}$ of margin because the op-amp's output cannot get closer than that to the positive supply rail.\n- The circuit as drawn could be damaged by a temporary short circuit across the output because the op-amp would attempt to drive the Darlington pair into heavy conduction. Regulated power supplies should always have circuitry to limit \"fault\" current (see §9.1.1C for more details).\n- Without the \"compensation capacitor\" $C_{\\mathrm{C}}$, the circuit would likely oscillate when the dc\nI apologize, but the length of the text you've provided exceeds the capacity for rephrasing within a single response. It would be best to break down the text into smaller sections or provide a specific section you'd like me to rephrase. Could\nCertainlystood.

It uses a capacitor to increase the input impedance, enhancing the performance of the op-amp when AC-coupled inputs are present.\n\nFigure 4.21. Op-amp follower with bootstrap.\n\n#### B. Follower with Bootstrap\n\nSimilar to transistor amplifiers, the bias path can diminish the high input impedance that an op-amp normally offers, especially for ac-coupled inputs, which require a resistor to ground. Should this be problematic, the bootstrap circuit presented in Figure 4.21 offers a potential resolution. As with the transistor bootstrap circuit (\\$2.4.3\\$), the $0.1 \\mu \\mathrm{~F}$ capacitor causes the upper 1 M resistor to appear as a high-impedance current source to input signals. The low-frequency cutoff for this circuit commences at roughly 10 Hz, descending at 12 dB per octave for frequencies below this. ${ }^{9}$ The circuit may exhibit some frequency peaking, akin to the Sallen-and-Key circuit of §4.3.6; this can be controlled by inserting a resistor of $1-10 \\mathrm{k}$ in series with the feedback capacitor.\n\nThe exceptionally low input current (and correspondingly high input impedance) of FET-input op-amps typically make bootstrapping unnecessary; larger resistors, such as 10 M or more, can be used for the input bias path in ac-coupled amplifiers.\n\n#### C. Ideal Current-to-Voltage Converter\n\nRecall that a simple resistor serves as the most basic $I$-to-$V$ converter. However, it possesses the drawback of presenting a non-zero impedance to the source of input current; this can be critical if the device providing the input current lacks compliance or does not supply a constant current as the output voltage varies. A prime example is a photovoltaic cell, a diode junction optimized for light detection. Even common signal diodes employed in circuits exhibit a minor photovoltaic effect (there are entertaining stories of peculiar circuit behavior eventually traced to this effect). Figure 4.22 demonstrates the proper method to convert current to voltage while maintaining the input at ground. The inverting input is a virtual ground; this is advantageous because a photovoltaic diode can generate only a few tenths\n\n[^22]image_name:Figure 4.22 Photodiode amplifier\ndescription:\n[\nname: Rf, type: Resistor, value: 1M, ports: {N1: Vout, N2: InN(A1)}\nname: A1, type: OpAmp, ports: {InP: GND, InN: InN(A1), OutP: Vout}\nname: D1, type: Diode, ports: {Na: InN(A1), Nc: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit illustrated in Figure 4.22 is a photodiode amplifier with a transresistance configuration. It converts the current from the photodiode into a voltage output, with Vout = Rf * ID = 1 volt/μA.\n\nFigure 4.22. Photodiode amplifier.\nof a volt. This particular circuit produces an output of 1 volt per microamp of input current. (With BJT-input op-amps, you may encounter a resistor connected between the non-inverting input and ground; its purpose will be explained shortly in relation to op-amp shortcomings.)\n\nNaturally, this transresistance configuration can also be utilized for devices that source current from a positive excitation voltage, such as $V_{\\mathrm{CC}}$. Photodiodes and phototransistors (both devices that source current from a positive supply when exposed to light) are often employed in this manner (Figure 4.23). The photodiode has a lower photocurrent, yet excels in linearity and speed; extremely fast photodiodes can operate at gigahertz speeds. In contrast, the phototransistor has a substantially higher photocurrent (due to the transistor beta, which amplifies the natural collector-to-base photocurrent), with poorer linearity and speed. Photo-Darlingtons can also be found, which continue this trend.\n\nIn practical applications, it is often necessary to include a small capacitor across the feedback resistor to ensure stability (i.e., to prevent oscillation or ringing). This is because the detector's capacitance, combined with the feedback resistor, creates a lowpass filter; the resulting lagging phase shift at high frequencies, combined with the op-amp's own lagging phase shift (see §4.9.3), can accumulate to $180^{\\circ}$, leading to overall positive feedback and, consequently, oscillation. We delve into this intriguing issue in detail in Chapter $4 x$ (\"Transresistance amplifiers\"); be sure to read that section carefully if you are constructing amplifiers for photodiodes. (And similar stability issues arise for driving capacitive loads with op-amps; see §4.6.1B).\n\nExercise 4.5: Construct a \"perfect\" current meter (i.e., one with zero input impedance) with a 5 mA full scale using a 411 and a 1 mA (full scale) meter.

Phototransistor used as photodiode; for variety we show it current sinking. D. Phototransistor with load resistor driving voltage follower.\n\n#### D. Summing Amplifier\n\nThe circuit presented in Figure 4.24 is essentially a variation of the inverting amplifier. Point $X$ acts as a virtual ground, meaning the input current is $V_{1} / R_{1}+V_{2} / R_{2}+V_{3} / R_{3}$. With equivalent resistor values, the output voltage is $V_{\\text {out }}=-\\left(V_{1}+V_{2}+V_{3}\\right)$. Note that the inputs can be either positive or negative. Moreover, the input resistors need not be equal; if they are unequal, a weighted sum is obtained. For example, with four inputs, each of which is +1 volt or zero, representing binary values $1,2,4$, and 8, you could achieve a negative output in volts corresponding to the binary count input. By using input resistors of $10 \\mathrm{k}, 5 \\mathrm{k}, 2.5 \\mathrm{k}$, and 1.25 k , you will get a negative output in volts equal to the binary count input. This scheme can be easily expanded to multiple digits. It is the foundation for digital-to-analog conversion, albeit a different input circuit (an $R-2 R$ ladder) is typically employed.\n\nExercise 4.6: Explain how to create a two-digit digital-to-analog converter (DAC) by appropriately scaling the input resistors in a summing amplifier. The digital input represents two digits, each consisting of four lines that represent the values $1,2,4$, and 8 for the respective digits. An input line is either at +1 volt or at ground, i.e., the eight input lines represent $1,2,4,8,10,20,40$, and 80. With $\\pm 15 \\mathrm{~V}$ supplies, the op-amp's outputs typically cannot exceed $\\pm 13$ volts; thus, an output in volts equal to one-tenth the value of the input number must be settled for.\nimage_name:Figure 4.24.

Follower with Bootstrap\n\nSimilar to transistor amplifiers, the bias path in op-amps can affect the high input impedance, especially with AC-coupled inputs that require a resistor to ground. The bootstrap circuit presented in Figure 4.21 offers a solution to this issue. Similar to the transistor bootstrap circuit, the \\( 0.1 \\mu \\mathrm{~F} \\) capacitor makes the upper 1 M resistor appear as a high-impedance current source to input signals. The low-frequency rolloff for this circuit starts at approximately 10 Hz, decreasing at 12 dB per octave for frequencies below this.

Ideal Current-to-Voltage Converter\n\nThe resistor serves as the simplest current-to-voltage (I-to-V) converter. However, it presents a non-zero impedance to the source of input current, which can be problematic if the device providing the input current has limited compliance or does not produce a constant current as the output voltage changes. A photovoltaic cell is a good example of such a device. Figure 4.22 illustrates a method to convert current to voltage while keeping the input at ground. The inverting input acts as a virtual ground, which is beneficial because a photovoltaic diode can generate only a few tenths of a volt. This particular circuit yields an output of 1 volt per microamp of input current.\n\n#### D. Summing Amplifier\n\nThe circuit in Figure 4.24 is a variation of the inverting amplifier. Point \\( X \\) is a virtual ground, so the input current is \\( V_1 / R_1 + V_2 / R_2 + V_3 / R_3 \\). With equal resistor values, the output voltage \\( V_{\\text {out }} \\) is \\( -(V_1 + V_2 + V_3) \\). Note that the inputs can be positive or negative. Additionally, the input resistors need not be equal; if they are unequal, a weighted sum is obtained. For example, you could have four inputs, each at +1 volt or zero, representing binary values 1, 2, 4, and 8. By using input resistors of \\( 10 \\mathrm{k}, 5 \\mathrm{k}, 2.5 \\mathrm{k} \\), and 1.25 k, you will get a negative output in volts equal to the binary count input.

Demonstrate how to construct a two-digit digital-to-analog converter (DAC) by appropriately scaling the input resistors in a summing amplifier. The digital input represents two digits, each consisting of four lines that represent the values 1, 2, 4, and 8 for the respective digits.

With \\( \\pm 15 \\mathrm{~V} \\) supplies, the op-amp's outputs generally cannot swing beyond \\( \\pm 13 \\) volts; you will have to settle for an output in volts equal to one-tenth the value of the input number.\n\n#### E. Power Booster\n\nFor high output current, a power transistor follower can be connected to an op-amp output (Figure 4.25). In this case, a non-inverting amplifier has been depicted, although a follower can be added to any op-amp configuration. Notice that feedback is taken from the emitter; thus, feedback enforces the desired output voltage despite the \\( V_{\\mathrm{BE}} \\) drop. This circuit has the usual limitation that the follower output can only source current. As with transistor circuits, the solution is a push-pull booster (Figure 4.26). We'll see later that the limited speed with which the op-amp can move its output (slew rate) seriously limits the speed of this booster in the crossover region, creating distortion. For slow-speed applications, you don't need to bias the push-pull pair into quiescent conduction because feedback will take care of most of the crossover distortion. Complete power booster ICs are available, e.g., the LT1010 and BUF633/4. These are unity-gain push-pull amplifiers capable of 200 mA of output current, and operation up to \\( 20-100 \\mathrm{MHz} \\) (see \\( \\S 5.8 .4 \\), and also the discussion (and table) of unity-gain buffers in Chapter \\( 4 x \\)); they are carefully biased for low open-loop crossover distortion and include on-chip protection (current limit, and often thermal shutdown as well). As long as you ensure that the op-amp driving them has significantly less bandwidth, you can include them inside the feedback loop without any concerns.\n\n#### F. Power Supply\n\nAn op-amp can provide the gain for a feedback voltage regulator (Figure 4.29). The op-amp compares a sample of the output with the zener reference, adjusting the drive to the Darlington \"pass transistor\" as necessary. This circuit supplies a stable 10-volt output (\"regulated\"), at up to 1-amp load current. Some notes on this circuit:\n\n- The voltage divider that samples the output could be a potentiometer, allowing for adjustable output voltage.\n- For reduced ripple at the zener, the 10 k resistor should be replaced with a current source. Another approach is to bias the zener from the output, taking advantage of the built-in regulator. Caution: when using this method, you must carefully analyze the circuit to ensure it will start up when power is initially applied.\n- A rail-to-rail op-amp is used, which can swing its output to the positive rail, so that the input voltage can go as low as +12 V without putting the Darlington pass transistor into saturation. With a 411, you would have to allow another \\( 1.5-2 \\mathrm{~V} \\) of margin because the op-amp's output cannot get closer than that to the positive supply rail.\n- The circuit as drawn could be damaged by a temporary short circuit across the output because the op-amp would attempt to drive the Darlington pair into heavy conduction. Regulated power supplies should always have circuitry to limit \"fault\" current (see §9.1.1C for more details).\n- Without the \"compensation capacitor\" \\( C_{\\mathrm{C}} \\), the circuit would likely oscillate when the dc output is bypassed (as it would be when powering a circuit) because of the additional lagging phase shift. Capacitor \\( C_{\\mathrm{C}} \\) ensures stability into a capacitive load, a subject we'll explore in \\( \\S \\S 4.6 .1 \\mathrm{~B} \\), 4.6.2, and 9.1.1C.\n- Integrated circuit voltage regulators are available in a wide variety, from the time-honored 723 to the convenient 3-terminal adjustable regulators with internal current limit and thermal shutdown (see §9.3). These devices, complete with temperature-compensated internal voltage reference and pass transistor, are so easy to use that you will almost never use a general-purpose op-amp as a regulator. The exception might be to generate a stable voltage within a circuit that already has a stable power supply voltage available.\n\nIn Chapter 9, we delve into voltage regulators and power supplies in detail, including special ICs designed for use as voltage regulators."

Phototransistor with load resistor driving voltage follower.\n\n#### D. Summing amplifier\n\nThe circuit depicted in Figure 4.24 is merely a variation of the inverting amplifier. Point \\( X \\) is a virtual ground, so the input current is \\( V_1/R_1 + V_2/R_2 + V_3/R_3 \\). With equal resistor values, you obtain \\( V_{\\text {out }} = -(V_1 + V_2 + V_3) \\). Note that the inputs can be positive or negative. Additionally, the input resistors need not be equal; if they are unequal, you achieve a weighted sum. For instance, you could have four inputs, each at +1 volt or zero, representing binary values \\( 1, 2, 4, \\) and 8. By employing input resistors of \\( 10 \\mathrm{k}, 5 \\mathrm{k}, 2.5 \\mathrm{k} \\), and 1.25 k, you will obtain a negative output in volts equivalent to the binary count input. This scheme can be readily expanded to accommodate several digits. It serves as the foundation for digital-to-analog conversion, although a distinct input circuit (an \\( R-2 R \\) ladder) is commonly employed.\n\nExercise 4.6. Demonstrate how to construct a two-digit digital-to-analog converter (DAC) by appropriately scaling the input resistors in a summing amplifier. The digital input signifies two digits, each comprising four lines representing the values \\( 1, 2, 4, \\) and 8 for the respective digits. An input line is either at +1 volt or at ground, i.e., the eight input lines represent \\( 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 20, 40, \\) and 80. With \\( \\pm 15 \\mathrm{~V} \\) supplies, the op-amp's outputs typically cannot swing beyond \\( \\pm 13 \\) volts; you will have to settle for an output in volts equal to one-tenth the value of the input number.\n\nFigure 4.24. Summing amplifier.\n\n#### E. Power booster\n\nFor high output current, a power transistor follower can be appended to an op-amp output (Figure 4.25). In this instance, a non-inverting amplifier has been depicted, although a follower can be added to any op-amp configuration. Observe that feedback is derived from the emitter; thus, feedback enforces the desired output voltage despite the \\( V_{\\mathrm{BE}} \\) drop. This circuit exhibits the customary issue that the follower output can only source current. As with transistor circuits, the solution is a push-pull booster (Figure 4.26). We will later observe that the limited speed at which the op-amp can shift its output (slew rate) significantly constrains the speed of this booster in the crossover region, inducing distortion. For low-speed applications, you do not need to bias the push-pull pair into quiescent conduction, as feedback will address most of the crossover distortion. Complete power booster ICs are available, e.g., the LT1010 and BUF633/4. These are unity-gain push-pull amplifiers capable of 200 mA of output current, and operation up to \\( 20-100 \\mathrm{MHz} \\) (refer to \\( \\S 5.8 .4 \\), and also the discussion (and table) of unity-gain buffers in Chapter \\( 4x \\)); they are meticulously biased for minimal open-loop crossover distortion and incorporate on-chip protection (current limit, and often thermal shutdown as well). As long as you guarantee that the op-amp driving them has substantially less bandwidth, you can incorporate them within the feedback loop without any concerns.\n\n#### Feedback and the push-pull booster\n\nThe push-pull booster circuit vividly illustrates the linearizing effect of negative feedback. We connected an LF411 op-amp as a non-inverting unity-gain follower, driving a BJT push-pull output stage, and loaded the output with a \\( 10 \\Omega \\) resistor to ground. Figure 4.27 displays the output signals at the op-amp and at the load, with an input sine wave of 1 V amplitude at 125 Hz. For the upper pair of traces, we (foolishly) derived the feedback from the op-amp's output, which generated an accurate replica of the input signal; however, the load experiences severe crossover distortion (from the \\( 2 V_{\\mathrm{BE}} \\) dead zone). With the feedback emanating from the push-pull output (where the load is connected), we achieve the desired outcome, as observed in the lower pair of traces. The op-amp ingeniously generates an exaggerated waveform to drive the push-pull follower, with precisely the correct shape to compensate for the crossover.\n\nFigure 4.28 presents what these waveforms resemble when we attempt to drive an actual loudspeaker, a load that is more complex than a resistor (as it is both a \"motor\" and a \"generator,\" it exhibits resonances and other undesirable characteristics; it also possesses a reactive crossover network, and an inductive coil to propel the cone). Once again, the magic of feedback accomplishes the task, this time with an op-amp output that is delightfully asymmetrical.\n\n#### F. Power supply\n\nAn op-amp can provide the gain for a feedback voltage regulator (Figure 4.29). The op-amp compares a sample of the output with the zener reference, modifying the drive to the Darlington \"pass transistor\" as necessary. This circuit delivers a stable 10 volt output (\"regulated\"), at up to 1 amp load current. Some observations regarding this circuit:\n\n- The voltage divider that samples the output could be a potentiometer, enabling adjustable output voltage.\n- For diminished ripple at the zener, the 10 k resistor should be supplanted with a current source. Another approach is to bias the zener from the output; thereby capitalizing on the regulator you have constructed. Caution: when employing this technique, you must meticulously analyze the circuit to ensure it will commence operation when power is initially applied.\n- We utilized a rail-to-rail op-amp, which can swing its output to the positive rail, so that the input voltage can drop as low as +12 V without causing the Darlington pass transistor to saturate. With a 411, in contrast, you would need to allow an additional \\( 1.5-2 \\mathrm{~V} \\) of margin, since the op-amp's output cannot approach closer than that to the positive supply rail.\n- The circuit as depicted could be damaged by a temporary short circuit across the output, as the op-amp would strive to drive the Darlington pair into heavy conduction. Regulated power supplies should always incorporate circuitry to limit \"fault\" current (refer to §9.1.1C for more details).\n- Without the \"compensation capacitor\" \\( C_{\\mathrm{C}} \\), the circuit would likely oscillate when the dc output is bypassed (as it would be when powering a circuit) due to the additional lagging phase shift. Capacitor \\( C_{\\mathrm{C}} \\) guarantees stability into a capacitive load, a topic we will explore in \\( \\S \\S 4.6 .1 \\mathrm{~B} \\), 4.6.2, and 9.1.1C.\n- Integrated circuit voltage regulators are available in a vast array, from the time-honored 723 to the convenient 3-terminal adjustable regulators with internal current limit and thermal shutdown (refer to §9.3). These devices, complete with temperature-compensated internal voltage reference and pass transistor, are so user-friendly that you will seldom use a general-purpose op-amp as a regulator. The exception might be to generate a stable voltage within a circuit that already has a stable power supply voltage accessible.\n\nIn Chapter 9, we delve into voltage regulators and power supplies in detail, including specialized ICs intended for use as voltage regulators."

    "text": "#### A. Comparator - an overview\n\nIt's frequently necessary to discern\ncompare two signals to determine which is greater or to ascertain when a specific input signal surpasses a set voltage level. Consider the conventional method for producing triangle waves, which involves charging a capacitor with alternating positive and negative currents and reversing the current's direction upon reaching a predefined peak amplitude. Another example is a digital voltmeter, which converts voltage into a numerical value by applying the unknown voltage to one comparator input and a linear ramp (composed of a capacitor and a current source) to the other. A digital counter tallies the oscillator's cycles while the ramp's voltage is less than the unknown voltage, displaying the count when the two amplitudes are equal. This count is directly proportional to the input voltage, a process known as single-slope integration. More advanced instruments typically employ dual-slope integration (refer to Chapter 13).\n\nThe most basic comparator is a high-gain differential amplifier, which can be constructed using transistors or an operational amplifier (Figure 4.30). This circuit lacks feedback, causing the op-amp to saturate at either the positive or negative voltage limit based on the input voltage difference. Given the substantial voltage gain of op-amps (usually ranging from $10^{5}$ to $10^{6}$), the inputs must be almost identical, differing by only a fraction of a millivolt to prevent output saturation. While a standard op-amp can serve as a comparator and often does, there are specialized integrated circuits designed specifically for this purpose. These ICs allow the output voltage levels to be set independently of the comparator's power supply voltages (for instance, outputs of 0 V and +5 V from a comparator powered by $\\pm 15 \\mathrm{~V}$), and they generally offer much faster response times since they are not designed to function as op-amps, which are linear amplifiers intended for use with negative feedback. A detailed discussion of these components will be provided in Chapter 12 (§§12.1.7 and 12.3, and Table 12.2).\n\nFigure 4.30. Comparator: an op-amp without feedback.\nimage_name:Figure 4.31\ndescription:Figure 4.31 presents a time-domain waveform graph that illustrates the behavior of a comparator without hysteresis when subjected to a noisy input signal.\n\n1. **Type of Graph and Function:**\n- The graph displays a time-domain waveform depicting the relationship between the input signal and the output of a comparator.\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n- The x-axis indicates time, with no specific units provided.\n- The y-axis for the top section of the graph represents the voltage levels of the input signal and the trigger point, while the y-axis for the bottom section shows the comparator output, typically alternating between two distinct levels (e.g., 0 and 1 or low and high).\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- The input signal is characterized by noise, with fluctuations centered around a general trend. This noise leads to multiple crossings of the trigger point.\n- The output waveform exhibits several transitions, corresponding to the input signal's crossings of the trigger point due to noise.\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The input signal varies around a trigger point, represented by a horizontal line indicating the voltage at the comparator's other input.\n- The output signal undergoes multiple transitions, changing state each time the input crosses the trigger point.\n- This behavior demonstrates the absence of hysteresis, resulting in an unstable output as the input signal noise triggers repeated transitions.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- The graph includes annotations for 'input' and 'trigger point' on the input waveform and 'output' on the output waveform.\n- No specific numerical values or units are provided for the voltages or time intervals.\n\nFigure 4.31.

The resistors R1 and R2 form a voltage divider that establishes a reference voltage at the inverting input of the op-amp. R3 provides positive feedback from the output to the non-inverting input, creating hysteresis.\n\nFigure 4.32. Positive feedback prevents multiple comparator transitions. A. Comparator without feedback. B. Schmitt trigger configuration uses positive feedback to prevent multiple output transitions. Special comparator ICs are generally preferable, and are drawn with the same symbol.\n\n#### B. Schmitt trigger\n\nThe comparator circuit shown in Figure 4.30 has two primary drawbacks. With a very slowly changing input, the output's swing can be notably slow. More critically, if the input is noisy, the output may undergo several transitions as the input crosses the trigger point (Figure 4.31). Both of these issues can be addressed by incorporating positive feedback (Figure 4.32). The resistor $R_{3}$ introduces a dual-threshold mechanism based on the output state. In the depicted example, the threshold is 4.76 volts when the output is at ground (input high) and 5.0 volts when the output is at +5 volts. This setup reduces the likelihood of multiple triggering due to a noisy input (Figure 4.33). Moreover, the positive feedback guarantees a swift output transition, irrespective of the input waveform's speed. (A small \"speed-up\" capacitor of $10-100 \\mathrm{pF}$ is often added across $R_{3}$ to further enhance switching speed.) This arrangement is known as a Schmitt trigger, a function previously encountered in a discrete transistor circuit (Figure 2.13).\n\nThe output depends not only on the input voltage but also on its recent history, a phenomenon referred to as hysteresis. This can be visualized using a graph of output versus input, as shown in Figure 4.34. The design process for Schmitt triggers with minimal hysteresis is straightforward. Utilize the circuit from Figure 4.32B. Initially, select a resistive divider ($R_{1}$, $R_{2}$) to set the threshold voltage approximately where desired; if the threshold needs to be near ground, simply use a single resistor from the non-inverting input to ground. Next, choose the positive feedback resistor $R_{3}$ to generate the required hysteresis, keeping in mind that the hysteresis is equal to the output swing, attenuated by the resistive divider formed by $R_{3}$ and $R_{1} \\| R_{2}$. Lastly, if using a comparator with an \"open-collector\" output, an output pull-up resistor must be added, which is small enough to ensure nearly full supply swing, considering the loading by $R_{3}$ (more on comparator outputs in $\\S 12.3$, and see Table 12.2). For cases where thresholds need to be symmetrical around ground, connect an offsetting resistor of appropriate value from the non-inverting input to the negative supply. Scaling all resistor values may be necessary to keep the output current and impedance within practical limits.\n\n#### C. Power-switching driver\n\nThe output of a comparator or Schmitt trigger switches rapidly between high and low voltages; it is not a continuous (or \"linear\") signal. Such an output might be used to activate or deactivate a significant load, such as a relay, laser, or motor.\nimage_name:A\ndescription:\n[\nname: A, type: OpAmp, ports: {InP: In1(A), InN: In2(A), OutP: Out(A), OutN: , Vdd: , -Vdd:}\nname: R, type: Resistor, value: 1k, ports: {N1: Out(A), N2: base}\nname: PI, type: Diode, ports: {Na: base, Nc: GND}\nname: M1, type: NPN, ports: {C: +Vcc, B: base, E: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:This circuit is a power-switching driver that employs an op-amp and an NPN transistor.

It is designed to control a load by switching it on or off using the op-amp's output. The op-amp is powered by dual supply rails (+15V and -15V). The NMOS transistor (IRF520) acts as a switch, controlled by the op-amp output, to connect the load to ground. The load is connected between the drain of the NMOS and a positive supply voltage (+VDD).\n\nFigure 4.35. Power switching with an op-amp; A. With bipolar npn; note base current limit and reverse protection, B. With power MOSFET; note simplified drive circuit.\n\nFor loads that operate in an on/off state, a switching transistor can be driven by a comparator or op-amp, as shown in Figure 4.35A. The diode is included to prevent reverse base-emitter breakdown (op-amps powered by dual supply rails can easily exceed the -6 V base-emitter breakdown voltage); it would be omitted if the op-amp's negative supply were no more than -5 V. The TIP3055 is a standard power transistor for non-critical high-current applications, although various types with enhanced maximum voltage, current, power dissipation, and speed are available (refer to the listing in Table 2.2 on page 106). A Darlington pair can be used for driving currents greater than about 1 amp.\n\nHowever, in most cases, it is more advantageous to use an $n$-channel power MOSFET, which allows the resistor and diode to be omitted altogether (Figure 4.35B). The IRF520 is a nearly classic choice, but the selection of power MOSFETs available is extensive (see Table 3.4); typically, there is a trade-off between high breakdown voltage and low ON-resistance.\n\nWhen switching external loads, it is crucial to include a reverse diode if the load is inductive (refer to §1.6.7).\n\n[^25]image_name:Figure 4.36\ndescription:\n[\nname: A1, type: OpAmp, value: A1, ports: {InP: Vin, InN: InN(A1), OutP: Out(A1), OutN:}\nname: D1, type: Diode, ports: {Na: Out(A1), Nc: Vout}\nname: R, type: Resistor, value: 10k, ports: {N1: Vout, N2: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:This circuit is a simple active half-wave rectifier that uses an op-amp and a diode. The op-amp is configured with a diode in the feedback loop to rectify the input signal. The resistor R provides a path to ground for the output.\n\nFigure 4.36. Simple active half-wave rectifier.\nimage_name:Figure 4.37\ndescription:Figure 4.37 shows a time-domain waveform that illustrates the effect of finite slew rate on a simple active rectifier. The graph features two main waveforms: the input signal and the op-amp output.\n\n**Axes Labels and Units:**\n- The vertical axis represents voltage, ranging from \\(V_{EE}\\) to \\(V_{CC}\\), with 0 volts indicated in the middle.\n- The horizontal axis represents time, with no specific units provided, implying a continuous waveform.\n\n**Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- The input waveform, depicted as a dashed line, oscillates symmetrically around the 0-volt line, indicating an AC signal.\n- The op-amp output, represented by a solid line, closely follows the input waveform when it is positive but deviates when the input is negative, due to the rectification process.\n\n**Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The graph highlights the impact of the op-amp's finite slew rate on the rectification process. When the input signal is positive, the op-amp output tracks it closely, but there is a noticeable delay and smoothing effect due to the slew rate limitation.\n- A critical feature noted is the '1 diode drop' annotation, indicating the voltage drop across the diode when the input is positive. This is typical in diode-based rectifiers, but the op-amp compensates for this drop, allowing the output to closely follow the input.\n- The op-amp output waveform is slightly smoothed compared to the input, especially at the peaks, due to the finite slew rate and the diode's presence in the feedback loop.\n\n**Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- The graph is annotated with 'op-amp output' and 'input' to distinguish between the two waveforms.\n- The '1 diode drop' annotation is positioned at the peak of the positive cycle, indicating the voltage difference caused by the diode.\n\nOverall, the graph demonstrates how the active rectifier circuit effectively rectifies the input signal with minimal voltage drop across the diode, but also highlights the impact of the op-amp's finite slew rate on the output waveform's fidelity.\n\nFigure 4.37. Effect of finite slew rate on the simple active rectifier.\n\n#### D. Active rectifier\n\nThe rectification of signals smaller than a diode drop cannot be achieved with a simple diode-resistor circuit. Op-amps, as usual, provide a solution by incorporating a diode in the feedback loop (Figure 4.36). When $V_{\\text {in }}$ is positive, the diode supplies negative feedback, allowing the circuit's output to follow the input closely, coupled through the diode without a $V_{\\mathrm{BE}}$ drop. When $V_{\\text {in }}$ is negative, the op-amp saturates at the negative voltage limit, and $V_{\\text {out }}$ is at ground. The resistor R could be selected to be smaller for lower output impedance, at the expense of higher op-amp output current. A superior solution is to employ an op-amp follower at the output, as shown, to generate very low output impedance regardless of the resistor value.\n\nA significant issue arises with this circuit when dealing with high-speed signals. Since an op-amp cannot instantaneously swing its output voltage, the recovery from negative saturation (as the input waveform crosses zero from below) takes some time, during which the output is inaccurate. This is depicted in the curve shown in Figure 4.37. The output (heavy trace) is an accurate rectified version of the input (light trace), except for a brief time interval after the input rises through zero volts. During that interval, the op-amp output is rapidly ascending from saturation near $-V_{E E}$, so the circuit's output remains at ground. A general-purpose op-amp like the 411 has a slew rate (the maximum rate at which the output can change) of $15 \\mathrm{~V} / \\mu \\mathrm{s}$; thus, recovery from negative saturation takes approximately $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$ (when operating from $\\pm 15 \\mathrm{~V}$ supplies), which may introduce significant output error for fast signals. A circuit modification can significantly improve this situation (Figure 4.38).\n$D_{1}$ configures the circuit as a unity-gain inverter for negative input signals. $D_{2}$ clamps the op-amp's output at one diode drop below ground for positive inputs, and since $D_{1}$ is then reverse-biased, $V_{\\text {out }}$ remains at ground. The improvement is due to the op-amp's output swinging only two diode drops as the input signal crosses zero. As the op-amp output only needs to change about 1.2 volts instead of $V_{\\mathrm{EE}}$ volts, the \"glitch\" at zero crossings is reduced more than 10-fold. This rectifier is inverting; if a non-inverted output is required, a unity-gain inverter can be attached to the output.\n\nThese circuits' performance is enhanced by selecting an op-amp with a high slew rate. Slew rate also affects the performance of other op-amp applications discussed earlier, such as simple voltage amplifier circuits. Soon, we will examine the ways in which real op-amps deviate from the ideal—input current, offset voltage, bandwidth, and slew rate—because understanding these limitations is crucial for designing effective circuits. With this knowledge, we will also explore some active full-wave rectifier circuits to complement these half-wave rectifiers. First, though"

Here's the rephrased text for the first section:\n\n#### A. Comparator - an Overview\n\nIt's a necessary to compare two signals to determine which is stronger or to identify when an input signal exceeds a specific voltage threshold. For example, the standard method for generating triangle waves involves charging a capacitor with positive or negative currents and reversing the current's polarity when the amplitude reaches a predetermined peak value. Another example is a digital voltmeter, which converts a voltage into a numerical value by applying the unknown voltage to one input of a comparator and a linear ramp (comprised of a capacitor and current source) to the other. A digital counter tracks the number of cycles of an oscillator while the ramp is below the unknown voltage and displays the result when the two amplitudes are equal, with the count being directly proportional to the input voltage. This method is known as single-slope integration; however, dual-slope integration is typically employed in more advanced instruments (refer to Chapter 13).\n\nThe simplest form of comparator is a high-gain differential amplifier, which can be constructed using transistors or an operational amplifier (op-amp) as shown in Figure 4.30. This circuit lacks feedback; hence, the op-amp's output goes into positive or negative saturation based on the difference in input voltages. Due to the high voltage gain of op-amps (typically $10^{5}-10^{6}$), the inputs must be almost equal to prevent the output from saturating. While an ordinary op-amp can serve as a comparator (and often does), there are specialized integrated circuits (ICs) designed specifically for comparator applications. These allow you to set the output voltage levels independently of the power supply voltages used by the comparator (e.g., you can achieve output levels of 0 V and +5 V from a comparator powered by $\\pm 15 \\mathrm{~V}$); they are also generally much faster because they are not designed to function as op-amps, which are linear amplifiers intended for use with negative feedback. We will discuss these in more detail in Chapter 12 (§§12.1.7 and 12.3, and Table 12.2).\n\n#### B. Schmitt Trigger\n\nThe simple comparator circuit in Figure 4.30 has two drawbacks. For a very slowly changing input, the output swing can be rather slow. Worse still, if the input is noisy, the output may make several transitions as the input passes through the trigger point (Figure 4.31). Both these issues can be addressed by using positive feedback (Figure 4.32). The effect of $R_{3}$ is to create two thresholds in the circuit, depending on the output state. In the example shown, the threshold when the output is at ground (input high) is 4.76 volts, whereas the threshold with the output at +5 volts is 5.0 volts. A noisy input is less likely to produce multiple triggering (Figure 4.33). Furthermore, the positive feedback ensures a rapid output transition, regardless of the speed of the input waveform. (A small \"speed-up\" capacitor of $10-100 \\mathrm{pF}$ is often connected across $R_{3}$ to enhance switching speed further.) This configuration is known as a Schmitt trigger, a function that we saw earlier in a discrete transistor implementation (Figure 2.13).\n\nThe output depends both on the input voltage and on its recent history, an effect called hysteresis. This can be illustrated with a diagram of output versus input, as in Figure 4.34. The design procedure is straightforward for Schmitt triggers with a small amount of hysteresis. Use the circuit of Figure 4.32B. First, choose a resistive divider ($R_{1}$, $R_{2}$) to set the threshold at approximately the right voltage; if you want the threshold near ground, just use a single resistor from the non-inverting input to ground. Next, choose the (positive) feedback resistor $R_{3}$ to produce the required hysteresis, noting that the hysteresis equals the output swing, attenuated by a resistive divider formed by $R_{3}$ and $R_{1} \\| R_{2}$. Finally, if you are using a comparator with \"open-collector\" output, you must add an output pull-up resistor small enough to ensure a nearly full supply swing, taking account of the loading by $R_{3}$ (read about comparator outputs in $\\S 12.3$, and see Table 12.2). For the case in which you want thresholds symmetrical about ground, connect an offsetting resistor of appropriate value from the non-inverting input to the negative supply. You may wish to scale all resistor values to keep the output current and impedance levels within a reasonable range.\n\n#### C. Power-switching Driver\n\nThe output of a comparator or Schmitt trigger switches abruptly between high and low voltages; it's not a continuous (or \"linear\") signal. You might want to use its output to turn a substantial load on or off. Examples might be a relay, laser, or motor.\n\nFor loads that are either on or off, a switching transistor can be driven from a comparator or op-amp. Figure 4.35A shows how. Note the diode to prevent reverse base-emitter breakdown (op-amps powered from dual supply rails easily swing more than the -6 V base-emitter breakdown voltage); it would be omitted if the op-amp's negative supply were no more than -5 V. The TIP3055 is a jellybean classic power transistor for non-critical high-current applications, though you'll find plenty of variety of available types with improved maximum voltage, current, power dissipation, and speed (see the listing in Table 2.2 on page 106). A Darlington can be used if currents greater than about 1 amp need to be driven.\n\nIn general, however, you're better off using an $n$-channel power MOSFET, in which case you can dispense with the resistor and diode altogether (Figure 4.35B). The IRF520 ${ }^{13}$ is a near-classic - but the variety of readily available power MOSFETs is overwhelming (see Table 3.4); in general you trade off high breakdown voltage against low ON-resistance.\n\nWhen switching external loads, don't forget to include a reverse diode if the load is inductive (§1.6.7).\n\n#### D. Active Rectifier\n\nRectification of signals smaller than a diode drop cannot be done with a simple diode-resistor combination. As usual, op-amps come to the rescue, in this case by putting a diode in the feedback loop (Figure 4.36). For $V_{\\text {in }}$ positive, the diode provides negative feedback; the circuit's output follows the input, coupled by the diode, but without a $V_{\\mathrm{BE}}$ drop. For $V_{\\text {in }}$ negative, the op-amp goes into negative saturation and $V_{\\text {out }}$ is at ground. $R$ could be chosen smaller for lower output impedance, with the tradeoff of higher op-amp output current. A better solution is to use an op-amp follower at the output, as shown, to produce very low output impedance regardless of the resistor value.\n\nThere is a problem with this circuit that becomes serious with high-speed signals. Because an op-amp cannot swing its output infinitely fast, the recovery from negative saturation (as the input waveform passes through zero from below) takes some time, during which the output is incorrect. It looks something like the curve shown in Figure 4.37. The output (heavy trace) is an accurate rectified version of the input (light trace), except for a short time interval after the input rises through zero volts. During that interval the op-amp output is racing up from saturation near $-V_{E E}$, so the circuit's output is still at ground. A general-purpose op-amp like the 411 has a slew rate (maximum rate at which the output can change) of $15 \\mathrm{~V} / \\mu \\mathrm{s}$; recovery from negative saturation therefore takes about $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$ (when operating from $\\pm 15 \\mathrm{~V}$ supplies), which may introduce significant output error for fast signals. A circuit modification improves the situation considerably (Figure 4.38). $D_{1}$ makes the circuit a unity-gain inverter for negative input signals. $D_{2}$ clamps the op-amp's output at one diode drop below ground for positive inputs, and since $D_{1}$ is then back-biased, $V_{\\text {out }}$ sits at ground. The improvement comes because the op-amp's output swings only two diode drops as the input signal passes through zero. Because the op-amp output has to slew only about 1.2 volts instead of $V_{\\mathrm{EE}}$ volts, the \"glitch\" at zero crossings is reduced more than 10-fold. This rectifier is inverting, incidentally. If you require a non-inverted output, attach a unity-gain inverter to the output.\n\nThe performance of these circuits is improved if you choose an op-amp with a high slew rate. Slew rate also influences the performance of the other op-amp applications we've discussed, for instance, the simple voltage amplifier circuits. Shortly, we'll take a closer look at the ways in which real op-amps depart from the ideal - input current, offset voltage, bandwidth, and slew rate, and so on - because you need to know about those limitations if you want to design good circuits. With that knowledge, we'll also look at some active full-wave rectifier circuits to complement these half-wave rectifiers. First, though, we'd like to demonstrate some of the fun of designing with op-amps by showing a few real-world circuit examples."

    "text": "#### A. Comparator - an introduction\n\nThe need to determine the relative magnitude of two signals or to identify when a specific input signal surpasses a set voltage is widespread. Consider, for example, the standard approach for generating triangle waves, which involves feeding positive or negative currents into a capacitor and reversing the current direction upon reaching a predetermined peak amplitude. Another instance is seen in digital voltmeters, which convert voltage into numerical values by applying the unknown voltage to one comparator input while a linear ramp—a combination of a capacitor and a current source—is applied to the other. A digital counter then counts the oscillator cycles when the ramp's voltage is below the unknown voltage, displaying the count once the ramp equals the input voltage. This count is directly proportional to the input voltage and represents a process known as single-slope integration. More advanced instruments often employ dual-slope integration (refer to Chapter 13).\n\nThe most basic comparator is a high-gain differential amplifier, which can be constructed using transistors or an operational amplifier (Figure 4.30). This circuit lacks feedback; the op-amp's output saturates at either the positive or negative limit based on the input voltage difference. Due to the op-amp's high voltage gain (usually in the range of $10^{5}-10^{6}$), the inputs must be nearly equal to prevent saturation. Although a standard op-amp can serve as a comparator, specialized integrated circuits are designed for this purpose. They allow for independent setting of output voltage levels from the supply voltage (for instance, outputs of 0 V and +5 V from a comparator powered by $\\pm 15 \\mathrm{~V}$) and are generally faster since they are not designed to function as linear amplifiers with negative feedback.

    "text": "#### A. Comparator - an Overview\n\nThe necessity to discern which of two signals is greater, or to detect when a certain input signal surpasses a set voltage, is widespread. Consider the standard technique for generating triangle waves, which involves charging a capacitor with alternating positive and negative currents, reversing the current's direction upon reaching a pre-set amplitude peak. Another instance is the digital voltmeter, which converts voltage into numerical readings by applying the unknown voltage to one comparator input, while a linear ramp (a combination of capacitor and current source) is applied to the other. A digital counter tallies the oscillator's cycles while the ramp's voltage is beneath the unknown voltage, displaying the count when the two amplitudes are equal. This count is proportional to the input voltage and is referred to as single-slope integration; dual-slope integration is utilized in more advanced instruments (refer to Chapter 13).\n\nThe most basic comparator is a high-gain differential amplifier, which can be constructed using transistors or an operational amplifier (op-amp) (Figure 4.30). This circuit lacks feedback; the op-amp saturates positively or negatively based on the disparity between the input voltages. Owing to the substantial voltage gain of op-amps (commonly $10^{5}-10^{6}$), the inputs must be nearly identical, differing by only a fraction of a millivolt to prevent the output from saturating. While a standard op-amp can serve as a comparator (and often does), there are specialized integrated circuits (ICs) designed specifically for this purpose. These ICs permit the setting of output voltage levels independently of the comparator's power supply voltages (for example, output levels of 0 V and +5 V from a comparator powered by $\\pm 15 \\mathrm{~V}$), and they generally operate much faster since they are not designed to function as op-amps, i.e., linear amplifiers intended for use with negative feedback. We will discuss these in detail in Chapter 12 (§§12.1.7 and 12.3, and Table 12.2).\n\n#### B. Schmitt Trigger\n\nThe straightforward comparator circuit depicted in Figure 4.30 possesses two drawbacks. With a very slowly changing input, the output's swing can be notably slow. More critically, if the input is noisy, the output may undergo several transitions as the input traverses the trigger point (Figure 4.31). Both of these issues can be resolved by employing positive feedback (Figure 4.32). The resistor $R_{3}$ serves to create two distinct thresholds in the circuit, contingent on the output's state. In the depicted example, the threshold when the output is grounded (input high) is 4.76 volts, whereas with the output at +5 volts, the threshold is 5.0 volts. A noisy input is thus less likely to induce multiple triggering events (Figure 4.33). Moreover, the positive feedback guarantees swift output transitions, irrespective of the input waveform's speed. (A small \"speed-up\" capacitor of $10-100 \\mathrm{pF}$ is frequently connected across $R_{3}$ to further accelerate the switching speed.) This arrangement is recognized as a Schmitt trigger, a function previously encountered in a discrete transistor configuration (Figure 2.13).\n\nThe output of a Schmitt trigger relies on both the current input voltage and its recent history, a phenomenon known as hysteresis. This can be depicted through a diagram of output versus input, such as in Figure 4.34. The design process for Schmitt triggers with minimal hysteresis is straightforward, utilizing the circuit shown in Figure 4.32B. Initially, select a resistive divider ($R_{1}$, $R_{2}$) to establish the threshold at approximately the desired voltage; for a threshold near ground, simply employ a single resistor from the non-inverting input to ground. Subsequently, choose the (positive) feedback resistor $R_{3}$ to generate the necessary hysteresis, bearing in mind that the hysteresis equals the output swing, diminished by a resistive divider composed of $R_{3}$ and $R_{1} \\| R_{2}$. Finally, if a comparator with an \"open-collector\" output is used, an output pull-up resistor must be added, ensuring a nearly full supply swing while considering the loading imposed by $R_{3}$ (for more on comparator outputs, see $\\S 12.3$, and Table 12.2). In scenarios where thresholds symmetrical about ground are desired, connect an offsetting resistor of suitable value from the non-inverting input to the negative supply. Scaling all resistor values might be necessary to maintain the output current and impedance levels within practical boundaries.\n\n#### C. Power-Switching Driver\n\nThe output of a comparator or Schmitt trigger transitions sharply between high and low voltages; it is not a continuous (\"linear\") signal. This output can be employed to activate or deactivate a significant load, such as a relay, laser, or motor.\n\nFigure 4.35 demonstrates how a switching transistor can be driven by a comparator or op-amp. Note the inclusion of a diode to prevent reverse base-emitter breakdown (op-amps powered from dual supply rails can easily exceed the -6 V base-emitter breakdown voltage); this diode would be omitted if the op-amp's negative supply were no more than -5 V. The TIP3055 is a quint power transistor suitable for non-critical high-current applications, although numerous types with enhanced maximum voltage, current, power dissipation, and speed are available (refer to the listing in Table 2.2 on page 106). A Darlington pair can be employed for driving currents exceeding approximately 1 amp.\n\nIn general, however, an $n$-channel power MOSFET is a more favorable choice, allowing for the elimination of the resistor and diode altogether (Figure 4.35B). The IRF520 ${ }^{13}$ is a near-classic choice, but the assortment of power MOSFETs readily available is extensive (refer to Table 3.4); typically, there is a trade-off between high breakdown voltage and low ON-resistance.\n\nWhen switching external loads, it is crucial to incorporate a reverse diode if the load is inductive (refer to §1.6.7).\n\n#### D. Active Rectifier\n\nConventional diode-resistor combinations are inadequate for rectifying signals smaller than a diode drop. Op-amps offer a solution by incorporating a diode in the feedback loop (Figure 4.36). When $V_{\\text {in }}$ is positive, the diode supplies negative feedback, causing the circuit's output to track the input, with the diode in the circuit but without a $V_{\\mathrm{BE}}$ drop. For negative $V_{\\text {in }}$, the op-amp saturates negatively, and $V_{\\text {out }}$ is grounded. The resistor $R$ could be chosen to be smaller for lower output impedance, at the expense of increased op-amp output current. A more effective solution is to employ an op-amp follower at the output, as illustrated, to achieve very low output impedance irrespective of the resistor value.\n\nThis circuit encounters a problem that becomes pronounced with high-speed signals. Since an op-amp cannot instantaneously swing its output, the recovery from negative saturation (as the input waveform crosses zero from below) necessitates some time, during which the output is inaccurate. This is depicted in Figure 4.37. The output (heavy trace) is a rectified version of the input (light trace), except for a brief interval after the input rises through zero volts. During this interval, the op-amp output is rapidly ascending from saturation near $-V_{E E}$, causing the circuit's output to remain at ground. A general-purpose op-amp like the 411 has a slew rate (the maximum rate at which the output can change) of $15 \\mathrm{~V} / \\mu \\mathrm{s}$; hence, recovery from negative saturation takes approximately $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$ (when operating from $\\pm 15 \\mathrm{~V}$ supplies), which may introduce significant output errors for fast signals. A circuit modification can substantially improve this situation (Figure 4.38).\n\n$D_{1}$ configures the circuit as a unity-gain inverter for negative input signals. $D_{2}$ clamps the op-amp's output at one diode drop below ground for positive inputs, and since $D_{1}$ is then reverse-biased, $V_{\\text {out }}$ remains at ground. The enhancement arises because the op-amp's output only needs to swing two diode drops as the input signal crosses zero. As the op-amp output only needs to change by about 1.2 volts instead of $V_{\\mathrm{EE}}$ volts, the \"glitch\" at zero crossings is reduced by more than 10-fold. This rectifier is inverting; if a non-inverted output is required, a unity-gain inverter can be connected to the output.\n\nThe performance of these circuits is enhanced by selecting an op-amp with a high slew rate. Slew rate also affects the performance of other op-amp applications discussed, such as simple voltage amplifier circuits. We will shortly delve into the ways in which real op-amps deviate from the ideal - input current, offset voltage, bandwidth and slew rate, etc. - as knowledge of these limitations is essential for designing effective circuits. With this understanding, we will also examine some active full-wave rectifier circuits to complement these half-wave rectifiers. ${ }^{14}$ First, however, we aim to showcase the enjoyment of designing with op-amps by presenting several real-world circuit examples."

Another example is found in digital voltmeters, where an unknown voltage is compared to a linearly increasing voltage using a comparator. A digital counter then measures the time the increasing voltage is below the unknown voltage, displaying the result upon reaching equivalence. This process, known as single-slope integration, is enhanced in advanced instruments by dual-slope integration.\n\nThe most basic comparator is a high-gain differential amplifier, typically constructed using transistors or operational amplifiers (opamps) without feedback. These devices amplify the difference between input voltages to the point where the output saturates at the positive or negative limit. Opamps have an immense voltage gain (commonly around $10^{5}-10^{6}$), necessitating the inputs to be almost equal to prevent saturation. While a standard opamp can act as a comparator, specialized integrated circuits are designed specifically for this purpose, offering independent output voltage levels and faster response times since they are not designed to function as linear amplifiers with negative feedback.\n\nThe behavior of a comparator without hysteresis is depicted in Figure 4.31, which shows how a noisy input signal can cause multiple transitions in the output as it crosses the trigger point. This can be contrasted with a Schmitt trigger configuration, as shown in Figure 4.32, which uses positive feedback to establish two thresholds and prevent erratic output transitions due to input noise.\n\nSchmitt triggers are particularly useful in managing noise-prone comparator outputs. The positive feedback mechanism creates a rapid output transition and provides hysteresis, which is the dependence of the output on the recent history of the input signal. Figure 4.33 exemplifies this by demonstrating how the Schmitt trigger's output remains stable despite noise in the input signal.\n\nA transfer function graph, as presented in Figure 4.34, further illustrates the hysteresis effect of a Schmitt trigger, where the output voltage changes in response to the input voltage's level and history. Designing a Schmitt trigger involves selecting resistors to set the threshold voltage and the amount of hysteresis, and potentially using an output pullup resistor for comparators with open-collector outputs.\n\nComparator and Schmitt trigger outputs are well-suited for power-switching applications, such as controlling relays, lasers, or motors. Figure 4.35 demonstrates power switching using an op-amp and either a bipolar junction transistor (BJT) or a power MOSFET. For inductive loads, a reverse diode is necessary to prevent damage due to induced voltage spikes.\n\nActive rectifiers, like the one shown in Figure 4.36, utilize op-amps and diodes to rectify signals that are smaller than a diode's forward voltage drop. The circuit's output accurately follows the input for positive voltages but grounds for negative voltages. However, the finite slew rate of the op-amp can cause issues with high-speed signals, as seen in Figure 4.37, where there is a delay in the output recovering from negative saturation.\n\nAn improved active half-wave rectifier circuit, shown in Figure 4.38, addresses the slew rate problem by using an additional diode and op-amp to clamp the output and reduce the voltage swing required as the input passes through zero. This circuit modification significantly reduces output errors for fast signals.\n\nDesigning with op-amps requires an understanding of their limitations, such as input current, offset voltage, bandwidth, and slew rate. This knowledge is crucial for creating effective circuits and will be further explored in discussions of active full-wave rectifiers and real-world circuit examples."

    "text": "#### A. Comparator - An Overview\n\nIt is frequently necessary to determine which of two signals is greater or to identify when a specific input signal surpasses a set voltage level. Take, for example, the conventional method for generating triangle waves, which involves charging a capacitor with alternating positive and negative currents, reversing the current direction once the amplitude reaches a predefined peak. Another illustration is a digital voltmeter, which converts voltage into a numerical value by applying the unknown voltage to one comparator input and a linear ramp (comprised of a capacitor and current source) to the other. A digital counter tallies the oscillator's cycles during the period when the ramp's voltage is less than the unknown voltage, displaying the count when the two amplitudes are equal. This count is directly proportional to the input voltage and is known as single-slope integration. More advanced instruments typically employ dual-slope integration (refer to Chapter 13).\n\nThe most basic comparator is a high-gain differential amplifier, which can be constructed using transistors or an operational amplifier (op-amp) as shown in Figure 4.30. This circuit lacks feedback; the op-amp's output saturates at either the positive or negative voltage limit based on the input voltage differential. Due to the substantial voltage gain of op-amps (commonly around $10^{5}-10^{6}$), the input voltages must be almost identical, differing by only a fraction of a millivolt to prevent output saturation. While a standard op-amp can function as a comparator (and often does), specialized integrated circuits (ICs) are designed specifically for comparator applications. These allow the output voltage levels to be set independently of the comparator's supply voltage (for instance, outputs of 0 V and +5 V from a comparator powered by $\\pm 15 \\mathrm{~V}$), and they generally offer much faster response times since they are not designed to function as linear amplifiers with negative feedback. We will discuss these in greater detail in Chapter 12 (§§12.1.7 and 12.3, and Table 12.2).\n\nFigure 4.30 illustrates a comparator circuit utilizing an op-amp without feedback.\n\n#### B. Schmitt Trigger\n\nThe straightforward comparator circuit depicted in Figure 4.30 presents two main drawbacks. With a very slowly changing input, the output swing may be sluggish. More critically, if the input is noisy, the output may undergo several transitions as the input signal passes through the trigger point (Figure 4.31). Both issues can be addressed by incorporating positive feedback (Figure 4.32). The resistor $R_{3}$ creates two distinct threshold voltages depending on the output state. In the depicted example, the threshold is 4.76 volts when the output is grounded (indicating a high input), and 5.0 volts when the output is at +5 volts. A noisy input is less likely to cause repeated triggering (Figure 4.33). Additionally, the positive feedback guarantees a swift output transition irrespective of the input waveform's speed. (A small \"speed-up\" capacitor of $10-100 \\mathrm{pF}$ is frequently connected across $R_{3}$ to further enhance switching speed.) This setup is known as a Schmitt trigger, which we previously encountered in a discrete transistor circuit (Figure 2.13).\n\nThe output of a Schmitt trigger depends not only on the current input voltage but also on its recent history, a phenomenon referred to as hysteresis. This can be depicted using a graph of output versus input, as shown in Figure 4.34. The design process for Schmitt triggers with minimal hysteresis is straightforward using the circuit in Figure 4.32B. Initially, select a resistive divider ($R_{1}$, $R_{2}$) to set the threshold voltage approximately where desired; if the threshold needs to be close to ground, simply use a single resistor from the non-inverting input to ground. Next, choose the (positive) feedback resistor $R_{3}$ to achieve the required hysteresis, keeping in mind that the hysteresis is equal to the output swing, reduced by the resistive divider formed by $R_{3}$ and $R_{1} \\| R_{2}$. Lastly, for comparators with \"open-collector\" outputs, an output pull-up resistor must be added, which should be small enough to ensure nearly full supply swing, considering the loading by $R_{3}$ (further details on comparator outputs can be found in $\\S 12.3$, and Table 12.2). For cases where symmetrical thresholds about ground are needed, connect an offsetting resistor of suitable value from the non-inverting input to the negative supply. It may be necessary to adjust all resistor values to maintain the output current and impedance within practical limits.\n\n#### C. Power-Switching Driver\n\nThe output of a comparator or Schmitt trigger switches rapidly between high and low voltages; it is not a continuous (or \"linear\") signal. You might want to utilize its output to switch a significant load on or off. Examples might include a relay, laser, or motor.\n\nFigure 4.35A demonstrates how this can be achieved. Note the inclusion of a diode to prevent reverse base-emitter breakdown (op-amps powered from dual supply rails can easily exceed the -6 V base-emitter breakdown voltage); this diode would be omitted if the op-amp's negative supply were no more than -5 V. The TIP3055 is a standard power transistor suitable for non-critical high-current applications, though a variety of types with improved maximum voltage, current, power dissipation, and speed are available (refer to the listing in Table 2.2 on page 106). A Darlington pair can be used if currents greater than approximately 1 amp need to be driven.\n\nIn general, however, an $n$-channel power MOSFET is a preferable choice, allowing for the omission of the resistor and diode altogether (Figure 4.35B). The IRF520 is a near-classic example, but the selection of power MOSFETs available is extensive (refer to Table 3.4); typically, there is a trade-off between high breakdown voltage and low ON-resistance.\n\nWhen switching external loads, do not forget to include a reverse diode if the load is inductive (refer to §1.6.7).\n\n#### D. Active Rectifier\n\nSignals with voltages lower than a diode drop cannot be rectified using a simple diode-resistor configuration. As usual, op-amps provide a solution by incorporating a diode in the feedback loop (Figure 4.36). For positive $V_{\\text {in }}$, the diode provides negative feedback, causing the circuit's output to track the input, with the diode's forward voltage drop. For negative $V_{\\text {in }}$, the op-amp saturates at the negative voltage limit, and $V_{\\text {out }}$ is at ground. The resistor $R$ could be selected to be smaller for lower output impedance, with the trade-off being higher op-amp output current. A better solution is to employ an op-amp follower at the output, as shown, to achieve very low output impedance regardless of the resistor value.\n\nThis circuit, however, has a problem that becomes significant with high-speed signals. Because an op-amp cannot change its output voltage instantaneously, the recovery from negative saturation (as the input waveform crosses zero from below) takes some time, during which the output is incorrect. This is depicted in the curve shown in Figure 4.37. The output (heavy trace) is an accurate rectified version of the input (light trace), except for a brief interval after the input rises through zero volts. During this interval, the op-amp output is still rising from saturation near $-V_{E E}$, so the circuit's output remains at ground. A general-purpose op-amp like the 411 has a slew rate (the maximum rate at which the output can change) of $15 \\mathrm{~V} / \\mu \\mathrm{s}$; therefore, recovery from negative saturation takes about $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$ (when operating from $\\pm 15 \\mathrm{~V}$ supplies), which may introduce significant output errors for fast signals. A circuit modification can substantially improve this situation (Figure 4.38). $D_{1}$ configures the circuit as a unity-gain inverter for negative input signals. $D_{2}$ clamps the op-amp's output at one diode drop below ground for positive inputs, and since $D_{1}$ is then back-biased, $V_{\\text {out }}$ remains at ground. The improvement stems from the op-amp's output swinging only two diode drops as the input signal crosses zero. Since the op-amp output only needs to change by about 1.2 volts instead of $V_{\\mathrm{EE}}$ volts, the \"glitch\" at zero crossings is reduced more than 10-fold. This rectifier is inverting; if a non-inverted output is required, a unity-gain inverter can be added to the output.\n\nThe performance of these circuits can be enhanced by selecting an op-amp with a high slew rate. Slew rate also affects the performance of other op-amp applications we've discussed, such as simple voltage amplifier circuits. Shortly, we'll delve deeper into the ways in which real op-amps deviate from the ideal - input current, offset voltage, bandwidth, slew rate, etc. - because understanding these limitations is crucial for designing effective circuits. With this knowledge, we'll also explore some active full-wave rectifier circuits to complement these half-wave rectifiers. First, however, we'd like to showcase the enjoyment of designing with op-amps by presenting several real-world circuit examples."

Comparator without feedback. B. Schmitt trigger configuration uses positive feedback to prevent multiple output transitions. Special comparator ICs are generally preferable, and are drawn with the same symbol.\n\n#### B. Schmitt trigger\n\nThe comparator circuit in Figure 4.30 has two drawbacks. With a very slowly changing input, the output's response can be sluggish. More critically, if the input is noisy, the output may undergo several transitions as the input passes through the trigger point (Figure 4.31). Both issues can be resolved by incorporating positive feedback (Figure 4.32). The resistor $R_{3}$ introduces dual thresholds depending on the output state. For instance, when the output is at ground (input high), the threshold is 4.76 volts, whereas with the output at +5 volts, the threshold is 5.0 volts. A noisy input is less likely to cause repeated triggering (Figure 4.33). Moreover, the positive feedback guarantees a swift output transition, irrespective of the input waveform's speed. (A small \"speed-up\" capacitor of $10-100 \\mathrm{pF}$ is often added across $R_{3}$ to further boost switching speed.) This setup is known as a Schmitt trigger, a function previously observed in a discrete transistor implementation (Figure 2.13).\n\nThe output relies on both the input voltage and its recent history, a phenomenon referred to as hysteresis. This can be depicted in a graph of output versus input, as shown in Figure 4.34. Designing Schmitt triggers with minimal hysteresis is straightforward using the circuit in Figure 4.32B. Initially, select a resistive divider ($R_{1}$, $R_{2}$) to set the threshold voltage roughly where desired; for a threshold near ground, simply employ a single resistor from the non-inverting input to ground. Next, pick the (positive) feedback resistor $R_{3}$ to generate the necessary hysteresis, considering that the hysteresis equals the output swing, attenuated by the resistive divider formed by $R_{3}$ and $R_{1} \\| R_{2}$. If using a comparator with an \"open-collector\" output, an output pullup resistor must be added, small enough to ensure nearly full supply swing, accounting for the loading by $R_{3}$ (more on comparator outputs in $\\S 12.3$, and see Table 12.2). For thresholds symmetric around ground, connect an offsetting resistor of suitable value from the non-inverting input to the negative supply. Scaling all resistor values to maintain output current and impedance levels within reasonable bounds may be beneficial.\n\n#### C. Power-switching driver\n\nThe output of a comparator or Schmitt trigger switches abruptly between high and low voltages; it is not a continuous (or \"linear\") signal.

It is designed to control a load by switching it on or off using the op-amp's output. The op-amp is powered by dual supply rails (+15V and -15V). The NMOS transistor (IRF520) acts as a switch, controlled by the op-amp output, to connect the load to ground. The load is connected between the drain of the NMOS and a positive supply voltage (+VDD).\n\nFigure 4.35. Power switching with an op-amp; A. With bipolar npn; note base current limit and reverse protection, B. With power MOSFET; note simplified drive circuit.\n\nFor loads that are either fully on or off, a switching transistor can be driven by a comparator or op-amp, as demonstrated in Figure 4.35A. Note the diode that prevents reverse base-emitter breakdown (op-amps powered from dual supply rails can easily exceed the -6 V base-emitter breakdown voltage); it would be omitted if the op-amp's negative supply were no more than -5 V. The TIP3055 is a classic power transistor for non-critical high-current applications, though various types with enhanced maximum voltage, current, power dissipation, and speed are available (refer to the listing in Table 2.2 on page 106).

When the input signal is positive, the op-amp output tracks it closely, but there is a noticeable delay and smoothing effect due to the slew rate limitation.\n- A critical feature noted is the '1 diode drop' annotation, indicating the voltage drop across the diode when the input is positive. This is typical in diode-based rectifiers, but the op-amp compensates for this drop, allowing the output to closely follow the input.\n- The op-amp output waveform is slightly smoothed compared to the input, especially at the peaks, due to the finite slew rate and the diode's presence in the feedback loop.\n\n**Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- The graph is annotated with 'op-amp output' and 'input' to distinguish between the two waveforms.\n- The '1 diode drop' annotation is positioned at the peak of the positive cycle, indicating the voltage difference caused by the diode.\n\nOverall, the graph illustrates how the active rectifier circuit effectively rectifies the input signal with minimal voltage drop across the diode, but also highlights the impact of the op-amp's finite slew rate on the output waveform's fidelity.\n\nFigure 4.37. Effect of finite slew rate on the simple active rectifier.\n\n#### D. Active rectifier\n\nRectifying signals smaller than a diode drop cannot be achieved with a simple diode-resistor circuit. Op-amps can address this issue by incorporating a diode in the feedback loop (Figure 4.36). For positive $V_{\\text {in }}$, the diode supplies negative feedback, allowing the circuit's output to track the input through the diode without a $V_{\\mathrm{BE}}$ drop. For negative $V_{\\text {in }}$, the op-amp saturates negatively, and $V_{\\text {out }}$ is at ground. $R$ could be chosen smaller for lower output impedance, with the trade-off of higher opamp output current. A better solution is to employ an op-amp follower at the output, as shown, to achieve very low output impedance regardless of the resistor value.\n\nThis circuit has a limitation that becomes significant with high-speed signals. Since an op-amp cannot instantly swing its output, the recovery from negative saturation (as the input waveform crosses zero from below) requires some time, during which the output is inaccurate. This is depicted in the curve shown in Figure 4.37. The output (heavy trace) is an accurate rectified version of the input (light trace), except for a brief interval after the input rises through zero volts. During that interval, the op-amp output is rapidly ascending from saturation near $-V_{E E}$, so the circuit's output remains at ground. A general-purpose opamp like the 411 has a slew rate (maximum rate at which the output can change) of $15 \\mathrm{~V} / \\mu \\mathrm{s}$; recovery from negative saturation thus takes about $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$ (when operating from $\\pm 15 \\mathrm{~V}$ supplies), which may introduce significant output error for fast signals. A circuit modification can substantially improve this situation (Figure 4.38). $D_{1}$ configures the circuit as a unity-gain inverter for negative input signals. $D_{2}$ clamps the op-amp's output at one diode drop below ground for positive inputs, and since $D_{1}$ is then back-biased, $V_{\\text {out }}$ remains at ground. The enhancement arises because the op-amp's output only needs to swing two diode drops as the input signal crosses zero. Since the opamp output only needs to change about 1.2 volts instead of $V_{\\mathrm{EE}}$ volts, the \"glitch\" at zero crossings is reduced more than 10-fold. This rectifier is inverting. If a non-inverted output is required, a unity-gain inverter can be added to the output.\n\nThe performance of these circuits is enhanced by choosing an op-amp with a high slew rate. Slew rate also affects the performance of other op-amp applications discussed, such as simple voltage amplifier circuits. Soon, we will delve deeper into the ways real op-amps deviate from the ideal — input current, offset voltage, bandwidth, and slew rate, among others — because understanding these limitations is crucial for designing effective circuits. With this knowledge, we will also explore some active full-wave rectifier circuits to complement these half-wave rectifiers. First, however, we would like to showcase the enjoyment of designing with op-amps by presenting several real-world circuit examples."

    "text": "The rephrased text:\n\n```\nThese op-amp circuit fragments we've examined—amplifiers, integrators, Schmitt triggers, etc.—are intriguing; however, the true thrill in circuit design emerges when you creatively assemble these pieces to form a complete system. A suitable example we can now tackle is a triangle-wave oscillator. Unlike previous circuits, this one lacks an input signal; instead, it generates an output signal, specifically a symmetrical triangle wave with a 1-volt amplitude. Additionally, it produces a square wave as a by-product. (More oscillator examples will be discussed in Chapter 7).\n\nThe concept involves initially using an integrator (with a constant DC input voltage) to produce a ramp. When the ramp reaches its ±1 V limits, it needs to reverse direction, so we let the integrator's output (the ramp) drive a Schmitt trigger, which has thresholds set at ±1 V. The Schmitt trigger's output then determines the ramp's direction. Simply use its output (switching between supply rail voltages) as the integrator's input.\n\nFigure 4.39 illustrates the circuit implementation. It's most straightforward to begin with IC2, configured as a noninverting Schmitt trigger (though it resembles an inverting amplifier, the feedback is connected to the non-inverting input, which we'll explain shortly). This setup is less common than the standard inverting configuration shown in Figure 4.32B, due to its lower input impedance and significant input current reversal at threshold.

    "text": "Here's another practical application of op-amps: imagine you need to measure a batch of JFETs to categorize them based on their pinch-off voltage $V_{\\mathrm{GS}}$ (off) (also known as $V_{P}$, see $\\S 3.1 .3$). This is beneficial because the wide range of specified $V_{\\mathrm{P}}$ values can complicate the design of an effective amplifier. ${ }^{15}$ We'll assume your goal is to determine the gate-source back-bias that results in a drain current of $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$ with the drain at +10 V and the source grounded.\n\n[^27]image_name:Figure 4.40\ndescription:\n[\nname: A1, type: OpAmp, value: A1, ports: {InP: GND, InN: Out(A1), OutP: Out(A1), OutN: , Vdd: V+, -Vdd: V-}\nname: R1, type: Resistor, value: 100k, ports: {N1: Out(A1), N2: DUT_D}\nname: C1, type: Capacitor, value: 100pF, ports: {Np: Out(A1), Nn: InN(A1)}\nname: R2, type: Resistor, value: 10M, ports: {N1: InN(A1), N2: V-}\nname: DUT, type: NMOS, ports: {S: GND, D: V+, G: DUT_D}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit is designed to test the pinch-off voltage of n-channel JFETs. It utilizes an op-amp (LF411) to maintain a constant drain current of 1 μA for the JFET being tested, with the drain at +10 V and the source grounded. The gate-source voltage under these conditions is the pinch-off voltage.\n\nFigure 4.40. Simplified pinch-off voltage tester.\nIf you were unfamiliar with op-amps, you might consider (a) grounding the source, (b) connecting a sensitive current meter from the drain to a +10 V supply, and then (c) adjusting the gate voltage using a variable negative supply until the measured drain current reaches $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$.\n\nFigure 4.40 illustrates a more efficient method. The device under test (commonly abbreviated as DUT) has its drain connected to +10 V; however, instead of grounding the source lead, it is attached to the inverting input (virtual ground) of an op-amp whose noninverting input is grounded. The op-amp regulates the gate voltage, thereby keeping the source at ground potential. Due to the source being pulled down to -10 V through a 10 M resistor, the source current (and consequently the drain current) is $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$. The op-amp's output corresponds to the gate voltage, thus providing the pinch-off voltage you aimed to measure.\n\nSome key points to consider:\n\n- We selected $\\pm 10 \\mathrm{~V}$ power supply voltages for the op-amp to simplify the rest of the circuit, as we intended to measure $V_{\\mathrm{P}}$ with +10 V on the drain. This is acceptable because most op-amps function well across a variety of supply voltages (indeed, there is a trend towards lower operating voltages, driven by the demand for battery-powered consumer devices). If you only have $\\pm 15 \\mathrm{~V}$ available, you would need to generate +10 V within your circuit, using a voltage divider, a zener diode, or a 3-terminal voltage regulator (refer to Chapter 9).\n- We included a 100 k resistor ($R_{1}$) as a protective measure in series with the gate to prevent any substantial gate current from flowing during plug-in transients, etc. This can introduce a lagging phase shift in the loop at high frequencies (similarly, the large pull-down resistor $R_{2}$ can have this effect), so we added a small feedback capacitor $C_{1}$ to ensure stability.\n\nWe discuss the topic of stability later in the chapter, in §4.9.\n\n- For this circuit to function correctly, it is crucial that the op-amp's inverting input does not load the source terminal, for instance, by drawing any current close to a microamp. As we will soon learn, this is not always the case. In this example, our general-purpose 411 op-amp, with its JFET input transistors, is suitable (having input currents in the picoamperes range); however, an op-amp using bipolar transistors for its input stage would typically have input currents in the 10's to 100's of nanoamps and should be avoided for low-current applications like this.\n- The drain current at which the pinch-off voltage is specified is not always $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$. You will find $V_{\\mathrm{GS}(\\text { off })}$ specified at drain currents ranging from 1 nA to tens of microamps, depending on the JFET size and the manufacturer's preference. (In an informal review of datasheets, 1 nA was the most common, followed by $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$, 10 nA, and 0.5 nA, with five other values used occasionally.) Modifying the circuit to handle higher test currents is straightforward; however, to achieve 10 nA, for instance, you would require a $1 \\mathrm{G} \\Omega$ resistor for $R_{2}$! In such cases, a better approach is to connect the pull-down resistor to a lower voltage, such as -0.1 V, which can be generated using a voltage divider from the -10 V negative supply. With such a small test current, you would again need to be cautious about op-amp input currents.\n\nExercise 4.8. Demonstrate how to adapt the pinch-off tester to operate with $\\pm 15 \\mathrm{~V}$ supplies while still measuring at $V_{\\mathrm{D}}=+10 \\mathrm{~V}$; assume the largest resistor value available is $10 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega$.\n\nExercise 4.9. Modify the pinch-off tester circuit shown in Figure 4.40 to enable measurement of $V_{\\mathrm{GS}}$ at three different drain currents: $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$, $10 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$, and $100 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$, by using a 3-position switch.

If only $\\pm 15 \\mathrm{~V}$ is available, you must generate +10 V within the circuit, using a voltage divider, zener diode, or 3-terminal voltage regulator (see Chapter 9).\n- We included a 100 k resistor ($R_{1}$) as protection in series with the gate to prevent significant gate current during plug-in transients, etc. This can introduce a lagging phase shift in the loop at high frequencies (as can the large pull-down resistor $R_{2}$), so we added a small feedback capacitor $C_{1}$ to ensure stability.\n\nWe discuss stability considerations later in the chapter, in §4.9.\n\n- For this circuit to function correctly, it's crucial that the op-amp's inverting input does not load the source terminal, for instance, by drawing current close to a microamp. As we will soon learn, this is not always the case. In this example, our general-purpose 411 op-amp, with its JFET input transistors, is suitable (with input currents in the picoamperes); however, an op-amp using bipolar transistors for its input stage would typically have input currents in the 10's to 100's of nanoamps and should be avoided for low-current applications like this.\n- The drain current at which the pinch-off voltage is specified is not always $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$. You'll find $V_{\\mathrm{GS}(\\text { off })}$ specified at drain currents ranging from 1 nA to tens of microamps, depending on the JFET size and the manufacturer's preference. (An informal review of datasheets revealed 1 nA to be the most common, followed by $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$, 10 nA, and 0.5 nA, with five other values used occasionally.) Modifying the circuit for higher test currents is straightforward; but for a test current of 10 nA, for example, you would need a $1 \\mathrm{G} \\Omega$ resistor for $R_{2}$! In such cases, a better approach is to connect the pull-down resistor to a lower voltage, such as -0.1 V, which can be generated using a voltage divider from the -10 V negative supply. You would again need to consider op-amp input currents with such a small test current.\nExercise 4.8.

Moreover, modern general-purpose SPICE-based analog simulation tools, or specialized filter analysis software, enable you to design and visualize filter response curves with relative ease.\n\n[^29]image_name:A\ndescription:\n[\nname: R1, type: Resistor, value: R1, ports: {N1: input, N2: X1}\nname: R2, type: Resistor, value: R2, ports: {N1: X1, N2: InP}\nname: C1, type: Capacitor, value: C1, ports: {Np: X1, Nn: GND}\nname: C2, type: Capacitor, value: C2, ports: {Np: InP, Nn: GND}\nname: A1, type: OpAmp, value: A1, ports: {InP: InP, InN: InN, OutP: output}\n]\nextrainfo:This is a Sallen-and-Key active lowpass filter.
