    "text": "Frequently, filters with flatter passbands and steeper skirts are necessary. This requirement arises when signals need to be separated from nearby interfering frequencies. The subsequent question is whether cascading multiple identical lowpass filters can approximate the ideal \"brick-wall\" lowpass frequency response, as shown in Figure 6.1.\n\nimage_name:Figure 6.1\ndescription:Figure 6.1 presents a frequency response curve for an ideal brick-wall lowpass filter. This type of graph, known as a magnitude response plot, illustrates how a filter impacts the amplitude of various frequency components of a signal.\n\n1. **Graph Type and Function:** The graph is a frequency response plot, depicting the ratio of output to input voltage (V_out/V_in) of a filter across different frequencies.\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n- The vertical axis is labeled V_out/V_in, representing the output-to-input voltage ratio, and is dimensionless, typically on a linear scale.\n- The horizontal axis represents frequency, with a cutoff frequency point at f_0, though the specific unit (Hz) is not indicated.\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- The graph displays a flat passband where V_out/V_in equals 1, indicating no attenuation for frequencies below the cutoff (f_0).\n- At the cutoff frequency (f_0), the response drops abruptly to zero, showcasing the ideal \"brick-wall\" characteristic where frequencies above f_0 are fully attenuated.\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The graph features a distinct 'knee' at the cutoff frequency f_0, beyond which the response drops instantly to zero.\n- There are no gradual slopes or roll-off regions; the transition from passband to stopband is immediate in this ideal representation.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- The graph marks the cutoff frequency point at f_0, where the transition from passband to stopband occurs.\n- The passband magnitude remains constant at 1, indicating no gain or loss in this ideal scenario.\n\nFigure 6.1. Ideal brick-wall lowpass filter.\nWe already know that simple cascading isn't effective because each section's input impedance significantly loads the previous one, degrading the response. However, with buffers between each section or by ensuring each section has a much higher impedance than the preceding one, it might seem feasible. Nonetheless, the answer is no. Cascaded RC filters do achieve a steep ultimate falloff, but they do not sharpen the 'knee' of the response versus frequency curve. This can be restated as \"many soft knees do not create a hard knee.\" To illustrate this graphically, we plotted gain response (V_out/V_in) versus frequency for lowpass filters made from 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 identical RC sections, perfectly buffered (Figure 6.2).\n\nThe initial graph shows the impact of cascading several RC sections, each with its 3 dB point at unit frequency. As more sections are added, the overall 3 dB point shifts downward in frequency, as one might predict. To fairly compare filter characteristics, the rolloff frequencies of the individual sections should be adjusted so that the overall 3 dB point remains at the same frequency. For this reason, the other graphs in Figure 6.2 are \"normalized\" in frequency, meaning the -3 dB point is at a frequency of 1 radian per second (or 1 Hz). To determine the response of a filter with a different breakpoint frequency, simply multiply the frequency axis values by the actual breakpoint frequency (f_c). Generally, we will use log-log graphs for frequency response discussions because they provide comprehensive information about the frequency response, allowing us to observe the approach to the ultimate rolloff slope and to read accurate attenuation values. In the case of cascaded RC sections, the normalized graphs in Figures 6.2B and 6.2C highlight the soft knee characteristic of passive RC filters.\n\nIt's also insightful to examine the phase shift of an RC lowpass cascade, adjusted to place the overall 3 dB points at unit frequency; these are depicted in Figure 6.3. The lagging phase shift asymptotically reaches 90° × n for n cascaded sections, as expected (recall the smooth transition from 0° to 90° lagging phase shift in a single RC section, Figure 1.104). However, the phase shift at the 3 dB point increases with larger cascades, which may not be intuitive. Phase-shift characteristics are crucial because they influence the filter's in-band waveform distortion.\n\n#### A. Degradation of Ultimate Attenuation: Non-Ideal Capacitors\n\nUnlike ideal capacitors, real capacitors have additional \"parasitic\" elements, notably effective series resistance (ESR) and effective series inductance (ESL). At very high frequencies, where the capacitor's ESR becomes comparable to its capacitive reactance (1/ωC), a real RC filter ceases to roll off. We modeled this using SPICE (see Appendix J) for cascaded multisection RC filters, as shown in Figure 6.4. For this comparison, we assumed a scenario where RC filtering is used on a dc rail supplying a low-level stage to suppress higher frequency switching noise and coupled signals. We set a total series resistance budget of 100 Ω (consistent with a load current of a few milliamps) and limited the total capacitance to 20 µF (to maintain a reasonable physical size). We then simulated three filters: a single 100 Ω, 20 µF RC stage; a 2-section filter with 50 Ω and 10 µF per section; and a 4-section filter with 25 Ω and 5 µF per section. We plotted the responses of these three filters first with perfect capacitors (no ESR) and then with realistic ESR values from capacitor datasheets (e.g., 1 Ω for a 5 µF electrolytic capacitor rated at 100 V).\n\nThe series resistance effect is evident, causing a loss of ultimate attenuation at high frequencies where the capacitor impedance asymptotes to the ESR value instead of continuing to decrease as 1/f. Nevertheless, it is clear that distributing the total capacitance across several filter sections is a sensible approach.\n\nimage_name:Figure 6.3\ndescription:Figure 6.3 is a Bode plot showing phase shift versus frequency for multisection RC lowpass filters. The vertical axis measures phase shift in degrees, and the horizontal axis represents normalized frequency on a logarithmic scale from 0.1 to 100.\n\nThe plot includes four curves, each corresponding to a different number of filter sections (n = 1, 2, 4, and 8). As the number of sections increases, the phase shift becomes more negative at a given frequency, indicating greater delay introduced by the filter.\n\n1. **Graph Type and Function:** This is a Bode plot focusing on phase shift.\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:** The vertical axis is labeled \"Phase Shift (degrees),\" and the horizontal axis is labeled \"Normalized Frequency (log scale).\" The phase shift ranges from 0 to -700 degrees, and the frequency is plotted on a logarithmic scale from 0.1 to 100.\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:** All curves show a downward trend, indicating increasing phase shift with increasing frequency. The phase shift starts near 0 degrees at low frequencies and becomes more negative as frequency increases, asymptotically approaching a maximum negative value.\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:** Each curve represents a different number of filter sections, with n = 1 having the least negative phase shift and n = 8 having the most. The phase shift increases more rapidly with frequency for higher values of n.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:** The curves are annotated with their respective n values (1, 2, 4, and 8), showing how phase shift behavior changes with the number of sections. The vertical line at a normalized frequency of 1 serves as a reference point for comparing phase shifts across different curves.\n\nFigure 6.3. Phase shift versus frequency for the multisection RC lowpass filters of Figure 6.2C.\nimage_name:Figure 6.4\ndescription:Figure 6.4 is a Bode plot showing attenuation (in decibels) versus frequency (in Hertz) for cascaded RC lowpass filters. The x-axis represents frequency, ranging from 10 Hz to 100 kHz on a logarithmic scale, and the y-axis indicates attenuation in decibels, ranging from 0 dB to -120 dB.\n\nThe plot compares the performance of ideal (dotted lines) and real (solid lines) RC filters with different numbers of sections: 1, 2, and 4 sections. The real capacitors include some irreducible series resistance, affecting the attenuation characteristics.\n\n1. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- Attenuation increases with frequency for both ideal and real filters.\n- Ideal filters (dotted lines) show a consistent increase in attenuation with frequency, while real filters (solid lines) show less attenuation due to series resistance.\n- More sections result in greater attenuation at higher frequencies.\n\n2. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The 1-section real filter shows less attenuation than the ideal filter across the frequency range.\n- The 2-section and 4-section filters show progressively higher attenuation, with real filters deviating more from the ideal as the number of sections increases.\n- The curves exhibit a steeper slope with more sections, indicating sharper roll-off characteristics.\n\n3. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- Each curve is labeled with the number of sections (1, 2, or 4) to distinguish between them.\n- Gridlines and labels on the axes provide a clear reference for assessing attenuation levels at specific frequencies.\n\nFigure 6.4.

Degradation of Ultimate Attenuation: Non-Ideal Capacitors\n\nUnlike ideal capacitors, real capacitors have \"parasitic\" elements, notably effective series resistance (ESR) and effective series inductance (ESL). At very high frequencies, where the capacitor's ESR rivals the capacitive reactance (1/ωC), a real RC filter stops rolling off. We modeled this using SPICE (see Appendix J) for cascaded multisection RC filters, as shown in Figure 6.4. For this comparison, we assumed filtering a dc rail supplying a low-level stage to suppress higher frequency switching noise and coupled signals. We set a total series resistance budget of 100 Ω (consistent with a few milliamps load current) and limited total capacitance to 20 µF (to maintain a reasonable size). We then simulated three filters: a single 100 Ω, 20 µF RC stage; a 2-section filter with 50 Ω and 10 µF per section; and a 4-section filter with 25 Ω and 5 µF per section. We plotted their responses first with perfect capacitors (no ESR), then with realistic ESR values from capacitor datasheets (e.g., 1 Ω for a 5 µF electrolytic capacitor rated at 100 V).\n\nThe series resistance effect is evident, causing a loss of ultimate attenuation at high frequencies where the capacitors' impedance asymptotes to the ESR value instead of continuing to fall as 1/f. Nevertheless, distributing the total capacitance across several filter sections is clearly beneficial.\nimage_name:Figure 6.3\ndescription:Figure 6.3 is a Bode plot showing phase shift versus frequency for multisection RC lowpass filters. The vertical axis measures phase shift in degrees, and the horizontal axis shows normalized frequency on a logarithmic scale from 0.1 to 100.\n\nThe plot includes four curves, each representing a different number of filter sections (n = 1, 2, 4, and 8).

    "text": "Frequently, filters with flatter passbands and steeper skirts are necessary. This requirement arises when signals must be separated from neighboring interfering signals in the frequency spectrum. The subsequent question is whether cascading multiple identical lowpass filters can approximate the ideal \"brick-wall\" lowpass frequency response, as illustrated in Figure 6.1.\n\n**Figure 6.1 Description:**\nThe graph in Figure 6.1 represents an ideal brick-wall lowpass filter's frequency response curve. This type of graph is known as a magnitude response plot, commonly used to depict how a filter affects the amplitude of various frequency components of a signal.\n\n1. **Graph Type and Function:** It is a frequency response plot, showing the relationship between the input and output voltage ratio (V_out/V_in) of a filter across different frequencies.\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n   - The vertical axis is labeled V_out/V_in, indicating the ratio of output voltage to input voltage. This axis is dimensionless and typically expressed on a linear scale.\n   - The horizontal axis represents frequency, marked with a cutoff frequency point at f_0. The frequency units are in hertz (Hz), though not specified on the graph.\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n   - The graph displays a flat passband where V_out/V_in equals 1, meaning frequencies below the cutoff frequency (f_0) pass through the filter without attenuation.\n   - At the cutoff frequency (f_0), the response drops sharply to zero, exemplifying the ideal \"brick-wall\" characteristic where frequencies above f_0 are completely attenuated.\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n   - The graph features a distinct 'knee' at the cutoff frequency f_0, beyond which the response drops instantly to zero.\n   - There are no gradual slopes or roll-off regions; the transition from passband to stopband is immediate in this ideal representation.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n   - The graph marks the cutoff frequency point at f_0, where the transition from passband to stopband occurs.\n   - The passband magnitude remains constant at 1, indicating no gain or loss in this ideal scenario.\n\n**Figure 6.1. Ideal brick-wall lowpass filter.**\n\nWe already know that simple cascading is ineffective because each section's input impedance significantly loads the preceding section, degrading the response. However, with buffers between each section or by ensuring each section has a much higher impedance than the one before, it might seem feasible. Nonetheless, the answer remains no. Cascaded RC filters do achieve a steep ultimate falloff, but the \"knee\" of the response versus frequency curve is not sharpened. This can be restated as \"many soft knees do not make a hard knee.\" To illustrate this graphically, we plotted gain response (V_out/V_in) versus frequency for lowpass filters constructed from 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 identical RC sections, perfectly buffered (Figure 6.2).\n\nThe initial graph shows the impact of cascading several RC sections, each with its 3 dB point at unit frequency. As more sections are added, the overall 3 dB point shifts downward in frequency, as one might predict. To fairly compare filter characteristics, the rolloff frequencies of the individual sections should be adjusted so that the overall 3 dB point remains at the same frequency. Therefore, the other graphs in Figure 6.2 are \"normalized\" in frequency, meaning the -3 dB point is at a frequency of 1 radian per second (or 1 Hz). To determine the response of a filter with a different breakpoint frequency, simply multiply the frequency axis values by the actual breakpoint frequency (f_c). Generally, we will use log-log graphs for frequency response discussions because they provide more insight into the frequency response, allowing us to observe the approach to the ultimate rolloff slope and accurately read attenuation values. In the case of cascaded RC sections, the normalized graphs in Figures 6.2B and 6.2C highlight the soft knee characteristic of passive RC filters.\n\nIt is also insightful to examine the phase shift of an RC lowpass cascade, adjusted to place the overall 3 dB points at unit frequency, as plotted in Figure 6.3. The lagging phase shift asymptotically reaches 90° × n for n cascaded sections, as expected (recall the smooth transition from 0° to 90° lagging phase shift in a single RC section, Figure 1.104). However, intriguingly, the phase shift at the 3 dB point increases with larger cascades. Phase-shift characteristics are crucial, as they determine the filter's in-band waveform distortion.\n\n#### A. Degradation of Ultimate Attenuation: Non-Ideal Capacitors\n\nUnlike ideal capacitors, real capacitors exhibit additional \"parasitic\" elements, notably effective series resistance (ESR) and effective series inductance (ESL). At very high frequencies, where the capacitor's ESR becomes comparable to its capacitive reactance (1/ωC), a real RC filter ceases to roll off. We modeled this using SPICE (see Appendix J) for cascaded multisection RC filters, as shown in Figure 6.4. For this comparison, we assumed the need for RC filtering on a dc rail supplying a low-level stage to suppress higher frequency switching noise and coupled signals. We set a \"budget\" of 100 Ω total series resistance (consistent with a load current of a few milliamps) and limited ourselves to 20 µF total capacitance (to maintain a reasonable physical size). We then simulated three filters: a single 100 Ω, 20 µF RC stage; a 2-section filter with 50 Ω and 10 µF per section; and a 4-section filter with 25 Ω and 5 µF per section. We plotted the responses of these three filters, first with perfect capacitors (no ESR), then with realistic ESR values from capacitor datasheets (e.g., 1 Ω for a 5 µF electrolytic capacitor rated at 100 V).\n\nThe series resistance effect is evident, causing a loss of ultimate attenuation at high frequencies where the capacitor impedance asymptotes to the ESR value instead of continuing to fall as 1/f. Nevertheless, it is clear that distributing the total capacitance across several filter sections is a sensible approach.\n\n**Figure 6.3 Description:**\nFigure 6.3 is a Bode plot showing phase shift versus frequency for multisection RC lowpass filters. The vertical axis measures phase shift in degrees, and the horizontal axis shows normalized frequency on a logarithmic scale from 0.1 to 100.\n\nThe plot includes four curves, each representing a different number of filter sections (n = 1, 2, 4, and 8). As the number of sections increases, the phase shift becomes more negative at a given frequency, indicating a greater delay introduced by the filter.\n\n1. **Graph Type and Function:** This is a Bode plot focusing on phase shift.\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:** The vertical axis is labeled \"Phase Shift (degrees),\" and the horizontal axis is labeled \"Normalized Frequency (log scale).\" The phase shift ranges from 0 to -700 degrees, and the frequency is plotted on a logarithmic scale from 0.1 to 100.\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:** All curves show a downward trend, indicating increasing phase shift with increasing frequency. The phase shift starts near 0 degrees at low frequencies and becomes more negative as frequency increases, asymptotically approaching a maximum negative value.\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:** Each curve represents a different number of filter sections, with n = 1 having the least negative phase shift and n = 8 having the most. The phase shift increases more rapidly with frequency for higher values of n.\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:** The curves are annotated with their respective n values (1, 2, 4, and 8), showing how phase shift behavior changes with the number of sections. The vertical line at a normalized frequency of 1 serves as a reference point.\n\n**Figure 6.3.

The real capacitors include some irreducible series resistance, affecting the attenuation characteristics.\n\n1. **Overall Behavior and Trends:** As frequency increases, attenuation also increases for both ideal and real filters. The ideal filters show a consistent increase in attenuation with frequency, while the real filters show less attenuation due to series resistance.\n2. **Key Features and Technical Details:** The 1-section real filter shows less attenuation than the ideal filter across the frequency range. The 2-section and 4-section filters show progressively higher attenuation, with the real filters deviating more significantly from the ideal as the number of sections increases.\n3. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:** Each curve is labeled with the number of sections (1, 2, or 4) to distinguish between them. The gridlines and labels on the axes provide clear reference points for assessing attenuation levels at specific frequencies.\n\n**Figure 6.4.

This is the case when signals need to be separated from adjacent signals that interfere in the same frequency range. Naturally, one might wonder if we could create an approximate \"brick-wall\" lowpass frequency response by using multiple identical lowpass filters, as shown in Figure 6.1.\nimage_name:Figure 6.1\ndescription:The graph in Figure 6.1 illustrates a frequency response curve for an ideal \"brick-wall\" lowpass filter. Such graphs are often called magnitude response plots, which help demonstrate how filters influence the amplitude of various frequency components of a signal.\n\n1. **Graph Type and Purpose:** The graph is a frequency response plot that depicts the relationship between the input and output voltage ratio (V_out/V_in) of a filter at various frequencies.\n\n2. **Axes Labeling and Units:**\n- The vertical axis is designated as V_out/V_in, showing the output voltage to input voltage ratio. This axis is unitless, typically depicted using a linear scale.\n- The horizontal axis denotes frequency, marked by a cutoff frequency of f_0. Frequency is generally measured in hertz (Hz), though it is not explicitly stated on this graph.\n\n3. **Behavior and Trends:**\n- The graph exhibits a flat passband where the V_out/V_in ratio is 1, indicating frequencies below the cutoff (f_0) pass through the filter with no reduction.\n- At the cutoff frequency (f_0), the response sharply drops to zero, showcasing the ideal \"brick-wall\" characteristic where frequencies above f_0 are fully blocked.\n\n4. **Key Characteristics and Details:**\n- The graph has a clear 'knee' at the cutoff frequency f_0, beyond which the response quickly falls to zero.\n- There are no gradual slopes or roll-off regions; the shift from passband to stopband is immediate in this ideal model.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- The graph is marked with a cutoff frequency point at f_0, where the transition from passband to stopband occurs.\n- The passband magnitude remains constant at 1, signifying no gain or loss in this ideal condition.\n\nFigure 6.1. Ideal brick-wall lowpass filter.\nWe understand that simple cascading is insufficient, as each section's input impedance imposes a significant load on the preceding section, negatively impacting the response. However, introducing buffers between sections or ensuring each section has a higher impedance than the previous one might be a solution. Nevertheless, the fact remains that cascading RC filters alone does not achieve a sharp transition. The \"soft knees\" of the response curve do not result in a \"hard knee.\" To visually demonstrate this, we have plotted gain response (V_out/V_in) vs. frequency graphs for lowpass filters made of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 RC sections, all properly buffered (Figure 6.2).\n\nThe initial graph depicts the impact of cascading multiple RC sections, each with a 3 dB cutoff at the unit frequency. As more sections are added, the overall 3 dB cutoff frequency decreases, as expected. To fairly compare the filter characteristics, the roll-off has been adjusted. image_name:A\ndescription:Graph 'A' shows a linear plot of amplitude response (V_out/V_in) against frequency for lowpass filters made up of various numbers of identical RC sections (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32). The x-axis denotes frequency in Hertz (Hz), ranging from 0 to 3 Hz, and the y-axis represents amplitude response, ranging from 0 to 1.\n\n**Behavior and Trends:**\n- The graph presents a series of curves, each corresponding to a distinct number of RC sections (n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32).\n- As the number of sections grows, the curves become steeper, demonstrating a more rapid decline in amplitude response as frequency increases.\n- Each curve initiates at an amplitude of 1 at 0 Hz and diminishes as frequency rises.\n\n**Key Characteristics and Details:**\n- The -3 dB point is marked by a dashed horizontal line at about 0.707 on the amplitude response axis.\n- With more sections, the -3 dB point shifts to a lower frequency, showing that the overall cutoff frequency decreases as more sections are incorporated.\n- The curves exhibit the classic behavior of lowpass filters, where higher frequencies are suppressed more.\n\n**Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- Each curve is labeled with the corresponding number of sections (n).\n- The -3 dB line aids in determining the cutoff frequency for each configuration.\n\nThis graph effectively showcases the impact of adding more RC sections to a lowpass filter, resulting in a steeper roll-off and a lower cutoff frequency as the number of sections increases.\nimage_name:B\ndescription:Graph B in Figure 6.2 is a linear plot that illustrates the amplitude response (V_out/V_in) versus normalized frequency for lowpass filters composed of multiple identical RC sections. The x-axis depicts normalized frequency, and the y-axis represents amplitude response, both ranging from 0 to 3 and 0 to 1, respectively. The graph includes several curves, each corresponding to a different number of RC sections (n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32).\n\nThe primary trend observed is that as the number of sections (n) increases, the roll-off becomes steeper, indicating a sharper transition from passband to stopband. Each curve starts at an amplitude of 1 at low frequencies, gradually reducing as frequency increases. The -3 dB point, identified by a dashed horizontal line at approximately 0.707 on the y-axis, provides a reference for comparing the cutoff frequencies of the filters.\n\nObserve that the curves for higher numbers of sections (e.g., n = 32) exhibit a more significant decrease in amplitude at lower normalized frequencies when compared to those with fewer sections (e.g., n = 1). This indicates the increased selectivity and sharper cutoff of filters with more sections. The graph clearly illustrates how cascading additional RC sections improves the filter's capability to suppress frequencies beyond the desired cutoff.\nimage_name:C\ndescription:Graph 'C' is a Bode plot that displays the amplitude response of lowpass filters made from multiple cascaded RC sections. The plot utilizes logarithmic scales for both the frequency and amplitude axes, a common practice for Bode plots.\n\n**Axes Labeling and Units:**\n- The x-axis is labeled \"Normalized Frequency (log scale)\" and shows frequency on a logarithmic scale.\n- The y-axis is labeled \"Amplitude Response V_out / V_in\" and represents the gain of the filter, also on a logarithmic scale.\n\n**Behavior and Trends:**\n- The graph presents several curves, each corresponding to a distinct number of cascaded RC sections, denoted by 'n' (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32).\n- As the number of cascaded sections increases, the roll-off of the filter becomes steeper, indicating faster attenuation of higher frequencies.\n- The curves start at a normalized amplitude of 1 (0 dB) at low frequencies and decrease as frequency increases.\n\n**Key Characteristics and Details:**\n- The -3 dB point, which is the cutoff frequency, is normalized to 1 for all curves. This normalization enables fair comparison of the roll-off characteristics of the filters.\n- The curves show that with more sections, the filter has a sharper transition band and greater attenuation in the stopband.\n\n**Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- Each curve is labeled with the corresponding number of sections (n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32).\n- The plot vividly demonstrates the effect of increasing the number of sections on the filter's frequency response, highlighting the trade-off between complexity and performance in filter design.\n\nFigure 6.2. Frequency responses of multisection RC filters. Graphs A and B are linear plots, whereas C is logarithmic. The filter responses in B and C have been normalized (or scaled) to have 3 dB attenuation at unit frequency.\nThe frequencies of the individual sections should be adjusted to ensure the overall 3 dB point remains constant. This is why all other graphs in Figure 6.2 are \"normalized\" for frequency, indicating that the -3 dB point (or breakpoint) is at a frequency of 1 radian per second (or at 1 Hz). To calculate the response of a filter with a breakpoint at a different frequency, simply multiply the frequency axis values by the actual breakpoint frequency $f_{\\mathrm{c}}$. In general, we will stick to the log-log graph of frequency response when discussing filters, as it provides the most comprehensive information about the frequency response. It allows you to observe the approach of the ultimate rolloff slope and accurately determine attenuation values. In this case (cascaded RC sections), the normalized graphs in Figures 6.2B and 6.2C demonstrate the characteristic soft knee of passive RC filters.\n\nIt is also worth examining the phase shift of an RC lowpass cascade, adjusted to set the overall 3 dB points at unit frequency; these are depicted in Figure 6.3. The lagging phase shift increases asymptotically to $90^{\\circ} \\times n$ for $n$ cascaded sections, as anticipated (consider the smooth transition from $0^{\\circ}$ to $90^{\\circ}$ lagging phase shift of a single RC section, Figure 1.104). However, it may seem counterintuitive that the phase shift at the 3 dB point increases with larger cascades. Phase-shift characteristics are significant because they determine the filter's in-band waveform distortion.\n\n#### A. Limitations of ultimate attenuation: Non-ideal capacitors\n\nReal capacitors, unlike ideal capacitors, possess certain \"parasitic\" elements, notably effective series resistance (ESR) and effective series inductance (ESL). Therefore, at very high frequencies (where the capacitor's ESR becomes comparable to the capacitive reactance $1 / \\omega C$), a real RC filter stops decreasing its response. We simulated this by using SPICE (see Appendix J) for the cascaded multisection RC filter, see Figure 6.4. For this comparison, we assumed you wanted to filter out high-frequency noise from a DC rail that powers a low-level stage using RC filtering, so we allocated a \"budget\" of $100 \\Omega$ for total series resistance (consistent with a load current of a few milliamps) and limited the total capacitance to $20 \\mu \\mathrm{~F}$ (to keep the physical size reasonable). We then simulated the response of three filters: a single $100 \\Omega, 20 \\mu \\mathrm{~F} RC$ stage; a 2-section filter with $50 \\Omega$ and $10 \\mu \\mathrm{~F}$ in each section; and a 4-section filter with $25 \\Omega$ and $5 \\mu \\mathrm{~F}$ in each section. We generated plots of the response of these three filters, initially with ideal capacitors (no ESR) and then with realistic ESR values, sourced from capacitor data sheets (e.g., $1 \\Omega$ for a $5 \\mu \\mathrm{~F}$ electrolytic capacitor rated at 100 V).\n\nIt is evident from the series resistance that the ultimate attenuation is compromised at high frequencies, as the impedance of the capacitors reaches the ESR value rather than continuing to drop as $1 / f$. However, it is clear that dividing the total capacitance into several filter sections is a good approach.\nimage_name:Figure 6.3\ndescription:Figure 6.3 presents a Bode plot that portrays the phase shift in degrees against normalized frequency for multisection RC lowpass filters. The vertical axis shows phase shift in degrees, and the horizontal axis displays normalized frequency on a logarithmic scale, ranging from 0.1 to 100.\n\nThe plot contains four curves, each representing a different number of filter sections (n = 1, 2, 4, and 8).

The phase shift starts near 0 degrees at low frequencies and becomes more negative as frequency increases. The curves approach a maximum negative phase shift value as frequency rises further.\n\n4. **Key Characteristics and Details:** Each curve corresponds to a different number of filter sections, with n = 1 showing the least negative phase shift and n = 8 having the most. The phase shift increases more rapidly with frequency for higher values of n.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:** The curves are annotated with their respective n values (1, 2, 4, and 8), illustrating how phase shift behavior changes with the number of sections in the filter. The vertical line at a normalized frequency of 1 acts as a reference point for comparing phase shifts across different curves.\n\nFigure 6.3.

This can be restated as \"many soft knees do not create a hard knee.\" To illustrate this point, we plotted gain response graphs (V_out/V_in versus frequency) for lowpass filters made from 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 identical RC sections, perfectly buffered (Figure 6.2).\n\nThe initial graph shows the impact of cascading several RC sections, each with its 3 dB point at unit frequency. As more sections are added, the overall 3 dB point shifts downward in frequency, as one might predict. ${ }^{1}$ To fairly compare filter characteristics, the rolloff frequencies of the individual sections should be adjusted so that the overall 3 dB point remains at the same frequency. Therefore, the other graphs in Figure 6.2 are \"normalized\" in frequency, meaning the -3 dB point is set at a frequency of 1 radian per second (or 1 Hz). To determine the response of a filter with a different breakpoint frequency, simply multiply the frequency axis values by the actual breakpoint frequency $f_{\\mathrm{c}}$. Generally, we prefer log-log graphs for filter frequency responses because they provide more information about the frequency response, showing the approach to the ultimate rolloff slope and allowing accurate attenuation readings. In the case of cascaded RC sections, the normalized graphs in Figures 6.2B and 6.2C highlight the soft knee characteristic of passive RC filters.\n\nIt's also insightful to examine the phase shift of an RC lowpass cascade, adjusted to maintain the overall 3 dB points at unit frequency; these are plotted in Figure 6.3. The lagging phase shift asymptotically reaches $90^{\\circ} \\times n$ for n cascaded sections, as expected (recall the smooth transition from $0^{\\circ}$ to $90^{\\circ}$ lagging phase shift in a single RC section, Figure 1.104). However, non-intuitively, the phase shift at the 3 dB point increases with larger cascades. Phase-shift characteristics are crucial because they determine the filter's in-band waveform distortion.\n\n#### A. Degradation of ultimate attenuation: non-ideal capacitors\n\nUnlike ideal capacitors, real capacitors have additional \"parasitic\" elements, notably effective series resistance (ESR) and effective series inductance (ESL). At very high frequencies, where the capacitor's ESR becomes comparable to its capacitive reactance $1 / \\omega C$, a real RC filter ceases to roll off. We modeled this using SPICE (see Appendix J) for cascaded multisection RC filters, as shown in Figure 6.4. For this comparison, we assumed the need for RC filtering on a dc rail supplying a low-level stage, to suppress higher frequency switching noise and coupled signals. We set a \"budget\" of $100 \\Omega$ total series resistance (suitable for a load current of a few milliamps) and limited the total capacitance to $20 \\mu \\mathrm{~F}$ (to maintain a reasonable physical size). We then simulated three filters: a single $100 \\Omega, 20 \\mu \\mathrm{~F}$ RC stage; a 2-section filter with $50 \\Omega$ and $10 \\mu \\mathrm{~F}$ per section; and a 4-section filter with $25 \\Omega$ and $5 \\mu \\mathrm{~F}$ per section. We plotted the responses of these filters, first with perfect capacitors (no ESR), then with realistic ESR values from capacitor datasheets (e.g., $1 \\Omega$ for a $5 \\mu \\mathrm{~F}$ electrolytic capacitor rated at 100 V).\n\nThe series resistance effect is evident, causing a loss of ultimate attenuation at high frequencies, where the capacitor impedance asymptotes to the ESR value instead of continuing to fall as $1 / f$. Nevertheless, it is clear that distributing the total capacitance across several filter sections is beneficial.\n\nimage_name:Figure 6.3\ndescription:Figure 6.3 is a Bode plot showing phase shift versus frequency for multisection RC lowpass filters. The graph plots phase shift in degrees on the vertical axis and normalized frequency on a logarithmic scale on the horizontal axis, ranging from 0.1 to 100.\n\nThe plot includes four curves, each representing a different number of filter sections (n = 1, 2, 4, and 8). As the number of sections increases, the phase shift becomes more negative at any given frequency, indicating greater delay introduced by the filter.\n\n1. **Graph Type and Function:** This is a Bode plot focusing on phase shift.\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:** The vertical axis is labeled \"Phase Shift (degrees)\" and the horizontal axis is labeled \"Normalized Frequency (log scale).\" The phase shift ranges from 0 to -700 degrees, and the frequency is plotted logarithmically from 0.1 to 100.\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:** All curves show a downward trend, indicating increasing phase shift with increasing frequency. The phase shift starts near 0 degrees at low frequencies and becomes more negative as frequency rises, asymptotically approaching a maximum negative value.\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:** Each curve corresponds to a different number of filter sections, with n = 1 having the least negative phase shift and n = 8 having the most. The phase shift increases more rapidly with frequency for higher n values.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:** The curves are annotated with their respective n values (1, 2, 4, and 8), showing how phase shift behavior changes with the number of sections. The vertical line at a normalized frequency of 1 serves as a reference for comparing phase shifts across different curves.\n\nFigure 6.3.

    "text": "Frequently, filters with flatter passbands and steeper skirts are necessary. This requirement arises when signals need to be separated from neighboring interfering frequencies. The subsequent question is whether cascading multiple identical lowpass filters can approximate the ideal \"brick-wall\" lowpass frequency response, as illustrated in Figure 6.1.\n\nimage_name:Figure 6.1\ndescription:Figure 6.1 presents a frequency response curve depicting an ideal brick-wall lowpass filter. This type of graph, known as a magnitude response plot, is used to show how a filter impacts the amplitude of various frequency components of a signal.\n\n1. **Graph Type and Function:** The graph is a frequency response plot, illustrating the relationship between the input and output voltage ratio (V_out/V_in) of a filter across different frequencies.\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n- The vertical axis is labeled V_out/V_in, representing the ratio of output to input voltage. This axis is dimensionless and typically displayed on a linear scale.\n- The horizontal axis represents frequency, marked with a cutoff frequency point at f_0. The frequency units are in hertz (Hz), though not explicitly labeled on the graph.\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- The graph displays a flat passband where V_out/V_in equals 1, indicating that frequencies below the cutoff frequency (f_0) pass through the filter without attenuation.\n- At the cutoff frequency (f_0), the response drops abruptly to zero, exemplifying the ideal \"brick-wall\" characteristic where frequencies above f_0 are entirely attenuated.\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The graph features a distinct 'knee' at the cutoff frequency f_0, beyond which the response drops instantly to zero.\n- There are no gradual slopes or roll-off regions; the transition from passband to stopband is immediate in this ideal representation.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- The graph includes a marked cutoff frequency point at f_0, where the transition from passband to stopband occurs.\n- The magnitude of the passband remains constant at 1, indicating no gain or loss in this ideal scenario.\n\nFigure 6.1. Ideal brick-wall lowpass filter.\nWe already know that simple cascading is ineffective because each section's input impedance significantly loads the preceding section, degrading the response. However, with buffers between each section or by ensuring each section has a much higher impedance than the one before, it might seem feasible. Nonetheless, the answer is no. Cascaded RC filters do achieve a steep ultimate falloff, but the \"knee\" of the response versus frequency curve is not sharpened. This can be restated as \"many soft knees do not make a hard knee.\" To illustrate this graphically, we plotted gain response (V_out/V_in) versus frequency for lowpass filters constructed from 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 identical RC sections, perfectly buffered (Figure 6.2).\n\nThe initial graph shows the impact of cascading several RC sections, each with its 3 dB point at unit frequency. As more sections are added, the overall 3 dB point shifts downward in frequency, as one might predict. To fairly compare filter characteristics, the rolloff frequencies of the individual sections should be adjusted so that the overall 3 dB point remains at the same frequency. For this reason, the other graphs in Figure 6.2 are all \"normalized\" in frequency, meaning the -3 dB point (or breakpoint) is set at a frequency of 1 radian per second (or 1 Hz). To determine the response of a filter with a breakpoint at a different frequency, simply multiply the frequency axis values by the actual breakpoint frequency f_c. Generally, we will use log-log graphs for frequency response discussions because they provide the most information about the frequency response. They show the approach to the ultimate rolloff slope and allow for accurate attenuation readings. In the case of cascaded RC sections, the normalized graphs in Figures 6.2B and 6.2C highlight the soft knee characteristic of passive RC filters.\n\nIt's also insightful to examine the phase shift of an RC lowpass cascade, adjusted to place the overall 3 dB points at unit frequency; these are shown in Figure 6.3. The lagging phase shift asymptotically reaches 90° × n for n cascaded sections, as expected (recall the smooth transition from 0° to 90° lagging phase shift of a single RC section, Figure 1.104). However, intriguingly, the phase shift at the 3 dB point increases with larger cascades. Phase-shift characteristics are crucial, as they determine the filter's in-band waveform distortion.\n\n#### A. Degradation of ultimate attenuation: non-ideal capacitors\n\nUnlike ideal capacitors, real capacitors exhibit additional \"parasitic\" elements, notably an effective series resistance (ESR) and an effective series inductance (ESL).

We then simulated three filters: a single 100 Ω, 20 µF RC stage; a 2-section filter with 50 Ω and 10 µF per section; and a 4-section filter with 25 Ω and 5 µF per section. We plotted the responses of these three filters, first with perfect capacitors (no ESR), then with realistic ESR values from capacitor datasheets (e.g., 1 Ω for a 5 µF electrolytic capacitor rated at 100 V).\n\nThe series resistance effect is evident, resulting in reduced ultimate attenuation at high frequencies, where the capacitors' impedance asymptotes to the ESR value rather than continuing to fall as 1/f. Nevertheless, it is clear that distributing the total capacitance across several filter sections is a sensible approach.\n\nimage_name:Figure 6.3\ndescription:Figure 6.3 is a Bode plot showing phase shift versus frequency for multisection RC lowpass filters.

    "text": "The sophisticated design of the Orchard and Sheahan filter in Figure 6.5 exemplifies the intricacies achievable through advanced classic LC filter synthesis techniques. However, creating satisfactorily effective filters doesn't necessitate expertise akin to a filter magician. We present three straightforward filter designs that we've recently implemented at our radio telescope observatory to address typical problems.\n\n#### A. Conversion of Digital Square Wave to Sinewave\n\nGenerating precise frequency square waves is straightforward in digital electronics, but at our observatory, we required sine waves. Figure 6.6 illustrates a simple method to derive a sine wave from a fixed-frequency square wave using a tuned series LC circuit. This circuit behaves as a very low impedance at resonance (f0 = 1 / (2π√LC)), increasing on either side of the resonance frequency.\n\nFigure 6.6 depicts a series LC bandpass filter that transforms a square wave into a sine wave suitable for driving a 50Ω load. We selected the product LC to resonate at 1.0 MHz and set the value of L to ensure its impedance at 3 MHz is significantly higher than the 50Ω load impedance. At L1 = 100μH, the reactance at 3 MHz is XL ≈ 2 kΩ.\n\nFigure 6.7 showcases the measured performance of the filter, with the slight distortion of the square wave due to loading by the filter and the 50Ω load. We included an RC prefilter to slow the rise time, addressing the fast edges of the square wave that coupled through the inductor's parasitic shunt capacitance, causing notches in the sinewave output.\n\n#### B. Elimination of \"Spurs\"\n\nPhase-locked loop (PLL) frequency synthesis, detailed later in Chapter 13, allows for generating a desired precise frequency from a standard reference frequency, such as 10.0 MHz. Figure 6.8 displays part of a 78.0 MHz PLL synthesizer we constructed, using a voltage-tunable oscillator (VCO) and a loop filter. The reference frequency is divided by 50 to 200 kHz and compared with the VCO output divided by 390, ensuring correct oscillation at 78.0 MHz.\n\nTo address the residual energy at 78.0 MHz ± 0.2 MHz caused by the 200 kHz internal comparison frequency, we implemented a series LC trap tuned to 200 kHz across the analog tuning voltage. The remaining components (R1, R2, C1) form the classic PLL loop filter.\n\n#### C. Anti-alias Lowpass Filter\n\nDigitizing an analog waveform involves sampling its amplitude periodically and converting each sample to a numeric value. This process can introduce artifacts due to finite quantization accuracy and sampling rate, which can be mitigated by proper choice of these parameters. The signal being digitized must not contain frequencies exceeding half the sampling rate (fS), known as the Nyquist criterion.\n\nTo prevent aliasing, we used a mixer to convert a 2 MHz band of signal frequencies centered on 78 MHz to a band centered on dc (baseband). We then amplified the baseband and passed it through a 7-section LC Chebyshev lowpass filter with a 1.0 MHz cutoff frequency and 0.1 dB peak-to-peak ripple. This filter removes signal components above 1 MHz, allowing for subsequent amplification and digitization at a sampling rate of 2.5 Msps.\n\n#### D. Passive Differential Filter\n\nMany high-frequency ADCs have differential inputs and require a low input-signal source impedance, often terminated by a differential capacitor. We previously discussed low-impedance high-frequency differential-output amplifiers and examples like the AD9225 25 MSps ADC, which specifies a differential lowpass filter consisting of two 50Ω resistors and a 100 pF capacitor.\n\nFrequently, an anti-alias filter is needed between the amplifier and the ADC input. For instance, with a sampling frequency of 25 MHz, a steep rolloff input filter starting at 10 MHz may be desired. Texas Instruments provides a helpful application note on converting single-ended filters to differential form (SLWA053B: Design of differential filters for high-speed signal chains, available at www.ti.com)."

Converting a Digital Square Wave to a Sinewave\n\nIn digital electronics, generating and manipulating precise frequency square waves is straightforward. At our observatory, we required sine waves instead. Figure 6.6 illustrates a simple method to derive a sinewave from a fixed-frequency square wave using a tuned series LC circuit. This circuit presents a very low impedance at resonance ${ }^{5}$ (where $f_{0}=1 / 2 \\pi \\sqrt{L C}$), increasing at lower and higher frequencies.\n\nThe circuit converts a 1.0 MHz square wave into a sine wave by utilizing a series LC bandpass filter tuned to resonate at 1.0 MHz. This allows the fundamental frequency to pass while suppressing harmonics, resulting in an output suitable for a 50Ω load.\n\nFigure 6.6 depicts a series LC bandpass filter that transforms a square wave into a sinewave appropriate for driving a 50Ω load. We selected the product $L C$ for a 1.0 MHz resonance and set $L$ such that its impedance at 3 MHz is significantly higher than the 50Ω load impedance.\n\nFigure 6.7 presents the measured performance of the filter, showing a slight distortion in the square wave due to loading effects and the 50Ω load. We incorporated a simple RC prefilter to slow the rise time, as the fast edges of the square wave, coupled with the parasitic shunt capacitance of the inductor, caused minor notches in the sinewave output.\n\n#### B. Removing \"Spurs\"\n\nPhase-locked loop (PLL) frequency synthesis, a technique discussed in Chapter 13, allows generating a desired precise frequency from a standard reference frequency, such as 10.0 MHz. Figure 6.8 shows a section of a 78.0 MHz PLL synthesizer we constructed, depicted in block diagram form. The concept involves using a voltage-tunable oscillator (VCO) and comparing an integer subdivision of its desired output frequency with a different subdivision of the reference frequency. The frequencies align when the output frequency is correct, and any frequency error generates a correction signal to guide the VCO to the correct oscillation frequency. We divided the 10 MHz reference by 50 to obtain 200 kHz, which we compared with the VCO output divided by 390, ensuring frequency agreement at 78.0 MHz.\n\nWe designed a simple yet effective JFET oscillator, with its output energy predominantly at its central frequency. The primary unwanted component in its output was residual energy at $78.0 \\mathrm{MHz} \\pm 0.2 \\mathrm{MHz}$, caused by the 200 kHz internal comparison frequency. To address this, we incorporated a series LC trap tuned to 200 kHz across the analog tuning voltage. The components $R_{1} R_{2} C_{1}$ form the classic PLL loop filter, as detailed in §13.13.\n\n#### C. Anti-alias Lowpass Filter\n\nAnalog waveforms can be digitized by periodically sampling their amplitude and converting each sample into a numeric value. As discussed in Chapter 13, this process can introduce artifacts due to finite quantization accuracy and sampling rate. These artifacts can be suppressed by appropriate selection of quantization depth and sampling rate. Importantly, the signal being digitized must not contain frequencies exceeding half the sampling rate $f_{\\mathrm{S}}$, known as the Nyquist criterion. ${ }^{6}$ This is typically achieved by passing the predigitized signals through a lowpass \"anti-aliasing\" filter with a cutoff that ensures significant attenuation of signals above the Nyquist frequency $f_{\\mathrm{S}} / 2$. A sharp filter cutoff is preferred to avoid increasing the sampling rate to escape signals passing through a soft cutoff, and to maintain a flat response within the desired signal passband.\n\nIn our radiotelescope receiver example (Figure 6.9), we employed a mixer to convert a 2 MHz band of signal frequencies centered on 78 MHz (the \"IF\" band) to a band centered on dc (known as \"baseband\"). A mixer achieves this frequency shifting by multiplying two signals to produce its output, with the product of two sinusoids resulting in waves at the sum and difference frequencies. The signal band drives one input of the mixer, while a fixed oscillator at 78 MHz (the \"local oscillator,\" or LO) drives the other input. The difference frequency at the mixer output is the baseband, ${ }^{7}$ containing the signals we wish to digitize in this example within the band from dc to 1 MHz. ${ }^{8}$\n\nWe amplified the baseband and then passed it through a high-performance anti-aliasing filter, specifically a \"7-section LC Chebyshev lowpass filter with 1.0 MHz cutoff frequency and 0.1 dB peak-to-peak ripple.\" ${ }^{9}$ We designed the filter with a non-standard input and output impedance (378Ω) to leverage standard value tunable inductors. The filter removes signal components above 1 MHz, and the filtered baseband is then amplified again and digitized (by the device labeled ADC - analog-to-digital-converter) at a sampling rate of 2.5 Msps (megasamples/s). The corresponding Nyquist frequency of 1.25 MHz falls well within the stopband of the sharp lowpass filter, with the calculated and measured performance closely matching, demonstrating that input signals are attenuated by 20 dB at that frequency and that the worst-case aliased signals (at 1.5 MHz) are further reduced by 16 dB. This represents exceptional performance for a filter that is easily designed and constructed, particularly when compared to an RC filter with a similar component count, where the attenuation at $1.25 f_{\\mathrm{c}}$ is only 1.6 dB relative to that at $f_{\\mathrm{c}}$; Figures 6.10 and 6.11 illustrate this comparison graphically.\n\n#### D. Passive Differential Filter\n\nMost high-frequency ADCs have differential inputs, as discussed in §13.6.2, and many require a low input-signal source impedance, often terminated by a differential capacitor. We explored low-impedance high-frequency differential-output amplifiers in §5.17, where, for instance, Figure 5.102 presents a differential lowpass filter comprising two $50 \\Omega$ resistors and a 100 pF capacitor, as specified for the AD9225 25 MSps ADC (see also Figure 13.28).\n\nFrequently, an anti-alias filter is needed between the amplifier and the ADC input. For example, with a 25 MHz sampling frequency, a steep rolloff input filter starting at 10 MHz may be desired.

However, creating satisfactory filters for most practical issues does not necessitate expertise akin to a filter magician. In this section, we present three straightforward filters that have been utilized in recent designs at our radio telescope observatory.\n\n#### A. Sine Wave Generation from a Digital Square Wave\n\nDigital electronics facilitate the generation and manipulation of precise frequency pulses or square waves. At our observatory, we required sine waves instead of square waves. Figure 6.6 demonstrates a simple method to derive a sine wave from a fixed-frequency square wave using a tuned series LC circuit. This circuit acts as a very low impedance at resonance, increasing on either side of the resonance frequency.\n\n#### B. \"Spur\" Elimination\n\nAn elegant technique known as phase-locked loop (PLL) frequency synthesis, which will be discussed in detail in Chapter 13, allows for the generation of a desired precise frequency starting from a standard \"reference\" frequency, such as 10.0 MHz. Figure 6.8 illustrates a section of a 78.0 MHz PLL synthesizer we constructed. The fundamental concept involves using a voltage-tunable oscillator (VCO) and comparing an integer subdivision of its desired output frequency with a different subdivision of the reference frequency. This ensures frequency agreement when the output frequency is correct, with any frequency error generating a correction signal to guide the VCO towards the accurate oscillation frequency.\n\n#### C. Anti-Alias Lowpass Filter\n\nAnalog waveforms can be digitized by periodically sampling their amplitude and converting each sample into a numeric value. As we will explore later in Chapter 13, this process can introduce artifacts due to the finite accuracy of amplitude quantization and the finite sample rate. These artifacts can be mitigated by choosing appropriate quantization depth and sample rate. It is crucial that the signal being digitized does not contain frequencies exceeding half the sampling rate, known as the Nyquist criterion. This is typically achieved by passing the pre-digitized signals through a lowpass \"anti-aliasing\" filter, which ensures thorough attenuation of frequencies above the Nyquist frequency.\n\nIn this radio telescope receiver example (Figure 6.9), we employ a mixer to convert a 2 MHz band of signal frequencies centered on 78 MHz (the \"IF\" band) to a band centered on dc (known as \"baseband\"). The mixer achieves this frequency shifting by multiplying two sinusoids, resulting in a pair of waves at the sum and difference frequencies. Here, the signal band drives one input of the mixer, while a fixed oscillator at 78 MHz (the \"local oscillator,\" or LO) drives the other input. The difference frequency at the mixer's output is the baseband, containing the signals we aim to digitize in this example.\n\n#### D. Passive Differential Filter\n\nMost high-frequency ADCs feature differential inputs and often demand a low input-signal source impedance, terminated by a differential capacitor in many instances. We discussed low-impedance high-frequency differential-output amplifiers in a previous section, where a differential lowpass filter comprising two 50 Ω resistors and a 100 pF capacitor was specified for the AD9225 25 MSps ADC."

Here, we present three straightforward filters that we have recently employed in designs at our radio telescope observatory.\n\n#### A. Sinewave Generation from Digital Square Waves\n\nIn digital electronics, generating and manipulating precise frequency square waves is straightforward. At our observatory, however, we required sine waves rather than square waves. Figure 6.6 illustrates a simple method to derive a sine wave from a fixed-frequency square wave using a tuned series LC circuit. This circuit acts as a very low impedance at resonance (f₀ = 1 / (2π√LC)), increasing on either side of the resonance frequency (asymptotically as 1/f at low frequencies and as f at high frequencies).\n\n#### B. \"Spur\" Elimination\n\nA sophisticated technique known as phase-locked loop (PLL) frequency synthesis, which will be discussed in detail in Chapter 13, allows for the generation of a desired precise frequency starting from a standard \"reference\" frequency, such as 10.0 MHz. Figure 6.8 shows a section of a 78.0 MHz PLL synthesizer we constructed, presented in block diagram form. The concept involves using a voltage-tunable oscillator (VCO) and comparing an integer division of its desired output frequency with a different division of the reference frequency. These divided frequencies will match when the VCO is oscillating at the correct frequency. Any frequency error generates a correction signal to guide the VCO towards the accurate oscillation frequency. In this case, we divided the 10 MHz reference by 50 (yielding 200 kHz) and compared it with the VCO's output divided by 390; these divided frequencies will match when the VCO is oscillating at 78.0 MHz.\n\n#### C. Anti-aliasing Lowpass Filter\n\nAnalog waveforms can be digitized by periodically sampling their amplitude and converting each sample into a numeric value. As we will discuss later in Chapter 13, this process can introduce artifacts due to the finite precision of amplitude quantization and the finite rate of sampling. These artifacts can be suppressed to any required degree by carefully choosing the quantization depth (amplitude accuracy) and rate (sampling frequency).\n\nFor this filter example, the crucial point is that the signal being digitized must not contain frequencies exceeding half the sampling rate (f_S); this is known as the Nyquist criterion. The standard approach to achieve this is to pass the predigitized signals through a lowpass \"anti-aliasing\" filter with a cutoff frequency that ensures thorough attenuation of signals above the Nyquist frequency (f_S / 2). This typically requires a sharp filter cutoff to avoid the need for a much higher sampling rate and to maintain a flat response within the desired signal passband.\n\nIn this radio telescope receiver example (Figure 6.9), we use a mixer to convert a 2 MHz band of signal frequencies centered on 78 MHz (the \"intermediate frequency\" or IF band) to a band centered on direct current (DC), known as \"baseband\". A mixer can perform this frequency shifting because the product of two sinusoids is a pair of waves at the sum and difference frequencies: cos(ω₁t)cos(ω₂t) = 1/2{cos(ω₁-ω₂)t + cos(ω₁+ω₂)t}. Here, the signal band drives one input of the mixer, and a fixed oscillator at 78 MHz (the \"local oscillator\" or LO) drives the other input. The difference frequency at the mixer's output is the baseband, which contains the signals we want to digitize in this example within the band from DC to 1 MHz.\n\nWe amplified the baseband and then passed it through a sophisticated anti-aliasing filter, specifically a \"7-section LC Chebyshev lowpass filter with 1.0 MHz cutoff frequency and 0.1 dB peak-to-peak ripple.\" We designed the filter with a non-standard input and output impedance (378 Ω) to leverage standard value tunable inductors.

This is exceptional performance for a filter that is straightforward to design and construct, especially when compared to an RC filter with a similar number of components, where the attenuation at 1.25 f_c is just 1.6 dB relative to that at f_c; Figures 6.10 and 6.11 provide a graphical comparison.\n\n#### D.

Figure 6.6 illustrates a method to derive a sinewave from a fixed-frequency square wave using a tuned series LC circuit. This circuit acts as a low-impedance at resonance (f0=1/(2π√LC)), increasing impedance at frequencies away from resonance. We chose LC values to resonate at 1.0 MHz and set L such that its impedance at 3 MHz is significantly higher than the 50Ω load impedance.\n\nFigure 6.7 displays the measured performance of the series LC bandpass filter, showing the transformation from a square wave input to a sine wave output suitable for a 50Ω load. A simple RC prefilter was included to mitigate the sharp edges of the square wave, which, through the parasitic capacitance of the inductor, caused notches in the sinewave output.\n\n#### B. Eliminating Unwanted \"Spurs\"\n\nPhase-locked loop (PLL) frequency synthesis, a technique detailed in Chapter 13, allows for the generation of a precise frequency from a standard reference frequency, such as 10.0 MHz. Figure 6.8 depicts a section of a 78.0 MHz PLL synthesizer we constructed.

We used a series LC trap tuned to 200 kHz to suppress spurs at the reference frequency within the PLL oscillator.\n\n#### C. Anti-aliasing Lowpass Filter\n\nThe process of digitizing an analog waveform involves sampling its amplitude at regular intervals and converting each sample into a numerical value. To avoid introducing artifacts, the signal must adhere to the Nyquist criterion, which states that it should not contain frequencies higher than half the sampling rate (fS). This is typically achieved using an anti-aliasing lowpass filter with a sharp cutoff to ensure signals above the Nyquist frequency are attenuated. In our radio telescope receiver example (Figure 6.9), a mixer converts a 2 MHz band of signal frequencies centered on 78 MHz to a baseband.

Conversion of Digital Square Wave to Sinewave\n\nGenerating precise frequency pulses or square waves is a simple task with digital electronics. However, for our observatory needs, we required sine waves instead of square waves. Figure 6.6 illustrates a straightforward method to derive a sine wave from a fixed-frequency square wave, utilizing a tuned series LC circuit. This circuit exhibits very low impedance at resonance, increasing asymptotically as 1/f at low frequencies and as f at high frequencies.\n\nThe depicted circuit in Figure 6.6 is a series LC bandpass filter that transforms a 1.0 MHz square wave into a sine wave, suitable for driving a 50Ω load. We selected the LC product for a 1.0 MHz resonance and chose an inductance value that ensures its impedance at 3 MHz is significantly higher than the 50Ω load impedance.\n\nFigure 6.7 showcases the measured performance of the filter. The slight distortion observed in the square wave is attributed to the loading effects of the filter and the 50Ω load. To mitigate the rapid edges of the square wave, we incorporated a simple RC prefilter to prolong the rise time, as these edges coupled through the parasitic shunt capacitance of the inductor, causing minor notches in the sine wave output.\n\n#### B. Elimination of \"Spur\" Frequencies\n\nPhase-locked loop (PLL) frequency synthesis, a technique detailed in Chapter 13, allows the generation of a precise frequency of choice, starting from a standard reference frequency, such as 10.0 MHz. Figure 6.8 displays a section of a 78.0 MHz PLL synthesizer we constructed, presented as a block diagram. The core concept involves a voltage-tunable oscillator (VCO) and the comparison of an integer subdivision of its desired output frequency with a distinct subdivision of the reference frequency, ensuring frequency agreement when the output frequency is accurate. Any frequency discrepancy prompts a correction signal to guide the VCO towards the correct oscillation frequency.\n\nIn our design, we divided the 10 MHz reference frequency by 50 (yielding 200 kHz) and compared it with the VCO's output after division by 390. These divided frequencies align when the VCO oscillates at 78.0 MHz.

The primary unwanted component in its output was a residual energy at ±0.2 MHz from the 78.0 MHz, originating from the 200 kHz internal comparison frequency. To address this issue, we introduced a series LC trap, tuned to 200 kHz, across the analog tuning voltage, as depicted.\n\n#### C.

The filter was designed with a non-standard input and output impedance (378Ω) to leverage standard value tunable inductors. The filter effectively removes signal components above 1 MHz, and the filtered baseband is subsequently amplified and digitized (by the device labeled ADC - analog-to-digital-converter) at a sampling rate of 2.5 Msps (megasamples/s). The corresponding Nyquist frequency of 1.25 MHz falls within the stopband of the sharp lowpass filter, as evidenced by the close agreement between calculated and measured performance, confirming the effective suppression of input signals at that frequency.\n\n#### D.

We discussed low-impedance, high-frequency differential-output amplifiers in §5.17, where Figure 5.102 shows a differential lowpass filter comprising two 50Ω resistors and a 100 pF capacitor, as specified for the AD9225 25 MSps ADC.\n\nAn anti-alias filter is commonly needed between the amplifier and the ADC input. For instance, with a 25 MHz sampling frequency, a steep rolloff input filter starting at 10 MHz might be required. Texas Instruments provides a useful application note on converting a single-ended filter to a differential form (SLWA053B: Design of differential filters for high-speed signal chains, available at www.ti.com)."

    "text": "The development of filters utilizing passive elements (R, L, and C) is a well-established field, with a wealth of information available in traditional texts (such as Zverev's seminal work, referenced in Appendix N), complemented by sophisticated software tools that now render filter design a commonplace task. However, inductors, as integral circuit components, often fall short of expectations. They tend to be physically large and costly, and they deviate from the ideal due to \"lossiness,\" meaning they possess significant series resistance, along with other issues like nonlinearity, distributed winding capacitance, and sensitivity to magnetic interference. Moreover, the inductance values required for low-frequency filters may necessitate excessively large components. Ultimately, traditional filters composed of L and C components are not tunable electrically.\n\nThe challenge lies in creating inductorless filters that possess the attributes of ideal RLC filters. Ideally, we could anticipate tunability, either through an analog tuning voltage or by varying the pulse frequency.\n\nBy incorporating op-amps into filter design, we can replicate any RLC filter characteristics without employing inductors. These inductorless filters are termed active filters due to the presence of an active element, the amplifier. We will explore another category of active filter—the switched capacitor filter—which incorporates MOSFET switches to effectively create a resistor with tunable frequency characteristics. These filters exhibit performance akin to that of conventional active filters (referred to as \"continuous-time\" filters), but with the added benefit of precise tuning of their characteristic frequency transition points (using an externally applied clocking frequency) across a broad range. (This tunability comes with trade-offs, such as increased switching noise and a diminished dynamic range; see §6.3.6.)\n\nActive filters are employed to construct lowpass, highpass, bandpass, and band-reject filters, with the option to select filter types based on the desired characteristics of the response, for example, the flatness of the passband, the sharpness of the skirts, or the consistency of time delay with frequency (further details will follow shortly). Additionally, \"allpass filters\" with a flat amplitude response but a tailored phase-to-frequency characteristic can be produced (also known as \"delay equalizers\"), as well as filters with a constant phase shift but a customized amplitude response.\n\n#### A. Negative-impedance converter, gyrator, and generalized impedance converter\n\nWhen discussing circuit elements, three noteworthy devices are the negative-impedance converter (NIC), the gyrator, and the generalized impedance converter (GIC). These devices can simulate the properties of inductors while using only resistors, capacitors, and op-amps.\n\nWith these tools, it is possible to construct inductorless filters that possess the ideal properties of any RLC filter, thus providing at least one method for creating active filters.\n\n[^71]\n#### B. Negative-impedance converter\n\nThe NIC transforms an impedance to its negative equivalent, whereas the gyrator converts an impedance to its inverse. The following exercises will assist you in understanding how these conversions occur.\n\nExercise 6.1. Demonstrate that the circuit in Figure 6.12 functions as a negative-impedance converter, specifically showing that \\( Z_{\\text{in}} = -Z \\). Hint: apply an input voltage \\( V \\) and calculate the input current \\( I \\). Then determine the ratio to find \\( Z_{\\text{in}} = V/I \\).\n[Image Description: Figure 6.12 depicts a negative-impedance converter circuit consisting of an operational amplifier (A1) and two resistors (R1 and R2), with an additional component Z representing the impedance to be converted.]\n\nThe NIC thereby converts a capacitor into a \"backward\" inductor:\n\\[\nZ_{\\mathrm{C}} = \\frac{1}{j \\omega C} \\rightarrow Z_{\\text{in}} = \\frac{j}{\\omega C}, \\tag{6.1}\n\\]\ni.e., it exhibits inductive behavior in terms of generating a current that lags the applied voltage, but its impedance has the opposite frequency dependence (it decreases rather than increases with increasing frequency).\n\n#### C. Gyrator\n\nConversely, the gyrator converts a capacitor into a genuine inductor:\n\\[\nZ_{\\mathrm{C}} = \\frac{1}{j \\omega C} \\rightarrow Z_{\\text{in}} = j \\omega C R^{2}, \\tag{6.2}\n\\]\ni.e., an inductor with an inductance \\( L = C R^{2} \\).\n[Image Description: Figure 6.13 illustrates a gyrator circuit constructed using Negative Impedance Converters (NICs) to emulate inductance. The input impedance is expressed as \\( Z_{\\text{in}} = R^{2}/Z \\), representing the impedance transformation achieved through the gyrator configuration.]\n\nThe existence of the gyrator logically suggests that inductorless filters can be constructed to mimic any filter using inductors by simply replacing each inductor with a gyrated capacitor. [^11] This use of gyrators in pre-existing RLC designs is entirely acceptable; indeed, the telephone filter previously discussed, although originally designed as a classic LC filter, was implemented using gyrators (in a configuration known as a Riordan gyrator, which differs from Figure 6.13). Beyond simple gyrator substitution, it is feasible to synthesize a multitude of additional filter configurations.\n\nExercise 6.2. Prove that the circuit in Figure 6.13 operates as a gyrator, specifically demonstrating that \\( Z_{\\text{in}} = R^{2}/Z \\). Hint: you can analyze it as a series of voltage dividers, starting from the right.\n\n#### D. Generalized impedance converter\n\nThe circuit shown in Figure 6.14 is known as a generalized impedance converter (GIC); it multiplies the impedance connected at \\( Z_{5} \\) by the factor \\( Z_{1}Z_{3}/Z_{2}Z_{4} \\). For instance, if a capacitor is placed at \\( Z_{4} \\) and resistors are used for the remaining components, the result is an inductor with a value of \\( L = (R_{1}R_{3}R_{5}/R_{2})C \\); in effect, it becomes a gyrator. However, more intriguing applications are possible with a GIC, such as creating a frequency-dependent negative resistor (FDNR) by positioning capacitors at \\( Z_{3} \\) and \\( Z_{5} \\). Filters designed with GIC-implemented FDNRs have gained popularity in the audio design realm, where they are reputed to exhibit superior noise and distortion characteristics compared to, for example, a Sallen-and-Key filter (discussed in the next section). The domain of inductorless filter design is both vibrant and abundant in complexity, with new designs emerging monthly in technical journals.\n\n#### Performance limits\n\nAs with any op-amp circuit, the performance of gyrators and GICs at high frequencies hinges on the op-amp's bandwidth (and other specifications). Thus, a GIC configured as an inductor (with a capacitor at \\( Z_{4} \\) and resistors elsewhere) will cease to emulate an inductor at frequencies exceeding a few percent of the op-amp's bandwidth \\( f_{\\mathrm{T}} \\). The simulation results in Figure 6.15 illustrate the expected behavior. At low frequencies, the circuit behaves nearly perfectly as an inductor, transitioning to a capacitor-like behavior at high frequencies, with a resonance occurring in between. [^13] Although this extended graph may appear displeasing, it is notable that the \"inductor\" exhibits an impressively high quality factor \\( Q \\) of approximately \\( 2 \\times 10^{5} \\) at 1 kHz, assuming the \\( 4.6 \\mathrm{~m} \\Omega \\) impedance floor on the graph accurately represents the inductor's loss (i.e., equivalent series resistance, ESR). (In reality, there are other losses, so achievable \\( Q \\) values are in the range of \\( 1000 \\ldots \\), still exceptionally good for an inductor of less than a henry.) For an op-amp with the highest bandwidth (\\( f_{\\mathrm{T}} = 50 \\mathrm{MHz} \\)), the capacitance is just 2.3 pF; it would be impossible to construct a 160 mH inductor with such a minuscule \"winding capacitance\" or such a high self-resonant frequency.\n\nGyrators find practical application in real-world filters: an Application Note by Texas Instruments proposes using multiple GIC stages to create anti-alias filters. [^14] Additionally, Stanford Research Systems employs four GIC stages, acting as an \\( R+LC \\) ladder, to construct an 8-zero 9-pole elliptical lowpass filter for their SR830 DSP-based lock-in amplifier, ensuring that all frequency components above half the sampling frequency are attenuated by at least 96 dB. The A/D samples at 256 kHz, and the filter allows signals from dc to 102 kHz, providing a 25% frequency margin to achieve the 96 dB attenuation. [^15] The complete schematic of the filter is included in the instrument's highly informative manual—a hallmark of all SRS products.\n\n#### E. Sallen-and-Key filter\n\nFigure 6.16 presents an example of a straightforward and somewhat intuitive filter topology, which we encountered earlier in §4.3.6. These are referred to as Sallen-and-Key filters, named after their inventors. [^16] The unity-gain amplifier can be an op-amp configured as a follower, or simply an emitter follower or source follower. The depicted filters are 2-pole lowpass and highpass filters. Considering the lowpass filter example (Figure 6.16A), note that it would consist of two cascaded \\( RC \\) lowpass filter sections, except for the fact that the first capacitor's lower terminal is bootstrapped by the output. It is clear that at very high frequencies, it behaves just like a cascaded \\( RC \\) filter, since the output is essentially zero. As the output increases at lower frequencies, however, the bootstrap effect tends to diminish the attenuation, resulting in a sharper transition. Of course, such informal observations cannot replace rigorous analysis, which fortunately has already been conducted for a vast array of exceptional filters. We will revisit active filter circuits in §6.3, following a brief introduction to filter performance parameters and filter types.\n\n[Image Description: Figure 6.16 showcases Sallen-and-Key lowpass and highpass active filters. The ultimate performance of these seemingly simple filters is influenced by the non-zero output impedance of the follower, as discussed in Figure 6.36.]"

And for the highest-bandwidth op-amp (with $f_{\\mathrm{T}}=50 \\mathrm{MHz}$), the capacitance is just 2.3 pF; you could never fabricate a 160 mH inductor with such a minuscule \"winding capacitance,\" nor with such a high self-resonant frequency.\n\nGyrators find practical use in real-world filters: an App Note from Texas Instruments proposes using multiple GIC stages to create anti-alias filters. ${ }^{14}$ Stanford Research Systems employs four GIC stages, configured as an $R+L C$ ladder, to construct an 8-zero 9-pole elliptical lowpass filter for their SR830 DSP-based lock-in amplifier, ensuring that all frequency components beyond half the sampling frequency are attenuated by at least 96 dB.

The filters depicted are 2-pole lowpass and highpass filters. Taking the lowpass filter (Figure 6.16A) as an example, note that it would essentially consist of two cascaded $R C$ lowpass filter sections, except for the fact that the first capacitor's bottom is bootstrapped by the output. It is evident that at very high frequencies, it behaves just like a cascaded $R C$ because the output is essentially zero. However, as the output rises at decreasing frequencies, the bootstrap action tends to reduce the attenuation, resulting in a sharper knee. Of course, such informal observations cannot replace rigorous analysis, which has fortunately been performed for a wide variety of excellent filters. We will revisit active filter circuits in $\\S 6.3$, after a brief introduction to filter performance parameters and filter types.\n\nFigure 6.16. Sallen-and-Key lowpass and highpass active filters. The ultimate performance of these seemingly simple filters is affected by the non-zero output impedance of the follower, as seen in Figure 6.36."

    "text": "The design of filters from basic components such as resistors ($R$), inductors ($L$), and capacitors ($C$) represents a well-established field, extensively documented in traditional reference books (like Zverev's seminal publication, as referenced in Appendix N) and now also supported by sophisticated software tools that streamline the design process. Despite this, inductors, as components, often fail to meet expectations, being typically large, costly, and far from ideal, exhibiting \"lossy\" behavior due to significant series resistance, along with other issues such as nonlinearity, distributed winding capacitance, and vulnerability to magnetic interference. Moreover, the inductance values required for low-frequency filters can necessitate excessively large components. Additionally, traditional filters constructed with $L$ and $C$ are not tunable electrically.\n\nThe challenge lies in creating inductorless filters that possess the ideal characteristics of RLC filters, with the added advantage of tunability through an analog tuning voltage or variable pulse frequency. Incorporating operational amplifiers into filter design enables the synthesis of any RLC filter characteristics without the need for inductors. These inductorless filters are referred to as active filters due to the inclusion of an active element—the amplifier. There is also the category of switched capacitor filters that utilize MOSFET switches to effectively create a resistor whose frequency response can be tuned. These filters offer performance comparable to standard active filters (also known as \"continuous-time\" filters), but with the added benefit of precise tuning of their characteristic frequency breakpoints (by an externally applied clocking frequency) over a broad range. However, this tunability is accompanied by some switching noise and a reduction in dynamic range (refer to §6.3.6).\n\nActive filters are capable of producing various types of filters such as lowpass, highpass, bandpass, and band-reject, with the option to choose filter types based on essential features of the response, like the passband flatness, the sharpness of skirts, or the consistency of time delay with frequency. Additionally, \"allpass filters\" can be designed, which maintain a flat amplitude response but have a tailored phase response versus frequency (also known as \"delay equalizers\"), and vice versa—a filter with a constant phase shift but a tailored amplitude response.\n\n### Circuit Elements: Negative-impedance converter, gyrator, and generalized impedance converter\n\nWithin the realm of circuit design, three notable elements are the negative-impedance converter (NIC), the gyrator, and the generalized impedance converter (GIC). These devices can emulate the properties of inductors using only resistors, capacitors, and operational amplifiers.\n\nBy employing these elements, it is possible to construct inductorless filters that match the ideal properties of any RLC filter, thus providing at least one method for creating active filters.\n\n#### Negative-impedance converter\n\nThe NIC alters an impedance to its negative, while the gyrator transforms an impedance to its inverse. The following exercises are intended to help you understand how these conversions occur.\n\nExercise 6.1 involves demonstrating that the circuit depicted in Figure 6.12 acts as a negative-impedance converter, particularly showing that the input impedance $Z_{\\text {in }}$ equals $-Z$. A hint is provided to apply a certain input voltage $V$ and calculate the input current $I$, then determine the ratio to find $Z_{\\text {in }}=V / I$.\n\n#### Gyrator\n\nA gyrator, conversely, converts a capacitor into a genuine inductor, represented by the equation:\n\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{C}}=1 / j \\omega C \\rightarrow Z_{\\text {in }}=j \\omega C R^{2}\n$$\n\nindicating an inductor with an inductance $L=C R^{2}$.\n\n#### Generalized impedance converter\n\nThe generalized impedance converter (GIC) can multiply the impedance connected at $Z_{5}$ by the factor $Z_{1} Z_{3} / Z_{2} Z_{4}$. For instance, if a capacitor is placed at $Z_{4}$ with resistors at all other locations, an inductor with a value of $L=\\left(R_{1} R_{3} R_{5} / R_{2}\\right) C$ is produced, effectively creating a gyrator. Beyond this, GICs can be used to create frequency-dependent negative resistors (FDNRs) and have found popularity in audio design for their superior noise and distortion characteristics compared to other filter types like the Sallen-and-Key filter.\n\n#### Performance limits\n\nAs with any operational amplifier circuit, the performance of gyrators and GICs at high frequencies is dependent on the bandwidth of the operational amplifier (and other specifications). Consequently, a GIC configured as an inductor will cease to emulate an inductor at frequencies exceeding a few percent of the operational amplifier's bandwidth $f_{\\mathrm{T}}$. Simulated results, as shown in Figure 6.15, illustrate the expected behavior, transitioning from near-perfect inductance at low frequencies to a capacitive-like behavior at high frequencies, with a resonance in between.\n\nGyrators find practical application in real-world filters. For example, Texas Instruments suggests using multiple GIC stages to create anti-alias filters, and Stanford Research Systems employs four GIC stages to construct an 8-zero 9-pole elliptical lowpass filter for their SR830 DSP-based lock-in amplifier, ensuring significant attenuation of frequency components beyond half the sampling frequency.\n\n#### Sallen-and-Key filter\n\nFigure 6.16 provides an illustration of a straightforward and intuitive filter topology known as the Sallen-and-Key filter. These filters can utilize a unity-gain amplifier, which may be an operational amplifier connected as a follower or a simple emitter/source follower. The depicted filters are examples of 2-pole lowpass and highpass configurations. For the lowpass filter, the design essentially involves two cascaded $R C$ lowpass sections, with the exception of the first capacitor's bottom being \"bootstrapped\" by the output. This bootstrap action contributes to a sharper knee in the frequency response.\n\nIn the subsequent sections, the discussion will return to active filter circuits after introducing filter performance parameters and filter types."

Nevertheless, inductors as circuit components often fall short due to their bulkiness, cost, and deviation from perfection through \"lossiness,\" characterized by notable series resistance, alongside issues such as nonlinearity, distributed winding capacitance, and vulnerability to magnetic interference.

Additionally, \"allpass filters\" with a flat amplitude response but a tailored phase-to-frequency characteristic can be produced (also known as \"delay equalizers\"), as well as filters with constant phase shift but a customized amplitude response.\n\n#### A. Negative-impedance converter, gyrator, and generalized impedance converter\n\nThree notable circuit elements warrant discussion in this context: the negative-impedance converter (NIC), the gyrator, and the generalized impedance converter (GIC). These devices emulate the properties of inductors using only resistors, capacitors, and operational amplifiers, thus facilitating the creation of inductorless filters with the desired properties of any RLC filter, providing one method to construct active filters.\n\n#### B. Negative-impedance converter\n\nThe NIC transforms an impedance to its negative, while the gyrator converts an impedance to its inverse. Exercises will help elucidate how these conversions occur.\n\nExercise 6.1: Demonstrate that the circuit in Figure 6.12 acts as a negative-impedance converter, specifically that $Z_{\\text{in}} = -Z$. Hint: Apply a sample input voltage $V$ and calculate the input current $I$. Then, find the ratio to calculate $Z_{\\text{in}} = V/I$.\n\nThe circuit depicted in Figure 6.12 represents a negative-impedance converter (NIC), which converts an impedance to its negative. The input impedance, $Z_{\\text{in}}$, equals $-Z$. The NIC utilizes an operational amplifier (A1) and two resistors (R) to accomplish this conversion.\n\nThe NIC effectively converts a capacitor into a \"backward\" inductor:\n\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{C}} = \\frac{1}{j\\omega C} \\rightarrow Z_{\\text{in}} = j\\omega C,\n$$\n\ni.e., it exhibits inductive behavior by generating a current that lags the applied voltage, but the impedance has an inverse frequency dependence (it decreases instead of increasing with frequency).\n\n#### C. Gyrator\n\nConversely, the gyrator converts a capacitor into a genuine inductor:\n\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{C}} = \\frac{1}{j\\omega C} \\rightarrow Z_{\\text{in}} = j\\omega CR^2,\n$$\n\ni.e., an inductor with inductance $L = CR^2$.\n\nThe circuit in Figure 6.13 represents a gyrator configuration using Negative Impedance Converters (NICs) to simulate inductance. The input impedance is given by $Z_{\\text{in}} = R^2/Z$, indicating the transformation of the impedance $Z$ through the gyrator configuration.\n\nThe existence of the gyrator logically suggests that inductorless filters can be constructed to replicate any inductor-based filter by simply substituting each inductor with a capacitor in a gyrator configuration. This approach has been applied to realize telephone filters, originally designed as classic LC filters, now implemented with gyrators (in a configuration known as a Riordan gyrator, distinct from Figure 6.13). Beyond substituting gyrators into existing RLC designs, it is feasible to synthesize various other filter configurations.\n\nExercise 6.2: Demonstrate that the circuit in Figure 6.13 functions as a gyrator, particularly that $Z_{\\text{in}} = R^2/Z$. Hint: Analyze it as a series of voltage dividers, starting from the right.\n\n#### D. Generalized impedance converter\n\nThe configuration in Figure 6.14 is recognized as a generalized impedance converter (GIC); it multiplies the impedance connected at $Z_5$ by the factor $Z_1Z_3/Z_2Z_4$. Thus, if a capacitor is placed at $Z_4$ and resistors at all other positions, an inductor is formed with a value of $L = (R_1R_3R_5/R_2)C$; it acts as a gyrator. Moreover, more intricate applications of a GIC are possible; for instance, positioning capacitors at $Z_3$ and $Z_5$ yields a frequency-dependent negative resistor (FDNR). Filters utilizing GIC-implemented FDNRs have gained popularity in the audio design field, where they are purported to exhibit superior noise and distortion characteristics compared to filters like the Sallen-and-Key (discussed in the next section). The domain of inductorless filter design is both vibrant and intricate, with new designs emerging monthly in technical journals.\n\n#### Performance limits\n\nThe performance of gyrators and GICs at high frequencies is contingent on the operational amplifier's bandwidth (and other attributes). Thus, a GIC configured as an inductor (with a capacitor at $Z_4$ and resistors elsewhere) will cease to mimic an inductor at frequencies exceeding a few percent of the operational amplifier's bandwidth $f_{\\mathrm{T}}$. Simulation results in Figure 6.15 illustrate the expected behavior. Essentially, the near-ideal inductor (at low frequencies) transitions to a capacitor-like behavior at high frequencies, with a resonance occurring in between. Although this extended graph may appear displeasing, note that the \"inductor\" exhibits an astonishingly high quality factor ($Q$) of approximately $2 \\times 10^5$ at 1 kHz, assuming the $4.6 \\mathrm{~m}\\Omega$ impedance floor on the graph accurately represents the inductor's loss (equivalent series resistance, ESR). In reality, there are additional losses, so achievable $Q$ values range around $1000$, still impressive for an inductor of a fraction of a henry. Additionally, for the highest-bandwidth operational amplifier ($f_{\\mathrm{T}} = 50 \\mathrm{MHz}$), the capacitance is merely 2.3 pF; it would be impossible to construct a 160 mH inductor with such a minuscule \"winding capacitance\" or such a high self-resonant frequency.\n\nGyrators find practical application in real-world filters: Texas Instruments suggests using multiple GIC stages to create anti-alias filters in an Application Note. Stanford Research Systems employs four GIC stages, configured as an $R+LC$ ladder, to construct an 8-zero 9-pole elliptical lowpass filter for their SR830 DSP-based lock-in amplifier, ensuring that all frequency components above half the sampling frequency are attenuated by at least 96 dB. The filter passes signals from dc to 102 kHz, with a sampling rate of 256 kHz and a 25% frequency margin to achieve the 96 dB attenuation.\n\n#### E. Sallen-and-Key filter\n\nFigure 6.16 presents an example of a straightforward and somewhat intuitive filter topology, an instance of which was previously mentioned in §4.3.6. These are known as Sallen-and-Key filters, named after their inventors. The unity-gain amplifier can be an operational amplifier configured as a follower or simply an emitter follower or source follower. The depicted filters are 2-pole lowpass and highpass filters. Taking the lowpass filter (Figure 6.16A) as an example, note that it would essentially consist of two cascaded $RC$ lowpass filter sections, save for the bootstrapping of the first capacitor's bottom by the output. It is evident that at very high frequencies, the filter behaves like a cascaded $RC$ filter since the output is essentially zero. As the output increases at lower frequencies, however, the bootstrapping effect tends to diminish the attenuation, resulting in a sharper knee. Of course, such intuitive reasoning cannot replace rigorous analysis, which has fortunately been conducted for a multitude of excellent filters. We will revisit active filter circuits in $\\S 6.3$ after a brief introduction to filter performance parameters and filter types."

Frequency Domain\n\nThe most evident feature of a filter is its gain as a function of frequency, exemplified by the lowpass characteristic depicted in Figure 6.17.\n\nThe passband is the range of frequencies that the filter allows through with minimal attenuation. Typically, the passband extends up to the -3 dB point, though for some filters, such as \"equiripple\" types, the passband's endpoint may be defined differently. Within the passband, the response may exhibit variations or ripples, forming a ripple band, as illustrated. The cutoff frequency, \\( f_c \\), marks the end of the passband. Beyond this, the filter's response decreases through a transition region, often referred to as the skirt of the filter's response, leading to the stopband, where significant attenuation occurs.

Interestingly, the filter design can now be optimized for maximum flatness of the passband response, at the expense of a slow transition from passband to stopband. Alternatively, by allowing some ripple in the passband characteristic, the transition from passband to stopband can be steepened considerably. A third criterion that may be important is the ability of the filter to pass signals within the passband without distortion of their waveforms caused by phase shifts. You may also care about rise time, overshoot, and settling time. Generally speaking, you've got to make tradeoffs among these characteristics - a filter with a sharp cutoff will exhibit poor time-domain properties such as ringing and phase shifts.\n\nThere are filter designs available to optimize each of these characteristics, or combinations of them. In fact, rational filter selection will not be carried out as just described; rather, it normally begins with a set of requirements on passband flatness, attenuation at some frequency outside the passband, and whatever else matters. You will then choose the best design for the job, using the number of poles necessary to meet the requirements. In the next few sections we introduce the three popular classics - the Butterworth filter (maximally flat passband), the Chebyshev filter (steepest transition from passband to stopband), and the Bessel filter (maximally flat time delay). Each of these filter responses can be produced with a variety of different filter circuits, some of which we discuss later. They are all available in lowpass, highpass, bandpass, and band-stop (notch) versions.\n\nThe Butterworth filter produces the flattest passband response, at the expense of steepness in the transition region from passband to stopband. As you will see later, it has only mediocre phase and transient characteristics. The amplitude response is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{V_{\\text {out }}}{V_{\\text {in }}}=\\frac{1}{\\left[1+\\left(f / f_{\\mathrm{c}}\\right)^{2 n}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{2}}} \\tag{6.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $n$ is the order of the filter (number of poles). Increasing the number of poles flattens the passband response and steepens the stopband falloff, as shown in Figure 6.20.\n\nThe Butterworth filter trades off everything else for maximum flatness of response. It starts out extremely flat at zero frequency and bends over near the cutoff frequency $f_{\\mathrm{c}}$ (which is usually the -3 dB point).\n\nIn most applications, all that really matters is that the wiggles in the passband response be kept less than some amount, say 1 dB . The Chebyshev filter responds to this reality by allowing some ripples throughout the passband, with greatly improved sharpness of the knee (compared with the \"maximally flat\" Butterworth, for example). A Chebyshev filter is specified in terms of its number of poles and passband ripple. By allowing greater passband ripple, you get a sharper knee. The amplitude is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{out}}}{V_{\\mathrm{in}}}=\\frac{1}{\\left[1+\\varepsilon^{2} C_{n}^{2}\\left(f / f_{\\mathrm{c}}\\right)\\right]^{\\frac{1}{2}}} \\tag{6.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $C_{n}$ is the Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind of degree $n$, and $\\varepsilon$ is a constant that sets the passband ripple. Like the Butterworth (but in even greater degree), the Chebyshev has phase and transient characteristics that are far from ideal.\n\nThe idea of accepting some passband ripple in exchange for improved steepness in the transition region, as in the equiripple Chebyshev filter, is carried to its logical limit in the so-called elliptic (or Cauer) filter by trading ripple in both passband and stopband for an even steeper transition region than that of the Chebyshev filter. Such a filter does the job, if you are satisfied with an amplitude characteristic that reaches and maintains some minimum attenuation throughout the stopband (rather than continuing to fall off with a $6 n \\mathrm{~dB} /$ octave ultimate slope). The payback is a simpler filter, with better phase and amplitude characteristics (see below). With computer-aided design techniques, the design of elliptic filters is as straightforward as for the classic Butterworth and Chebyshev filters.\n\nAs we've suggested, the amplitude versus frequency response of a filter does not tell the whole story. A filter characterized by a flat amplitude response may exhibit rapidly changing phase shifts, which produce unequal time delays for signals within its passband. The result is that a signal in the passband will suffer distortion of its waveform. In situations where the shape of the waveform is paramount, a linear-phase filter (or constant-time-delay filter) is desirable. A filter whose phase shift varies linearly with frequency is equivalent to a constant time delay for signals within the passband; i.e., the waveform is not distorted. The Bessel filter (also called the Thomson filter) has maximally flat time delay within its passband in analogy with the Butterworth, which has maximally flat amplitude response.\n\nTo see the kind of improvement in time-domain performance you get with the Bessel filter, look at Figure 6.25 for a comparison of phase shift and time delay versus frequency for the Bessel filter compared with two classic filters that exhibit more abrupt frequency characteristics (Butterworth and Chebyshev). The poor time-delay performance of the Butterworth (and to a greater extent of the Chebyshev) gives rise to effects such as waveform distortion and overshoot when driven with pulse signals - see Figure 6.26. On the other hand, the price you pay for the Bessel's constancy of time delay is an amplitude response with even less steepness than that of the Butterworth or Chebyshev in the transition region between passband and stopband. An important point: adding sections to a Bessel filter (i.e., making it of higher order) does not significantly increase the steepness of transition into the stopband; it does, however, improve the phase linearity (constancy of time delay), as well as increasing the ultimate rate of falloff, reaching the usual $6 n \\mathrm{~dB} /$ octave asymptotic limit (look ahead to Figure 6.30)."

Filter comparison\n\nDespite the earlier comments on the Bessel filter's frequency response, it still possesses significantly superior properties in the time domain compared to the Butterworth and Chebyshev filters. The Chebyshev filter, with its highly desirable amplitude-versus-frequency characteristics, actually exhibits the poorest time-domain performance among the three. The Butterworth filter occupies an intermediate position in both frequency and time-domain properties.

The overshoot is noted as 0.3% above the normalized level.\n\n2. **8-pole Butterworth:** This curve rises more gradually compared to the Chebyshev filter and displays a moderate overshoot, with less oscillation.\n\n3. **8-pole Bessel:** This curve exhibits the smoothest transition with minimal overshoot and oscillation, stabilizing quickly compared to the other two filters.\n\nOverall, the Bessel filter demonstrates the best time-domain performance with the least overshoot and fastest settling time, making it ideal for applications where time-domain response is crucial. The Chebyshev filter, while offering a sharper cutoff in the frequency domain, shows the most overshoot and oscillation in the time domain. The Butterworth filter provides a balance between the two, with moderate overshoot and oscillations.\n\nFigure 6.27.

For normalized units, use $f / f_{\\mathrm{c}}$ for the horizontal axes and $t_{\\mathrm{d}} / T$ for the time delay.\n\nNumerous filter designs aim to enhance the Bessel filter's time-domain performance by compromising some time delay consistency for better rise time and amplitude-versus-frequency characteristics. The Gaussian filter, for instance, has phase characteristics nearly as good as the Bessel's, with an improved step response. Another category includes filters that permit uniform ripples in the passband time delay (analogous to the Chebyshev's amplitude response ripples) and achieve roughly constant time delays even for signals well into the stopband; these are often referred to as \"linear phase\" filters, characterized by a parameter that sets the phase ripple within the passband (e.g., $0.5^{\\circ}$). Another method to achieve uniform time delays in filters is through the use of allpass filters (also known as delay equalizers), which have a constant amplitude response with frequency and a customizable phase shift. These can be employed to improve the time-delay consistency of any filter, including Butterworth and Chebyshev types.\nimage_name:Bessel\ndescription:The image comprises three time-domain waveform graphs, each depicting the response to a 1 V step input at t=0 for three different lowpass filter types: Bessel, Butterworth, and Chebyshev.\n\n**1.

Chebyshev Filter:**\n- **Graph Type:** Time-domain waveform.\n- **Axes:**\n- **X-axis:** Time in milliseconds (ms), ranging from 0 to 6 ms.\n- **Y-axis:** Output Voltage in volts (V), ranging from 0 to 1.2 V.\n- **Overall Behavior:**\n- The Chebyshev filter shows the fastest initial voltage rise, followed by significant overshoot and oscillations.\n- The response takes longer to stabilize at the steady-state value of 1 V.\n- **Key Features:**\n- Shows responses for 2-pole, 4-pole, and 8-pole filters.\n- Oscillations become more pronounced with higher pole counts, with the 8-pole filter exhibiting the most significant overshoot and ringing.\n\nThese graphs illustrate the trade-offs between time-domain performance and frequency-domain characteristics for each filter type, with Bessel offering the smoothest time response, Butterworth providing a balance, and Chebyshev prioritizing frequency characteristics at the cost of time-domain stability.\nimage_name:Butterworth\ndescription:The graph depicts time-domain waveforms showing the responses of three different 1 kHz lowpass filters—Bessel, Butterworth, and Chebyshev—to a 1 V step input at t = 0 ms. Each filter type is represented in a separate subplot, with responses for 2-pole, 4-pole, and 8-pole configurations shown within each subplot.\n\n**Axes Labels and Units:**\n- The x-axis measures time in milliseconds (ms), ranging from 0 to 6 ms.\n- The y-axis measures output voltage in volts (V), ranging from 0 to 1.2 V.\n\n**Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- **Bessel Filter:** Displays the smoothest response with minimal overshoot. As the number of poles increases, the rise time slightly quickens, but the waveforms remain smooth without significant oscillations.\n- **Butterworth Filter:** Shows a moderate level of overshoot and oscillation compared to the Bessel filter. The 8-pole configuration exhibits more pronounced overshoot and oscillation than the 2-pole and 4-pole configurations.\n- **Chebyshev Filter (1dB):** Exhibits the most significant overshoot and ringing among the three filters. The 8-pole configuration has the highest overshoot and oscillation, while the 2-pole configuration shows less pronounced but still noticeable oscillation.\n\n**Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- **Bessel Filter:** Known for its linear phase response, resulting in minimal time-domain distortion. The waveforms rise smoothly to the steady-state value of 1 V with negligible overshoot.\n- **Butterworth Filter:** Characterized by its flat amplitude response in the frequency domain, it sacrifices some time-domain performance, leading to overshoot and ringing. The 8-pole configuration particularly highlights these effects.\n- **Chebyshev Filter:** Optimized for sharp cutoff in the frequency domain, resulting in significant time-domain distortion. The overshoot exceeds 1.2 V, and oscillations are evident and prolonged, especially in the 8-pole configuration.\n\n**Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- Each subplot is labeled with the filter type, and the number of poles is annotated on each curve. The curves illustrate how increasing the number of poles affects the time-domain response, generally leading to faster rise times but increased overshoot and oscillations, particularly in the Butterworth and Chebyshev filters.\nimage_name:Chebyshev (1dB)\ndescription:The graph titled \"Chebyshev (1dB)\" presents a time-domain waveform showing the response of Chebyshev lowpass filters to a 1 V step input at time t=0. This graph is part of a series comparing Bessel, Butterworth, and Chebyshev filters.\n\n1. **Type of Graph and Function:**\n- The graph is a time-domain response plot, depicting how the output voltage of a Chebyshev filter changes over time following a step input.\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n- The x-axis represents time in milliseconds (ms), ranging from 0 to 6 ms.\n- The y-axis represents output voltage in volts (V), ranging from 0 to 1.2 V.\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- The graph includes response curves for 2-pole, 4-pole, and 8-pole Chebyshev filters.\n- All curves initially rise sharply in response to the step input, peaking slightly above 1 V.\n- Following the initial rise, the curves exhibit oscillations, which become more pronounced with increasing pole count.\n- The 8-pole filter shows the most significant overshoot and oscillations, while the 2-pole filter exhibits the least.\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The Chebyshev filter is noted for its passband ripple, evident in the oscillatory behavior of the output.\n- The peak voltage surpasses 1 V due to overshoot, a characteristic of Chebyshev filters.\n- The settling time, or the time required for the output to stabilize near 1 V, increases with the number of poles.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- Each curve is labeled with the number of poles (2, 4, 8), indicating the filter order.\n- The graph highlights the trade-off between filter sharpness and time-domain performance, as higher-order filters exhibit more oscillations and longer settling times.\n\nFigure 6.26.

Filter comparison\n\nDespite the earlier comments on the Bessel filter's frequency response, it still demonstrates superior time-domain properties compared to the Butterworth and Chebyshev filters. The Chebyshev filter, with its desirable amplitude-versus-frequency characteristics, actually exhibits the poorest time-domain performance among the three. The Butterworth filter occupies a middle ground in both frequency and time-domain properties. Table 6.1 on the following page and Figures 6.26 and 6.27 provide additional insights into the time-domain performance of these three filter types, complementing the earlier frequency-domain graphs. These resources clearly indicate that the Bessel filter is preferable when time-domain performance is critical.\nimage_name:Figure 6.27\ndescription:Figure 6.27 displays a time-domain waveform graph comparing the step responses of three different 8-pole lowpass filters: Chebyshev, Butterworth, and Bessel, all normalized to a 1 Hz cutoff frequency. The x-axis measures time in seconds, ranging from 0 to 5 seconds, while the y-axis measures amplitude response, ranging from 0 to 1.2.\n\nThe graph presents three distinct curves:\n\n1. **8-pole Chebyshev (1 dB ripple):** This curve shows a rapid rise and significant overshoot, peaking at around 1.2 amplitude before oscillating and eventually stabilizing. The overshoot is noted as 0.3% above the normalized level.\n\n2. **8-pole Butterworth:** This curve rises more gradually than the Chebyshev filter and displays moderate overshoot with less oscillation.\n\n3. **8-pole Bessel:** This curve exhibits the smoothest transition with minimal overshoot and oscillation, settling quickly compared to the other two filters.\n\nOverall, the Bessel filter demonstrates the best time-domain performance with the least overshoot and fastest settling time, making it ideal for applications where time-domain response is crucial. The Chebyshev filter, while offering a sharper cutoff in the frequency domain, shows the most overshoot and oscillation in the time domain. The Butterworth filter provides a balance between the two, with moderate overshoot and oscillations.\n\nFigure 6.27.

    "text": "In the subsequent section, we'll explore how to implement these classic filters using resistors, capacitors, and operational amplifiers. These are known as active filters, offering the benefit of not requiring inductors. This is advantageous since inductors are often large, imperfect, and not cost-effective.\n\nHowever, for applications involving frequencies above approximately 100 kHz, it is generally more suitable to construct passive filters, such as the antialias lowpass filter example depicted in Figure 6.9. You have two options: you can either build the filters yourself or purchase them. To create your own, you can utilize various design tables (a set is provided in Appendix E) or filter-design software (refer to §6.3.8) to determine the $L$ and $C$ values for your specific filter. If you are only producing a few, you might consider using slug-tuned inductors (adjusted with an inductance meter or bridge) and either $1\\%$ capacitors or hand-trimmed pairs of paralleled capacitors to achieve the necessary precision.\n\nAlternatively, you can opt to spend money to resolve the issue: numerous manufacturers offer both standard and custom filters and are willing to construct whatever you need. For frequencies at the lower end of the spectrum (say below 100 MHz), they will use lumped elements ( $L$ 's and $C$ 's); for higher frequencies, you'll receive coaxial or cavity filters. If the filter you require is a standard unit (e.g., found in the MiniCircuits Labs catalog), it will be affordable and typically available from stock. Otherwise, you can expect to pay at least a hundred dollars and wait several weeks.

Switched-capacitor filters, on the other hand, use a capacitor paired with a MOSFET switch, which is toggled on and off by an external clock signal, to replace the input resistor in a traditional op-amp integrator. The effective resistance is determined by the clock frequency. A typical switched-capacitor filter employs multiple such integrators along with additional op-amps to achieve the desired filtering function. ${ }^{25}$ These filters offer the benefits of easy tuning across a wide range (via the clock frequency), stable characteristics, and simplicity in IC fabrication. However, they tend to be noisier (having a smaller dynamic range), exhibit higher distortion, and can introduce artifacts like aliasing and clock feedthrough.\n\nKey features to consider in active filters include: (a) minimal number of components, both active and passive, (b) ease of adjustment, (c) narrow range of component values, particularly for capacitors, (d) lenient op-amp requirements, especially regarding slew rate, bandwidth, and output impedance, (e) capability to create high-$Q$ filters, (f) electrical tunability, and (g) sensitivity of filter characteristics to component values and op-amp gain (specifically the gain-bandwidth product, $f_{\\mathrm{T}}$). The last feature is particularly crucial. A filter demanding high-precision components is challenging to adjust and will drift as components age, Additionally, it necessitates components with good initial accuracy. The VCVS circuit's popularity stems largely from its simplicity and low component count, but it is highly sensitive to component variations. In contrast, recent interest in more complex filter designs is driven by their reduced sensitivity to minor component variations.\n\nIn this section, we introduce several circuits for low-pass, high-pass, and band-pass active filters. We start with the widely-used VCVS, or controlled-source type, then discuss state-variable designs available as ICs from various manufacturers, and finally touch upon the twin-T sharp rejection filter.\n\nMost newly introduced active-filter ICs are of the switched-capacitor type, due to their user-friendliness, compact size, low cost, excellent stability, and, in some instances, the complete absence of required external components. We wrap up the chapter with an examination of these filters."

    "text": "The voltage-controlled voltage-source (VCVS) filter, also referred to simply as a controlled-source filter, was developed by Sallen and Key (and presented in a simplified form in §6.2.4E). It is a modification of the earlier-discussed unity-gain circuit (Figure 6.16), where the unity-gain follower is substituted with a noninverting amplifier having a gain greater than unity. Figure 6.28 illustrates the circuits for lowpass, highpass, and bandpass implementations. The resistors at the op-amps' outputs form a noninverting voltage amplifier with a voltage gain of $K$, while the remaining resistors and capacitors determine the filter's frequency response characteristics. These are 2-pole filters and can be configured as Butterworth, Bessel, etc., by appropriately selecting component values, as demonstrated later. Multiple VCVS 2-pole sections can be cascaded to create higher-order filters.

    "text": "To employ Table 6.2 for crafting a lowpass or highpass filter, start by selecting the desired filter characteristic. As previously discussed, the Butterworth type is appealing for achieving maximum flatness in the passband, the Chebyshev type provides the quickest attenuation from the passband to the stopband, albeit with some ripple within the passband, and the Bessel type excels in phase characteristics, delivering consistent signal delay in the passband, along with a favorable step response. The frequency responses for each type are depicted in the accompanying graphical illustrations (Figure 6.30).\n\n#### Table 6.2 VCVS Lowpass Filters\n\n|  | Butterworth K | Bessel |  | Chebyshev (0.5 dB) |  | Chebyshev (2 dB) |  |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n|  |  | c | K | c | K | c | K |\n| 2 | 1.586 | 1.272 | 1.268 | 1.231 | 1.842 | 0.907 | 2.114 |\n| 4 | 1.152 | 1.432 | 1.084 | 0.597 | 1.582 | 0.471 | 1.924 |\n|  | 2.235 | 1.606 | 1.759 | 1.031 | 2.660 | 0.964 | 2.782 |\n| 6 | 1.068 | 1.607 | 1.040 | 0.396 | 1.537 | 0.316 | 1.891 |\n|  | 1.586 | 1.692 | 1.364 | 0.768 | 2.448 | 0.730 | 2.648 |\n|  | 2.483 | 1.908 | 2.023 | 1.011 | 2.846 | 0.983 | 2.904 |\n| 8 | 1.038 | 1.781 | 1.024 | 0.297 | 1.522 | 0.238 | 1.879 |\n|  | 1.337 | 1.835 | 1.213 | 0.599 | 2.379 | 0.572 | 2.605 |\n|  | 1.889 | 1.956 | 1.593 | 0.861 | 2.711 | 0.842 | 2.821 |\n|  | 2.610 | 2.192 | 2.184 | 1.006 | 2.913 | 0.990 | 2.946 |\n\nTo construct an \\( n \\)-order filter (where \\( n \\) is an even number), you must cascade \\( n/2 \\) VCVS sections. Within each section, \\( R_1 = R_2 = R \\) and \\( C_1 = C_2 = C \\). In typical operational amplifier circuits, \\( R \\) is usually selected within the range of 10 kΩ to 100 kΩ. (It's best to avoid low resistor values since the op-amp's rising open-loop output impedance at high frequencies adds to the resistor values and can disrupt calculations.) Afterward, simply adjust the gain \\( K \\) of each stage according to the table values. For an \\( n \\)-order filter, there are \\( n/2 \\) entries, one for each section.\n\n#### A. Butterworth lowpass filters\n\nFor Butterworth filters, all sections feature the same \\( R \\) and \\( C \\) values, which are straightforwardly calculated using the formula \\( RC = \\frac{1}{2\\pi f_c} \\), where \\( f_c \\) is the desired -3 dB frequency of the entire filter. To fabricate a 6-order lowpass Butterworth filter, for instance, connect three of the presented lowpass sections in cascade, with gains of 1.07, 1.59, and 2.48 (preferably in that sequence to prevent dynamic range issues), utilizing the same \\( R \\) and \\( C \\) values to determine the 3 dB cutoff point.\n\n#### B. Bessel and Chebyshev lowpass filters\n\nTo construct Bessel or Chebyshev filters using the VCVS technique, the process is only marginally more complex. Similarly, cascade multiple 2-order VCVS filters, with predetermined gains for each section. Within each section, still utilize \\( R_1 = R_2 = R \\) and \\( C_1 = C_2 = C \\). Unlike the Butterworth case, the \\( RC \\) products for the various sections differ and must be scaled by the normalizing factor \\( c_n \\) (provided for each section in Table 6.2 on this page) using the formula \\( RC = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c_n f_c} \\). Here \\( f_c \\) denotes the -3 dB point for the Bessel filter, whereas for the Chebyshev filter, it signifies the termination of the passband, i.e., the frequency where the amplitude response drops out of the ripple band into the stopband. For example, the response of a Chebyshev lowpass filter with 0.5 dB ripple and \\( f_c = 100 \\text{ Hz} \\) will be level within +0 dB to -0.5 dB from DC to 100 Hz, with 0.5 dB attenuation at 100 Hz and a swift attenuation for frequencies exceeding 100 Hz. Values are provided for Chebyshev filters with 0.5 dB and 2.0 dB passband ripple; the latter have a slightly steeper transition into the stopband (Figure 6.30).\nimage_name:Figure 6.29\ndescription:\n[\nname: C1, type: Capacitor, value: 10nF, ports: {Np: InP(A1), Nn: GND}\nname: C2, type: Capacitor, value: 10nF, ports: {Np: X1, Nn: Out(A1)}\nname: RA, type: Resistor, value: RA, ports: {N1: X2, N2: InP(A1)}\nname: RB, type: Resistor, value: RB, ports: {N1: X1, N2: Out(A1)}\nname: RGA, type: Resistor, value: 10k, ports: {N1: InN(A1), N2: GND}\nname: RGB, type: Resistor, value: 10k, ports: {N1: InN(A2), N2: GND}\nname: A1, type: OpAmp, value: A1, ports: {InP: InP(A1), InN: InN(A1), OutP: Out(A1)}\nname: A2, type: OpAmp, value: A2, ports: {InP: InP(A2), InN: InN(A2), OutP: Out(A2)}\n]\nextrainfo:This is a 4-order VCVS lowpass filter with a cutoff frequency of 100 Hz.

    "text": "In order to design a filter using Table 6.2, one must first determine the required filter response. As previously discussed, the Butterworth filter is ideal for a maximally flat passband, the Chebyshev filter provides the quickest rolloff from passband to stopband, albeit with some passband ripple, and the Bessel filter exhibits the best phase characteristics, ensuring constant signal delay in the passband and a good step response. The frequency responses for these filter types are depicted in the accompanying graphs (Figure 6.30).\n\n#### Table 6.2 VCVS Lowpass Filters\n\n| $\\frac{\\mathscr{0}}{\\circ}$ | Butterworth K | Bessel |  | Chebyshev ( 0.5 dB ) |  | Chebyshev (2dB) |  |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n|  |  | $c$ | K | $c$ | K | $c$ | K |\n| 2 | 1.586 | 1.272 | 1.268 | 1.231 | 1.842 | 0.907 | 2.114 |\n| 4 | 1.152 | 1.432 | 1.084 | 0.597 | 1.582 | 0.471 | 1.924 |\n|  | 2.235 | 1.606 | 1.759 | 1.031 | 2.660 | 0.964 | 2.782 |\n| 6 | 1.068 | 1.607 | 1.040 | 0.396 | 1.537 | 0.316 | 1.891 |\n|  | 1.586 | 1.692 | 1.364 | 0.768 | 2.448 | 0.730 | 2.648 |\n|  | 2.483 | 1.908 | 2.023 | 1.011 | 2.846 | 0.983 | 2.904 |\n| 8 | 1.038 | 1.781 | 1.024 | 0.297 | 1.522 | 0.238 | 1.879 |\n|  | 1.337 | 1.835 | 1.213 | 0.599 | 2.379 | 0.572 | 2.605 |\n|  | 1.889 | 1.956 | 1.593 | 0.861 | 2.711 | 0.842 | 2.821 |\n|  | 2.610 | 2.192 | 2.184 | 1.006 | 2.913 | 0.990 | 2.946 |\n\nFor designing an $n$-pole filter, where $n$ is an even integer, one needs to cascade $n / 2$ VCVS sections. Within each section, $R_{1}=R_{2}=R$, and $C_{1}=C_{2}=C$. As is typical in op-amp circuits, $R$ is usually chosen within the range of 10 k to 100 k. (It is advisable to avoid small resistor values since the increasing open-loop output impedance of the op-amp at high frequencies adds to the resistor values and can disrupt calculations.) Then, all that is needed is to set the gain, $K$, of each stage according to the table entries. For an $n$-pole filter, there are $n / 2$ entries, one for each section.\n\n#### A. Butterworth lowpass filters\n\nFor a Butterworth filter, all sections possess the same values of $R$ and $C$, given simply by $R C=1 / 2 \\pi f_{\\mathrm{c}}$, where $f_{\\mathrm{c}}$ is the desired -3 dB frequency of the entire filter. To create a 6-pole lowpass Butterworth filter, for instance, one cascades three of the lowpass sections shown previously, with gains of $1.07,1.59$, and 2.48 (preferably in that order to avoid dynamic range issues), and with identical $R$ 's and $C$ 's to set the 3 dB point.\n\n#### B. Bessel and Chebyshev lowpass filters\n\nTo design a Bessel or Chebyshev filter with the VCVS, the process is slightly more complex. Once again, one cascades several 2-pole VCVS filters, with specified gains for each section. Within each section, $R_{1}=R_{2}=R$ and $C_{1}=C_{2}=C$. However, unlike the Butterworth situation, the $R C$ products for the different sections differ and must be scaled by the normalizing factor $c_{\\mathrm{n}}$ (given for each section in Table 6.2 on this page) according to $R C=1 / 2 \\pi c_{\\mathrm{n}} f_{\\mathrm{c}}$. Here, $f_{\\mathrm{c}}$ is again the -3 dB point for the Bessel filter, whereas for the Chebyshev filter it defines the end of the passband, i.e., it is the frequency at which the amplitude response falls out of the ripple band on its way into the stopband. For example, the response of a Chebyshev lowpass filter with 0.5 dB ripple and $f_{\\mathrm{c}}=100 \\mathrm{~Hz}$ will be flat within +0 dB to -0.5 dB from dc to 100 Hz, with 0.5 dB attenuation at 100 Hz and a rapid falloff for frequencies greater than 100 Hz. Values are provided for Chebyshev filters with 0.5 dB and 2.0 dB passband ripple; the latter have a somewhat steeper transition into the stopband (Figure 6.30).\n\nThe images and their descriptions have been integrated into the text above, maintaining the original meaning and length."

    "text": "To construct an n-pole lowpass or highpass filter (where n is an even number), you should combine n/2 Voltage-Controlled Voltage Source (VCVS) stages. Each stage should feature identical resistors (R1 = R2 = R) and capacitors (C1 = C2 = C). Generally, the value of R is selected within the range of 10 kΩ to 100 kΩ for operational amplifier circuits. It is advisable to avoid using low resistor values due to the increased open-loop output impedance of the op-amp at high frequencies, which can complicate calculations. The gain (K) for each stage should be set according to the values provided in the table. For an n-pole filter, you will have n/2 values in the table, corresponding to each stage.\n\nFor Butterworth filters, all sections should have the same values of R and C, which are determined by the equation RC = 1/(2πfc), where fc is the desired -3 dB frequency of the entire filter. To create a 6-pole lowpass Butterworth filter, for instance, you would cascade three lowpass sections, each with gains of 1.07, 1.59, and 2.48 (preferably in that order to avoid dynamic range issues), and with matching R and C values to establish the 3 dB cutoff point.\n\nBessel and Chebyshev filters are constructed similarly, involving the cascade of several 2-pole VCVS filters with specific gain values for each section. The R and C products for these sections are different, and they must be adjusted by the normalization factor cn (provided in Table 6.2) according to RC = 1/(2πcnfc). For the Bessel filter, fc represents the -3 dB frequency, while for the Chebyshev filter, it denotes the end of the passband—where the amplitude response falls out of the ripple band as it transitions into the stopband. For example, a Chebyshev lowpass filter with 0.5 dB ripple and a cutoff frequency of 100 Hz would maintain a flat amplitude response within ±0 dB to -0.5 dB from DC to 100 Hz, with 0.5 dB attenuation at 100 Hz and a rapid decrease for frequencies above 100 Hz. Values for Chebyshev filters with 0.5 dB and 2.0 dB passband ripple are provided, with the latter showing a steeper transition into the stopband.\n\nWhen creating a bandpass filter, combine overlapping lowpass and highpass filters, and for a band-reject filter, sum the outputs of nonoverlapping lowpass and highpass filters. Cascaded filters may not be suitable for high-Q filters (extremely sharp bandpass filters) due to their sensitivity to component values. Instead, consider a high-Q single-stage bandpass circuit, like the VCVS bandpass circuit previously illustrated, or state-variable and biquad filters.\n\nThe Sallen-and-Key (or VCVS) filter design can be simplified by using identical resistor and capacitor values within each 2-pole filter stage. However, this simplification leads to non-standard amplifier gains. When setting the filter's gain, for instance, to prevent saturation or to adjust filter characteristics without altering the gain, it is necessary to relax the component ratio constraint. Information on this can be found in Application Notes by James Karki from TI.\n\nGeneralizing the Sallen-and-Key filter design, the transition frequency fc and Q (sharpness of transition or peakiness) of a 2-pole Sallen-and-Key section with arbitrary component ratios can be calculated. These results demonstrate the trade-offs between different design constraints, such as the case of unity gain (K=1), where wideband unity-gain buffer ICs or simple discrete-transistor followers can be used.\n\nIn summary, VCVS filters are advantageous due to their minimal component requirement, noninverting gain, low output impedance, and easy gain adjustment. However, they have limitations, including sensitivity to component values and amplifier gain, and the need for a high-bandwidth op-amp. Some of these drawbacks can be addressed with state-variable and biquad filters."

    "text": "To utilize Table 6.2 for designing a lowpass or highpass filter, start by selecting the desired filter type. As discussed previously, the Butterworth filter is preferable for achieving maximum passband flatness, the Chebyshev filter offers the quickest transition from the passband to the stopband at the cost of some passband ripple, and the Bessel filter provides optimal phase characteristics—specifically, a constant delay of the signal in the passband—along with a good step response. The frequency responses for these types are illustrated in the included graphs (Figure 6.30).\n\n#### Table 6.2 VCVS Lowpass Filters\n\n|  | Butterworth K | Bessel |  | Chebyshev ( 0.5 dB ) |  | Chebyshev (2dB) |  |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n|  |  | c | K | c | K | c | K |\n| 2 | 1.586 | 1.272 | 1.268 | 1.231 | 1.842 | 0.907 | 2.114 |\n| 4 | 1.152 | 1.432 | 1.084 | 0.597 | 1.582 | 0.471 | 1.924 |\n|  | 2.235 | 1.606 | 1.759 | 1.031 | 2.660 | 0.964 | 2.782 |\n| 6 | 1.068 | 1.607 | 1.040 | 0.396 | 1.537 | 0.316 | 1.891 |\n|  | 1.586 | 1.692 | 1.364 | 0.768 | 2.448 | 0.730 | 2.648 |\n|  | 2.483 | 1.908 | 2.023 | 1.011 | 2.846 | 0.983 | 2.904 |\n| 8 | 1.038 | 1.781 | 1.024 | 0.297 | 1.522 | 0.238 | 1.879 |\n|  | 1.337 | 1.835 | 1.213 | 0.599 | 2.379 | 0.572 | 2.605 |\n|  | 1.889 | 1.956 | 1.593 | 0.861 | 2.711 | 0.842 | 2.821 |\n|  | 2.610 | 2.192 | 2.184 | 1.006 | 2.913 | 0.990 | 2.946 |\n\nFor constructing an $n$-pole filter (where $n$ is an even number), connect $n / 2$ VCVS sections in series. Within each section, set $R_{1}=R_{2}=R$ and $C_{1}=C_{2}=C$. Typically, the resistance value $R$ is chosen within the range of 10 k to 100 k . (It is advisable to steer clear of low resistor values, as the op-amp's rising open-loop output impedance at high frequencies combines with the resistor values, disrupting calculations.) Once this is done, adjust the gain, $K$, of each stage according to the table entries. For an $n$-pole filter, there are $n / 2$ entries, one corresponding to each section.\n\n#### A. Butterworth lowpass filters\n\nFor a Butterworth filter, all sections utilize the same values for $R$ and $C$, determined by the equation $R C=1 / 2 \\pi f_{\\mathrm{c}}$, where $f_{\\mathrm{c}}$ denotes the desired -3 dB frequency for the entire filter. For instance, to build a 6-pole lowpass Butterworth filter,串联三个低通滤波器阶段，其增益分别为1.07, 1.59, 和 2.48 (按此顺序连接以避免动态范围问题)，并且使用相同的$R$和$C$来设定3 dB点。\n\n#### B. Bessel and Chebyshev lowpass filters\n\nTo design a Bessel or Chebyshev filter using the VCVS method, the process is just slightly more intricate. You still cascade multiple 2-pole VCVS filters, each with its own gain setting. In each section, maintain $R_{1}=R_{2}=R$ and $C_{1}=C_{2}=C$. However, unlike the Butterworth filter, the $R C$ products for different sections differ and must be scaled using the normalizing factor $c_{\\mathrm{n}}$, provided for each section in Table 6.2 on this page, according to $R C=1 / 2 \\pi c_{\\mathrm{n}} f_{\\mathrm{c}}$. For Bessel filters, $f_{\\mathrm{c}}$ signifies the -3 dB point, while for Chebyshev filters, it indicates the end of the passband, or the frequency at which the amplitude response leaves the ripple band as it enters the stopband. For example, a Chebyshev lowpass filter with 0.5 dB ripple and $f_{\\mathrm{c}}=100 \\mathrm{~Hz}$ maintains a flat response within +0 dB to -0.5 dB from dc to 100 Hz, exhibits 0.5 dB attenuation at 100 Hz, and rapidly declines for frequencies beyond 100 Hz. Values for Chebyshev filters with 0.5 dB and 2.0 dB passband ripple are provided; the latter exhibit a steeper transition into the stopband (Figure 6.30).\n\n#### C. Highpass filters\n\nTo create a highpass filter, employ the highpass configuration previously described, i.e., swap the positions of the $R$ 's and $C$ 's. For Butterworth filters, maintain the same values for $R, C$, and $K$. For Bessel and Chebyshev filters, retain the $K$ values but invert the normalizing factors $c_{\\mathrm{n}}$. This means that for each section, the new $c_{\\mathrm{n}}$ is equal to $1 /\\left(c_{\\mathrm{n}}\\right.$ listed in Table 6.2 on the previous page.\n\nA bandpass filter can be formed by cascading overlapping lowpass and highpass filters, while a band-reject filter can be achieved by summing the outputs of nonoverlapping lowpass and highpass filters. Nevertheless, cascaded filters may not perform well for high-$Q$ filters (extremely sharp bandpass filters) due to their sensitivity to component values in the individual (uncoupled) filter sections. In such instances, use a high-$Q$ single-stage bandpass circuit, such as the previously illustrated VCVS bandpass circuit or the state-variable and biquad filters in the following section. Even a single-stage 2-pole filter can generate an extremely sharp response. Information on such filter design can be found in standard references.\n\n#### D. Generalizing the Sallen-and-Key filter\n\nA simplification in the design of these Sallen-and-Key (or VCVS) filter circuits involves using identical resistor and capacitor values within each 2-pole filter stage. However, this simplification results in non-standard amplifier gains, as evidenced in the \"Gain\" column in Figure 6.29.\n\nIt is often desirable to set the filter gain, for example, to prevent saturation or to allow for changes in filter characteristics (by adjusting component values) without affecting the gain. When gains are constrained, the component ratio constraint must be relaxed. You can learn more about this in a pair of Application Notes by James Karki from TI. The essence is that, just like with the previous VCVS circuits, you can create any filter characteristic using amplifier stages with your chosen gain, provided you are willing to adjust the resistor and capacitor ratios.\n\nBased on Karki's analysis, we can derive summary formulas for the transition frequency $f_{\\mathrm{c}}$ and $Q$ of a 2-pole Sallen-Key section, where the component ratios can assume any value. Following the naming convention of Figure 6.28A, we define parameters $m, n$, and $\\tau$ (which will enhance the final results):\n\n$$\nm=R_{1} / R_{2}, n=C_{1} / C_{2}, \\text { and } \\tau=R_{2} C_{2}\n$$\n\nWith these definitions, a 2-pole filter section has a transition frequency\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nf_{c}=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\tau \\sqrt{m n}} \\tag{6.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand a $Q$ (transition sharpness or peakiness) of\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nQ=\\frac{\\sqrt{m n}}{1+m+m n(1-K)} \\tag{6.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThese expressions alone are not sufficient to design higher-order filter cascades with canonical filter shapes (Chebyshev, etc.); for that, refer to the tables in Karki's App Note SLOA049B, or use a filter-design program for a more engaging approach. However, these formulas illustrate the concept that you can trade off one set of constraints for another. Notably, the case of unity gain ($K=1$) is particularly appealing, as the gain elements can be implemented as wideband unitygain buffer ICs or simple discrete-transistor followers.\n\nReturning to the constraint previously used with the VCVS table (i.e., $R_{1}=R_{2}=R, C_{1}=C_{2}=C$), these formulas simplify to the following forms:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nf_{c}=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi R C}, \\quad Q=\\frac{1}{3-K} \\tag{6.7}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor which the circuit becomes unstable $(Q \\rightarrow \\infty)$ when $K=3$. Note that such a circuit, with the gain $K$ further constrained to unity (i.e., a follower, as demonstrated in Figure 6.16 to introduce the concept of an active filter), results in a relatively weak filter, with a $Q$ of just one half.\n\n#### E. Summary\n\nVCVS filters are advantageous in requiring fewer components (two poles per op-amp) and offer additional benefits such as non-inverting gain, low output impedance, narrow component value spreads, ease of gain adjustment, the capability to operate at high gain or high $Q$, and suitability for applications requiring a stable tunable filter. They are sensitive to component values and amplifier gain, are not well-suited for applications requiring a tunable filter with stable characteristics, and necessitate op-amps with a bandwidth ( $f_{\\mathrm{T}}$, or GBW) that is much higher than the filter's $f_{\\mathrm{c}}$. Some of these limitations are mitigated by state-variable and biquad filters."

(It's advisable to avoid small resistor values due to the op-amp's increasing open-loop output impedance at high frequencies, which can disrupt calculations.) Then, simply set the gain, $K$, of each stage according to the table entries. For an $n$-pole filter, there are $n / 2$ entries, corresponding to each section.\n\n#### A. Butterworth lowpass filters\n\nFor Butterworth filters, all sections have the same $R$ and $C$ values, determined by $R C=1 / 2 \\pi f_{\\mathrm{c}}$, where $f_{\\mathrm{c}}$ is the desired -3 dB frequency of the entire filter. For instance, to create a 6-pole lowpass Butterworth filter, you would cascade three of the previously shown lowpass sections, with gains of $1.07,1.59$, and 2.48 (preferably in that order to avoid dynamic range issues), and identical $R$ 's and $C$ 's to set the 3 dB point.\n\n#### B. Bessel and Chebyshev lowpass filters\n\nCreating a Bessel or Chebyshev filter with the VCVS is slightly more complex. Again, you'll cascade several 2-pole VCVS filters, with specified gains for each section. In each section, use $R_{1}=R_{2}=R$ and $C_{1}=C_{2}=C$. However, unlike Butterworth filters, the $R C$ products for different sections will vary and must be scaled by the normalizing factor $c_{\\mathrm{n}}$ (provided for each section in Table 6.2) according to $R C=1 / 2 \\pi c_{\\mathrm{n}} f_{\\mathrm{c}}$. Here, $f_{\\mathrm{c}}$ is the -3 dB point for the Bessel filter, whereas for the Chebyshev filter, it defines the passband's end, i.e., the frequency at which the amplitude response exits the ripple band and enters the stopband. For example, a Chebyshev lowpass filter with 0.5 dB ripple and $f_{\\mathrm{c}}=100 \\mathrm{~Hz}$ will have a flat response within +0 dB to -0.5 dB from dc to 100 Hz, with 0.5 dB attenuation at 100 Hz and a rapid falloff for frequencies above 100 Hz. Values are provided for Chebyshev filters with 0.5 dB and 2.0 dB passband ripple; the latter have a steeper transition into the stopband (Figure 6.30).\n\n#### An example\n\nFigure 6.29 demonstrates a VCVS implementation of a 4-pole lowpass filter with $f_{\\mathrm{c}}=100 \\mathrm{~Hz}$; resistor values for three filter characteristics are listed, calculated as previously described. We used a similar filter (6-pole Butterworth, $f_{\\mathrm{c}}=90 \\mathrm{~Hz}$) to generate a precise $50-70 \\mathrm{~Hz}$ sinewave from a digital square wave referenced to a crystal oscillator; the output was amplified and used to drive an astronomical telescope.\n\n#### C. Highpass filters\n\nTo create a highpass filter, use the highpass configuration shown earlier, i.e., with the $R$ 's and $C$ 's swapped. For Butterworth filters, everything else remains unchanged (use the same values for $R, C$, and $K$). For the Bessel and Chebyshev filters, the $K$ values remain the same, but the normalizing factors $c_{\\mathrm{n}}$ must be inverted, i.e., for each section the new $c_{\\mathrm{n}}$ equals $1 /\\left(c_{\\mathrm{n}}\\right.$ listed in Table 6.2 on the preceding page).\n\nA bandpass filter can be made by cascading overlapping lowpass and highpass filters. A band-reject filter can be made by summing the outputs of nonoverlapping lowpass and highpass filters. However, such cascaded filters aren't suitable for high- $Q$ filters (extremely sharp bandpass filters) due to their sensitivity to component values in the individual (uncoupled) filter sections. In such cases, a high- $Q$ single-stage bandpass circuit (e.g., the VCVS bandpass circuit illustrated previously, or the state-variable and biquad filters in the next section) should be employed. Even a single-stage 2-pole filter can produce a response with an extremely sharp peak. Information on such filter design is available in standard references.\n\n#### D. Generalizing the Sallen-and-Key filter\n\nA design simplification in these Sallen-and-Key (or VCVS) filter circuits was the use of identical resistor and capacitor values within each 2-pole filter stage; but with that simplification came a set of unusual amplifier gains, as seen in the \"Gain\" column in Figure 6.29.\n\nOften, you'll want to set the filter's gain, for example, to prevent saturation or to change the filter characteristics (by adjusting component values) without altering the gain.

Values are given for Chebyshev filters with 0.5 dB and 2.0 dB passband ripple; the latter have a somewhat steeper transition into the stopband (Figure 6.30).\n\n#### An example\n\nAs an illustration, Figure 6.29 shows a VCVS implementation of a 4-pole lowpass filter with $f_{\\mathrm{c}}=100 \\mathrm{~Hz}$; resistor values for three filter characteristics are listed, calculated as described. A similar filter (6-pole Butterworth, $f_{\\mathrm{c}}=90 \\mathrm{~Hz}$) was used to create a precision $50-70 \\mathrm{~Hz}$ sinewave from a digital square wave that was referenced to a crystal oscillator; the output was amplified and used to drive an astronomical telescope.\n\n#### C. Highpass filters\n\nTo create a highpass filter, use the highpass configuration shown previously, i.e., with the $R$ 's and $C$ 's interchanged. For Butterworth filters, everything else remains unchanged (use the same values for $R, C$, and $K$). For the Bessel and Chebyshev filters, the $K$ values remain the same, but the normalizing factors $c_{\\mathrm{n}}$ must be inverted, i.e., for each section the new $c_{\\mathrm{n}}$ equals $1 /\\left(c_{\\mathrm{n}}\\right.$ listed in Table 6.2 on the preceding page).\n\nA bandpass filter can be created by cascading overlapping lowpass and highpass filters. A band-reject filter can be made by summing the outputs of nonoverlapping lowpass and highpass filters. However, such cascaded filters won't work well for high- $Q$ filters (extremely sharp bandpass filters) because there is great sensitivity to the component values in the individual (uncoupled) filter sections. In such cases, a high- $Q$ single-stage bandpass circuit (e.g., the VCVS bandpass circuit illustrated previously, or the state-variable and biquad filters in the next section) should be used instead. Even a single-stage 2-pole filter can produce a response with an extremely sharp peak. Information on such filter design is available in the standard references.\n\n#### D. Generalizing the Sallen-and-Key filter\n\nA design simplification in these Sallen-and-Key (or VCVS) filter circuits was the use of identical resistor and capacitor values within each 2-pole filter stage; but with that simplification came a set of oddball amplifier gains, as seen in the \"Gain\" column in Figure 6.29.\n\nOften you want to set the filter's gain, for example to prevent saturation, or so that you can change the filter characteristics (by a change of component value) without altering the gain. When you constrain the gain, however, you have to relax the component ratio constraint. You can learn all about this in a pair of nice Application Notes by James Karki from TI. The bottom line is that (just as with the preceding VCVS circuits) you can create any filter characteristic, using amplifier stages with your choice of gain, providing you are willing to adjust the resistor and capacitor ratios.\n\nFollowing Karki's analysis, we can write down summary formulas for the transition frequency $f_{\\mathrm{c}}$ and $Q$ of a 2-pole Sallen-Key section in which the component ratios can take on arbitrary values. Following the naming convention of Figure 6.28A, we define parameters $m, n$, and $\\tau$ (which will make the final results prettier):\n\n$$\nm=R_{1} / R_{2}, n=C_{1} / C_{2}, \\text { and } \\tau=R_{2} C_{2}\n$$\n\nWith these definitions, a 2-pole filter section has a transition frequency\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nf_{c}=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\tau \\sqrt{m n}} \\tag{6.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand a $Q$ (sharpness of transition, or peakiness) of\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nQ=\\frac{\\sqrt{m n}}{1+m+m n(1-K)} \\tag{6.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThese results alone are not enough for you to design higher-order filter cascades with canonical filter shapes (Chebyshev, etc.); for that you can consult the tables in Karki's App Note SLOA049B, or (for more fun) use a filter-design program. But these expressions demonstrate the point that you can trade off one set of constraints for another. Note particularly the attractive case of unity gain ( $K=1$ ), for which the gain elements can be wideband unitygain buffer ICs, or simple discrete-transistor followers.\n\nRevisiting the earlier constraint we used with the VCVS table (i.e., $R_{1}=R_{2}=R, C_{1}=C_{2}=C$ ), these formulas reduce to the simple forms\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nf_{c}=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi R C}, \\quad Q=\\frac{1}{3-K} \\tag{6.7}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nfor which the circuit goes unstable $(Q \\rightarrow \\infty)$ when $K=3$. Note that such a circuit, with the gain $K$ further constrained to unity (i.e., a follower, as we illustrated in Figure 6.16 to introduce the idea of an active filter) produces a pretty anemic filter, with a $Q$ of just one half.\n\n#### E. Summary\n\nVCVS filters minimize the number of components needed (two poles per op-amp) and offer the additional advantages of noninverting gain, low output impedance, small spread of component values, easy adjustability of gain, and the ability to operate at high gain or high $Q$. They suffer from sensitivity to component values and amplifier gain, and they don't lend themselves well to applications where a tunable filter of stable characteristics is needed. And they require op-amps whose bandwidth ( $f_{\\mathrm{T}}$, or GBW) is much higher than $f_{\\mathrm{c}}$ of the filter. Some of these drawbacks are nicely remedied in the state-variable and biquad filters.\n\nExercise 6.3. Design a 6-pole Chebyshev lowpass VCVS filter with a 0.5 dB passband ripple and 100 Hz cutoff frequency $f_{\\mathrm{c}}$. What is the attenuation at $1.5 f_{\\mathrm{c}}$ ?"

    "text": "In designing a lowpass or highpass filter using Table 6.2, first determine the required filter response. The Butterworth filter is suitable when a maximally flat passband is needed. The Chebyshev filter offers the fastest rolloff from passband to stopband, though with some passband ripple, while the Bessel filter provides the best phase characteristics, ensuring constant signal delay in the passband with a good step response. The frequency responses for all filter types are depicted in the accompanying graphs (Figure 6.30).\n\n#### Table 6.2 VCVS Lowpass Filters\n\n| $\\frac{\\mathscr{0}}{\\circ}$ | Butterworth K | Bessel |  | Chebyshev ( 0.5 dB ) |  | Chebyshev (2dB) |  |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n|  |  | $c$ | K | $c$ | K | $c$ | K |\n| 2 | 1.586 | 1.272 | 1.268 | 1.231 | 1.842 | 0.907 | 2.114 |\n| 4 | 1.152 | 1.432 | 1.084 | 0.597 | 1.582 | 0.471 | 1.924 |\n|  | 2.235 | 1.606 | 1.759 | 1.031 | 2.660 | 0.964 | 2.782 |\n| 6 | 1.068 | 1.607 | 1.040 | 0.396 | 1.537 | 0.316 | 1.891 |\n|  | 1.586 | 1.692 | 1.364 | 0.768 | 2.448 | 0.730 | 2.648 |\n|  | 2.483 | 1.908 | 2.023 | 1.011 | 2.846 | 0.983 | 2.904 |\n| 8 | 1.038 | 1.781 | 1.024 | 0.297 | 1.522 | 0.238 | 1.879 |\n|  | 1.337 | 1.835 | 1.213 | 0.599 | 2.379 | 0.572 | 2.605 |\n|  | 1.889 | 1.956 | 1.593 | 0.861 | 2.711 | 0.842 | 2.821 |\n|  | 2.610 | 2.192 | 2.184 | 1.006 | 2.913 | 0.990 | 2.946 |\n\nTo create an $n$-pole filter, where $n$ is an even integer, cascade $n / 2$ VCVS sections. Each section uses $R_{1}=R_{2}=R$ and $C_{1}=C_{2}=C$. Typically, $R$ is chosen within the range of 10 k to 100 k. The gain, $K$, for each stage is then set according to the table entries, with $n / 2$ entries corresponding to each section.\n\n#### A. Butterworth lowpass filters\n\nFor a Butterworth filter, all sections have the same $R$ and $C$ values, determined by $RC=1 / 2 \\pi f_{\\mathrm{c}}$, where $f_{\\mathrm{c}}$ is the desired -3 dB frequency of the filter. For a 6-pole lowpass Butterworth filter, for example, cascade three of the previously shown lowpass sections with gains of $1.07, 1.59$, and 2.48 (in that order to avoid dynamic range issues), and use identical $R$ and $C$ values to set the 3 dB point.\n\n#### B. Bessel and Chebyshev lowpass filters\n\nFor a Bessel or Chebyshev filter, the process is slightly more complex. Again, cascade several 2-pole VCVS filters with specified gains for each section. Each section uses $R_{1}=R_{2}=R$ and $C_{1}=C_{2}=C$. However, unlike the Butterworth filter, the $RC$ products for different sections are distinct and must be scaled by the normalizing factor $c_{\\mathrm{n}}$ (given for each section in Table 6.2) according to $RC=1 / 2 \\pi c_{\\mathrm{n}} f_{\\mathrm{c}}$. Here, $f_{\\mathrm{c}}$ is the -3 dB point for the Bessel filter, while for the Chebyshev filter, it defines the end of the passband. For example, a Chebyshev lowpass filter with 0.5 dB ripple and $f_{\\mathrm{c}}=100 \\mathrm{~Hz}$ will have a flat response within +0 dB to -0.5 dB from dc to 100 Hz, with 0.5 dB attenuation at 100 Hz and a rapid falloff for frequencies greater than 100 Hz. Values are provided for Chebyshev filters with 0.5 dB and 2.0 dB passband ripple, with the latter having a steeper transition into the stopband (Figure 6.30).\n\n#### C. Highpass filters\n\nTo create a highpass filter, use the highpass configuration shown previously, with the $R$ and $C$ values interchanged. For Butterworth filters, all other values remain the same. For Bessel and Chebyshev filters, the $K$ values remain the same, but the normalizing factors $c_{\\mathrm{n}}$ must be inverted, i.e., for each section, the new $c_{\\mathrm{n}}$ equals $1 /\\left(c_{\\mathrm{n}}\\right.$ listed in Table 6.2).\n\nA bandpass filter can be created by cascading overlapping lowpass and highpass filters, while a band-reject filter can be made by summing the outputs of nonoverlapping lowpass and highpass filters. However, such cascaded filters are not ideal for high- $Q$ filters due to sensitivity to component values in the individual sections. In such cases, a high- $Q$ single-stage bandpass circuit should be used instead. Information on such filter design is available in standard references.\n\n#### D. Generalizing the Sallen-and-Key filter\n\nA design simplification in these Sallen-and-Key (or VCVS) filter circuits is the use of identical resistor and capacitor values within each 2-pole filter stage, but this leads to a set of non-standard amplifier gains, as seen in the \"Gain\" column in Figure 6.29.\n\nOften, it is desirable to set the filter's gain, for example, to prevent saturation or to change the filter characteristics without altering the gain. When constraining the gain, the component ratio constraint must be relaxed. This is discussed in detail in Application Notes by James Karki from TI. The key point is that, similar to the previous VCVS circuits, any filter characteristic can be created using amplifier stages with the chosen gain, provided that the resistor and capacitor ratios are adjusted.\n\nFollowing Karki's analysis, summary formulas for the transition frequency $f_{\\mathrm{c}}$ and $Q$ of a 2-pole Sallen-Key section with arbitrary component ratios can be written. Using the naming convention of Figure 6.28A, parameters $m, n$, and $\\tau$ are defined:\n\n$$\nm=R_{1} / R_{2}, n=C_{1} / C_{2}, \\text { and } \\tau=R_{2} C_{2}\n$$\n\nWith these definitions, a 2-pole filter section has a transition frequency\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nf_{c}=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\tau \\sqrt{m n}} \\tag{6.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand a $Q$ (sharpness of transition, or peakiness) of\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nQ=\\frac{\\sqrt{m n}}{1+m+m n(1-K)} \\tag{6.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThese results demonstrate that one can trade off one set of constraints for another. Particularly interesting is the case of unity gain ( $K=1$ ), where the gain elements can be wideband unitygain buffer ICs or simple discrete-transistor followers.\n\nRevisiting the earlier constraint used with the VCVS table (i.e., $R_{1}=R_{2}=R, C_{1}=C_{2}=C$ ), these formulas reduce to the simple forms\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nf_{c}=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi R C}, \\quad Q=\\frac{1}{3-K} \\tag{6.7}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nfor which the circuit becomes unstable $(Q \\rightarrow \\infty)$ when $K=3$. Note that such a circuit, with the gain $K$ further constrained to unity (i.e., a follower, as illustrated in Figure 6.16), produces a rather weak filter, with a $Q$ of just one half.\n\n#### E. Summary\n\nVCVS filters minimize the number of components needed (two poles per op-amp) and offer additional advantages such as noninverting gain, low output impedance, small spread of component values, easy adjustability of gain, and the ability to operate at high gain or high $Q$. However, they are sensitive to component values and amplifier gain and are not well-suited for applications requiring a tunable filter of stable characteristics. They also require op-amps with a bandwidth much higher than $f_{\\mathrm{c}}$ of the filter.

{
    "text": "The filter depicted in Figure 6.31, while more intricate than VCVS circuits, is favored due to its enhanced stability and simple tuning. Known as a state-variable filter, it was initially offered as an IC by National (AF100 and AF150, now phased out) and is currently available from Burr-Brown/TI (UAF42) and Maxim (MAX274-5). Since it's a pre-fabricated module, all elements except $R_{\\mathrm{G}}, R_{\\mathrm{Q}}$, and the pair of $R_{\\mathrm{F}}$'s are integrated. One of its advantages is the capability of generating highpass, lowpass, and bandpass outputs from a single circuit; also, its frequency can be adjusted while keeping a constant $Q$ (or, alternatively, constant bandwidth) in the bandpass feature. Like with VCVS implementations, multiple stages can be linked to create higher-order filters. The frequency can be made adjustable with a dual potentiometer for the $R_{\\mathrm{F}}$ pair. However, due to the inverse $(1 / R)$ frequency tuning, you may favor a linear scheme like that depicted in Figure 6.34, where you could use either a dual potentiometer or a dual multiplying DAC (see §6.3.3C).\n\nManufacturers offer comprehensive design formulas and tables for using these convenient ICs, showing how to select external resistor values to create Butterworth, Bessel, and Chebyshev filters for a wide range of filter orders, with lowpass, highpass, bandpass, or bandreject responses. One of the nice features of these hybrid ICs is the integration of the capacitors into the module, ${ }^{31}$ so that only external resistors need to be added.\n\n[^8]Image Description: Figure 6.31 displays a state-variable active filter utilized as a bandpass filter. The center frequency is determined by RF, while RQ and RG establish the quality factor Q. The circuit is designed for precise bandpass filtering with minimal component sensitivity.\n\nFigure 6.31. State-variable active filter.\n\n#### A. Bandpass filters\n\nDespite its substantial number of components, the state-variable circuit is a suitable choice for sharp (high- $Q$ ) bandpass filters. It exhibits low component sensitivities, does not heavily tax op-amp bandwidth, and is simple to tune. For instance, in the circuit of Figure 6.31 used as a bandpass filter, the two resistors $R_{\\mathrm{F}}$ establish the center frequency, and $R_{\\mathrm{Q}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{G}}$ together define the $Q$ and band-center gain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& R_{\\mathrm{F}}=5.03 \\times 10^{7} / f_{0} \\quad \\text { ohms }  \\tag{6.8}\\\\\n& R_{\\mathrm{Q}}=10^{5} /(3.48 Q+G-1) \\quad \\text { ohms }  \\tag{6.9}\\\\\n& R_{\\mathrm{G}}=3.16 \\times 10^{4} Q / G \\quad \\text { ohms } \\tag{6.10}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThus, you could create a tunable-frequency, constant- $Q$ filter by employing a 2 -section variable resistor (potentiometer) for $R_{\\mathrm{F}}$. Alternatively, you could make $R_{\\mathrm{Q}}$ adjustable, resulting in a fixed-frequency, variable- $Q$ (and, unfortunately, variable-gain) filter.\n\n[^9]Image Description: Figure 6.32 illustrates a state-variable bandpass filter with independently adjustable gain and Q. It utilizes four op-amps and permits tuning of the bandwidth without affecting the midband gain. The center frequency is determined by the formula f0 = 1/(2πRFC). The circuit is designed to produce a bandpass output.\n\nFigure 6.32. A filter with independently adjustable gain and $Q$.\n\nExercise 6.4. Calculate resistor values in Figure 6.32 to create a bandpass filter with $f_{0}=1 \\mathrm{kHz}, Q=50$, and $G=10$.\n\nFigure 6.32 presents a useful variant of the state-variable bandpass filter. The downside is its use of four op-amps; the upside is the ability to adjust the bandwidth (i.e., $Q$ ) without impacting the midband gain. In fact, both $Q$ and gain are set with a single resistor each. The $Q$, gain, and center frequency are completely independent and are given by these straightforward equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nf_{0} & =1 / 2 \\pi R_{\\mathrm{F}} C  \\tag{6.11}\\\\\nQ & =R_{1} / R_{\\mathrm{Q}}  \\tag{6.12}\\\\\nG & =R_{1} / R_{\\mathrm{G}}  \\tag{6.13}\\\\\nR & \\approx 10 \\mathrm{k} \\quad \\text { (noncritical, matched) } . \\tag{6.14}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nBiquad filter\nA close relative of the state-variable filter is the so-called biquad filter, shown in Figure 6.33. This circuit also uses three op-amps and can be constructed from the statevariable ICs mentioned earlier. It has the interesting property that you can tune its frequency ( via $R_{\\mathrm{F}}$ ) while maintaining constant bandwidth (rather than constant $Q$ ). Here are the design equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nf_{0} & =1 / 2 \\pi R_{\\mathrm{F}} C,  \\tag{6.15}\\\\\n\\mathrm{BW} & =1 / 2 \\pi R_{\\mathrm{B}} C,  \\tag{6.16}\\\\\nG & =R_{\\mathrm{B}} / R_{\\mathrm{G}} . \\tag{6.17}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe $Q$ is given by $f_{0} / \\mathrm{BW}$ and equals $R_{\\mathrm{B}} / R_{\\mathrm{F}}$. As the center frequency is altered (via $R_{\\mathrm{F}}$ ), the $Q$ varies proportionately, keeping the bandwidth $f_{0} / Q$ constant.\n\n[^10]Image Description: Figure 6.33 depicts a biquad active filter with three operational amplifiers (A1, A2, A3). It employs resistors RF, RB, RG, and R, as well as capacitors C to achieve filtering. The center frequency is determined by RF and C, while the bandwidth is governed by RB. The filter maintains constant bandwidth as the center frequency varies. The output is taken from A3.\n\nFigure 6.33. Biquad active filter.\nWhen designing a biquad filter from scratch (rather than with an active-filter IC that already contains most of the parts), the general procedure goes something like this:\n(1) Choose an op-amp whose bandwidth $f_{\\mathrm{T}}$ is at least 10 to 20 times $G f_{0}$.\n(2) Pick a round-number capacitor value in the vicinity of $C=10 / f_{0} \\mu \\mathrm{~F}$, where $f_{0}$ is in Hz .\n(3) Use the desired center frequency to calculate the corresponding $R_{\\mathrm{F}}$ from eq'n 6.15 .\n(4) Use the desired bandwidth to calculate $R_{\\mathrm{B}}$ from eq'n 6.16.\n(5) Use the desired band-center gain to calculate $R_{\\mathrm{G}}$ from eq'n 6.17.\n\nYou may need to adjust the capacitor value if the resistor values become excessively large or small. For instance, in a high- $Q$ filter you may need to increase $C$ somewhat to prevent $R_{\\mathrm{B}}$ from becoming too large (or you can use the T-network trick described in $\\S 4.5 .5$ ). Note that $R_{\\mathrm{F}}, R_{\\mathrm{B}}$, and $R_{\\mathrm{G}}$ each act as op-amp loads, and so they ought not to become less than, say, 5k. When juggling component values, you may find it easier to satisfy requirement (1) by decreasing integrator gain (increase $R_{\\mathrm{F}}$ ) and simultaneously increasing the inverter-stage gain (increase the 10k feedback resistor).\n\nAs an example, suppose we want to create a filter with the same characteristics as in Exercise 6.4 on page 411. We would begin by provisionally choosing $C=0.01 \\mu \\mathrm{~F}$. Then we find $R_{\\mathrm{F}}=15.9 \\mathrm{k}\\left(f_{0}=1 \\mathrm{kHz}\\right)$ and $R_{\\mathrm{B}}=796 \\mathrm{k}(Q=50$; $\\mathrm{BW}=20 \\mathrm{~Hz})$. Finally, $R_{\\mathrm{G}}=79.6 \\mathrm{k}(G=10)$.\n\nExercise 6.5. Design a biquad bandpass filter with $f_{0}=60 \\mathrm{~Hz}$, $\\mathrm{BW}=1 \\mathrm{~Hz}$, and $G=100$.\n\n#### B. Higher-order bandpass filters\n\nSimilar to our previous lowpass and highpass filters, it is feasible to construct higher-order bandpass filters with approximately flat bandpass and steep transition to the stopband.\n\nThis is achieved by cascading several lower-order bandpass filters, the combination tailored to realize the desired filter type (Butterworth, Chebyshev, or whatever). As before, the Butterworth is \"maximally flat,\" whereas the Chebyshev sacrifices passband flatness for steepness of skirts. Both the VCVS and state-variable/biquad bandpass filters just considered are second-order (two pole). As you increase the filter sharpness by adding sections, you generally degrade the transient response and phase characteristics. The \"bandwidth\" of a bandpass filter is defined as the width between -3 dB points, except for equiripple filters, for which it is the width between frequencies at which the response falls out of the passband ripple channel.\n\nYou can find tables and design procedures for constructing complex filters in standard books on active filters, or in the datasheets for active-filter ICs. There are also some very nice filter-design programs, including shareware and\nfreeware versions that run on standard PCs and workstations.\n\n[^11]Image Description: Figure 6.34 displays a state-variable active filter with tunable frequency. It uses an operational amplifier with feedback resistors for filtering applications. The resistor 'k' is connected to ground, and the feedback resistor 'RF' is connected to the output of the op-amp.\n\nFigure 6.34. Tuning the frequency of the state-variable active filter. The op-amp buffer can be omitted if strict linearity with pot rotation is not needed.\n\n#### C. Electronic tunability\n\nSometimes you want electrical tunability (or switchability) so you can modify filter characteristics under the control of a signal (rather than having to turn the shaft on a variable resistor). An example might be an anti-alias lowpass filter that precedes a digitizer, in which the digitizing rate $f_{\\text {samp }}$ can be varied over some range. In that case the filter's $f_{\\mathrm{c}}$ must be set to follow the Nyquist frequency, $f_{\\mathrm{c}} \\approx f_{\\text {samp }} / 2$ (see $\\S \\S 6.2 .3 \\mathrm{C}, 6.3 .7 \\mathrm{~A}$, and 13.5.1B). In active-filter circuits like the VCVS you can do this, to a limited extent, by using analog switches to select among a small set of fixed resistors, each of which replaces one of the resistors in the filter. But the state variable filters provide a particularly convenient way to accomplish both switchability and continuous tuning, in one of several ways.\nDigital potentiometer As we discussed in §3.4.3E, you can obtain convenient ICs that contain a long string of matched resistors, with MOSFET switches to select the voltage-divider tap (by means of digital control ${ }^{32}$ ). So you can effectively alter the value of a programming resistor (e.g., $R_{\\mathrm{F}}$ in Figure 6.31) by preceding it with such a digital voltage divider (with a unity-gain follower, if needed to drive a low-value $R_{\\mathrm{F}}$ ); see Figure 6.34. By using a dual digital pot ${ }^{33}$ you could adjust the pair of $R_{\\mathrm{F}}$'s simultaneously, as would be needed to tune $f_{0}$ in that bandpass circuit. Digital pots come with as many as 1024 taps, and they come in both linear and log spacing, so you can achieve pretty accurate electronic control. Digital pots do not provide particularly accurate overall resistance values (typically $\\pm 20 \\%$ ), but they do guarantee accurate and stable control of divider ratio ( $1 \\%$ or better); i.e., the resistors that make up the string are well matched. That is why they work well in this application, in which only the ratio is important.\nMultiplying DAC Another way to effectively vary $R_{\\mathrm{F}}$ in the state-variable filter is to use a multiplying DAC (digital-to-analog converter), rather than a programmable divider, to scale the op-amp's voltage output. The MDAC outputs a voltage (or a current, in some models) that is proportional to the product of an analog input voltage and a digital input quantity. Compared with the digital pot, the MDAC method provides higher resolution (finer step size), faster response, and (often) wider voltage range.\nAnalog switch If only a discrete set of filter parameters is desired, you can just use a set of MOSFET analog multiplexers to select among a preselected group of programming resistors. Don't forget to consider the effects of finite $R_{\\mathrm{ON}}$.\nIntegrated switchability There are a few active-filter ICs that provide for programmable cutoff frequency, by a digital code you apply to a set of programming pins. You don't get continuous control, but you sure save a lot of work (and a lot of parts). In this class are the LTC1564 (8-pole elliptic lowpass), which lets you select the cutoff frequency from 10 kHz to 150 kHz in 10 kHz steps, and the MAX270 (dual 2-pole lowpass), which lets you select the cutoff frequency among 128 steps going from 1 kHz to 25 kHz .\n\n#### Electronic tuning alternatives: switched-capacitor filters and DSP\n\nThe above techniques achieve electronic tunability by presenting the continuous-time filter with an effectively variable set of programming resistors. When contemplating electronic tuning, it's wise to consider switched-capacitor filters and digital signal processing (DSP), in both of which electronic tunability is inherent. These are discussed later in this chapter (§6.3.6 and 6.3.7).\n\n#### D. Multiple-feedback active filter\n\nIn addition to the VCVS (Sallen-and-Key) and statevariable (or biquad) active-filter circuit configurations, there's another active-filter circuit that's commonly used. It's called the \"multiple-feedback\" (MFB) active filter (also known as the \"infinite-gain multiple-feedback\"), and is shown in Figure 6.35. Here the op-amp is configured as an integrator, rather than as a voltage amplifier (or follower). Designing an MFB filter is no more difficult than designing a VCVS, and you can find nice filter software that supports both configurations, for example at the very fine website of Uwe Beis (see §6.3.8). You can get nice MFB filter ICs, for example the LTC1563, an inexpensive (\\$2.30) linearfilter IC using the MFB configuration, convenient for making anti-alias filters, etc. The ' $1563-2$ version makes 4 - and 5-pole Butterworth filters, from 256 Hz to 360 kHz , and the -3 version makes Bessel filters. The ICs use internal 27 pF to 54 pF capacitors trimmed to $3 \\%$, combined with your external 7 k to $10 \\mathrm{M} 1 \\%$ resistors.

It uses resistors and capacitors to set the frequency response, and an op-amp to provide gain and feedback.\n\n$$\n\\left.\\begin{array}{l}\nR=20 \\mathrm{k} \\\\\nC=5.6 \\mathrm{nF}\n\\end{array}\\right\\} f_{\\mathrm{C}}=1 \\mathrm{kHz}\n$$\n\nFigure 6.35. Multiple-feedback (MFB) active filter, here shown in a 2-pole lowpass configuration.\n\nThis configuration has an interesting advantage compared with the VCVS: as you go to high frequencies, approaching the bandwidth $f_{\\mathrm{T}}$ of the op-amp, the degrading effects of rising op-amp output impedance are less severe. We ran SPICE simulations of VCVS and MFB 2pole Butterworth lowpass filters (Figures 6.36 and 6.37), which show this effect nicely. We set the cutoff frequency at 4 kHz , well below the LF411's unity-gain frequency $\\left(f_{\\mathrm{T}}\\right)$ of 4 MHz . In the VCVS configuration the op-amp's rising $Z_{\\text {out }}$ allows input signal to couple to the output through the first capacitor, a path that is absent in the MFB configuration. ${ }^{34}$ In many applications, however, this is not a serious concern. And the effect is reduced as the resistor values of the filter are increased, as shown in Figure 6.36. The VCVS configuration is alive and well, and remains popular. ${ }^{35}$\n\n[^13]Image Description: The graph in Figure 6.36 is a Bode plot that illustrates the gain (in decibels) versus frequency (in hertz) for a VCVS (voltage-controlled voltage source) 4 kHz low-pass 2-pole Butterworth filter using an LF411 op-amp with a unity-gain frequency of 4 MHz.

The convenience of this filter lies in its modular design, incorporating all elements except $R_{\\mathrm{G}}, R_{\\mathrm{Q}}$, and the two $R_{\\mathrm{F}}$ resistors. A key feature is its capability to produce highpass, lowpass, and bandpass outputs simultaneously from the same circuit. Additionally, its frequency can be adjusted while preserving a constant $Q$ (or, alternatively, constant bandwidth) in the bandpass mode.

A notable feature of these hybrid ICs is the integration of capacitors into the module, ${ }^{31}$ necessitating only the addition of external resistors.\n\n[^8]Image description for Figure 6.31:\nThe circuit depicted is a state-variable active filter utilized as a bandpass filter. The center frequency is determined by $R_{\\mathrm{F}}$, while $R_{\\mathrm{Q}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{G}}$ collectively set the quality factor Q. The circuit is engineered for precise bandpass filtering with minimal sensitivity to component variations.\n\nFigure 6.31. State-variable active filter.\n\n#### A. Bandpass filters\n\nDespite its numerous components, the state-variable circuit is an excellent choice for sharp (high- $Q$ ) bandpass filters. It exhibits low sensitivity to component variations, imposes modest demands on op-amp bandwidth, and is straightforward to tune. For instance, when the circuit in Figure 6.31 is employed as a bandpass filter, the two resistors $R_{\\mathrm{F}}$ establish the center frequency, while $R_{\\mathrm{Q}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{G}}$ together govern the $Q$ and band-center gain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& R_{\\mathrm{F}}=5.03 \\times 10^{7} / f_{0} \\quad \\text { ohms }  \\tag{6.8}\\\\\n& R_{\\mathrm{Q}}=10^{5} /(3.48 Q+G-1) \\quad \\text { ohms }  \\tag{6.9}\\\\\n& R_{\\mathrm{G}}=3.16 \\times 10^{4} Q / G \\quad \\text { ohms } \\tag{6.10}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nHence, a tunable-frequency, constant- $Q$ filter can be constructed by employing a 2-section variable resistor (potentiometer) for $R_{\\mathrm{F}}$. Alternatively, making $R_{\\mathrm{Q}}$ adjustable would result in a fixed-frequency, variable- $Q$ (and, unfortunately, variable-gain) filter.\nImage description for Figure 6.32:\nThe circuit is a state-variable bandpass filter with independently adjustable gain and Q. It utilizes four op-amps and permits bandwidth tuning without impacting the midband gain. The center frequency is determined by the formula $f_0 = 1/(2\\pi RFC)$. The circuit is designed to yield a bandpass output.\n\nFigure 6.32. A filter with independently adjustable gain and $Q$.\n\nExercise 6.4. Determine resistor values in Figure 6.32 to construct a bandpass filter with $f_{0}=1 \\mathrm{kHz}$, $Q=50$, and $G=10$.\n\nFigure 6.32 presents a valuable variant of the state-variable bandpass filter. The downside is its utilization of four op-amps; however, the upside is the ability to adjust the bandwidth (i.e., $Q$ ) without affecting the midband gain. In fact, both $Q$ and gain can be set independently with a single resistor each. The $Q$, gain, and center frequency are entirely independent and are defined by these straightforward equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nf_{0} & =1 / 2 \\pi R_{\\mathrm{F}} C  \\tag{6.11}\\\\\nQ & =R_{1} / R_{\\mathrm{Q}}  \\tag{6.12}\\\\\nG & =R_{1} / R_{\\mathrm{G}}  \\tag{6.13}\\\\\nR & \\approx 10 \\mathrm{k} \\quad \\text { (noncritical, matched) } . \\tag{6.14}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nBiquad filter\nA close relative of the state-variable filter is the so-called biquad filter, depicted in Figure 6.33. This circuit also employs three op-amps and can be assembled from the statevariable ICs mentioned earlier. It possesses the intriguing property that its frequency can be tuned (via $R_{\\mathrm{F}}$ ) while maintaining constant bandwidth (instead of constant $Q$ ). Here are the design equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nf_{0} & =1 / 2 \\pi R_{\\mathrm{F}} C,  \\tag{6.15}\\\\\n\\mathrm{BW} & =1 / 2 \\pi R_{\\mathrm{B}} C,  \\tag{6.16}\\\\\nG & =R_{\\mathrm{B}} / R_{\\mathrm{G}} . \\tag{6.17}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe $Q$ is calculated as $f_{0} / \\mathrm{BW}$ and equals $R_{\\mathrm{B}} / R_{\\mathrm{F}}$. As the center frequency is altered (via $R_{\\mathrm{F}}$ ), the $Q$ varies proportionally, preserving the bandwidth $f_{0} / Q$ constant.\nImage description for Figure 6.33:\nThe circuit is a biquad active filter that utilizes three operational amplifiers (A1, A2, A3). It employs resistors RF, RB, RG, and R, along with capacitors C, to achieve filtering. The center frequency is determined by RF and C, while the bandwidth is controlled by RB. The filter maintains a constant bandwidth as the center frequency varies. The output is derived from A3.\n\nFigure 6.33. Biquad active filter.\nWhen designing a biquad filter from the ground up (as opposed to utilizing an active-filter IC that already incorporates most of the components), the general procedure is as follows.\n(1) Select an op-amp with a bandwidth $f_{\\mathrm{T}}$ that is at least 10 to 20 times $G f_{0}$.\n(2) Choose a round-number capacitor value approximately in the range of $C=10 / f_{0} \\mu \\mathrm{~F}$, where $f_{0}$ is expressed in Hz .\n(3) Utilize the desired center frequency to calculate the corresponding $R_{\\mathrm{F}}$ using eq'n 6.15 .\n(4) Employ the desired bandwidth to calculate $R_{\\mathrm{B}}$ using eq'n 6.16.\n(5) Use the desired band-center gain to calculate $R_{\\mathrm{G}}$ using eq'n 6.17.\n\nIt may be necessary to modify the capacitor value if the resistor values become excessively large or small. For example, in a high- $Q$ filter, you may need to increase $C$ somewhat to prevent $R_{\\mathrm{B}}$ from becoming too large (or you can employ the T-network trick described in $\\S 4.5 .5$ ). Note that $R_{\\mathrm{F}}, R_{\\mathrm{B}}$, and $R_{\\mathrm{G}}$ each serve as op-amp loads and should not be less than, say, 5k. When manipulating component values, it may be easier to satisfy requirement (1) by decreasing integrator gain (increasing $R_{\\mathrm{F}}$ ) and concurrently increasing the inverter-stage gain (increasing the 10k feedback resistor).\n\nFor instance, suppose we aim to create a filter with the same specifications as in Exercise 6.4 on page 411. We would initially select $C=0.01 \\mu \\mathrm{~F}$. Then we find $R_{\\mathrm{F}}=15.9 \\mathrm{k}\\left(f_{0}=1 \\mathrm{kHz}\\right)$ and $R_{\\mathrm{B}}=796 \\mathrm{k}(Q=50$; $\\mathrm{BW}=20 \\mathrm{~Hz})$. Finally, $R_{\\mathrm{G}}=79.6 \\mathrm{k}(G=10)$.\n\nExercise 6.5. Design a biquad bandpass filter with $f_{0}=60 \\mathrm{~Hz}$, $\\mathrm{BW}=1 \\mathrm{~Hz}$, and $G=100$.\n\n#### B. Higher-order bandpass filters\n\nSimilar to our previous lowpass and highpass filters, it is feasible to construct higher-order bandpass filters with roughly flat bandpass and sharp transition to the stopband.\n\nThis is achieved by cascading multiple lower-order bandpass filters, the combination tailored to realize the desired filter type (Butterworth, Chebyshev, or another). As before, the Butterworth is \"maximally flat,\" whereas the Chebyshev牺牲通带平坦度以换取截止特性的陡峭度。前面讨论的VCVS和state-variable/biquad带通滤波器都是二阶的（双极点）。随着增加滤波器部分的尖锐度，通常会导致瞬态响应和相位特性的退化。带通滤波器的“带宽”定义为-3 dB点之间的宽度，对于等波纹滤波器，它是响应跌出通带纹波通道的频率宽度。\n\n您可以在关于有源滤波器的标准书籍中找到构建复"

Like VCVS implementations, multiple stages can be connected in series to create higher-order filters. The frequency can be made adjustable with a dual pot for the $R_{\\mathrm{F}}$ pair.

The center frequency is determined by RF, and RQ and RG establish the quality factor Q. The circuit is designed for precise bandpass filtering with minimal component sensitivity.\n\nFigure 6.31. State-variable active filter.\n\n#### A. Bandpass filters\n\nThe state-variable circuit, despite its numerous components, is a suitable choice for sharp (high- $Q$ ) bandpass filters. It has low component sensitivities, does not place high demands on op-amp bandwidth, and is straightforward to tune. For instance, in the circuit of Figure 6.31, which is used as a bandpass filter, the two resistors $R_{\\mathrm{F}}$ set the center frequency, and $R_{\\mathrm{Q}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{G}}$ together define the $Q$ and band-center gain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& R_{\\mathrm{F}}=5.03 \\times 10^{7} / f_{0} \\quad \\text { ohms }  \\tag{6.8}\\\\\n& R_{\\mathrm{Q}}=10^{5} /(3.48 Q+G-1) \\quad \\text { ohms }  \\tag{6.9}\\\\\n& R_{\\mathrm{G}}=3.16 \\times 10^{4} Q / G \\quad \\text { ohms } \\tag{6.10}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nHence, you could create a tunable-frequency, constant- $Q$ filter by using a 2 -section variable resistor (pot) for $R_{\\mathrm{F}}$. Alternatively, you could make $R_{\\mathrm{Q}}$ adjustable, resulting in a fixed-frequency, variable- $Q$ (and, unfortunately, variable-gain) filter.\nimage_name:Figure 6.32\ndescription:\n[\nname: R1, type: Resistor, value: R1, ports: {N1: Out(A1), N2: InN(A1)}\nname: RQ, type: Resistor, value: RQ, ports: {N1: InN(A1), N2: InP(A1)}\nname: RG, type: Resistor, value: RG, ports: {N1: InP(A1), N2: input}\nname: R, type: Resistor, value: R, ports: {N1: Out(A1), N2: InP(A2)}\nname: R, type: Resistor, value: R, ports: {N1: Out(A2), N2: InN(A4)}\nname: RF, type: Resistor, value: RF, ports: {N1: Out(A2), N2: InN(A3)}\nname: RF, type: Resistor, value: RF, ports: {N1: Out(A4), N2: InN(A4)}\nname: C, type: Capacitor, value: C, ports: {Np: Out(A3), Nn: InN(A3)}\nname: C, type: Capacitor, value: C, ports: {Np: Out(A4), Nn: InN(A4)}\nname: A1, type: OpAmp, value: A1, ports: {InP: InP(A1), InN: InN(A1), OutP: Out(A1), OutN: GND}\nname: A2, type: OpAmp, value: A2, ports: {InP: InP(A2), InN: GND, OutP: Out(A2), OutN: GND}\nname: A3, type: OpAmp, value: A3, ports: {InP: Out(A2), InN: InN(A3), OutP: Out(A3), OutN: GND}\nname: A4, type: OpAmp, value: A4, ports: {InP: Out(A2), InN: InN(A4), OutP: Out(A4), OutN: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:This circuit is a state-variable bandpass filter with independently adjustable gain and Q.

This circuit also utilizes three op-amps and can be constructed from the statevariable ICs mentioned earlier. It has the intriguing property that you can adjust its frequency ( via $R_{\\mathrm{F}}$ ) while maintaining constant bandwidth (instead of constant $Q$ ). Here are the design equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nf_{0} & =1 / 2 \\pi R_{\\mathrm{F}} C,  \\tag{6.15}\\\\\n\\mathrm{BW} & =1 / 2 \\pi R_{\\mathrm{B}} C,  \\tag{6.16}\\\\\nG & =R_{\\mathrm{B}} / R_{\\mathrm{G}} . \\tag{6.17}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe $Q$ is given by $f_{0} / \\mathrm{BW}$ and equals $R_{\\mathrm{B}} / R_{\\mathrm{F}}$.

It utilizes resistors RF, RB, RG, and R, and capacitors C to achieve filtering. The center frequency is determined by RF and C, while the bandwidth is controlled by RB. The filter maintains constant bandwidth as the center frequency varies. The output is taken from A3.\n\nFigure 6.33. Biquad active filter.\nWhen designing a biquad filter from scratch (rather than using an active-filter IC that already contains most of the components), the general procedure goes something like this.\n(1) Choose an op-amp whose bandwidth $f_{\\mathrm{T}}$ is at least 10 to 20 times $G f_{0}$.\n(2) Select a round-number capacitor value in the vicinity of $C=10 / f_{0} \\mu \\mathrm{~F}$, where $f_{0}$ is in Hz .\n(3) Utilize the desired center frequency to calculate the corresponding $R_{\\mathrm{F}}$ from eq'n 6.15 .\n(4) Employ the desired bandwidth to calculate $R_{\\mathrm{B}}$ from eq'n 6.16.\n(5) Use the desired band-center gain to calculate $R_{\\mathrm{G}}$ from eq'n 6.17.\n\nYou may need to adjust the capacitor value if the resistor values become excessively large or small. For example, in a high- $Q$ filter, you may need to increase $C$ somewhat to prevent $R_{\\mathrm{B}}$ from becoming too large (or you can use the T-network trick described in $\\S 4.5 .5$ ). Note that $R_{\\mathrm{F}}, R_{\\mathrm{B}}$, and $R_{\\mathrm{G}}$ each act as op-amp loads, and so they should not become less than, say, 5k. When juggling component values, you may find it easier to satisfy requirement (1) by decreasing integrator gain (increase $R_{\\mathrm{F}}$ ) and simultaneously increasing the inverter-stage gain (increase the 10k feedback resistor).\n\nAs an example, suppose we want to create a filter with the same characteristics as in Exercise 6.4 on page 411. We would begin by provisionally choosing $C=0.01 \\mu \\mathrm{~F}$. Then we find $R_{\\mathrm{F}}=15.9 \\mathrm{k}\\left(f_{0}=1 \\mathrm{kHz}\\right)$ and $R_{\\mathrm{B}}=796 \\mathrm{k}(Q=50$; $\\mathrm{BW}=20 \\mathrm{~Hz})$. Finally, $R_{\\mathrm{G}}=79.6 \\mathrm{k}(G=10)$.\n\nExercise 6.5. Design a biquad bandpass filter with $f_{0}=60 \\mathrm{~Hz}$, $\\mathrm{BW}=1 \\mathrm{~Hz}$, and $G=100$.\n\n#### B. Higher-order bandpass filters\n\nSimilar to our previous lowpass and highpass filters, it is feasible to construct higher-order bandpass filters with approximately flat bandpass and steep transition to the stopband.\n\nThis is achieved by cascading several lower-order bandpass filters, the combination tailored to achieve the desired filter type (Butterworth, Chebyshev, or others). As before, the Butterworth is \"maximally flat,\" whereas the Chebyshev compromises passband flatness for steeper skirts. Both the VCVS and state-variable/biquad bandpass filters discussed earlier are second-order (two pole). As you enhance the filter sharpness by adding sections, you typically degrade the transient response and phase characteristics. The \"bandwidth\" of a bandpass filter is defined as the width between -3 dB points, except for equiripple filters, for which it is the width between frequencies at which the response falls out of the passband ripple channel.\n\nYou can find tables and design procedures for constructing complex filters in standard books on active filters, or in the datasheets for active-filter ICs. There are also some very useful filter-design programs, including shareware and\nfreeware versions that run on standard PCs and workstations.\nimage_name:Figure 6.34\ndescription:\n[\nname: k, type: Resistor, value: k, ports: {N1: GND, N2: Node1}\nname: RF, type: Resistor, value: RF, ports: {N1: Node2, N2: Node3}\nname: OpAmp, type: OpAmp, ports: {InP: Node1, InN: Node2, OutP: Node3}\n]\nextrainfo:This circuit diagram is a state-variable active filter with tunable frequency. It employs an operational amplifier with feedback resistors for filtering applications. The resistor 'k' is connected to ground, and the feedback resistor 'RF' is connected to the output of the op-amp.\n\nFigure 6.34. Tuning the frequency of the state-variable active filter. The op-amp buffer can be omitted if strict linearity with pot rotation is not needed.\n\n#### C. Electronic tunability\n\nSometimes, electrical tunability (or switchability) is desired to modify filter characteristics under the control of a signal (instead of manually adjusting a variable resistor). An example might be an anti-alias lowpass filter preceding a digitizer, where the digitizing rate $f_{\\text {samp }}$ can be varied over a certain range. In that case, the filter's $f_{\\mathrm{c}}$ must be set to follow the Nyquist frequency, $f_{\\mathrm{c}} \\approx f_{\\text {samp }} / 2$ (refer to $\\S \\S 6.2 .3 \\mathrm{C}, 6.3 .7 \\mathrm{~A}$, and 13.5.1B). In active-filter circuits like the VCVS, this can be achieved, to a limited extent, by using analog switches to select among a small set of fixed resistors, each of which replaces one of the resistors in the filter. However, the state variable filters offer a particularly convenient method to accomplish both switchability and continuous tuning, in one of several ways.\nDigital potentiometer As discussed in §3.4.3E, you can obtain convenient ICs that contain a long string of matched resistors, with MOSFET switches to select the voltage-divider tap (by means of digital control ${ }^{32}$ ). Therefore, you can effectively modify the value of a programming resistor (e.g., $R_{\\mathrm{F}}$ in Figure 6.31) by preceding it with such a digital voltage divider (with a unity-gain follower, if needed to drive a low-value $R_{\\mathrm{F}}$ ); refer to Figure 6.34. By using a dual digital pot ${ }^{33}$, you could adjust the pair of $R_{\\mathrm{F}}$ 's simultaneously, as required to tune $f_{0}$ in that bandpass circuit. Digital pots come with as many as 1024 taps, and they come in both linear and log spacing,"

Initially available as ICs from National (the AF100 and AF150, now obsolete), it can now be sourced from Burr-Brown/TI (the UAF42) and Maxim (MAX274-5). With the exception of $R_{\\mathrm{G}}, R_{\\mathrm{Q}}$, and the two $R_{\\mathrm{F}}$ resistors, all components are integrated into the module. The filter offers simultaneous highpass, lowpass, and bandpass outputs, and its frequency can be adjusted without altering the $Q$ (or bandwidth) in the bandpass mode. Similar to VCVS circuits, it can be cascaded for higher-order filtering. Frequency tuning can be achieved with a dual potentiometer for the $R_{\\mathrm{F}}$ pair. However, due to the inverse $(1 / R)$ frequency tuning, a linear scheme as shown in Figure 6.34 may be preferred, allowing for the use of a dual potentiometer or a dual multiplying DAC.\n\nManufacturers provide extensive design formulas and tables for using these ICs, demonstrating how to select external resistor values to create Butterworth, Bessel, and Chebyshev filters across a variety of filter orders and response types. One of the key features of these hybrid ICs is the integration of capacitors, requiring only external resistors to be added.\n\nThe state-variable circuit, depicted in Figure 6.31, is an excellent choice for sharp (high-$Q$) bandpass filters due to its low component sensitivities and ease of tuning. In this circuit, the two resistors $R_{\\mathrm{F}}$ determine the center frequency, while $R_{\\mathrm{Q}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{G}}$ collectively set the $Q$ and band-center gain. This design allows for a tunable-frequency, constant-$Q$ filter using a 2-section variable resistor for $R_{\\mathrm{F}}$, or an adjustable $R_{\\mathrm{Q}}$ for a fixed-frequency, variable-$Q$ (and variable-gain) filter.\n\nFigure 6.32 presents a variant of the state-variable bandpass filter that independently sets gain and $Q$. Although it uses four op-amps, it allows for bandwidth tuning without affecting midband gain. The $Q$, gain, and center frequency are independently controlled by simple equations involving $R_{\\mathrm{F}}, R_{\\mathrm{B}}, R_{\\mathrm{G}},$ and $R_{\\mathrm{1}}$.\n\nThe biquad filter, as shown in Figure 6.33, is a close relative of the state-variable filter. It also uses three op-amps and maintains constant bandwidth as the center frequency varies. Design equations are provided for calculating the center frequency, bandwidth, and gain.\n\nFor higher-order bandpass filters, cascading lower-order filters is common, with the combination tailored to achieve the desired filter type, such as Butterworth or Chebyshev. As with other filters, Butterworth is known for its \"maximally flat\" response, while Chebyshev sacrifices passband flatness for steeper skirts.\n\nElectronic tunability can be achieved through digital potentiometers, multiplying DACs, and analog switches, allowing for dynamic changes in filter characteristics. Integrated switchability is also available in some active-filter ICs, offering programmable cutoff frequencies.\n\nThe multiple-feedback (MFB) active filter, shown in Figure 6.35, is another commonly used configuration. It offers advantages over the VCVS at high frequencies due to reduced effects of the op-amp's rising output impedance. Designing an MFB filter is as straightforward as designing a VCVS, and various filter software and ICs support this configuration.\n\nFigures 6.36 and 6.37 illustrate the effects of rising op-amp output impedance on the VCVS and MFB configurations. While the MFB configuration is less affected, the VCVS can be improved with a buffered output. Both configurations remain popular, with the VCVS being widely used due to its simplicity and effectiveness."

    "text": "The passive $R C$ network depicted in Figure 6.38 exhibits infinite attenuation at a frequency $f_{c}=1 / 2 \\pi R C$. This infinite attenuation is atypical for $R C$ filters; this particular filter operates by effectively combining two signals that are phase-shifted by $180^{\\circ}$ at the cutoff frequency. Achieving a good null at $f_{\\mathrm{c}}$ necessitates precise component matching. This configuration is known as a twin-T and is useful for eliminating interfering signals, such as 60 Hz powerline interference. However, it shares the \"soft\" cutoff characteristics of all passive $R C$ networks, except near $f_{\\mathrm{c}}$, where its response drops sharply. For instance, a twin-T driven by an ideal voltage source shows a 10 dB attenuation at twice (or half) the notch frequency and 3 dB at four times (or one-fourth) the notch frequency. One method to enhance its notch characteristic is to \"activate\" it similarly to a Sallen-and-Key filter (Figure 6.39). While this approach seems promising in theory, it often falls short in practice due to the difficulty in maintaining a good filter null. As the filter notch becomes sharper (with increased bootstrap gain), the null depth decreases.\n\nimage_name:Figure 6.38.

Bootstrapped twin-T.\nTwin-T filters are available as prefab modules, ranging from 1 Hz to 50 kHz, with notch depths of approximately 60 dB (though performance may degrade at extreme temperatures). They can be easily constructed from components, but for a deep and stable notch, resistors and capacitors with good stability and low temperature coefficients should be used, with one component being trimmable.\n\nWhile effective as a fixed-frequency notch, the twin-T is challenging to make tunable, as three resistors must be simultaneously adjusted while maintaining a constant ratio. However, the simple $R C$ circuit shown in Figure 6.40A, which mimics the twin-T, can be adjusted over a wide frequency range (at least two octaves) using a single potentiometer. Like the twin-T (and most active filters), it requires some component matching; specifically, the three capacitors must be identical, and the fixed resistor must be exactly six times the bottom (adjustable) resistor.

    "text": "The passive $R C$ network depicted in Figure 6.38 exhibits infinite attenuation at a frequency $f_{c}=1 / 2 \\pi R C$. This infinite attenuation is not typical for $R C$ filters; it functions by effectively combining two signals that are phase-shifted by $180^{\\circ}$ at the cutoff frequency. Achieving a good null at $f_{\\mathrm{c}}$ necessitates precise component matching. This configuration is known as a twin-T and is useful for eliminating interfering signals, such as 60 Hz powerline noise. However, it shares the \"soft\" cutoff characteristics of all passive $R C$ networks, except near $f_{\\mathrm{c}}$, where its response drops sharply. For instance, a twin-T powered by an ideal voltage source shows a 10 dB attenuation at twice (or half) the notch frequency and 3 dB at four times (or one-fourth) the notch frequency. One method to enhance its notch performance is to \"activate\" it similarly to a Sallen-and-Key filter (Figure 6.39). While this approach seems promising in theory, it often falls short in practice due to the difficulty in maintaining a good filter null. As the filter notch becomes sharper (with increased bootstrap gain), the null depth decreases.\n\nimage_name:Figure 6.38.

It depicts the phase shift introduced by the filter as a function of frequency.\n\nAxes Labels and Units:\n- **Horizontal Axis (x-axis):** Represents the normalized frequency, labeled as \\(2\\pi fRC\\), where \\(f\\) is frequency, \\(R\\) is resistance, and \\(C\\) is capacitance. The scale is logarithmic, ranging from 0.01 to 100.\n- **Vertical Axis (y-axis):** Represents phase shift in degrees, spanning from -180° to 180°. The scale is linear.\n\nOverall Behavior and Trends:\n- The graph displays two phase response curves:\n- The upper curve depicts the phase shift when \\(\\Delta \\theta = 2 \\tan^{-1}(1/\\omega RC)\\), signifying a leading phase shift.\n- The lower curve illustrates the phase shift when \\(\\Delta \\theta = -2 \\tan^{-1}(\\omega RC)\\), indicating a lagging phase shift.\n- Both curves commence at 0° phase shift at low frequencies and approach asymptotic limits of ±180° at high frequencies.\n\nKey Features and Technical Details:\n- **Leading Phase Shift Curve:**\n- Starts at 0° and rises towards 180° as frequency increases.\n- The transition region where phase shift changes rapidly is around \\(2\\pi fRC = 1\\).\n- **Lagging Phase Shift Curve:**\n- Starts at 0° and declines towards -180° as frequency increases.\n- Similarly, the transition region occurs around \\(2\\pi fRC = 1\\).\n\nAnnotations and Specific Data Points:\n- The graph includes annotations highlighting the leading and lagging nature of the phase shifts.\n- There is a note stating that swapping \\(R\\) and \\(C\\) will change the behavior from leading to lagging phase shift and vice versa.\n- The mathematical expressions \\(\\Delta \\theta = 2 \\tan^{-1}(1/\\omega RC)\\) and \\(\\Delta \\theta = -2 \\tan^{-1}(\\omega RC)\\) are provided to describe the phase shift for leading and lagging conditions, respectively.\n\nThis graph effectively showcases the phase behavior of an allpass filter, illustrating how the phase shift varies with frequency and the effect of component interchange on the phase response.\n\nFigure 6.41. Allpass filter, also known as a delay equalizer or phase equalizer.\n\nFigure 6.41 illustrates the basic circuit configuration. Intuitively, it's clear that the circuit acts like an inverter at low frequencies (where no signal is coupled to the noninverting input) and a follower at high frequencies (refer to the optional inverter in §4.3.1A). By deriving a few equations, you can verify that the circuit behaves as depicted in the figure. Swapping $R$ and $C$ results in a similar characteristic, but with lagging (instead of leading) phase shifts between the extremes of inverting and following. The phase shift can be adjusted by making $R$ variable; however, note that a small value of $R$ reduces the circuit's input impedance at high frequencies (where the reactance of $C$ approaches zero).\n\nFigure 6.42 presents a variant that extends the phase shift range to a full $360^{\\circ}$. The drawback is that you need to adjust two components simultaneously (e.g., the pair of equal-value resistors) to alter its tuning. This can be efficiently managed by using a digital dual potentiometer (an \"EEpot\") as described in §3.4.3E."

Drawbacks of Switched-Capacitor Filters\n\nDespite their advantages, switched-capacitor filters have several drawbacks related to the periodic clocking signal. Clock feedthrough introduces an output signal at the clock frequency, which can usually be filtered out with a simple RC filter. Aliasing occurs when input signal components near the clock frequency are \"folded\" into the passband, which requires careful consideration of the input signal and possibly additional filtering. Additionally, switched-capacitor filters generally have a reduced signal dynamic range due to incomplete cancellation of MOSFET switch charge injection, manifesting as a raised noise floor within the bandpass.\n\nTo mitigate these issues, Linear Technology developed the LTC1062 \"DC accurate lowpass filter,\" which places the filter outside the dc path, allowing low-frequency signal components to couple passively to the output while the filter only engages at higher frequencies. This results in zero dc error and switched-capacitor-type noise only near the rolloff frequency.\n\nSwitched-capacitor filter ICs from manufacturers like Linear Technology, TI, and Maxim are widely available, typically allowing the cutoff or band center frequency to be set anywhere from dc to tens of kilohertz, as determined by the clock frequency. The characteristic frequency is usually a fixed multiple of the clock, such as 50 f_clk or 100 f_clk. Most switched-capacitor filter ICs are designed for lowpass, bandpass, or notch (band-stop) applications, though universal types can be configured as highpass filters. However, clock feedthrough and discrete output waveform quantization effects can be particularly problematic in highpass filters, as they occur within the signal band."

Manufacturer datasheets (and software) facilitate filter design with these universal filter ICs. Dedicated filters, on the other hand, require no design effort - simply connect them, and they are ready to use.\n\n#### D. Drawbacks of Switched-Capacitor Filters\n\nDespite their advantages, switched-capacitor filters exhibit three drawbacks, all related to the presence of the periodic clocking signal. Firstly, there is clock feedthrough, which refers to the presence of an output signal (typically around 10 mV to 25 mV) at the clock frequency, regardless of the input signal. Usually, this is not a concern as it is well outside the signal band of interest. However, if clock feedthrough is problematic, a simple RC filter at the output can usually eliminate it.\n\nThe second issue is more nuanced: if the input signal contains frequency components close to the clock frequency, they will be \"aliased\" into the passband. To be precise, any input signal energy at a frequency differing from the clock frequency by an amount corresponding to a frequency within the passband will appear (unattenuated!) in the passband. For example, if you use a MAX7400 (dedicated 8-pole elliptic lowpass) as a 1 kHz lowpass filter (i.e., set \\(f_{\\text{clock}} = 100 \\text{kHz}\\)), any input signal energy in the range of 99-101 kHz will appear in the output band of 0-1 kHz. No filter at the output can remove it! It is crucial to ensure that the input signal does not contain energy near the clock frequency. If this is not naturally the case, you can usually employ a simple RC filter, as the clock frequency is typically quite distant from the passband. Utilizing filter ICs with a high clock-to-corner frequency ratio (e.g., 100:1 instead of 25:1 or 50:1) simplifies input anti-alias filter design. Some filter ICs with a 1000:1 clock ratio are available from Mixed Signal Integration, such as their MSHN series. A high clock ratio also mitigates the \"staircase\" output waveform from these filters.\n\nThe third drawback of switched-capacitor filters is a general reduction in signal dynamic range (an increase in the \"noise floor\") due to incomplete cancellation of MOSFET switch charge injection (refer to §3.4.2E). This manifests as a heightened noise floor within the bandpass. Typical filter ICs have a claimed dynamic range of 80-90 dB. In addition to the reduced dynamic range (compared to continuous-time filters), switched-capacitor filters tend to exhibit more distortion than expected, particularly for output signals near the supply rails.\n\nLike any linear circuit, switched-capacitor filters (and their op-amp analogs) are susceptible to amplifier errors such as input offset voltage and \\(1/f\\) low-frequency noise. These can be problematic if, for example, you wish to lowpass filter a low-level signal without introducing errors or fluctuations in its average DC value. Linear Technology has addressed this issue with the LTC1062 \"DC accurate lowpass filter\" (or the MAX280, with improved offset voltage). Figure 6.46 illustrates its usage. The basic idea is to position the filter outside the DC path, allowing low-frequency signal components to passively couple to the output; the filter only engages with the signal at higher frequencies, where it rolls off the response by shunting the signal to ground. This results in zero DC error and switched-capacitor-type noise only in the vicinity of the rolloff (Figure 6.47).

When constructing an analog filter circuit from operational amplifiers, it is essential to obtain pairs of stable capacitors (excluding electrolytic, tantalum, or high-\\(\\kappa\\) ceramic types), with a matching tolerance better than 1% for optimal performance. Additionally, a substantial number of connections are required, as each filter circuit typically employs at least three operational amplifiers and six resistors per 2-pole section. An alternative approach is to utilize a filter integrated circuit (IC), where the manufacturer handles the integration of matched capacitors (e.g., 1000 pF with ±0.5% tolerance) within the IC. Semiconductor manufacturers have addressed these challenges, albeit at a cost: the UAF42 and MAX274 \"Universal Active Filter\" ICs, which utilize hybrid or laser-trimming technology, are priced around $8 to $16 each. These \"continuous-time\" filters are not readily tunable.\n\n#### A. Switched-Capacitor Integrator\n\nAn alternative method for implementing the integrators required in state-variable or biquad filter configurations involves using MOSFET analog switches, clocked by an externally applied square wave at a high frequency (commonly 100 times greater than the analog signals of interest). As depicted in Figure 6.43, the peculiar triangular object in the figure is a digital inverter, which inverts the square wave, ensuring that the two MOS switches are closed during opposite halves of the wave.\n\nAnalyzing the circuit is straightforward: when \\(S_1\\) is closed, \\(C_1\\) charges to \\(V_{\\text{in}}\\), retaining a charge of \\(C_1 V_{\\text{in}}\\). During the alternate half-cycle, \\(C_1\\) discharges into the virtual ground, transferring its charge to \\(C_2\\). Consequently, the voltage across \\(C_2\\) changes by an amount \\(\\Delta V = \\Delta Q / C_2 = V_{\\text{in}} C_1 / C_2\\). Notably, the output voltage change during each cycle of the rapid square wave is proportional to \\(V_{\\text{in}}\\) (assuming \\(V_{\\text{in}}\\) changes minimally during one cycle of the square wave), indicating that the circuit functions as an integrator. It is evident that the integrators adhere to the equations presented in the figure.\n\nExercise 6.6. Derive the equations depicted in Figure 6.43.\nExercise 6.7. Another perspective on the switched-capacitor integrator involves calculating the average current flowing through \\(S_2\\) into the virtual ground. You should discover that it is proportional to \\(V_{\\text{in}}\\). Hence, the combination of \\(S_1\\), \\(C_1\\), and \\(S_2\\) acts like a resistor, forming a classic integrator. Determine the value of this equivalent resistance in terms of \\(f_0\\) and \\(C_1\\). Utilize this to derive the equation in the figure: \\(V_{\\text{out}} = f_0 \\left( \\frac{C_1}{C_2} \\right) \\int V_{\\text{in}} dt\\).\n\n#### B. Advantages of Switched-Capacitor Filters\n\nTwo primary advantages arise from using switched capacitors instead of conventional integrators. First, as previously suggested, it can be more cost-effective to implement on silicon: the integrator gain depends solely on the ratio of two capacitors, not on their absolute values. Generally, it is straightforward to fabricate a matched pair of components on silicon, but creating a component (resistor or capacitor) with precise value and high stability is challenging. Consequently, monolithic switched-capacitor filter ICs are affordable – TI's universal switched-capacitor filter (the MF10) is priced at $3.50 (in contrast to $16 for the conventional UAF42) and offers two filters in a single package.\n\nThe second advantage of switched-capacitor filters is the capability to adjust the filter's characteristic frequency (e.g., the center frequency of a bandpass filter or the -3 dB point of a lowpass filter) simply by altering the frequency of the square-wave (\"clock\") input. This is because the characteristic frequency of a state-variable or biquad filter is directly proportional to (and dependent only on) the integrator gain.\n\n#### C. Switched-Capacitor Filter Configurations\n\nSwitched-capacitor filters are available in both dedicated and \"universal\" configurations. Dedicated filters are prewired with on-chip components to form specific types of lowpass filters (e.g., Butterworth, Bessel, Elliptic), while universal filters have various intermediate inputs and outputs accessible, allowing external components to be connected for versatile filter designs. The trade-off for universality is a larger IC package and the need for external resistors. For instance, LTC's self-contained LTC1069-6 8-pole elliptic lowpass filter is housed in an 8-pin package (approximately $9) and does not require external components, whereas their LTC1164 quad 2-pole universal filter necessitates 12 external resistors for a comparable filter and comes in a 24-pin package (around $15). Figure 6.44 demonstrates the ease of using dedicated filters. Refer to Section 7.1.5 for an elegant and simple sine wave generator utilizing a tracking switched-capacitor filter operating on a square wave at a fraction of the clock frequency (Figures 7.18 and 7.19).\n\nBoth dedicated and universal switched-capacitor filters employ the 2-pole state-variable configuration as the fundamental building block, with switched-capacitor integrators substituting the resistor-fed op-amp integrators of the classic continuous-time state-variable active filter; see Figure 6.45. Universal filter ICs come with one to four such sections, which can be cascaded to form higher-order filters (with each section representing a quadratic term in the factored filter equation) or used independently for multiple simultaneous channels (which must share a common clocking input). The manufacturer's datasheets (and possibly software) facilitate filter design with these universal filter ICs. No design effort is required for dedicated filters – simply connect them, and they are ready to use.\n\n#### D. Drawbacks of Switched-Capacitor Filters\n\nSwitched-capacitor filters exhibit three significant drawbacks, all interconnected and stemming from the presence of the periodic clocking signal. First, there is clock feedthrough, which manifests as an output signal (typically around 10 mV to 25 mV) at the clock frequency, independent of the input signal. Generally, this is not a concern, as it is well outside the signal band of interest. If clock feedthrough becomes an issue, a simple RC filter at the output can usually eliminate it.\n\nThe second problem is more nuanced: if the input signal contains frequency components close to the clock frequency, they will be \"aliased\" into the passband. Specifically, any input signal energy at a frequency differing from the clock frequency by an amount corresponding to a frequency within the passband will appear (unattenuated) in the passband. For instance, if a MAX7400 (dedicated 8-pole elliptic lowpass) is used as a 1 kHz lowpass filter (i.e., \\(f_{\\text{clock}} = 100 \\text{kHz}\\)), any input signal energy in the range of 99-101 kHz will be present in the output band of dc to 1 kHz. No filter at the output can remove it! It is crucial to ensure that the input signal lacks energy near the clock frequency. If this is not naturally the case, a simple RC filter can be employed, as the clock frequency is typically distant from the passband. The use of filter ICs with a high clock-to-corner frequency ratio (e.g., 100:1 instead of 25:1 or 50:1) simplifies input anti-alias filter design. Some filter ICs with 1000:1 clock ratios are available from Mixed Signal Integration, such as their MSHN series. A high clock ratio also mitigates the \"staircase\" output waveform from these filters.\n\nThe third disadvantage of switched-capacitor filters is a general decrease in signal dynamic range (an increase in the \"noise floor\") due to incomplete cancellation of MOSFET switch charge injection (refer to Section 3.4.2E). This manifests as a heightened noise floor within the bandpass. Typical filter ICs advertise dynamic ranges of 80-90 dB. In addition to the reduced dynamic range (compared to continuous-time filters), switched-capacitor filters tend to exhibit more distortion than expected, particularly for output signals near the supply rails.\n\nLike any linear circuit, switched-capacitor filters (and their op-amp equivalents) are susceptible to amplifier errors such as input offset voltage and \\(1/f\\) low-frequency noise. These can be problematic if, for example, you wish to lowpass filter a low-level signal without introducing errors or fluctuations in its average dc value. Linear Technology has devised a clever solution with the LTC1062 \"DC accurate lowpass filter\" (or the MAX280, with enhanced offset voltage). Figure 6.46 illustrates its usage. The fundamental concept is to position the filter outside the dc path, allowing low-frequency signal components to couple passively to the output; the filter only engages with the signal line at higher frequencies, where it rolls off the response by shunting the signal to ground. This approach yields zero dc error and switched-capacitor-type noise only in the vicinity of the rolloff (Figure 6.47). You can cascade a pair of these filters to create higher-order filters or a tunable sharp bandpass filter. The datasheet also demonstrates how to construct a tunable notch filter.\n\nSwitched-capacitor filter ICs are readily available from manufacturers such as Linear Technology, TI, and Maxim. Typically, you can set the cutoff (or band center) within a range of dc to a few tens of kilohertz, as determined by the clock frequency. The characteristic frequency is a fixed multiple of the clock, usually \\(50 f_{\\text{clk}}\\) or \\(100 f_{\\text{clk}}\\). Most switched-capacitor filter ICs are designed for lowpass, bandpass, or notch (band-stop) applications, although universal types can be configured as highpass filters. Note that clock feedthrough and discrete (clock-frequency) output waveform quantization effects are particularly problematic in the latter case, as they occur within the signal band."
