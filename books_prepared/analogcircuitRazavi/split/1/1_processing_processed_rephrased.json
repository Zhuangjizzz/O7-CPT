Why are they necessary?\n\nThe block diagram in Figure 1.1(a) provides a simplified view of a cellphone's operation during a call, showing both the transmission (TX) and reception (RX) paths.\n\n1. **Main Components:**\n- **Microphone:** Converts the speaker's voice into an electrical signal.\n- **Transmitter (TX) Block:** An unspecified processing block (indicated by a question mark) that processes the electrical signal from the microphone before sending it to the antenna.\n- **Antenna (TX):** Transmits the processed electrical signal as electromagnetic waves.\n- **Antenna (RX):** Receives electromagnetic waves from the other end and converts them back to an electrical signal.\n- **Receiver (RX) Block:** Another unspecified processing block that processes the received electrical signal before sending it to the speaker.\n- **Speaker:** Converts the processed electrical signal back into sound.\n\n2. **Flow of Information or Control:**\n- The flow begins at the microphone, where the voice is converted to an electrical signal.

The arrangement of components ensures that voice signals are efficiently converted to and from electromagnetic waves, allowing for wireless communication over distances.\n\nFigure 1.1 (b) presents a simplified representation of the transmit and receive paths in a cellphone communication system. This version omits the detailed processing blocks seen in more complex systems, focusing instead on the fundamental components necessary for basic operation.\n\n1. **Main Components:**\n- **Microphone:** Captures the user's voice and converts it into an electrical signal. It is the starting point of the transmission path.\n- **Antenna (Transmitter):** Converts the electrical signal from the microphone into electromagnetic waves, which are then transmitted through the air.\n- **Antenna (Receiver):** Receives electromagnetic waves from the transmitting antenna. It converts the electromagnetic waves back into an electrical signal.\n- **Speaker:** Takes the electrical signal from the receiving antenna and converts it back into sound, allowing the listener to hear the transmitted voice.\n\n2. **Flow of Information or Control:**\n- The flow begins at the microphone, where the voice is converted to an electrical signal. This signal is sent to the transmitting antenna, which radiates it as electromagnetic waves.\n- These waves travel through the air to the receiving antenna, which captures them and converts them back into an electrical signal.\n- The signal is then directed to the speaker, which converts it into sound.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n- The diagram uses arrows to indicate the direction of signal flow, moving from the microphone to the transmitting antenna, through the air to the receiving antenna, and finally to the speaker.\n- The absence of any processing blocks between these components highlights the simplicity of the system, focusing purely on the conversion and transmission of signals.\n\n4. **Overall System Function:**\n- The primary function of this simplified system is to transmit voice from one point to another using electromagnetic waves. By illustrating only the essential components (microphone, antennas, and speaker), the diagram emphasizes the basic process of voice capture, transmission, reception, and playback without detailing the complex processing that typically occurs in a cellphone.\n\nFigure 1.1 (a) Simplified view of a cellphone, (b) further simplification of transmit and receive paths.\n\nLet us attempt to omit the black boxes and construct the simple system shown in Fig. 1.1(b). How well does this system work? We make two observations. First, our voice contains frequencies from 20 Hz to 20 kHz (called the \"voice band\"). Second, for an antenna to operate efficiently, i.e., to convert most of the electrical signal to electromagnetic radiation, its dimension must be a significant fraction (e.g., $25 \\%$ ) of the wavelength. Unfortunately, a frequency range of 20 Hz to 20 kHz translates to a wavelength ${ }^{1}$ of $1.5 \\times 10^{7}$ m to $1.5 \\times 10^{4} \\mathrm{~m}$, requiring gigantic antennas for each cellphone. Conversely, to obtain a reasonable antenna length, e.g., 5 cm , the wavelength must be around 20 cm and the frequency around 1.5 GHz .\n\nHow do we \"convert\" the voice band to a gigahertz center frequency? One possible approach is to multiply the voice signal, $x(t)$, by a sinusoid, $A \\cos \\left(2 \\pi f_{c} t\\right)$ [Fig. 1.2(a)]. Since multiplication in the time domain corresponds to convolution in the frequency domain, and since the spectrum of the sinusoid consists of two impulses at $\\pm f_{c}$, the voice spectrum is simply shifted (translated) to $\\pm f_{c}$ [Fig. 1.2(b)]. Thus, if $f_{c}=1 \\mathrm{GHz}$, the output occupies a bandwidth of 40 kHz centered at 1 GHz . This operation is an example of \"amplitude modulation.\" ${ }^{2}$\nThe diagram labeled \"(a)\" illustrates the process of amplitude modulation by showing the multiplication of a voice signal with a sinusoidal carrier signal.\n\n1. **Main Components:**\n- **Voice Signal, $x(t)$:** This is the input signal, a time-domain waveform representing the original audio or voice data.\n- **Sinusoidal Carrier, $A \\cos(2\\pi f_{c} t)$:** A cosine wave with amplitude $A$ and frequency $f_c$ that acts as the carrier signal.\n- **Output Waveform:** The result of multiplying the voice signal by the sinusoidal carrier, depicted as a modulated waveform.\n\n2. **Flow of Information:**\n- The voice signal $x(t)$ and the sinusoidal carrier $A \\cos(2\\pi f_{c} t)$ are inputs to a multiplier block.\n- These signals are multiplied together, resulting in the output waveform, which is the amplitude-modulated signal.\n\n3. **Labels and Annotations:**\n- The voice signal is labeled as $x(t)$, and the carrier signal is labeled as $A \\cos(2\\pi f_{c} t)$.\n- The output waveform is shown as a modulated signal, indicating the effect of the multiplication process.\n\n4. **Overall System Function:**\n- The primary function of this system is to perform amplitude modulation, where the voice signal is modulated by the carrier frequency. This process shifts the frequency spectrum of the voice signal to be centered around the carrier frequency $f_c$, allowing it to be transmitted over radio frequencies. The resulting output waveform has the same frequency content as the original voice signal but is now centered at the carrier frequency, ready for transmission.\n\nThe graph labeled as (b) illustrates the frequency domain representation of amplitude modulation. It consists of three main parts:\n\n1. **Voice Spectrum (X(f))**:\n- **Type**: Frequency spectrum graph.\n- **Axes**: The horizontal axis represents frequency (f) in hertz, ranging from -20 kHz to +20 kHz. The vertical axis represents amplitude, but no specific units are provided.\n- **Behavior**: The voice spectrum is centered around 0 Hz, showing a bandwidth of 40 kHz. It has a symmetrical shape about the vertical axis, indicating the baseband frequency components of the voice signal.\n\n2. **Spectrum of Cosine**:\n- **Type**: Impulse spectrum.\n- **Axes**: The horizontal axis represents frequency (f) in hertz, with impulses at -f_c and +f_c.\n- **Key Features**: Two impulses are present at the carrier frequencies -f_c and +f_c, where f_c is the carrier frequency.\n\n3. **Output Spectrum**:\n- **Type**: Frequency spectrum graph.\n- **Axes**: The horizontal axis represents frequency (f) in hertz, with marked points at -f_c, 0, and +f_c. The vertical axis represents amplitude.\n- **Behavior**: The output spectrum shows two shifted versions of the original voice spectrum, centered at -f_c and +f_c, as a result of the modulation process. This indicates that the voice signal has been translated in frequency by the carrier frequency, creating sidebands around the carrier frequencies.\n\n**Overall Description**:\nThe graph demonstrates how multiplying a voice signal by a sinusoidal carrier in the time domain results in the convolution of their spectra in the frequency domain. The voice spectrum, originally centered around 0 Hz, is shifted to new frequencies centered at -f_c and +f_c, corresponding to the carrier frequency. This operation effectively translates the voice signal to a higher frequency band, a key aspect of amplitude modulation.\n\nFigure 1.2 (a) Multiplication of a voice signal by a sinusoid, (b) equivalent operation in the frequency domain.\n\nWe therefore postulate that the black box in the transmitter of Fig. 1.1(a) contains a multiplier, ${ }^{3}$ as depicted in Fig. 1.3(a). But two other issues arise. First, the cellphone must deliver a relatively large voltage swing (e.g., $20 \\mathrm{~V}_{p p}$ ) to the antenna so that the radiated power can reach across distances of several kilometers, thereby requiring a \"power amplifier\" between the multiplier and the antenna. Second, the sinusoid, $A \\cos 2 \\pi f_{c} t$, must be produced by an \"oscillator.\" We thus arrive at the transmitter architecture shown in Fig. 1.3(b).\n\n[^0]The block diagram labeled as Fig. 1.3(a) represents a simple transmitter system used in communication devices like cellphones. This system consists of the following main components:\n\n1. **Data Source (D):** This block represents the input data signal that needs to be transmitted. It is typically a low-frequency signal that contains the information to be sent.\n\n2. **Multiplier (Mixer):** The data signal from the data source is fed into a multiplier. The multiplier's function is to combine the input data signal with a high-frequency carrier signal. This process is known as modulation.\n\n3. **Carrier Signal:** The carrier signal is represented by the notation \\( A \\cos(2\\pi f_c t) \\), where \\( A \\) is the amplitude, and \\( f_c \\) is the carrier frequency. This sinusoidal signal is necessary for transmitting the data over long distances.\n\n4. **Antenna:** After modulation, the combined signal is sent to the antenna. The antenna's role is to radiate the modulated signal into space as electromagnetic waves.\n\n**Flow of Information:**\n- The data signal from the data source is input into the multiplier.\n- Simultaneously, the carrier signal \\( A \\cos(2\\pi f_c t) \\) is also input into the multiplier.\n- The multiplier outputs a modulated signal, which is a combination of the data signal and the carrier signal.\n- This modulated signal is then sent to the antenna, which transmits it as radio waves.\n\n**Overall System Function:**\nThe primary function of this simple transmitter is to modulate a data signal with a high-frequency carrier signal and transmit it via an antenna. This allows the data to be sent over long distances, which is essential for communication systems such as cellphones. The simple architecture involves basic modulation and transmission without additional amplification or filtering stages.\n\nThe transmitter architecture shown in Fig. 1.3(b) is a more complete representation of a cellphone transmitter system. It consists of the following main components:\n\n1. **Data Source (D):** This is the initial block where the input signal originates. It represents the digital or analog data intended for transmission.\n\n2. **Mixer (Multiplier):** The data signal is fed into a mixer, which is responsible for combining the input signal with a carrier signal. The carrier signal is a sinusoidal waveform generated by the oscillator.\n\n3. **Oscillator:** This component produces a sinusoidal signal, denoted as \\( A \\cos(2\\pi f_c t) \\), which serves as the carrier frequency for modulation. The oscillator is connected to the mixer and provides the necessary frequency to shift the data signal to the desired transmission frequency.\n\n4. **Power Amplifier:** After modulation, the signal is passed through a power amplifier. The role of the power amplifier is to increase the amplitude of the signal, allowing it to be transmitted over long distances. This is crucial for ensuring that the signal can reach the intended receiver with sufficient strength.\n\n5. **Antenna:** The amplified signal is then sent to the antenna, which radiates the electromagnetic waves into the air for transmission.\n\n**Flow of Information:**\n- The data signal from the source is first mixed with the carrier signal from the oscillator in the mixer block.

This ensures that the signal can travel over long distances to reach a receiver, which will demodulate and process the signal for the end-user. The inclusion of the oscillator and power amplifier makes this system capable of handling the requirements of real-world wireless communication, such as that used in cellphones.\n\nFigure 1.3 (a) Simple transmitter, (b) more complete transmitter.\n\nLet us now turn our attention to the receive path of the cellphone, beginning with the simple realization illustrated in Fig. 1.1(b). Unfortunately, this topology fails to operate with the principle of modulation: if the signal received by the antenna resides around a gigahertz center frequency, the audio speaker cannot produce meaningful information. In other words, a means of translating the spectrum back to zero center frequency is necessary. For example, as depicted in Fig. 1.4(a), multiplication by a sinusoid, $A \\cos \\left(2 \\pi f_{c} t\\right)$, translates the spectrum to left and right by $f_{c}$, restoring the original voice band. The newly-generated components at $\\pm 2 f_{c}$ can be removed by a low-pass filter. We thus arrive at the receiver topology shown in Fig. 1.4(b).\n\nThe diagram labeled as (a) illustrates the translation of a modulated signal to a zero-center frequency, crucial for signal processing in communication systems.

The primary components and their functions are as follows:\n\n1. **Antenna**: This is the initial input point for the system, receiving the modulated radio frequency signals from the environment.\n\n2. **Mixer**: The received signal from the antenna is fed into a mixer. The mixer combines the incoming signal with a sinusoidal signal generated by an oscillator. This process translates the frequency of the signal down, centering it at zero frequency, which is necessary for further processing.\n\n3. **Oscillator**: This component generates a sinusoidal signal at a specified frequency. The frequency of this signal is used to mix with the incoming signal, effectively shifting its spectrum. This is a critical step for demodulating the signal.\n\n4. **Low-Pass Filter**: After mixing, the signal is passed through a low-pass filter. The filter removes high-frequency components generated during mixing, specifically the components at twice the oscillator frequency (±2f_c), isolating the desired baseband signal.\n\n5. **Speaker**: The filtered signal is finally sent to the speaker, which converts the electrical signal back into sound waves, allowing for audio output.\n\n**Flow of Information**:\n- The signal flow begins at the antenna, moves through the mixer where it is combined with the oscillator signal, and then passes through the low-pass filter. The output of the filter is sent directly to the speaker.\n\n**Overall System Function**:\n- The primary function of this receiver topology is to demodulate a received modulated signal and convert it into an audio signal that can be output through a speaker.

    "text": "The 1980s witnessed the emergence of cellular phones, which soared in popularity throughout the 1990s. Modern cellphones are equipped with complex analog and digital electronics, a subject beyond the scope of this book. However, our focus is on understanding how the book's concepts relate to a cellphone's functionality.\n\nImagine a conversation on your cellphone. Your voice is transformed into an electrical signal by the microphone and, following processing, transmitted via the antenna. Your friend's cellphone receiver captures this signal, processes it, and sends it to the speaker [Fig. 1.1(a)]. What occurs within these 'black boxes,' and why are they essential?\n\nThe block diagram in Figure 1.1(a) provides a simplified depiction of a cellphone's operation during a call, illustrating both transmission (TX) and reception (RX) pathways.\n\n1. **Main Components:**\n- **Microphone:** Transforms the speaker's voice into an electrical signal.\n- **Transmitter (TX) Block:** An unspecified processing block (indicated by a question mark) that processes the microphone's electrical signal before transmission to the antenna.\n- **Antenna (TX):** Transmits the processed electrical signal as electromagnetic waves.\n- **Antenna (RX):** Receives electromagnetic waves and converts them back to an electrical signal.\n- **Receiver (RX) Block:** An unspecified processing block that processes the received electrical signal before sending it to the speaker.\n- **Speaker:** Converts the processed electrical signal back into sound.\n\n2. **Flow of Information or Control:**\n- The flow starts at the microphone, converting voice to an electrical signal, processed by the transmitter block.\n- The processed signal is transmitted by the TX antenna as electromagnetic waves.\n- The RX antenna of the receiving cellphone captures these waves and converts them back to an electrical signal.\n- The receiver block processes this signal, and the processed signal drives the speaker, converting it into audible sound.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n- Labels for the microphone, speaker, transmitter, receiver, and antennas indicate the signal flow from microphone to speaker.\n- Question marks in the transmitter and receiver blocks suggest unspecified processing, typically involving modulation, amplification, filtering, and demodulation.\n\n4. **Overall System Function:**\n- The system facilitates voice communication between two parties using cellphones. The arrangement of components ensures efficient conversion of voice signals to and from electromagnetic waves for wireless communication over distances.\n\nFigure 1.1 (b) presents a simplified representation of the transmit and receive paths in a cellphone communication system, omitting detailed processing blocks seen in more complex systems to focus on fundamental components for basic operation.\n\n1. **Main Components:**\n- **Microphone:** Captures the user's voice and converts it into an electrical signal.\n- **Antenna (Transmitter):** Converts the microphone's electrical signal into electromagnetic waves for transmission.\n- **Antenna (Receiver):** Receives electromagnetic waves and converts them back into an electrical signal.\n- **Speaker:** Converts the electrical signal from the receiving antenna back into sound.\n\n2. **Flow of Information or Control:**\n- The flow begins at the microphone, converting voice to an electrical signal, sent to the transmitting antenna, radiated as electromagnetic waves.\n- These waves travel through the air to the receiving antenna, captured, and converted back into an electrical signal.\n- The signal is directed to the speaker, converting it into sound.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n- Arrows indicate the direction of signal flow from the microphone to the transmitting antenna, through the air to the receiving antenna, and finally to the speaker.\n- The absence of processing blocks between components highlights the simplicity of the system, focusing purely on signal conversion and transmission.\n\n4. **Overall System Function:**\n- The system transmits voice from one point to another using electromagnetic waves. By illustrating only essential components (microphone, antennas, and speaker), the diagram emphasizes the basic process of voice capture, transmission, reception, and playback without detailing complex processing.\n\nFigure 1.1 (a) Simplified view of a cellphone, (b) further simplification of transmit and receive paths.\n\nLet's consider the simplified system in Fig. 1.1(b), omitting the black boxes. Two observations are made. First, the human voice spans frequencies from 20 Hz to 20 kHz (voice band). Second, for efficient antenna operation, converting electrical signals to electromagnetic radiation, its size must be a significant fraction (e.g., 25%) of the wavelength. Unfortunately, a frequency range of 20 Hz to 20 kHz corresponds to wavelengths of 1.5 x 10^7 m to 1.5 x 10^4 m, requiring huge antennas for cellphones. Conversely, for a reasonable antenna length, e.g., 5 cm, the wavelength should be around 20 cm, and the frequency around 1.5 GHz.\n\nHow do we convert the voice band to a gigahertz center frequency? One approach is multiplying the voice signal, x(t), by a sinusoid, A cos(2πfc t) [Fig. 1.2(a)]. Multiplication in the time domain corresponds to convolution in the frequency domain, and the sinusoid's spectrum consists of impulses at ±fc, shifting the voice spectrum to ±fc [Fig. 1.2(b)]. Thus, if fc = 1 GHz, the output occupies a bandwidth of 40 kHz centered at 1 GHz. This is an example of amplitude modulation.\n\nFigure 1.2 (a) shows the process of amplitude modulation by multiplying a voice signal with a sinusoidal carrier signal.\n\n1. **Main Components:**\n- **Voice Signal, x(t):** Input signal representing the original audio or voice data.\n- **Sinusoidal Carrier, A cos(2πfc t):** Cosine wave with amplitude A and frequency fc, acting as the carrier signal.\n- **Output Waveform:** Result of multiplying the voice signal by the sinusoidal carrier, depicted as a modulated waveform.\n\n2. **Flow of Information:**\n- The voice signal x(t) and sinusoidal carrier A cos(2πfc t) are inputs to a multiplier block.\n- These signals are multiplied, resulting in the output waveform, the amplitude-modulated signal.\n\n3. **Labels and Annotations:**\n- The voice signal is labeled as x(t), and the carrier signal as A cos(2πfc t).\n- The output waveform is shown as a modulated signal, indicating the multiplication process.\n\n4. **Overall System Function:**\n- The system performs amplitude modulation, modulating the voice signal by the carrier frequency. This shifts the frequency spectrum of the voice signal to be centered around the carrier frequency fc, allowing transmission over radio frequencies. The resulting output waveform has the same frequency content as the original voice signal but is now centered at the carrier frequency, ready for transmission.\n\nFigure 1.2 (b) illustrates the frequency domain representation of amplitude modulation, consisting of three main parts:\n\n1. **Voice Spectrum (X(f)):**\n- **Type:** Frequency spectrum graph.\n- **Axes:** Horizontal axis represents frequency (f) in hertz, ranging from -20 kHz to +20 kHz. Vertical axis represents amplitude.\n- **Behavior:** The voice spectrum is centered around 0 Hz, showing a bandwidth of 40 kHz. It has a symmetrical shape about the vertical axis, indicating the baseband frequency components of the voice signal.\n\n2. **Spectrum of Cosine:**\n- **Type:** Impulse spectrum.\n- **Axes:** Horizontal axis represents frequency (f) in hertz, with impulses at -fc and +fc.\n- **Key Features:** Two impulses are present at the carrier frequencies -fc and +fc, where fc is the carrier frequency.\n\n3. **Output Spectrum:**\n- **Type:** Frequency spectrum graph.\n- **Axes:** Horizontal axis represents frequency (f) in hertz, with marked points at -fc, 0, and +fc. Vertical axis represents amplitude.\n- **Behavior:** The output spectrum shows two shifted versions of the original voice spectrum, centered at -fc and +fc, as a result of the modulation process. This indicates that the voice signal has been translated in frequency by the carrier frequency, creating sidebands around the carrier frequencies.\n\nThe graph demonstrates how multiplying a voice signal by a sinusoidal carrier in the time domain results in the convolution of their spectra in the frequency domain. The voice spectrum, originally centered around 0 Hz, is shifted to new frequencies centered at -fc and +fc, corresponding to the carrier frequency. This operation effectively translates the voice signal to a higher frequency band, a key aspect of amplitude modulation.\n\nFigure 1.2 (a) Multiplication of a voice signal by a sinusoid, (b) equivalent operation in the frequency domain.\n\nWe postulate that the black box in the transmitter of Fig. 1.1(a) contains a multiplier, as depicted in Fig. 1.3(a). However, two other issues arise. First, the cellphone must deliver a large voltage swing (e.g., 20 Vpp) to the antenna for sufficient radiated power over several kilometers, requiring a power amplifier between the multiplier and the antenna. Second, the sinusoid, A cos(2πfc t), must be produced by an oscillator. We arrive at the transmitter architecture shown in Fig. 1.3(b).\n\n[^0]Figure 1.3(a) represents a simple transmitter system used in communication devices like cellphones.\n\n1. **Data Source (D):** Input data signal for transmission.\n2. **Multiplier (Mixer):** Combines the input data signal with a high-frequency carrier signal.\n3. **Carrier Signal:** Sinusoidal signal A cos(2πfc t), necessary for data transmission over long distances.\n4. **Antenna:** Radiates the modulated signal into space as electromagnetic waves.\n\n**Flow of Information:**\n- The data signal from the data source is input into the multiplier.\n- Simultaneously, the carrier signal A cos(2πfc t) is also input into the multiplier.\n- The multiplier outputs a modulated signal, a combination of the data signal and the carrier signal.\n- This modulated signal is sent to the antenna, transmitted as radio waves.\n\n**Overall System Function:**\nThe simple transmitter modulates a data signal with a high-frequency carrier signal and transmits it via an antenna, allowing data transmission over long distances, essential for communication systems like cellphones.\n\nFigure 1.3(b) represents a more complete transmitter system.\n\n1. **Data Source (D):** Originates the input signal, representing the data for transmission.\n2. **Mixer (Multiplier):** Combines the input signal with a carrier signal, generated by the oscillator.\n3. **Oscillator:** Produces the sinusoidal signal A cos(2πfc t), serving as the carrier frequency for modulation.\n4. **Power Amplifier:** Increases the amplitude of the signal after modulation, allowing transmission over long distances.\n5. **Antenna:** Radiates the amplified signal into the air for transmission.\n\n**Flow of Information:**\n- The data signal is mixed with the carrier signal from the oscillator in the mixer block.

A means of translating the spectrum back to zero center frequency is necessary. For example, as depicted in Fig. 1.4(a), multiplication by a sinusoid, A cos(2πfc t), shifts the spectrum to the left and right by fc, restoring the original voice band. The newly-generated components at ±2fc can be removed by a low-pass filter.

The output of the filter is sent directly to the speaker.\n\n**Overall System Function:**\n- The receiver topology demodulates the received modulated signal and converts it into an audio signal for output through a speaker. The arrangement of components translates the received spectrum to a baseband signal, filters out unwanted frequencies, and provides an audio output.\n\nFigure 1.4(c) represents a more complete receiver topology designed to process and amplify weak signals received by an antenna.\n\n1. **Main Components:**\n- **Antenna:** Captures incoming radio frequency signals.\n- **Low-Noise Amplifier (LNA):** Amplifies weak received signals with minimal added noise, improving the signal-to-noise ratio.\n- **Mixer:** Combines the amplified signal with a locally generated signal from an oscillator to translate the frequency of the incoming signal.\n- **Oscillator:** Generates a sinusoidal signal used by the mixer to shift the frequency of the received signal.\n- **Low-Pass Filter:** Removes unwanted high-frequency components generated during the mixing process, allowing only the desired baseband or low-frequency signal to pass through.\n- **Amplifier**: Further amplifies the filtered signal to a level suitable for driving an audio speaker.\n- **Speaker:** Converts the electrical signals back into sound for the user to hear.\n\n2. **Flow of Information or Control:**\n- The signal flow begins at the antenna, where incoming radio frequency signals are captured and sent to the Low-Noise Amplifier.\n- The amplified signal from the LNA is then fed into the mixer.\n- Simultaneously, the oscillator provides a local frequency signal to the mixer.\n- The mixer outputs a signal that is a combination of the input signal and the oscillator's frequency, effectively shifting the frequency of the input signal.\n- This mixed signal is passed through the low-pass filter, which removes high-frequency noise and retains the baseband signal.\n- The filtered signal is then amplified by the amplifier to a level sufficient for sound reproduction.\n- Finally, the amplified signal drives the speaker, producing audible sound.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n- Each component is clearly labeled, indicating their function (e.g., \"Low-Noise Amplifier,\" \"Oscillator,\" \"Low-Pass Filter,\" \"Amplifier\").\n- Arrows indicate the direction of signal processing from one block to the next.\n\n4. **Overall System Function:**\n- The receiver system captures weak radio frequency signals, amplifies them, translates their frequency to a baseband signal, and finally converts them into audible sound. The arrangement of components ensures that the signal is amplified with minimal noise and filtered to remove unwanted frequencies, resulting in a clear audio output suitable for listening.\n\nFigure 1.4 (a) Translation of modulated signal to zero center frequency, (b) simple receiver, (c) more complete receiver.\n\nOur receiver design is still incomplete. The signal received by the antenna can be as low as a few tens of microvolts, whereas the speaker may require swings of several tens or hundreds of millivolts. The receiver must provide substantial amplification (\"gain\") between the antenna and the speaker. Furthermore, since multipliers typically introduce noise, corrupting the received signal, a \"low-noise amplifier\" must precede the multiplier. The overall architecture is depicted in Fig. 1.4(c).\n\nToday's cellphones are far more advanced than the described topologies. For instance, the voice signal in the transmitter and receiver is processed by a digital signal processor (DSP) to enhance communication quality and efficiency. Nonetheless, our study reveals some fundamental building blocks of cellphones, such as amplifiers, oscillators, and filters, with the last two also utilizing amplification. We devote considerable effort to analyzing and designing amplifiers.\n\nThe reader may wonder if the concepts of amplifiers, oscillators, and multipliers in both transmit and receive paths of a cellphone are outdated and trivial compared to the state of the art. Interestingly, these building blocks remain among the most challenging circuits in communication systems. This is because their design involves critical trade-offs between speed (gigahertz center frequencies), noise, power dissipation (battery lifetime), weight, cost (cellphone price), and many other parameters. In the competitive world of cellphone manufacturing, a design is never \"good enough,\" forcing engineers to continually push these trade-offs in each new generation of the product."

By illustrating only the essential components (microphone, antennas, and speaker), the diagram emphasizes the basic process of voice capture, transmission, reception, and playback without detailing the complex processing that typically occurs in a mobile phone.\n\nLet's consider a simplified system without the 'black boxes,' as shown in Fig. 1.1(b). How well does this system function? We note two key points. First, our voice spans frequencies from 20 Hz to 20 kHz (known as the \"voice band\"). Second, for an antenna to operate efficiently, its size must be a significant fraction (e.g., 25%) of the wavelength. Unfortunately, a frequency range of 20 Hz to 20 kHz corresponds to wavelengths of 1.5 x 10^7 m to 1.5 x 10^4 m, requiring massive antennas for each mobile phone. Conversely, to achieve a reasonable antenna length, such as 5 cm, the wavelength must be around 20 cm, and the frequency around 1.5 GHz.\n\nHow do we 'convert' the voice band to a gigahertz center frequency? One approach is to multiply the voice signal, x(t), by a sinusoid, A cos(2πf_c t) [Fig. 1.2(a)]. Since multiplication in the time domain corresponds to convolution in the frequency domain, and the spectrum of the sinusoid consists of impulses at ±f_c, the voice spectrum is simply shifted (translated) to ±f_c [Fig. 1.2(b)]. Thus, if f_c = 1 GHz, the output occupies a bandwidth of 40 kHz centered at 1 GHz. This operation is an example of \"amplitude modulation.\"\n\nFigure 1.2(a) illustrates amplitude modulation by showing the multiplication of a voice signal with a sinusoidal carrier signal.\n\n1. **Key Components:**\n- **Voice Signal, x(t):** The input signal, representing the original audio or voice data as a time-domain waveform.\n- **Sinusoidal Carrier, A cos(2πf_c t):** A cosine wave with amplitude A and frequency f_c that acts as the carrier signal.\n- **Output Waveform:** The result of multiplying the voice signal by the sinusoidal carrier, depicted as a modulated waveform.\n\n2. **Information Flow:**\n- The voice signal x(t) and the sinusoidal carrier A cos(2πf_c t) are inputs to a multiplier block.\n- These signals are multiplied together, resulting in the output waveform, which is the amplitude-modulated signal.\n\n3. **Labels and Indicators:**\n- The voice signal is labeled as x(t), and the carrier signal is labeled as A cos(2πf_c t).\n- The output waveform is shown as a modulated signal, indicating the effect of the multiplication process.\n\n4. **System Function:**\n- The system's primary role is to perform amplitude modulation, where the voice signal is modulated by the carrier frequency. This process shifts the frequency spectrum of the voice signal to be centered around the carrier frequency f_c, allowing it to be transmitted over radio frequencies. The resulting output waveform has the same frequency content as the original voice signal but is now centered at the carrier frequency, ready for transmission.\n\nFigure 1.2(b) shows the frequency domain representation of amplitude modulation, consisting of three main parts:\n\n1. **Voice Spectrum (X(f)):**\n- **Type:** Frequency spectrum graph.\n- **Axes:** The horizontal axis represents frequency (f) in hertz, ranging from -20 kHz to +20 kHz.

However, two other issues arise. First, the mobile phone must deliver a relatively large voltage swing (e.g., 20 V_pp) to the antenna to ensure the radiated power can cover distances of several kilometers, requiring a \"power amplifier\" between the multiplier and the antenna. Second, the sinusoid, A cos 2πf_c t, must be generated by an \"oscillator.\" This leads us to the transmitter architecture shown in Fig. 1.3(b).\n\nFigure 1.3(a) represents a simple transmitter system used in communication devices like mobile phones.\n\n1. **Data Source (D):** Represents the input data signal that needs to be transmitted, typically a low-frequency signal containing the information to be sent.\n\n2. **Multiplier (Mixer):** The data signal from the data source is fed into a multiplier, which combines the input data signal with a high-frequency carrier signal. This process is known as modulation.\n\n3. **Carrier Signal:** Represented by the notation A cos(2πf_c t), where A is the amplitude, and f_c is the carrier frequency. This sinusoidal signal is necessary for transmitting the data over long distances.\n\n4. **Antenna:** After modulation, the combined signal is sent to the antenna, which radiates the modulated signal into space as electromagnetic waves.\n\n**Information Flow:**\n- The data signal from the data source is input into the multiplier.\n- Simultaneously, the carrier signal A cos(2πf_c t) is also input into the multiplier.\n- The multiplier outputs a modulated signal, which is a combination of the data signal and the carrier signal.\n- This modulated signal is then sent to the antenna, which transmits it as radio waves.\n\n**System Function:**\nThe primary function of this simple transmitter is to modulate a data signal with a high-frequency carrier signal and transmit it via an antenna. This allows the data to be sent over long distances, which is essential for communication systems such as mobile phones. The simple architecture involves basic modulation and transmission without additional amplification or filtering stages.\n\nFigure 1.3(b) shows a more complete transmitter system for mobile phones.\n\n1. **Data Source (D):** The initial block where the input signal originates, representing the digital or analog data intended for transmission.\n\n2. **Mixer (Multiplier):** The data signal is fed into a mixer, which combines the input signal with a carrier signal. The carrier signal is a sinusoidal waveform generated by the oscillator.\n\n3. **Oscillator:** This component produces a sinusoidal signal, denoted as A cos(2πf_c t), which serves as the carrier frequency for modulation. The oscillator is connected to the mixer and provides the necessary frequency to shift the data signal to the desired transmission frequency.\n\n4. **Power Amplifier:** After modulation, the signal is passed through a power amplifier. The role of the power amplifier is to increase the amplitude of the signal, allowing it to be transmitted over long distances. This is crucial for ensuring that the signal can reach the intended receiver with sufficient strength.\n\n5. **Antenna:** The amplified signal is then sent to the antenna, which radiates the electromagnetic waves into the air for transmission.\n\n**Information Flow:**\n- The data signal from the source is first mixed with the carrier signal from the oscillator in the mixer block. This process modulates the data onto the carrier frequency.\n- The modulated signal is then amplified by the power amplifier to achieve the required transmission power level.\n- Finally, the amplified signal is transmitted through the antenna.\n\n**System Function:**\nThe primary function of this transmitter architecture is to modulate a data signal onto a higher frequency carrier, amplify it, and transmit it via an antenna. This ensures that the signal can travel over long distances to reach a receiver, which will demodulate and process the signal for the end-user. The inclusion of the oscillator and power amplifier makes this system capable of handling the requirements of real-world wireless communication, such as that used in mobile phones.\n\nFigure 1.3(a) Simple transmitter, (b) more complete transmitter.\n\nNow, let's examine the receive path of the mobile phone, starting with the simplified realization in Fig. 1.1(b). Unfortunately, this topology fails to operate effectively due to the principle of modulation: if the signal received by the antenna is centered around a gigahertz frequency, the audio speaker cannot produce meaningful information. In other words, a method is needed to translate the spectrum back to a zero center frequency. For instance, as depicted in Fig. 1.4(a), multiplication by a sinusoid, A cos(2πf_c t), shifts the spectrum to the left and right by f_c, restoring the original voice band. The newly-generated components at ±2f_c can be removed by a low-pass filter. This leads us to the receiver topology shown in Fig. 1.4(b).\n\nFigure 1.4(a) illustrates the translation of a modulated signal to a zero-center frequency, crucial for signal processing in communication systems. This is depicted through three distinct spectra: the Received Spectrum, the Spectrum of Cosine, and the Output Spectrum.\n\n1. **Type of Graph and Function:**\n- This is a frequency domain representation showing the spectral translation of signals.\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n- The horizontal axis represents frequency f, marked with significant points at -f_c, 0, +f_c, -2f_c, and +2f_c. There are no specific units marked, but frequency is typically measured in hertz (Hz).\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- The Received Spectrum shows two main lobes centered around -f_c and +f_c. The Spectrum of Cosine is represented by two delta functions at -f_c and +f_c, indicating the frequency components of the cosine wave used for mixing.\n- The Output Spectrum results from the multiplication of the Received Spectrum with the Spectrum of Cosine, showing three sets of lobes centered at -2f_c, 0, and +2f_c. This indicates the translation of the spectrum to a zero-center frequency and the generation of additional components at ±2f_c.\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The Received Spectrum is the initial modulated signal with its frequency components shifted by f_c.\n- The Spectrum of Cosine is used to mix with the Received Spectrum, effectively shifting the frequency components.\n- The Output Spectrum shows that the original voice band is restored at zero frequency, while new components appear at ±2f_c, which can be removed by a low-pass filter.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- The diagram uses dotted lines to indicate the center of each spectral component.\n- The arrows in the Spectrum of Cosine highlight the points of frequency translation.\n\nThis diagram effectively demonstrates the process of frequency translation in signal processing, illustrating how a modulated signal can be shifted back to its original baseband frequency using a mixing technique with a cosine wave.\n\nFigure 1.4(b) represents a simple receiver topology for processing a modulated signal received by an antenna.\n\n1. **Antenna**: Captures the incoming radio frequency signals.\n2. **Mixer**: The received signal from the antenna is fed into a mixer, which combines the incoming signal with a sinusoidal signal generated by an oscillator. This process translates the frequency of the signal down, centering it at zero frequency, which is necessary for further processing.\n3. **Oscillator**: Generates a sinusoidal signal at a specified frequency. The frequency of this signal is used to mix with the incoming signal, effectively shifting its spectrum. This is a critical step for demodulating the signal.\n4. **Low-Pass Filter**: After mixing, the signal is passed through a low-pass filter, which removes unwanted high-frequency components generated during mixing, specifically the components at twice the oscillator frequency (±2f_c), isolating the desired baseband signal.\n5. **Speaker**: The filtered signal is finally sent to the speaker, which converts the electrical signal back into sound waves, allowing for audio output.\n\n**Information Flow:**\n- The signal flow begins at the antenna, moves through the mixer where it is combined with the oscillator signal, and then passes through the low-pass filter. The output of the filter is sent directly to the speaker.\n\n**System Function:**\n- The primary function of this receiver topology is to demodulate a received modulated signal and convert it into an audio signal that can be output through a speaker. The arrangement of components effectively translates the received spectrum to a baseband signal, filters out unwanted frequencies, and provides an audio output.\n\nFigure 1.4(c) represents a more complete receiver topology designed to process and amplify weak signals received by an antenna.\n\n1. **Key Components:**\n- **Antenna:** Captures the incoming radio frequency signals.\n- **Low-Noise Amplifier (LNA):** Amplifies the weak received signals with minimal added noise, improving the signal-to-noise ratio.\n- **Mixer:** Combines the amplified signal with a locally generated signal from an oscillator to translate the frequency of the incoming signal.\n- **Oscillator:** Generates a sinusoidal signal used by the mixer to shift the frequency of the received signal.\n- **Low-Pass Filter:** Removes unwanted high-frequency components generated during the mixing process, allowing only the desired baseband or low-frequency signal to pass through.\n- **Amplifier:** Further amplifies the filtered signal to a level suitable for driving an audio speaker.\n- **Speaker:** Converts the electrical signals back into sound for the user to hear.\n\n2. **Information Flow:**\n- The signal flow begins at the antenna, where the incoming radio frequency signals are captured and sent to the Low-Noise Amplifier.\n- The amplified signal from the LNA is then fed into the mixer.\n- Simultaneously, the oscillator provides a local frequency signal to the mixer.\n- The mixer outputs a signal that is a combination of the input signal and the oscillator's frequency, effectively shifting the frequency of the input signal.\n- This mixed signal is passed through the low-pass filter, which removes high-frequency noise and retains the baseband signal.\n- The filtered signal is then amplified by the amplifier to a level sufficient for sound reproduction.\n- Finally, the amplified signal drives the speaker, producing audible sound.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n- The diagram labels each component clearly, indicating their function (e.g., \"Low-Noise Ampl"

Modern cellphones are equipped with advanced analog and digital electronics, which are beyond the scope of this text. However, our focus is on how the principles outlined in this book relate to the functioning of a cellphone.\n\nImagine a conversation with a friend over your cellphone. Your voice is transformed into an electric signal by the microphone and, after undergoing processing, is transmitted via the antenna. The signal from your antenna is then received by your friend's cellphone, processed, and converted back into sound by the speaker [Fig. 1.1(a)]. What occurs within these 'black boxes'? Why are they essential?\n\nFigure 1.1(a) depicts a simplified overview of a cellphone's operation during a call, illustrating the transmission (TX) and reception (RX) processes.\n\n1. **Main Components:**\n- **Microphone:** Converts the speaker's voice into an electrical signal.\n- **Transmitter (TX) Block:** An unspecified processing block that processes the electrical signal from the microphone before transmitting it to the antenna.\n- **Antenna (TX):** Transmits the processed electrical signal as electromagnetic waves.\n- **Antenna (RX):** Receives electromagnetic waves from the other cellphone and converts them back to an electrical signal.\n- **Receiver (RX) Block:** Another unspecified processing block that processes the received electrical signal before sending it to the speaker.\n- **Speaker:** Converts the processed electrical signal back into sound.\n\n2. **Flow of Information or Control:**\n- The process begins at the microphone, where the voice is converted to an electrical signal.

This version omits the detailed processing blocks seen in more complex systems, focusing instead on the fundamental components necessary for basic operation.\n\n1. **Main Components:**\n- **Microphone:** This component captures the user's voice and converts it into an electrical signal. It is the starting point of the transmission path.\n- **Antenna (Transmitter):** The antenna is responsible for converting the electrical signal from the microphone into electromagnetic waves, which are then transmitted through the air.\n- **Antenna (Receiver):** This antenna receives electromagnetic waves from the transmitting antenna.

By illustrating only the essential components (microphone, antennas, and speaker), the diagram emphasizes the basic process of voice capture, transmission, reception, and playback without detailing the complex processing that typically occurs in a cellphone.\n\nFigure 1.1 (a) Simplified view of a cellphone, (b) further simplification of transmit and receive paths.\n\nLet us attempt to omit the black boxes and construct the simple system shown in Fig. 1.1(b). How well does this system work? We make two observations. First, our voice contains frequencies from 20 Hz to 20 kHz (called the \"voice band\"). Second, for an antenna to operate efficiently, i.e., to convert most of the electrical signal to electromagnetic radiation, its dimension must be a significant fraction (e.g., $25 \\%$ ) of the wavelength. Unfortunately, a frequency range of 20 Hz to 20 kHz translates to a wavelength ${ }^{1}$ of $1.5 \\times 10^{7}$ m to $1.5 \\times 10^{4} \\mathrm{~m}$, requiring gigantic antennas for each cellphone. Conversely, to obtain a reasonable antenna length, e.g., 5 cm , the wavelength must be around 20 cm and the frequency around 1.5 GHz .\n\nHow do we \"convert\" the voice band to a gigahertz center frequency? One possible approach is to multiply the voice signal, $x(t)$, by a sinusoid, $A \\cos \\left(2 \\pi f_{c} t\\right)$ [Fig. 1.2(a)]. Since multiplication in the time domain corresponds to convolution in the frequency domain, and since the spectrum of the sinusoid consists of two impulses at $\\pm f_{c}$, the voice spectrum is simply shifted (translated) to $\\pm f_{c}$ [Fig. 1.2(b)]. Thus, if $f_{c}=1 \\mathrm{GHz}$, the output occupies a bandwidth of 40 kHz centered at 1 GHz . This operation is an example of \"amplitude modulation.\" ${ }^{2}$\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:The diagram labeled \"(a)\" illustrates the process of amplitude modulation by showing the multiplication of a voice signal with a sinusoidal carrier signal.\n\n1. **Main Components:**\n- **Voice Signal, $x(t)$:** This is the input signal, a time-domain waveform representing the original audio or voice data.\n- **Sinusoidal Carrier, $A \\cos(2\\pi f_{c} t)$:** A cosine wave with amplitude $A$ and frequency $f_c$ that acts as the carrier signal.\n- **Output Waveform:** The result of multiplying the voice signal by the sinusoidal carrier, depicted as a modulated waveform.\n\n2. **Flow of Information:**\n- The voice signal $x(t)$ and the sinusoidal carrier $A \\cos(2\\pi f_{c} t)$ are inputs to a multiplier block.\n- These signals are multiplied together, resulting in the output waveform, which is the amplitude-modulated signal.\n\n3. **Labels and Annotations:**\n- The voice signal is labeled as $x(t)$, and the carrier signal is labeled as $A \\cos(2\\pi f_{c} t)$.\n- The output waveform is shown as a modulated signal, indicating the effect of the multiplication process.\n\n4. **Overall System Function:**\n- The primary function of this system is to perform amplitude modulation, where the voice signal is modulated by the carrier frequency. This process shifts the frequency spectrum of the voice signal to be centered around the carrier frequency $f_c$, allowing it to be transmitted over radio frequencies. The resulting output waveform has the same frequency content as the original voice signal but is now centered at the carrier frequency, ready for transmission.\nimage_name:(b)\ndescription:The graph labeled as (b) illustrates the frequency domain representation of amplitude modulation. It consists of three main parts:\n\n1. **Voice Spectrum (X(f))**:\n- **Type**: Frequency spectrum graph.\n- **Axes**: The horizontal axis represents frequency (f) in hertz, ranging from -20 kHz to +20 kHz. The vertical axis represents amplitude, but no specific units are provided.\n- **Behavior**: The voice spectrum is centered around 0 Hz, showing a bandwidth of 40 kHz. It has a symmetrical shape about the vertical axis, indicating the baseband frequency components of the voice signal.\n\n2. **Spectrum of Cosine**:\n- **Type**: Impulse spectrum.\n- **Axes**: The horizontal axis represents frequency (f) in hertz, with impulses at -f_c and +f_c.\n- **Key Features**: Two impulses are present at the carrier frequencies -f_c and +f_c, where f_c is the carrier frequency.\n\n3. **Output Spectrum**:\n- **Type**: Frequency spectrum graph.\n- **Axes**: The horizontal axis represents frequency (f) in hertz, with marked points at -f_c, 0, and +f_c. The vertical axis represents amplitude.\n- **Behavior**: The output spectrum shows two shifted versions of the original voice spectrum, centered at -f_c and +f_c, as a result of the modulation process. This indicates that the voice signal has been translated in frequency by the carrier frequency, creating sidebands around the carrier frequencies.\n\n**Overall Description**:\nThe graph demonstrates how multiplying a voice signal by a sinusoidal carrier in the time domain results in the convolution of their spectra in the frequency domain. The voice spectrum, originally centered around 0 Hz, is shifted to new frequencies centered at -f_c and +f_c, corresponding to the carrier frequency. This operation effectively translates the voice signal to a higher frequency band, a key aspect of amplitude modulation.\n\nFigure 1.2 (a) Multiplication of a voice signal by a sinusoid, (b) equivalent operation in the frequency domain.\n\nWe therefore postulate that the black box in the transmitter of Fig. 1.1(a) contains a multiplier, ${ }^{3}$ as depicted in Fig. 1.3(a). But two other issues arise. First, the cellphone must deliver a relatively large voltage swing (e.g., $20 \\mathrm{~V}_{p p}$ ) to the antenna so that the radiated power can reach across distances of several kilometers, thereby requiring a \"power amplifier\" between the multiplier and the antenna. Second, the sinusoid, $A \\cos 2 \\pi f_{c} t$, must be produced by an \"oscillator.\" We thus arrive at the transmitter architecture shown in Fig. 1.3(b).\n\n[^0]image_name:(a)\ndescription:The block diagram labeled as Fig. 1.3(a) represents a simple transmitter system used in communication devices like cellphones.

How well does this system work? Two observations can be made. First, our voice spans frequencies from 20 Hz to 20 kHz (known as the \"voice band\"). Second, for an antenna to operate efficiently, converting most of the electrical signal to electromagnetic radiation, its size must be a significant fraction (e.g., 25%) of the wavelength. Unfortunately, a 20 Hz to 20 kHz frequency range corresponds to wavelengths of 1.5 x 10^7 m to 1.5 x 10^4 m, requiring massive antennas for each mobile. Conversely, for a reasonable antenna length, like 5 cm, the wavelength should be around 20 cm, and the frequency around 1.5 GHz.\n\nHow do we \"convert\" the voice band to a gigahertz center frequency? One approach is to multiply the voice signal, x(t), by a sinusoid, A cos(2πf_c t) [Fig. 1.2(a)]. Since multiplication in the time domain corresponds to convolution in the frequency domain, and the sinusoid's spectrum consists of impulses at ±f_c, the voice spectrum is shifted (translated) to ±f_c [Fig. 1.2(b)]. Thus, if f_c = 1 GHz, the output occupies a 40 kHz bandwidth centered at 1 GHz. This operation is an example of \"amplitude modulation.\"\n\nFigure 1.2 (a) Multiplication of a voice signal by a sinusoid, (b) equivalent operation in the frequency domain.\n\nWe postulate that the black box in the transmitter of Fig. 1.1(a) contains a multiplier, as depicted in Fig. 1.3(a). However, two other issues arise. First, the mobile must deliver a relatively large voltage swing (e.g., 20 V_pp) to the antenna for the radiated power to reach across distances of several kilometers, requiring a \"power amplifier\" between the multiplier and the antenna. Second, the sinusoid, A cos(2πf_c t), must be produced by an \"oscillator.\" We arrive at the transmitter architecture shown in Fig. 1.3(b).\n\nFigure 1.3 (a) Simple transmitter, (b) more complete transmitter.\n\nNow, let's examine the receive path of the mobile, starting with the simple realization in Fig. 1.1(b). Unfortunately, this topology fails to operate with the modulation principle: if the signal received by the antenna resides around a gigahertz center frequency, the audio speaker cannot produce meaningful information. In other words, a means of translating the spectrum back to zero center frequency is necessary. For example, as depicted in Fig. 1.4(a), multiplication by a sinusoid, A cos(2πf_c t), shifts the spectrum to the left and right by f_c, restoring the original voice band. The newly-generated components at ±2f_c can be removed by a low-pass filter. We arrive at the receiver topology shown in Fig. 1.4(b).\n\nFigure 1.4 (a) Translation of modulated signal to zero center frequency, (b) simple receiver.\n\nOur receiver design remains incomplete. The signal received by the antenna can be as low as a few tens of microvolts, whereas the speaker may require swings of several tens or hundreds of millivolts. Thus, the receiver must provide significant amplification (\"gain\") between the antenna and the speaker. Furthermore, since multipliers typically suffer from high \"noise,\" corrupting the received signal, a \"low-noise amplifier\" must precede the multiplier. The overall architecture is depicted in Fig. 1.4(c).\n\nToday's mobile phones are much more sophisticated than the described topologies.

    "text": "Cellular telephones emerged in the 1980s and saw widespread adoption in the 1990s. Modern cellphones are equipped with complex analog and digital electronics that extend beyond the scope of this book. Our aim here is to understand how the concepts discussed in this book relate to the functioning of a cellphone.\n\nConsider a scenario where you are talking to a friend on your cellphone. Your voice is transformed into an electric signal by the microphone, processed, and transmitted via the antenna. The signal from your antenna is captured by your friend's receiver, processed, and directed to the speaker [Fig. 1.1(a)]. What happens within these black boxes? Why are they essential?\n\nThe block diagram in Figure 1.1(a) offers a simplified perspective of a cellphone's operation during a call, showcasing both the transmission (TX) and reception (RX) pathways.\n\n1. **Key Components:**\n- **Microphone:** Converts the speaker's voice into an electrical signal.\n- **Transmitter (TX) Block:** An unspecified processing block (indicated by a question mark) that processes the electrical signal from the microphone before transmitting it to the antenna.\n- **Antenna (TX):** Transmits the processed electrical signal as electromagnetic waves.\n- **Antenna (RX):** Receives electromagnetic waves from the other end and converts them back into an electrical signal.\n- **Receiver (RX) Block:** Another unspecified processing block that processes the received electrical signal before sending it to the speaker.\n- **Speaker:** Converts the processed electrical signal back into sound.\n\n2. **Information Flow:**\n- The flow starts at the microphone, where the voice is transformed into an electrical signal. This signal is then processed by the transmitter block.\n- The processed signal is sent to the TX antenna, which broadcasts it as electromagnetic waves.\n- These electromagnetic waves are picked up by the RX antenna of the receiving cellphone.\n- The RX antenna converts the electromagnetic waves back into an electrical signal, which is then processed by the receiver block.\n- Finally, the processed signal is sent to the speaker, converting it back into audible sound.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n- The diagram includes labels for the microphone, speaker, transmitter, receiver, and antennas, clearly indicating the path of signal flow from the microphone to the speaker.\n- The question marks in the transmitter and receiver blocks suggest unspecified processing, typically involving modulation, amplification, filtering, and demodulation.\n\n4. **Overall System Function:**\n- The primary function of this system is to enable voice communication between two parties using cellphones. The arrangement of components ensures efficient conversion of voice signals to and from electromagnetic waves, facilitating wireless communication over distances.\n\nFigure 1.1 (a) Simplified view of a cellphone, (b) further simplification of transmit and receive paths.\n\nLet's attempt to exclude the black boxes and construct the simple system shown in Fig. 1.1(b). How well does this system work? We make two observations. First, our voice spans frequencies from 20 Hz to 20 kHz (referred to as the \"voice band\"). Second, for an antenna to operate efficiently, i.e., to convert most of the electrical signal to electromagnetic radiation, its dimension must be a significant fraction (e.g., 25%) of the wavelength. Unfortunately, a frequency range of 20 Hz to 20 kHz corresponds to a wavelength of 1.5 x 10^7 m to 1.5 x 10^4 m, requiring enormous antennas for each cellphone. Conversely, to achieve a reasonable antenna length, e.g., 5 cm, the wavelength must be around 20 cm, and the frequency around 1.5 GHz.\n\nHow do we \"convert\" the voice band to a gigahertz center frequency? One possible approach is to multiply the voice signal, x(t), by a sinusoid, A cos(2πf_c t) [Fig. 1.2(a)]. Since multiplication in the time domain corresponds to convolution in the frequency domain, and since the spectrum of the sinusoid consists of two impulses at ±f_c, the voice spectrum is simply shifted (translated) to ±f_c [Fig. 1.2(b)]. Thus, if f_c = 1 GHz, the output occupies a bandwidth of 40 kHz centered at 1 GHz. This operation is an example of \"amplitude modulation.\"\n\n[^ 1.2 (a) Multiplication of a voice signal by a sinusoid, (b) equivalent operation in the frequency domain.\n\nWe therefore postulate that the black box in the transmitter of Fig. 1.1(a) contains a multiplier, as depicted in Fig. 1.3(a).

Your voice is transformed into an electrical signal by the microphone, processed, and transmitted via the antenna. Your friend's phone receives this signal through its antenna, processes it, and plays it through the speaker [Fig. 1.1(a)]. What happens inside these 'black boxes,' and why are they essential?\n\n[Fig. 1.1(a)] This block diagram offers a simplified perspective on a cell phone's operation during a call, showcasing the transmission (TX) and reception (RX) processes.\n\n1. **Key Components:**\n   - **Microphone:** Transforms the user's voice into an electrical signal.\n   - **Transmitter (TX) Block:** An unspecified processing unit (denoted by a question mark) that processes the microphone's electrical signal before it reaches the antenna.\n   - **Antenna (TX):** Transmits the processed electrical signal as electromagnetic waves.\n   - **Antenna (RX):** Captures electromagnetic waves and converts them back into an electrical signal.\n   - **Receiver (RX) Block:** Another unspecified processing unit that processes the received electrical signal before it reaches the speaker.\n   - **Speaker:** Converts the processed electrical signal back into audible sound.\n\n2. **Information Flow:**\n   - The flow starts at the microphone, where the voice is converted to an electrical signal.

The arrangement of components ensures efficient conversion of voice signals to and from electromagnetic waves, facilitating wireless communication over distances.\n\n[Fig. 1.1(b)] This diagram provides a simplified view of the transmit and receive paths in a cell phone communication system, omitting the detailed processing blocks found in more complex systems to focus on the essential components for basic operation.\n\n1. **Key Components:**\n   - **Microphone:** Captures the user's voice and converts it into an electrical signal, marking the start of the transmission path.\n   - **Antenna (Transmitter):** Converts the electrical signal from the microphone into electromagnetic waves, which are then transmitted through the air.\n   - **Antenna (Receiver):** Captures electromagnetic waves from the transmitting antenna and converts them back into an electrical signal.\n   - **Speaker:** Converts the electrical signal from the receiving antenna back into sound, allowing the listener to hear the transmitted voice.\n\n2. **Information Flow:**\n   - The flow starts at the microphone, where the voice is converted to an electrical signal. This signal is sent to the transmitting antenna, which emits it as electromagnetic waves.\n   - These waves travel through the air to the receiving antenna, which captures them and converts them back into an electrical signal.\n   - The signal is then directed to the speaker, which converts it into sound.\n\n3. **Labels and Indicators:**\n   - The diagram uses arrows to indicate the direction of signal flow, from the microphone to the transmitting antenna, through the air to the receiving antenna, and finally to the speaker.\n   - The absence of processing blocks between these components emphasizes the system's simplicity, focusing solely on the conversion and transmission of signals.\n\n4. **System Function:**\n   - The primary function of this simplified system is to transmit voice from one location to another using electromagnetic waves. By showcasing only the essential components (microphone, antennas, and speaker), the diagram highlights the basic process of voice capture, transmission, reception, and playback without delving into the complex processing that typically occurs in a cell phone.\n\n[Fig. 1.2(a)] This diagram illustrates the process of amplitude modulation by depicting the multiplication of a voice signal with a sinusoidal carrier signal.\n\n1. **Key Components:**\n   - **Voice Signal, \\( x(t) \\):** The input signal, a time-domain waveform representing the original audio or voice data.\n   - **Sinusoidal Carrier, \\( A \\cos(2\\pi f_{c} t) \\):** A cosine wave with amplitude \\( A \\) and frequency \\( f_c \\) that serves as the carrier signal.\n   - **Output Waveform:** The result of multiplying the voice signal by the sinusoidal carrier, depicted as a modulated waveform.\n\n2. **Information Flow:**\n   - The voice signal \\( x(t) \\) and the sinusoidal carrier \\( A \\cos(2\\pi f_{c} t) \\) are inputs to a multiplier block.\n   - These signals are multiplied together, resulting in the output waveform, which is the amplitude-modulated signal.\n\n3. **Labels and Indicators:**\n   - The voice signal is labeled as \\( x(t) \\), and the carrier signal is labeled as \\( A \\cos(2\\pi f_{c} t) \\).\n   - The output waveform is shown as a modulated signal, indicating the effect of the multiplication process.\n\n4. **System Function:**\n   - The primary function of this system is to perform amplitude modulation, where the voice signal is modulated by the carrier frequency. This process shifts the frequency spectrum of the voice signal to be centered around the carrier frequency \\( f_c \\), allowing it to be transmitted over radio frequencies. The resulting output waveform has the same frequency content as the original voice signal but is now centered at the carrier frequency, ready for transmission.\n\n[Fig. 1.2(b)] This graph illustrates the frequency domain representation of amplitude modulation, consisting of three main parts:\n\n1. **Voice Spectrum (X(f)):**\n   - **Type:** Frequency spectrum graph.\n   - **Axes:** The horizontal axis represents frequency (f) in hertz, ranging from -20 kHz to +20 kHz. The vertical axis represents amplitude, but no specific units are provided.\n   - **Behavior:** The voice spectrum is centered around 0 Hz, showing a bandwidth of 40 kHz. It has a symmetrical shape about the vertical axis, indicating the baseband frequency components of the voice signal.\n\n2. **Spectrum of Cosine:**\n   - **Type:** Impulse spectrum.\n   - **Axes:** The horizontal axis represents frequency (f) in hertz, with impulses at -f_c and +f_c.\n   - **Key Features:** Two impulses are present at the carrier frequencies -f_c and +f_c, where f_c is the carrier frequency.\n\n3. **Output Spectrum:**\n   - **Type:** Frequency spectrum graph.\n   - **Axes:** The horizontal axis represents frequency (f) in hertz, with marked points at -f_c, 0, and +f_c. The vertical axis represents amplitude.\n   - **Behavior:** The output spectrum shows two shifted versions of the original voice spectrum, centered at -f_c and +f_c, as a result of the modulation process. This indicates that the voice signal has been translated in frequency by the carrier frequency, creating sidebands around the carrier frequencies.\n\n**Overall Description:**\nThe graph demonstrates how multiplying a voice signal by a sinusoidal carrier in the time domain results in the convolution of their spectra in the frequency domain. The voice spectrum, originally centered around 0 Hz, is shifted to new frequencies centered at -f_c and +f_c, corresponding to the carrier frequency. This operation effectively translates the voice signal to a higher frequency band, a key aspect of amplitude modulation.\n\nWe posit that the black box in the transmitter of Fig. 1.1(a) contains a multiplier, as depicted in Fig. 1.3(a). However, two other issues arise. First, the cell phone must deliver a relatively high voltage swing (e.g., 20 Vpp) to the antenna to ensure that the radiated power can cover distances of several kilometers, requiring a \"power amplifier\" between the multiplier and the antenna. Second, the sinusoid \\( A \\cos 2 \\pi f_{c} t \\) must be generated by an \"oscillator.\" We thus arrive at the transmitter architecture shown in Fig. 1.3(b).\n\n[Fig. 1.3(a)] This block diagram represents a simple transmitter system used in communication devices like cell phones. It consists of the following main components:\n\n1. **Data Source (D):** This block represents the input data signal that needs to be transmitted. It is typically a low-frequency signal that contains the information to be sent.\n\n2. **Multiplier (Mixer):** The data signal from the data source is fed into a multiplier. The multiplier's function is to combine the input data signal with a high-frequency carrier signal. This process is known as modulation.\n\n3. **Carrier Signal:** The carrier signal is represented by the notation \\( A \\cos(2\\pi f_c t) \\), where \\( A \\) is the amplitude, and \\( f_c \\) is the carrier frequency. This sinusoidal signal is necessary for transmitting the data over long distances.\n\n4. **Antenna:** After modulation, the combined signal is sent to the antenna. The antenna's role is to radiate the modulated signal into space as electromagnetic waves.\n\n**Information Flow:**\n   - The data signal from the data source is input into the multiplier.\n   - Simultaneously, the carrier signal \\( A \\cos(2\\pi f_c t) \\) is also input into the multiplier.\n   - The multiplier outputs a modulated signal, which is a combination of the data signal and the carrier signal.\n   - This modulated signal is then sent to the antenna, which transmits it as radio waves.\n\n**System Function:**\n   - The primary function of this simple transmitter is to modulate a data signal with a high-frequency carrier signal and transmit it via an antenna. This allows the data to be sent over long distances, which is essential for communication systems such as cell phones. The simple architecture involves basic modulation and transmission without additional amplification or filtering stages.\n\n[Fig. 1.3(b)] This transmitter architecture is a more complete representation of a cell phone transmitter system. It consists of the following main components:\n\n1. **Data Source (D):** This is the initial block where the input signal originates. It represents the digital or analog data intended for transmission.\n\n2. **Mixer (Multiplier):** The data signal is fed into a mixer, which is responsible for combining the input signal with a carrier signal. The carrier signal is a sinusoidal waveform generated by the oscillator.\n\n3. **Oscillator:** This component produces a sinusoidal signal, denoted as \\( A \\cos(2\\pi f_c t) \\), which serves as the carrier frequency for modulation. The oscillator is connected to the mixer and provides the necessary frequency to shift the data signal to the desired transmission frequency.\n\n4. **Power Amplifier:** After modulation, the signal is passed through a power amplifier. The role of the power amplifier is to increase the amplitude of the signal, allowing it to be transmitted over long distances. This is crucial for ensuring that the signal can reach the intended receiver with sufficient strength.\n\n5. **Antenna:** The amplified signal is then sent to the antenna, which radiates the electromagnetic waves into the air for transmission.\n\n**Information Flow:**\n   - The data signal from the source is first mixed with the carrier signal from the oscillator in the mixer block. This process modulates the data onto the carrier frequency.\n   - The modulated signal is then amplified by the power amplifier to achieve the required transmission power level.\n   - Finally, the amplified signal is transmitted through the antenna.\n\n**System Function:**\n   - The primary function of this transmitter architecture is to modulate a data signal onto a higher frequency carrier, amplify it, and transmit it via an antenna. This ensures that the signal can travel over long distances to reach a receiver, which will demodulate and process the signal for the end-user. The inclusion of the oscillator and power amplifier makes this system capable of handling the requirements of real-world wireless communication, such as that used in cell phones.\n\nLet's now focus on the receive path of the cell phone, starting with the simplified realization shown in Fig. 1.1(b). Unfortunately, this topology fails to operate with the principle of modulation: if the signal received by the antenna resides around a gigahertz center frequency, the audio speaker cannot produce meaningful information. In other words, a means of translating the spectrum back to zero center frequency is necessary. For example, as depicted in Fig. 1.4(a), multiplication by a sinusoid \\( A \\cos(2 \\pi f_{c} t) \\) translates the spectrum to left and right by \\( f_{c} \\), restoring the original voice band. The newly-generated components at \\( \\pm 2 f_{c} \\) can be removed by a low-pass filter. We thus arrive at the receiver topology shown in Fig. 1.4(b).\n\n[Fig. 1.4(a)] This diagram illustrates the translation of a modulated signal to a zero-center frequency, crucial for signal processing in communication systems. This is depicted through three distinct spectra: the Received Spectrum, the Spectrum of Cosine, and the Output Spectrum.\n\n1. **Type of Graph and Function:**\n   - This is a frequency domain representation showing the spectral translation of signals.\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n   - The horizontal axis represents frequency \\( f \\), marked with significant points at \\(-f_c\\), \\(0\\), \\(+f_c\\), \\(-2f_c\\), and \\(+2f_c\\). There are no specific units marked, but frequency is typically measured in hertz (Hz).\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n   - The Received Spectrum shows two main lobes centered around \\(-f_c\\) and \\(+f_c\\). The Spectrum of Cosine is represented by two delta functions at \\(-f_c\\) and \\(+f_c\\), indicating the frequency components of the cosine wave used for mixing.\n   - The Output Spectrum results from the multiplication of the Received Spectrum with the Spectrum of Cosine, showing three sets of lobes centered at \\(-2f_c\\), \\(0\\), and \\(+2f_c\\). This indicates the translation of the spectrum to a zero-center frequency and the generation of additional components at \\(\\pm 2f_c\\).\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n   - The Received Spectrum is the initial modulated signal with its frequency components shifted by \\(f_c\\).\n   - The Spectrum of Cosine is used to mix with the Received Spectrum, effectively shifting the frequency components.\n   - The Output Spectrum shows that the original voice band is restored at zero frequency, while new components appear at \\(\\pm 2f_c\\), which can be removed by a low-pass filter.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n   - The diagram uses dotted lines to indicate the center of each spectral component.\n   - The arrows in the Spectrum of Cosine highlight the points of frequency translation.\n\nThis diagram effectively demonstrates the process of frequency translation in signal processing, illustrating how a modulated signal can be shifted back to its original baseband frequency using a mixing technique with a cosine wave.\n\n[Fig. 1.4(b)] This system block diagram represents a simple receiver topology for processing a modulated signal received by an antenna. The primary components and their functions are as follows:\n\n1. **Antenna**: This is the initial input point for the system, receiving the modulated radio frequency signals from the environment.\n\n2. **Mixer**: The received signal from the antenna is fed into a mixer. The mixer combines the incoming signal with a sinusoidal signal generated by an oscillator. This process translates the frequency of the signal down, centering it at zero frequency, which is necessary for further processing.\n\n3. **Oscillator**: This component generates a sinusoidal signal at a specified frequency. The frequency of this signal is used to mix with the incoming signal, effectively shifting its spectrum. This is a critical step for demodulating the signal.\n\n4. **Low-Pass Filter**: After mixing, the signal is passed through a low-pass filter. The filter removes high-frequency components generated during mixing, specifically the components at twice the oscillator frequency (±2f_c), isolating the desired baseband signal.\n\n5. **Speaker**: The filtered signal is finally sent to the speaker, which converts the electrical signal back into sound waves, allowing for audio output.\n\n**Information Flow:**\n   - The signal flow begins at the antenna, moves through the mixer where it is combined with the oscillator signal, and then passes through the low-pass filter. The output of the filter is sent directly to the speaker.\n\n**System Function:**\n   - The primary function of this receiver topology is to demodulate a received modulated signal and convert it into an audio signal that can be output through a speaker. The arrangement of components effectively translates the received spectrum to a baseband signal, filters out unwanted frequencies, and provides an audio output.\n\n[Fig. 1.4(c)] This system block diagram represents a more complete receiver topology designed to process and amplify weak signals received by an antenna.\n\n1. **Key Components:**\n   - **Antenna:** Captures the incoming radio frequency signals.\n   - **Low-Noise Amplifier (LNA):** The first component after the antenna, which amplifies the weak received signals with minimal added noise, improving the signal-to-noise ratio.\n   - **Mixer**: Combines the amplified signal with a locally generated signal from an oscillator to translate the frequency of the incoming signal.\n   - **Oscillator**: Generates a sinusoidal signal used by the mixer to shift the frequency of the received signal.\n   - **Low-Pass Filter**: Removes unwanted high-frequency components generated during the mixing process, allowing only the desired baseband or low-frequency signal to pass through.\n   - **Amplifier**: Further amplifies the filtered signal to a level suitable for driving an audio speaker.\n   - **Speaker**: Converts the electrical signals back into sound for the user to hear.\n\n2. **Information Flow:**\n   - The signal flow begins at the antenna, where the incoming radio frequency signals are captured and sent to the Low-Noise Amplifier.\n   - The amplified signal from the LNA is then fed into the mixer.\n   - Simultaneously, the oscillator provides a local frequency signal to the mixer.\n   - The mixer outputs a signal that is a combination of the input signal and the oscillator's frequency, effectively shifting the frequency of the input signal.\n   - This mixed signal is passed through the low-pass filter, which removes high-frequency noise and retains the baseband signal.\n   - The filtered signal is then amplified by the amplifier to a level sufficient for sound reproduction.\n   - Finally, the amplified signal drives the speaker, producing audible sound.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n   - The diagram labels each component clearly, indicating their function (e.g., \"Low-Noise Ampl"

    "text": "Another consumer product that has significantly altered our habits and routines by \"going electronic\" is the digital camera. With traditional cameras, we lacked immediate feedback on photo quality, had to be meticulous in selecting and shooting scenes to conserve film, carried cumbersome rolls of film, and only saw the final result in printed form. In contrast, digital cameras resolve these issues and offer numerous features enabled by electronic processing, such as transmitting images via cellphones or retouching photos using computers. In this section, we delve into the operation of the digital camera.\n\nThe camera's \"front end\" must convert light into electricity, a task handled by an array (matrix) of \"pixels.\" Each pixel comprises an electronic device (a \"photodiode\") that generates a current proportional to the light intensity it receives. As depicted in Fig. 1.5(a), this current flows through a capacitance, $C_{L}$, for a specific duration, creating a proportional voltage across it. Thus, each pixel provides a voltage corresponding to the \"local\" light density.\n\nConsider a camera with 6.25 million pixels arranged in a $2500 \\times 2500$ array [Fig. 1.5(b)]. How is the output voltage of each pixel sensed and processed? If each pixel includes its own electronic circuitry, the overall array would occupy a substantial area, increasing cost and power dissipation significantly. Therefore, we must \"time-share\" the signal processing circuits among pixels. To achieve this, we follow the circuit of Fig. 1.5(a) with a simple, compact amplifier and a switch (within the pixel) [Fig. 1.5(c)]. We then connect a wire to the outputs of all 2500 pixels in a \"column,\" activate only one switch at a time, and apply the corresponding voltage to the \"signal processing\" block outside the column.\n\n**Image Descriptions:**\n\n- **(a)** The circuit includes a photodiode (D1) connected between Vout and GND, and a capacitor (CL) in parallel to stabilize the output voltage Vout when the photodiode is exposed to light.\n\n- **(b)** This block diagram illustrates a 2500 by 2500 pixel array in a digital camera's sensor. Each pixel contains a photodiode for converting light into electrical signals. The array is organized into 2500 columns and rows, totaling 6,250,000 pixels. Incoming light strikes the photodiodes, generating voltages proportional to light intensity. These signals are processed by dedicated signal processing blocks for each column, enabling efficient, parallel image data processing.\n\n- **(c)** The amplifier circuit consists of multiple stages, each with a diode, capacitor, op-amp, and switch. The output of each op-amp is connected through a switch to a common node X1, leading to a signal processing block. The diodes and capacitors condition and stabilize the input signals.\n\n**Figure 1.5:** (a) Photodiode operation, (b) pixel array in a digital camera, (c) one column of the array.\n\nThe entire array comprises 2500 such columns, each with a dedicated signal processing block.\n\n**Example:** A digital camera focuses on a chessboard.

Practically, the optimal choice lies between these two extremes.\n\n- **Figure 1.7**:\n  - The circuit diagram shows a configuration where each OpAmp (A1 to A4) is connected to a diode and capacitor, forming a basic signal processing unit. These units are connected to switches (SW1 to SW4) that direct the processed signals to nodes (X1 and X2). The signals from X1 and X2 are then fed into an ADC, which digitizes the analog signals. This setup allows sharing one ADC between two columns of a pixel array, optimizing ADC use through time-sharing.\n\n**Digital Domain Manipulation**:\nOnce in the digital domain, the \"video\" signal collected by the camera can be extensively manipulated. For instance, to \"zoom in,\" the digital signal processor (DSP) simply considers a section of the array, discarding information from the remaining pixels. Additionally, to reduce memory requirements, the processor \"compresses\" the video signal.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe digital camera exemplifies the extensive use of both analog and digital microelectronics. Analog functions include amplification, switching, and analog-to-digital conversion, while digital functions encompass subsequent signal processing and storage."

One might argue, \"Since I don't plan to work for a cellphone or camera manufacturer, I don't need to learn about analog circuits.\" Given the prevalence of digital communications, digital signal processors, and the digitization of other functions, one might wonder about the future relevance of analog design.\n\nHowever, some premises in these assertions are flawed.

    "text": "An electric signal is a waveform that conveys information. Natural signals can take any value within a specified range, known as \"analog\" signals, including voice, video, seismic, and music waveforms. As shown in Fig. 1.9(a), an analog voltage\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:Figure 1.9(a) illustrates an analog signal waveform in the time domain. The horizontal axis is marked 't' for time, and the vertical axis is labeled 'V(t)' for voltage, with both axes having a linear scale.\n\nThe waveform displays a continuous, smooth oscillatory pattern typical of analog signals, featuring multiple peaks and valleys with varying amplitudes and frequencies. It begins with a negative peak and undergoes a series of oscillations that gradually increase in amplitude, reaching a significant positive peak before declining again.\n\nKey characteristics include several maxima and minima, indicating the highest and lowest voltage values over time, and inflection points where the waveform's curvature changes, contributing to its overall smoothness. The signal lacks a fixed period, suggesting it may represent a complex or non-repetitive signal.\n\nThis graph visually demonstrates how analog signals can vary continuously over time, capturing the essence of natural signals like voice or music.\nimage_name:(b)\ndescription:The graph labeled \"(b)\" shows a time-domain waveform illustrating the impact of noise on an analog signal. The x-axis represents time \\( t \\), and the y-axis represents the voltage \\( V(t) + \\text{Noise} \\), both with linear scales, though specific units and values are not provided.\n\n**Overall Behavior and Trends:**\nThe waveform is highly erratic and jagged, indicating significant noise interference. Unlike a smooth analog signal, it exhibits rapid fluctuations and irregular oscillations around the zero voltage line, suggesting substantial distortion.\n\n**Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The waveform lacks a consistent pattern, with frequent peaks and valleys occurring in quick succession.\n- There are no apparent periodic patterns, indicating that the noise is random and not cyclic.\n- The amplitude of fluctuations varies, with some peaks reaching higher voltages than others, but specific values are not marked.\n\n**Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- The graph lacks specific annotations or markers for key data points or reference lines.\n- It is primarily qualitative, demonstrating the concept of noise rather than providing precise measurements.\n\nThis representation effectively illustrates the disruptive impact of noise on an analog signal, making it difficult to discern the original waveform's characteristics.\n\nFigure 1.9 (a) Analog signal, (b) effect of noise on analog signal.\n\n[^1]waveform fluctuates through a \"continuum\" of values, providing information at each moment in time.\n\nThough prevalent in our environment, analog signals are challenging to \"process\" due to their sensitivity to circuit imperfections like \"noise\" and \"distortion.\" ${ }^{5}$ For instance, Fig. 1.9(b) demonstrates the effect of noise. Additionally, analog signals are difficult to \"store\" because they require \"analog memories\" (e.g., capacitors).\n\nIn contrast, a digital signal takes only a finite number of values at specific times. Fig. 1.10(a) depicts a \"binary\" waveform, which remains at one of two levels for each period, $T$. As long as the voltages corresponding to ONEs and ZEROs differ sufficiently, logical circuits can correctly process the signal, even if noise or distortion causes some corruption [Fig. 1.10(b)]. Hence, digital signals are considered more \"robust\" than analog signals. Storing binary signals in digital memory is also much simpler.\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:1. **Type of Graph and Function:** The graph in Fig. 1.10(a) shows a time-domain waveform representing a digital signal, specifically a binary waveform that alternates between two distinct voltage levels.\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:** The horizontal axis is labeled \\( t \\) for time, and the vertical axis is labeled \\( V(t) \\) for voltage. The time axis is linear, and the waveform is periodic with a period denoted by \\( T \\).\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:** The waveform displays a square wave pattern, alternating between two voltage levels labeled \"ONE\" and \"ZERO.\" Each level is maintained for one period \\( T \\) before switching, creating a rectangular shape. The waveform is consistent and periodic, indicating a stable digital signal.\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:** The primary feature is its binary nature, with distinct and stable voltage levels for \"ONE\" and \"ZERO.\" Transitions between these levels are sharp and instantaneous, typical of digital signals. There are no intermediate levels or gradual changes, highlighting the robustness of the digital format.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:** The graph includes annotations for \"ONE\" and \"ZERO\" levels, indicating the high and low voltage states, respectively. The period \\( T \\) is marked on the time axis, showing the duration each voltage level is maintained before switching.\nimage_name:(b)\ndescription:The graph labeled \"(b)\" shows a time-domain waveform of a digital signal affected by noise. The horizontal axis represents time \\( t \\), and the vertical axis represents voltage \\( V(t) + \\text{Noise} \\). The waveform illustrates how noise impacts a digital signal, which ideally alternates between two distinct voltage levels representing binary ONEs and ZEROs.\n\n1. **Type of Graph and Function:**\n- This is a time-domain waveform showing the effect of noise on a digital signal.\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n- The horizontal axis is labeled \\( t \\) for time, without specific units marked.\n- The vertical axis is labeled \\( V(t) + \\text{Noise} \\), indicating voltage with noise.\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- The waveform shows a noisy signal fluctuating around a central level, with noise causing rapid, irregular oscillations around the ideal binary levels.\n- Despite the noise, the underlying binary structure remains discernible, with periods of high (ONE) and low (ZERO) voltage levels.\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- Noise introduces significant variability, causing deviations from the ideal square shape.\n- No specific numerical values or scales are provided, but the graph suggests potential momentary misinterpretations of the binary state due to noise.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- The graph lacks specific annotations or markers, but the effect of noise is visually evident as it distorts the clean transitions between binary states.\n\nFigure 1.10 (a) Digital signal, (b) effect of noise on digital signal.\n\nThese observations support the preference for processing signals in the digital domain, suggesting that inherently analog information should be converted to digital form as early as possible. Indeed, complex microelectronic systems like digital cameras, camcorders, and compact disk (CD) recorders perform some analog processing, \"analog-to-digital conversion,\" and digital processing (Fig. 1.11), with the first two functions being crucial for signal quality.\nimage_name:Figure 1.11\ndescription:Figure 1.11 presents a system block diagram illustrating signal handling in a typical microelectronic system, focusing on the conversion and processing of analog signals into digital form. The diagram comprises three main components arranged sequentially:\n\n1. **Analog Signal**: This is the input, representing inherently analog information that needs processing. It is the starting point for the signal processing sequence.\n\n2. **Analog Processing**: The first block processes the analog signal, involving amplification, filtering, or other modifications to prepare it for conversion. The goal is to optimize signal quality before digitization.\n\n3. **Analog-to-Digital Conversion**: This block converts the processed analog signal into a digital format, a critical step for handling inherently analog information in digital systems.

The hard disk is shown as a circular disk with a central hole, typical of hard disk drives. Above the disk, a read/write head is positioned close to the surface, indicating the data reading point.\n\nTo the right of the hard disk, a waveform represents the analog signal picked up from the disk. The waveform is irregular and jagged, indicating distortion and noise typical of raw data read from the disk. The amplitude of this waveform is approximately 3 millivolts, highlighting the small signal level retrieved.\n\nThe horizontal axis of the waveform is labeled 't' for time, indicating a time-domain representation of the signal. A vertical double-headed arrow next to the waveform denotes the amplitude of about 3 millivolts, illustrating the challenge of processing such low-amplitude signals and the need for amplification and further analog processing to convert the data into a usable digital form.\n\nFigure 1.12 Signal picked up from a hard disk in a computer.\n```"

The absence of clear periodicity or trends reflects the randomness of noisy signals. The NOT gate symbol suggests the circuit's role in inverting the noisy input signal.\n\nConsider the circuit in Fig. 1.17, where switch $S_{1}$ is controlled by the digital input $A$. If $A$ is high, $S_{1}$ is on, and vice versa. Prove that this circuit performs the NOT function.\n\n**Figure 1.17**\n\nThe circuit in Fig. 1.17 is a NOT gate implementation using a switch and resistor. When input $A$ is high, $S_{1}$ closes, forcing $V_{\\text{out}}$ to GND. When $A$ is low, $S_{1}$ opens, and $V_{\\text{out}}$ is pulled high to $V_{DD}$ through $R_{L}$.\n\n**Solution:** If $A$ is high, $S_{1}$ is on, making $V_{\\text{out}}$ zero. Conversely, if $A$ is low, $S_{1}$ is off, drawing no current from $R_{L}$. Thus, the voltage drop across $R_{L}$ is zero, resulting in $V_{\\text{out}} = V_{DD}$, meaning the output is high. This demonstrates that the output state is always opposite to the input state.\n\n**Exercise:** Determine the logical function if $S_{1}$ and $R_{L}$ are swapped and $V_{\\text{out}}$ is measured across $R_{L}$.\n\nThis example highlights that switches can execute logical operations. Early digital circuits used mechanical switches (relays) but were limited to speeds of a few kilohertz. The advent of transistors and their use as switches enabled the creation of digital circuits with millions of gates operating at speeds of several gigahertz."

This passage is dedicated to revisiting these pivotal concepts.\n\nKirchoff's Laws are fundamental to circuit analysis.

KVL stems from the conservation of the electromotive force. The example in Fig. 1.19(a) demonstrates that the sum of voltages around a loop equals zero: $V_{1}+V_{2}+V_{3}+V_{4}=0$. Fig. 1.19(b) presents an alternative perspective, illustrating that $V_{1}$ is equivalent to the sum of the voltages across elements 2, 3, and 4: $V_{1}=V_{2}+V_{3}+V_{4}$. It's important to note that the polarities assigned to $V_{2}$, $V_{3}$, and $V_{4}$ in Fig. 1.19(b) differ from those in Fig. 1.19(a).\n\nWhen analyzing circuits, initial uncertainty about the correct polarities of currents and voltages is common.

The analysis involves applying KCL and KVL to determine the voltage gain of the amplifiers.\n\nThevenin's and Norton's theorems are introduced as powerful tools that simplify circuit analysis and offer deeper insights into circuit behavior. Thevenin's theorem states that any linear one-port network can be replaced by an equivalent circuit consisting of a voltage source in series with an impedance. Norton's theorem, on the other hand, asserts that the same network can be represented by a current source in parallel with an impedance.\n\nThe examples demonstrate how to compute the Thevenin and Norton equivalents of various circuits, which is crucial for understanding the interaction between circuits and subsequent stages or loads.

KVL stems from the conservation of the \"electromotive force.\" In the example illustrated in Fig. 1.19(a), we may sum the voltages in the loop to zero: $V_{1}+V_{2}+V_{3}+V_{4}=0$. Alternatively, adopting the modified view shown in Fig. 1.19(b), we can say $V_{1}$ is equal to the sum of the voltages across elements 2, 3, and 4: $V_{1}=V_{2}+V_{3}+V_{4}$. Note that the polarities assigned to $V_{2}$, $V_{3}$, and $V_{4}$ in Fig. 1.19(b) are different from those in Fig. 1.19(a).\n\nIn circuit analysis, we may not know beforehand the correct polarities of the currents and voltages. Nonetheless, we can simply assign arbitrary polarities, write KCLs and KVLs, and solve the equations to obtain the actual polarities and values.

Next, noting that the currents $v_{\\pi} / r_{\\pi}$ and $g_{m} v_{\\pi}$ flow into the output node, and the current $v_{\\text {out }} / R_{E}$ flows out of it, we write a KCL:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{v_{\\pi}}{r_{\\pi}}+g_{m} v_{\\pi}=\\frac{v_{\\text {out }}}{R_{E}} \\tag{1.13}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSubstituting $v_{\\text {in }}-v_{\\text {out }}$ for $v_{\\pi}$ gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{\\text {in }}\\left(\\frac{1}{r_{\\pi}}+g_{m}\\right)=v_{\\text {out }}\\left(\\frac{1}{R_{E}}+\\frac{1}{r_{\\pi}}+g_{m}\\right), \\tag{1.14}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand hence\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{v_{\\text {out }}}{v_{\\text {in }}} & =\\frac{\\frac{1}{r_{\\pi}}+g_{m}}{\\frac{1}{R_{E}}+\\frac{1}{r_{\\pi}}+g_{m}}  \\tag{1.15}\\\\\n& =\\frac{\\left(1+g_{m} r_{\\pi}\\right) R_{E}}{r_{\\pi}+\\left(1+g_{m} r_{\\pi}\\right) R_{E}} \\tag{1.16}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nNote that the voltage gain always remains below unity. Would such an amplifier prove useful at all? In fact, this topology exhibits some important properties that make it a versatile building block.\n\nExercise: Repeat the above example if $r_{\\pi} \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n\nThe aforementioned examples relate to three amplifier topologies that are studied extensively in Chapter 5.\n\nThevenin and Norton Equivalents: While Kirchoff's laws can always be employed to solve any circuit, the Thevenin and Norton theorems can both simplify the algebra and, more importantly, provide additional insight into the operation of a circuit.\n\nThevenin's theorem asserts that a (linear) one-port network can be replaced with an equivalent circuit consisting of one voltage source in series with one impedance. Illustrated in Fig. 1.23(a), the term \"port\" refers to any two nodes whose voltage difference is of interest. The equivalent voltage, $v_{\\text {Thev }}$, is obtained by leaving the port open and computing the voltage created by the actual circuit at this port. The equivalent impedance, $Z_{\\text {Thev }}$, is determined by setting all independent voltage and current sources in the circuit to zero and calculating the impedance between the two nodes. We also call $Z_{\\text {Thev }}$ the impedance \"seen\" when \"looking\" into the output port [Fig. 1.23(b)]. The impedance is computed by applying a voltage source across the port and obtaining the resulting current. A few examples illustrate these principles.\n\nSuppose the input voltage source and the amplifier shown in Fig. 1.20 are placed in a box and only the output port is of interest [Fig. 1.24(a)]. Determine the Thevenin equivalent of the circuit.\n\nSolution\n\nWe must compute the open-circuit output voltage and the impedance seen when looking into the output port. The Thevenin voltage is obtained from Fig. 1.24(a) and Eq. (1.9):\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv_{\\text {Thev }} & =v_{\\text {out }}  \\tag{1.17}\\\\\n& =-g_{m} R_{L} v_{\\text {in }} . \\tag{1.18}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nTo calculate $Z_{\\text {Thev }}$, we set $v_{\\text {in }}$ to zero, apply a voltage source, $v_{X}$, across the output port, and determine the current drawn from the voltage source, $i_{X}$. As shown in Fig. 1.24(b), setting $v_{\\text {in }}$ to zero means replacing it with a short circuit. Also, note that the current source $g_{m} v_{\\pi}$ remains in the circuit because it depends on the voltage across $r_{\\pi}$, whose value is not known a priori.\n\nFigure 1.24\n\nHow do we solve the circuit of Fig. 1.24(b)? We must again eliminate $v_{\\pi}$. Fortunately, since both terminals of $r_{\\pi}$ are tied to ground, $v_{\\pi}=0$ and $g_{m} v_{\\pi}=0$. The circuit thus reduces to $R_{L}$ and\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{X}=\\frac{v_{X}}{R_{L}} \\tag{1.19}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThat is,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{\\text {Thev }}=R_{L} \\tag{1.20}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFigure 1.24(c) depicts the Thevenin equivalent of the input voltage source and the amplifier. In this case, we call $R_{\\text {Thev }}\\left(=R_{L}\\right)$ the \"output impedance\" of the circuit.\n\nExercise: Repeat the above example if $r_{\\pi} \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n\nWith the Thevenin equivalent of a circuit available, we can readily analyze its behavior in the presence of a subsequent stage or \"load.\"\n\nExample 1.9\n\nThe amplifier of Fig. 1.20 must drive a speaker having an impedance of $R_{s p}$. Determine the voltage delivered to the speaker.\n\nFigure 1.25\n\nSolution: Shown in Fig. 1.25(a) is the overall circuit arrangement that we must solve. Replacing the section in the dashed box with its Thevenin equivalent from Fig. 1.24(c), we greatly simplify the circuit [Fig. 1.25(b)], and write\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv_{\\text {out }} & =-g_{m} R_{L} v_{\\text {in }} \\frac{R_{s p}}{R_{s p}+R_{L}}  \\tag{1.21}\\\\\n& =-g_{m} v_{\\text {in }}\\left(R_{L} \\| R_{s p}\\right) . \\tag{1.22}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nExercise: Repeat the above example if $r_{\\pi} \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n\nExample: Determine the Thevenin equivalent of the circuit shown in Fig. 1.22 if the output port is 1.10 of interest.\n\nSolution: The open-circuit output voltage is simply obtained from (1.16):\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{\\text {Thev }}=\\frac{\\left(1+g_{m} r_{\\pi}\\right) R_{L}}{r_{\\pi}+\\left(1+g_{m} r_{\\pi}\\right) R_{L}} v_{i n} \\tag{1.23}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nTo calculate the Thevenin impedance, we set $v_{i n}$ to zero and apply a voltage source across the output port as depicted in Fig. 1.26. To eliminate $v_{\\pi}$, we recognize that the two terminals of $r_{\\pi}$ are tied to those of $v_{X}$ and hence\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{\\pi}=-v_{X} . \\tag{1.24}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFigure 1.26\n\nWe now write a KCL at the output node. The currents $v_{\\pi} / r_{\\pi}, g_{m} v_{\\pi}$, and $i_{X}$ flow into this node and the current $v_{X} / R_{L}$ flows out of it. Consequently,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{v_{\\pi}}{r_{\\pi}}+g_{m} v_{\\pi}+i_{X}=\\frac{v_{X}}{R_{L}} \\tag{1.25}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left(\\frac{1}{r_{\\pi}}+g_{m}\\right)\\left(-v_{X}\\right)+i_{X}=\\frac{v_{X}}{R_{L}} . \\tag{1.26}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThat is,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nR_{\\text {Thev }} & =\\frac{v_{X}}{i_{X}}  \\tag{1.27}\\\\\n& =\\frac{r_{\\pi} R_{L}}{r_{\\pi}+\\left(1+g_{m} r_{\\pi}\\right) R_{L}} \\tag{1.28}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nExercise: What happens if $R_{L}=\\infty$ ?\n\nNorton's theorem states that a (linear) one-port network can be represented by one current source in parallel with one impedance (Fig. 1.27). The equivalent current, $i_{\\text {Nor }}$, is obtained by shorting the port of interest and computing the current that flows through it. The equivalent impedance, $Z_{\\mathrm{Nor}}$, is determined by setting all independent voltage and current sources in the circuit to zero and calculating the impedance seen at the port. Of course, $Z_{\\text {Nor }}=Z_{\\text {Thev }}$.\n\nFigure 1.27\n\nExample 1.11\n\nSolution: As depicted in Fig. 1.28(a), we short the output port and seek the value of $i_{\\text {Nor }}$. Since the voltage across $R_{L}$ is now forced to zero, this resistor carries no current.\n\nFigure 1.28\n\nDetermine the Norton equivalent of the circuit shown in Fig. 1.20 if the output port is of interest.\n\nA KCL at the output node thus yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ni_{\\text {Nor }} & =-g_{m} v_{\\pi}  \\tag{1.29}\\\\\n& =-g_{m} v_{i n} \\tag{1.30}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nAlso, from Example $1.8, R_{\\text {Nor }}\\left(=R_{\\text {Thev }}\\right)=R_{L}$. The Norton equivalent therefore emerges as shown in Fig. 1.28(b). To check the validity of this model, we observe that the flow of $i_{\\text {Nor }}$ through $R_{L}$ produces a voltage of $-g_{m} R_{L} v_{i n}$, the same as the output voltage of the original circuit.\n\nExercise: Repeat the above example if a resistor of value $R_{1}$ is added between the top terminal of $v_{\\text {in }}$ and the output node.\n\nExample: Determine the Norton equivalent of the circuit shown in Fig. 1.22 if the output port is 1.12 interest.\n\nSolution: Shorting the output port as illustrated in Fig. 1.29(a), we note that $R_{L}$ carries no current. Thus,\n\nFigure 1.29\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{\\text {Nor }}=\\frac{v_{\\pi}}{r_{\\pi}}+g_{m} v_{\\pi} . \\tag{1.31}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAlso, $v_{i n}=v_{\\pi}$ (why?), yielding\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{\\text {Nor }}=\\left(\\frac{1}{r_{\\pi}}+g_{m}\\right) v_{i n} \\tag{1.32}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWith the aid of $R_{\\text {Thev }}$ found in Example 1.10, we construct the Norton equivalent depicted in Fig. 1.29(b).\n\nExercise: What happens if $r_{\\pi}=\\infty$ ?"

This section offers a summary of these key concepts.\n\nKirchoff's Laws\nKirchoff's Current Law (KCL) asserts that the total current entering a node is zero (refer to Fig. 1.18). Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\sum_{j} I_{j}=0 \\tag{1.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nKCL is a consequence of the conservation of charge: if the sum were not zero, it would imply that either charge is disappearing at node $X$ or that the node itself generates charge. Figure 1.18 depicts KCL with a node labeled $X1$, where multiple currents converge.\n\nKirchoff's Voltage Law (KVL) posits that the sum of voltage drops around any closed loop in a circuit is zero (refer to Fig. 1.19(a)). This can be represented as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\sum_{j} V_{j}=0 \\tag{1.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHere, $V_{j}$ represents the voltage drop across the $j$th element. KVL is derived from the conservation of electromotive force. In the example shown in Fig. 1.19(a), the voltages around the loop sum to zero: $V_{1}+V_{2}+V_{3}+V_{4}=0$. Alternatively, in the modified view of Fig. 1.19(b), $V_{1}$ equals the sum of the voltages across elements 2, 3, and 4: $V_{1}=V_{2}+V_{3}+V_{4}$. The polarities assigned to $V_{2}$, $V_{3}$, and $V_{4}$ in Fig. 1.19(b) differ from those in Fig. 1.19(a).\n\nIn circuit analysis, the correct polarities of currents and voltages may not be initially known. However, one can assign arbitrary polarities, apply KCLs and KVLs, and solve the resulting equations to determine the actual polarities and values.\n\nDependent current source $i_{1}$ is equal to a constant, $g_{m},{ }^{6}$ multiplied by the voltage drop across $r_{\\pi}$. Determine the voltage gain of the amplifier, $v_{\\text {out }} / v_{\\text {in }}$.\n${ }^{6}$ What is the dimension of $g_{m}$ ?\n\nFigure 1.20 shows another amplifier topology.

The negative sign signifies that the circuit inverts the signal.\n\nThevenin and Norton Equivalents\nKirchoff's laws are always applicable for solving circuits, but Thevenin's and Norton's theorems can simplify the algebra and offer deeper insights into circuit operation.\n\nThevenin's theorem states that a linear one-port network can be replaced by an equivalent circuit consisting of a single voltage source in series with a single impedance. In Fig. 1.23(a), the \"port\" refers to any two nodes whose voltage difference is of interest.

Next, considering that the currents $v_{\\pi} / r_{\\pi}$ and $g_{m} v_{\\pi}$ flow into the output node, and the current $v_{\\text {out }} / R_{E}$ flows out of it, apply a KCL:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{v_{\\pi}}{r_{\\pi}}+g_{m} v_{\\pi}=\\frac{v_{\\text {out }}}{R_{E}} \\tag{1.13}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSubstituting $v_{\\text {in }}-v_{\\text {out }}$ for $v_{\\pi}$ results in\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{\\text {in }}\\left(\\frac{1}{r_{\\pi}}+g_{m}\\right)=v_{\\text {out }}\\left(\\frac{1}{R_{E}}+\\frac{1}{r_{\\pi}}+g_{m}\\right), \\tag{1.14}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand hence\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{v_{\\text {out }}}{v_{\\text {in }}} & =\\frac{\\frac{1}{r_{\\pi}}+g_{m}}{\\frac{1}{R_{E}}+\\frac{1}{r_{\\pi}}+g_{m}}  \\tag{1.15}\\\\\n& =\\frac{\\left(1+g_{m} r_{\\pi}\\right) R_{E}}{r_{\\pi}+\\left(1+g_{m} r_{\\pi}\\right) R_{E}} \\tag{1.16}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe voltage gain always remains below unity. Nonetheless\nThevenin and Norton Equivalents\n\nWhile Kirchoff's laws are always applicable for solving any circuit, Thevenin's and Norton's theorems offer a simplification of the algebraic process and, more significantly, provide deeper insights into circuit behavior.\n\nThevenin's theorem asserts that a linear one-port network can be substituted with an equivalent circuit comprising\nWhile Kirchoff's laws are always applicable for solving any circuit, Thevenin's and Norton's theorems offer a simplification of the algebraic process and, more significantly, provide deeper insights into circuit behavior.\n\nThevenin's theorem asserts that a linear one-port network can be substituted with an equivalent circuit consisting of a single voltage source in series with a single impedance. The term \"port\" refers to any two nodes where the voltage difference is of interest. The equivalent voltage, $v_{\\text {Thev }}$, is determined by leaving the port open and calculating the voltage generated by the actual circuit at this port. The equivalent impedance, $Z_{\\text {Thev }}$, is calculated by setting all independent voltage and current sources in the circuit to zero and measuring the impedance between the two nodes. We also refer to $Z_{\\text {Thev }}$ as the impedance \"seen\" when \"looking\" into the output port. The impedance is determined by applying a voltage source across the port and measuring the resulting current. Several few examples will illustrate these principles.\n\nConsider the input voltage source and the amplifier shown in Fig. 1.20, which are enclosed in a box, and only the output port is of interest. Determine the Thevenin equivalent of the circuit.\n\nThe Thevenin voltage is obtained from Fig. 1.24(a) and Eq. (1.9):\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv_{\\text {Thev }} & =v_{\\text {out }}  \\tag{1.17}\\\\\n& =-g_{m} R_{L} v_{\\text {in }} . \\tag{1.18}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nTo calculate $Z_{\\text {Thev }}$, we set $v_{\\text {in }}$ to zero, apply a voltage source, $v_{X}$, across the output port, and determine the current drawn from the voltage source, $i_{X}$. As shown in Fig. 1.24(b), setting $v_{\\text {in }}$ to zero means replacing it with a short circuit. Also, note that the current source $g_{m} v_{\\pi}$ remains in the circuit because it depends on the voltage across $r_{\\pi}$, whose value is not known a priori.\n\nHow do we solve the circuit of Fig. 1.24(b)? We must again eliminate $v_{\\pi}$. Fortunately, since both terminals of $r_{\\pi}$ are tied to ground, $v_{\\pi}=0$ and $g_{m} v_{\\pi}=0$. The circuit thus reduces to $R_{L}$ and\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{X}=\\frac{v_{X}}{R_{L}} \\tag{1.19}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThat is,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{\\text {Thev }}=R_{L} \\tag{1.20}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFigure 1.24(c) depicts the Thevenin equivalent of the input voltage source and the amplifier. In this case, we call $R_{\\text {Thev }}\\left(=R_{L}\\right)$ the \"output impedance\" of the circuit.\n\nWith the Thevenin equivalent of a circuit available, we can readily analyze its behavior in the presence of a subsequent stage or \"load.\"\n\nConsider the amplifier of Fig. 1.20, which must drive a speaker having an impedance of $R_{s p}$. Determine the voltage delivered to the speaker.\n\nShown in Fig. 1.25(a) is the overall circuit arrangement that we must solve. Replacing the section in the dashed box with its Thevenin equivalent from Fig. 1.24(c), we greatly simplify the circuit [Fig. 1.25(b)], and write\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv_{\\text {out }} & =-g_{m} R_{L} v_{\\text {in }} \\frac{R_{s p}}{R_{s p}+R_{L}}  \\tag{1.21}\\\\\n& =-g_{m} v_{\\text {in }}\\left(R_{L} \\| R_{s p}\\right) . \\tag{1.22}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nNorton's theorem states that a linear one-port network can be represented by a single current source in parallel with a single impedance. The equivalent current, $i_{\\text {Nor }}$, is obtained by shorting the port of interest and calculating the current that flows through it. The equivalent impedance, $Z_{\\mathrm{Nor}}$, is determined by setting all independent voltage and current sources in the circuit to zero and calculating the impedance seen at the port. Of course, $Z_{\\text {Nor }}=Z_{\\text {Thev }}$.\n\nConsider\nNorton's theorem pos that a linear one-port network can be represented by a single current source in parallel with a single impedance.

The equivalent impedance, $Z_{\\mathrm{Nor}}$, is determined by setting all independent voltage and current sources in the circuit to zero and calculating the impedance seen at the port. Of course, $Z_{\\text {Nor }}=Z_{\\text {Thev }}$.\n\nExample 1.11\n\nDetermine the Norton equivalent of the circuit shown in Fig. 1.20 if the output port is of interest.\n\nAs depicted in Fig. 1.28(a), we short the output port and seek the value of $i_{\\text {Nor }}$. Since the voltage across $R_{L}$ is now forced to zero, this resistor carries no current. A KCL at the output node thus yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ni_{\\text {Nor }} & =-g_{m} v_{\\pi}  \\tag{1.29}\\\\\n& =-g_{m} v_{i n} \\tag{1.30}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nAlso, from Example 1.8, $R_{\\text {Nor }}\\left(=R_{\\text {Thev }}\\right)=R_{L}$. The Norton equivalent therefore emerges as shown in Fig. 1.28(b). To check the validity of this model, we observe that the flow of $i_{\\text {Nor }}$ through $R_{L}$ produces a voltage of $-g_{m} R_{L} v_{i n}$, the same as the output voltage of the original circuit.\n\nRepeat\nNorton's theorem asserts\nNorton's theorem is a fundamental concept in electrical engineering that provides a method for simplifying the analysis of complex circuits.

This current is the short-circuit current of the network. The equivalent impedance, denoted as $Z_{\\text{Nor}}$, is the impedance seen looking into the port when all independent sources within the network are set to zero. This is equivalent to the Thevenin equivalent impedance, $Z_{\\text{Thev}}$, of both represent the impedance of the network as viewed from the port with no external load connected.\n\nBy using Norton's theorem, engineers can convert a complex network into a simpler model, which is particularly useful when analyzing the interaction between the network and an external load.
