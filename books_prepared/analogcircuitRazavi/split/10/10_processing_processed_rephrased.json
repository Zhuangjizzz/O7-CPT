It is also understood that while a solitary transistor can function as a current source, its output impedance is constrained, due to phenomena such as the Early effect in bipolar devices or channel-length modulation in MOSFETs.\n\nThe challenge lies in augmenting the output impedance of a transistor functioning as a current source. An essential insight from Chapters 5 and 7 serves as the basis for our discussion. \n\n[^3]image_name:R_{out1}\ndescription:\n[\nname: Q1, type: NPN, ports: {C: Rout1, B: Vb, E: GND}\nname: RE, type: Resistor, value: RE, ports: {N1: E, N2: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:This illustration depicts two configurations for enhancing output impedance, utilizing emitter degeneration for the NPN transistor and source degeneration for the NMOS transistor.\nimage_name:R_{out2}\ndescription:\n[\nname: M1, type: NMOS, ports: {S: c1, D: Rout2, G: Vb}\nname: RS, type: Resistor, value: RS, ports: {N1: GND, N2: c1}\n]\nextrainfo:This schematic represents a current source with an NMOS transistor M1 and resistor RS to elevate output impedance, and includes capacitor CI for stabilization between the output and bias voltage Vb.\n\nFigure 9.1 Output impedance of degenerated bipolar and MOS devices.\nOur exploration revolves around the concept that emitter or source degeneration effectively \"enhances\" the impedance perceived from the collector or drain, respectively. For the circuits depicted in Fig. 9.1, we derive the following equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nR_{\\text {out } 1} & =\\left[1+g_{m}\\left(R_{E} \\| r_{\\pi}\\right)\\right] r_{O}+R_{E} \\| r_{\\pi}  \\tag{9.1}\\\\\n& =\\left(1+g_{m} r_{O}\\right)\\left(R_{E} \\| r_{\\pi}\\right)+r_{O}  \\tag{9.2}\\\\\nR_{\\text {out } 2} & =\\left(1+g_{m} R_{S}\\right) r_{O}+R_{S}  \\tag{9.3}\\\\\n& =\\left(1+g_{m} r_{O}\\right) R_{S}+r_{O} \\tag{9.4}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThese equations indicate that increasing $R_{E}$ or $R_{S}$ can elevate the output resistance. However, this also results in a proportional increase in the voltage drop across the degeneration resistor, consuming voltage headroom and ultimately restricting the voltage swings that the circuit can provide using such a current source. For instance, if $R_{E}$ causes a 300 mV drop and $Q_{1}$ necessitates a minimum collector-emitter voltage of 500 mV, then the degenerated current source \"utilizes\" 800 mV of headroom.\n\nTo mitigate the trade-off between output impedance and voltage headroom, a transistor can replace the degeneration resistor. This strategy is illustrated in Fig. 9.2(a) for the bipolar version, where the objective is to introduce a high small-signal resistance $\\left(=r_{O 2}\\right)$ at the emitter of $Q_{1}$, with headroom consumption independent of the current. In this setup, $Q_{2}$ requires a headroom of roughly 0.4 V to stay in soft saturation. This arrangement is referred to as the \"cascode\" stage. To differentiate the roles of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$, we label $Q_{1}$ as the cascode transistor and $Q_{2}$ as the degeneration transistor.

Assume $\\beta=100$ and $V_{A}=5 \\mathrm{~V}$ for both transistors.\n\nThe solution involves simplifying Eq. (9.7) by noting that $g_{m}=I_{C} / V_{T}, r_{O}=V_{A} / I_{C}$, and $r_{\\pi}=\\beta V_{T} / I_{C}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nR_{\\text {out }} & \\approx \\frac{I_{C 1}}{V_{T}} \\cdot \\frac{V_{A 1}}{I_{C 1}} \\cdot \\frac{\\frac{V_{A 2}}{I_{C 2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\beta V_{T}}{I_{C 1}}}{\\frac{V_{A 2}}{I_{C 2}}+\\frac{\\beta V_{T}}{I_{C 1}}}  \\tag{9.8}\\\\\n& \\approx \\frac{1}{I_{C 1}} \\cdot \\frac{V_{A}}{V_{T}} \\cdot \\frac{\\beta V_{A} V_{T}}{V_{A}+\\beta V_{T}}, \\tag{9.9}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere $I_{C}=I_{C 1}=I_{C 2}$ and $V_{A}=V_{A 1}=V_{A 2}$. At room temperature, $V_{T} \\approx 26 \\mathrm{mV}$, leading to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{\\text {out }} \\approx 328.9 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega . \\tag{9.10}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nComparatively, the output resistance of $Q_{1}$ without degeneration would be $r_{O 1}=5 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$, indicating that \"cascoding\" has amplified $R_{\\text {out }}$ by a factor of 66. It is worth noting that $r_{O 2}$ and $r_{\\pi 1}$ are of similar magnitude in this example.\n\nAn exercise involves calculating the required Early voltage for an output resistance of $500 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$.\n\nNotably, if $r_{O 2}$ significantly exceeds $r_{\\pi 1}$, then $R_{\\text {out } 1}$ approaches\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nR_{\\text {out }, \\text { max }} & \\approx g_{m 1} r_{O 1} r_{\\pi 1}  \\tag{9.11}\\\\\n& \\approx \\beta_{1} r_{O 1} . \\tag{9.12}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis represents the maximum output impedance achievable with a bipolar cascode. Even with $r_{O 2}=\\infty$ [or $R_{E}=\\infty$ in Eq. (9.1)], $r_{\\pi 1}$ still presents itself from the emitter of $Q_{1}$ to ac ground, thereby limiting $R_{\\text {out }}$ to $\\beta_{1} r_{O 1}$.\n\nAn example is provided to compare the output impedance of the cascode with the upper bound given by Eq.

The task is to determine the required value of the degeneration resistor, assuming $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ are identical.\n\nThe solution involves replacing $Q_{2}$ and $R_{E}$ with their equivalent resistance from Eq. (9.1):\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{\\text {out } A}=\\left[1+g_{m 2}\\left(R_{E} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right)\\right] r_{O 2}+R_{E} \\| r_{\\pi 2} \\tag{9.15}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIt follows from Eq. (9.7) that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{\\text {out }} \\approx g_{m 1} r_{O 1}\\left(R_{\\text {out } A} \\| r_{\\pi 1}\\right) \\tag{9.16}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nTo achieve a doubled output impedance, we set\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{\\text {outA }} \\| r_{\\pi 1}=2\\left(r_{O 2} \\| r_{\\pi 1}\\right) \\tag{9.17}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThat is,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{o u t A}=\\frac{2 r_{O 2} r_{\\pi 1}}{r_{\\pi 1}-r_{O 2}} \\tag{9.18}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn reality, $r_{\\pi 1}$ is typically less than $r_{O 2}$, rendering a positive value of $R_{\\text {outA }}$ impossible! Consequently, it is not feasible to double the output impedance of the cascode by emitter degeneration.\n\nThe implications of this result suggest that even identical transistors yield an $R_{\\text {out }}$ $(=328.9 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega)$ that is close to the upper bound $(=500 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega)$. Specifically, the ratio of (9.7) and (9.12) is equal to $r_{O 2} /\\left(r_{O 2}+r_{\\pi 1}\\right)$, a value greater than 0.5 if $r_{O 2}>r_{\\pi 1}$.\n\nFor completeness, Fig. 9.5 depicts a pnp cascode, where $Q_{1}$ acts as the cascode device and $Q_{2}$ as the degeneration device. The output impedance is given by Eq.

    "text": "In Chapters 5 and 7, we learned that using current-source loads can significantly enhance the voltage gain of amplifiers. We also know that while a single transistor can function as a current source, its output impedance is restricted due to the Early effect in bipolar devices or channel-length modulation in MOSFETs.\n\nTo boost the output impedance of a transistor functioning as a current source, we can utilize an important concept from Chapters 5 and 7. The circuits depicted in the figures demonstrate two methods for increasing output impedance using emitter degeneration for the NPN transistor and source degeneration for the NMOS transistor.\n\nFigure 9.1 illustrates the output impedance of degenerated bipolar and MOS devices. We observe that emitter or source degeneration can enhance the impedance seen looking into the collector or drain, respectively. For the circuits shown in Fig. 9.1, we have the following equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nR_{\\text {out } 1} & =\\left[1+g_{m}\\left(R_{E} \\| r_{\\pi}\\right)\\right] r_{O}+R_{E} \\| r_{\\pi}  \\tag{9.1}\\\\\n& =\\left(1+g_{m} r_{O}\\right)\\left(R_{E} \\| r_{\\pi}\\right)+r_{O}  \\tag{9.2}\\\\\nR_{\\text {out } 2} & =\\left(1+g_{m} R_{S}\\right) r_{O}+R_{S}  \\tag{9.3}\\\\\n& =\\left(1+g_{m} r_{O}\\right) R_{S}+r_{O} \\tag{9.4}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nWe can increase $R_{E}$ or $R_{S}$ to raise the output resistance. However, this also increases the voltage drop across the degeneration resistor, consuming voltage headroom and ultimately limiting the voltage swings provided by the circuit using such a current source. For instance, if $R_{E}$ sustains 300 mV and $Q_{1}$ requires a minimum collector-emitter voltage of 500 mV, then the degenerated current source \"consumes\" a headroom of 800 mV.\n\nTo mitigate the trade-off between output impedance and voltage headroom, we can substitute the degeneration resistor with a transistor. Shown in Fig. 9.2(a) for the bipolar version, this approach introduces a high small-signal resistance $\\left(=r_{O 2}\\right)$ in the emitter of $Q_{1}$ while consuming a headroom independent of the current. In this case, $Q_{2}$ requires a headroom of approximately 0.4 V to remain in soft saturation. This configuration is known as the \"cascode\" stage. To distinguish the roles of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$, we refer to $Q_{1}$ as the cascode transistor and $Q_{2}$ as the degeneration transistor. Note that $I_{C 1} \\approx I_{C 2}$ if $\\beta_{1} \\gg 1$.\n\nFigure 9.2 (a) and (b) depict the cascode bipolar current source and its equivalent circuit.\n\nTo calculate the output impedance of the bipolar cascode in Fig. 9.2(a), we note that since the base-emitter voltage of $Q_{2}$ is constant, this transistor simply acts as a small-signal resistance equal to $r_{O 2}$ [Fig. 9.2(b)]. In analogy with the resistively-degenerated counterpart in Fig. 9.1, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{\\text {out }}=\\left[1+g_{m 1}\\left(r_{O 2} \\| r_{\\pi 1}\\right)\\right] r_{O 1}+r_{O 2} \\| r_{\\pi 1} \\tag{9.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince typically $g_{m 1}\\left(r_{O 2} \\| r_{\\pi 1}\\right) \\gg 1$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nR_{\\text {out }} & \\approx\\left(1+g_{m 1} r_{O 1}\\right)\\left(r_{O 2} \\| r_{\\pi 1}\\right)  \\tag{9.6}\\\\\n& \\approx g_{m 1} r_{O 1}\\left(r_{O 2} \\| r_{\\pi 1}\\right) . \\tag{9.7}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIt is important to note that $r_{O}$ cannot generally be assumed much greater than $r_{\\pi}$.\n\nExample 9.1 involves determining the output resistance of the cascode in Fig. 9.2(a) with $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ biased at a collector current of 1 mA. Assuming $\\beta=100$ and $V_{A}=5 \\mathrm{~V}$ for both transistors, the solution is as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nR_{\\text {out }} & \\approx \\frac{1}{I_{C 1}} \\cdot \\frac{V_{A}}{V_{T}} \\cdot \\frac{\\beta V_{A} V_{T}}{V_{A}+\\beta V_{T}}, \\tag{9.9}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere $I_{C}=I_{C 1}=I_{C 2}$ and $V_{A}=V_{A 1}=V_{A 2}$.

Transistor $Q_{2}$ now operates as a diode-connected device, presenting an impedance of $\\left(1 / g_{m 2}\\right) \\| r_{O 2}$ at node $X$. Given by Eq.

Examining the circuits depicted in Figure 9.1, we find the following equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nR_{\\text {out } 1} & =\\left[1+g_{m}\\left(R_{E} \\| r_{\\pi}\\right)\\right] r_{O}+R_{E} \\| r_{\\pi}  \\tag{9.1}\\\\\n& =\\left(1+g_{m} r_{O}\\right)\\left(R_{E} \\| r_{\\pi}\\right)+r_{O}  \\tag{9.2}\\\\\nR_{\\text {out } 2} & =\\left(1+g_{m} R_{S}\\right) r_{O}+R_{S}  \\tag{9.3}\\\\\n& =\\left(1+g_{m} r_{O}\\right) R_{S}+r_{O} \\tag{9.4}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nHere, it is evident that increasing the values of $R_{E}$ or $R_{S}$ can enhance the output resistance. However, it is worth noting that the voltage drop across the degeneration resistor also increases proportionally, which can consume the voltage headroom and, in turn, limit the voltage swings provided by the circuit utilizing such a current source. For instance, if $R_{E}$ sustains a voltage drop of 300 mV and $Q_{1}$ necessitates a minimum collector-emitter voltage of 500 mV, then the degenerated current source \"uses up\" a headroom of 800 mV.\n\nTo mitigate the trade-off between output impedance and voltage headroom, it is possible to substitute the degeneration resistor with a transistor. As illustrated in Figure 9.2(a) for the bipolar version, the objective is to introduce a high small-signal resistance $\\left(=r_{O 2}\\right)$ in the emitter of $Q_{1}$ while maintaining a headroom that is independent of the current. In this instance, $Q_{2}$ necessitates a headroom of roughly 0.4 V to remain in soft saturation. This configuration is known as the \"cascode\" stage. To differentiate the distinct roles of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ in this setup, we refer to $Q_{1}$ as the cascode transistor and $Q_{2}$ as the degeneration transistor. Note that if $\\beta_{1} \\gg 1$, the collector current $I_{C 1}$ is approximately equal to $I_{C 2}$.\n\nIn the circuit of Figure 9.2(a), let's calculate the output impedance of the bipolar cascode. As the base-emitter voltage of $Q_{2}$ remains constant, this transistor acts solely as a small-signal resistance equal to $r_{O 2}$ [Figure 9.2(b)]. Similar to the resistively-degenerated circuit in Figure 9.1, we obtain the following equation:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{\\text {out }}=\\left[1+g_{m 1}\\left(r_{O 2} \\| r_{\\pi 1}\\right)\\right] r_{O 1}+r_{O 2} \\| r_{\\pi 1} \\tag{9.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nGiven that typically $g_{m 1}\\left(r_{O 2} \\| r_{\\pi 1}\\right) \\gg 1$, we can approximate:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nR_{\\text {out }} & \\approx\\left(1+g_{m 1} r_{O 1}\\right)\\left(r_{O 2} \\| r_{\\pi 1}\\right)  \\tag{9.6}\\\\\n& \\approx g_{m 1} r_{O 1}\\left(r_{O 2} \\| r_{\\pi 1}\\right) . \\tag{9.7}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nHowever, it is important to note that $r_{O}$ cannot generally be assumed to be much greater than $r_{\\pi}$."

(9.7), we derive:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{\\text {out }} \\approx g_{m 1} r_{O 1}\\left(R_{\\text {out } A} \\| r_{\\pi 1}\\right) \\tag{9.16}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nTo achieve a twofold increase in output impedance:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{\\text {outA }} \\| r_{\\pi 1}=2\\left(r_{O 2} \\| r_{\\pi 1}\\right) \\tag{9.17}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{o u t A}=\\frac{2 r_{O 2} r_{\\pi 1}}{r_{\\pi 1}-r_{O 2}} \\tag{9.18}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn reality, $r_{\\pi 1}$ is typically less than $r_{O 2}$, rendering a positive value of $R_{\\text {outA }}$ impossible! Consequently, it is impractical to double the output impedance of the cascode through emitter degeneration.\n\nThe implications of this result are as follows: Comparing the output resistances derived in Examples 9.1 and 9.2, we observe that even identical transistors yield an $R_{\\text {out }}$ $(=328.9 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega)$ that is close to the upper bound $(=500 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega)$. Specifically, the ratio of (9.7) and (9.12) is equal to $r_{O 2} /\\left(r_{O 2}+r_{\\pi 1}\\right)$, a value greater than 0.5 if $r_{O 2}>r_{\\pi 1}$.\n\nFor completeness, Fig. 9.5 presents a pnp cascode, where $Q_{1}$ functions as the cascode device and $Q_{2}$ as the degeneration device. The output impedance is provided by Eq. (9.5).\n\nFigure 9.5 depicts a PNP cascode current source.\n\nWhile we have arrived at the cascode as an extreme case of emitter degeneration, it is also possible to perceive the evolution as illustrated in Fig. 9.6. In essence, since $Q_{2}$ provides only an output impedance of $r_{O 2}$, we \"stack\" $Q_{1}$ on top of it to enhance $R_{\\text {out }}$.\n\nFigure 9.6 illustrates the evolution of cascode topology viewed as stacking $Q_{1}$ atop $Q_{2}$.\n\nExample: Explain why the topologies depicted in Fig. 9.7 are not cascodes.\n\nSolution: Unlike the cascode in Fig. 9.2(a), the circuits in Fig. 9.7 connect the emitter of $Q_{1}$ to the emitter of $Q_{2}$. Consequently, transistor $Q_{2}$ operates as a diode-connected device (instead of a current source), presenting an impedance of $\\left(1 / g_{m 2}\\right) \\| r_{O 2}$ (rather than $r_{O 2}$) at node $X$. As indicated by Eq. (9.1), the output impedance, $R_{\\text {out }}$, is significantly lower:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{\\text {out }}=\\left[1+g_{m 1}\\left(\\frac{1}{g_{m 2}}\\left\\|r_{O 2}\\right\\| r_{\\pi 1}\\right)\\right] r_{O 1}+\\frac{1}{g_{m 2}}\\left\\|r_{O 2}\\right\\| r_{\\pi 1} \\tag{9.19}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nConsidering that $1 / g_{m 2} \\ll r_{O 2}, r_{\\pi 1}$ and $g_{m 1} \\approx g_{m 2}$ (why?),\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nR_{\\text {out }} & \\approx\\left(1+\\frac{g_{m 1}}{g_{m 2}}\\right) r_{O 1}+\\frac{1}{g_{m 2}}  \\tag{9.20}\\\\\n& \\approx 2 r_{O 1} . \\tag{9.21}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe same observations apply to the topology in Fig. 9.7(b).\n\nExercise: Estimate the output impedance for a collector bias current of 1 mA and $V_{A}=8 \\mathrm{~V}$.\n\nMOS Cascodes: The similarity between Eqs. (9.1) and (9.3) for degenerated stages suggests that cascoding can also be applied to MOSFETs to increase the output impedance of a current source. As illustrated in Fig. 9.8, the concept involves replacing the degeneration resistor with a MOS current source, thereby presenting a small-signal resistance of $r_{O 2}$ from $X$ to ground. Equation (9.3) can now be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nR_{\\text {out }} & =\\left(1+g_{m 1} r_{O 2}\\right) r_{O 1}+r_{O 2}  \\tag{9.22}\\\\\n& \\approx g_{m 1} r_{O 1} r_{O 2}, \\tag{9.23}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nassuming $g_{m 1} r_{O 1} r_{O 2} \\gg r_{O 1}, r_{O 2}$.\n\nFigure 9.8 showcases a MOS cascode current source and its equivalent.\n\nEquation (9.23) is a crucial result, indicating that the output impedance is proportional to the intrinsic gain of the cascode device.\n\nExample: Design an NMOS cascode for an output impedance of 0.5 mA. For simplicity, assume $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ in Fig. 9.8 are identical. Assume $\\mu_{n} C_{o x}=100 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} / \\mathrm{V}^{2}$ and $\\lambda=0.1 \\mathrm{~V}^{-1}$.\n\nSince $r_{O 1}=r_{O 2}=\\left(\\lambda I_{D}\\right)^{-1}=20 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$, we require that $g_{m 1}=(800 \\Omega)^{-1}$, leading to:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\sqrt{2 \\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L} I_{D}}=\\frac{1}{800 \\Omega} . \\tag{9.25}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis implies:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{W}{L}=15.6 . \\tag{9.26}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIt is also important to note that $g_{m 1} r_{O 1}=25 \\gg 1$.\n\nExercise: Determine the output resistance if $W / L=32$.\n\nBy invoking the alternative perspective depicted in Fig. 9.6 for the MOS counterpart (Fig. 9.9), we recognize that stacking a MOSFET on top of a current source \"boosts\" the impedance by a factor of $g_{m 2} r_{O 2}$ (the intrinsic gain of the cascode transistor). This observation highlights an intriguing contrast between bipolar and MOS cascodes: in the former, increasing $r_{O 2}$ eventually results in $R_{\\text {out }, b i p}=\\beta r_{O 1}$"

    "text": "The cascode topology is known not only for its high output impedance as a current source but also for its ability to function as a high-gain amplifier. The relationship between output impedance and amplifier gain is a critical one.\n\nFor the study ahead, it's essential to grasp the concept of transconductance in the context of circuits. As detailed in Chapters 4 and 6, transconductance is defined as the ratio of the change in collector or drain current to the change in base-emitter or gate-source voltage for a transistor. This concept extends to circuits as well. As shown in Fig. 9.12, when the output voltage is grounded, the \"short-circuit transconductance\" of the circuit is defined as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nG_{m}=\\left.\\frac{i_{\\text {out }}}{v_{\\text {in }}}\\right|_{v o u t=0} \\tag{9.29}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nTransconductance represents the circuit's \"strength\" in converting input voltage to current. It's important to observe the direction of $i_{\\text {out }}$ in Fig. 9.12.\n\nThe circuit diagram in Fig. 9.12 demonstrates the calculation of transconductance by grounding the output. The output current $i_{\\text {out }}$ flows towards ground.\n\nIn Fig. 9.13(a), we have an example of a CS stage. Calculate its transconductance.\n\nFor the circuit in Fig. 9.13(b), we short the output node to ac ground and, noting that $R_{D}$ carries no current, we write\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nG_{m} & =\\frac{i_{\\text {out }}}{v_{\\text {in }}}  \\tag{9.30}\\\\\n& =\\frac{i_{D 1}}{v_{G S 1}}  \\tag{9.31}\\\\\n& =g_{m 1} \\tag{9.32}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThus, in this case, the circuit's transconductance equals that of the transistor.\n\nExercise: How does $G_{m}$ change if the transistor's width and bias current are doubled?\n\nA lemma states that the voltage gain of a linear circuit can be expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nA_{v}=-G_{m} R_{\\text {out }} \\tag{9.33}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $R_{\\text {out }}$ denotes the output resistance of the circuit with the input voltage set to zero. Proof: We know that a linear circuit can be replaced with its Norton equivalent [Fig. 9.14(a)]. Norton's theorem states that $i_{\\text {out }}$ is obtained by grounding the output and computing the short-circuit current [Fig. 9.14(b)]. We also relate $i_{\\text {out }}$ to $v_{\\text {in }}$ by the circuit's transconductance, $G_{m}=i_{\\text {out }} / v_{\\text {in }}$. Thus, in Fig. 9.14(a),\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv_{\\text {out }} & =-i_{\\text {out }} R_{\\text {out }}  \\tag{9.34}\\\\\n& =-G_{m} v_{\\text {in }} R_{\\text {out }} \\tag{9.35}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nand hence\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{v_{\\text {out }}}{v_{\\text {in }}}=-G_{m} R_{\\text {out }} \\tag{9.36}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nExample: Determine the voltage gain of the common-emitter stage shown in Fig. 9.15(a).\n\nSolution: To calculate the short-circuit transconductance of the circuit, we place an ac short from the output to ground and find the current through it [Fig. 9.15(b)]. In this case, $i_{\\text {out }}$ is simply equal to the collector current of $Q_{1}, g_{m 1} v_{i n}$, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nG_{m} & =\\frac{i_{\\text {out }}}{v_{\\text {in }}}  \\tag{9.37}\\\\\n& =g_{m 1} \\tag{9.38}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nNote that $r_{O}$ does not carry a current in this test. Next, we obtain the output resistance as depicted in Fig. 9.15(c):\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nR_{\\text {out }} & =\\frac{v_{X}}{i_{X}}  \\tag{9.39}\\\\\n& =r_{O 1} \\tag{9.40}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIt follows that\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nA_{v} & =-G_{m} R_{\\text {out }}  \\tag{9.41}\\\\\n& =-g_{m 1} r_{O 1} . \\tag{9.42}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSuppose the transistor is degenerated by an emitter resistor equal to $R_{E}$. The transconductance falls but the output resistance rises. Does the voltage gain increase or decrease?\n\nThe above lemma serves as an alternative method of gain calculation. It also indicates that the voltage gain of a circuit can be increased by raising the output impedance, as in cascodes.\n\nBipolar Cascode Amplifier: To maximize the voltage gain of a common-emitter stage, the collector load impedance must be maximized, as recalled from Chapter 4. In the limit, an ideal current source serving as the load [Fig. 9.16(a)] yields a voltage gain of\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nA_{v} & =-g_{m 1} r_{O 1}  \\tag{9.43}\\\\\n& =-\\frac{V_{A}}{V_{T}} \\tag{9.44}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIn this case, the small-signal current, $g_{m 1} v_{i n}$, produced by $Q_{1}$ flows through $r_{O 1}$, thus generating an output voltage equal to $-g_{m 1} v_{i n} r_{O 1}$.\n\nNow, suppose we stack a transistor on top of $Q_{1}$ as shown in Fig. 9.16(b). We know from Section 9.1.1 that the circuit achieves a high output impedance and, from the above lemma, a voltage gain higher than that of a CE stage.\n\nLet us determine the voltage gain of the bipolar cascode with the aid of the above lemma. As shown in Fig. 9.17(a), the short-circuit transconductance is equal to $i_{\\text {out }} / v_{\\text {in }}$. As a common-emitter stage, $Q_{1}$ still produces a collector current of $g_{m 1} v_{i n}$, which subsequently flows through $Q_{2}$ and hence through the output short:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{\\text {out }}=g_{m 1} v_{i n} \\tag{9.45}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThat is,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nG_{m}=g_{m 1} \\tag{9.46}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe reader may view Eq. (9.46) dubiously. After all, as shown in Fig. 9.17(b), the collector current of $Q_{1}$ must split between $r_{O 1}$ and the impedance seen looking into the emitter of $Q_{2}$. We must therefore verify that only a negligible fraction of $g_{m 1} v_{i n}$ is \"lost\" in $r_{O 1}$. Since the base and collector voltages of $Q_{2}$ are equal, this transistor can be viewed as a diode-connected device having an impedance of $\\left(1 / g_{m 2}\\right) \\| r_{O 2}$. Dividing $g_{m 1} v_{i n}$ between this impedance and $r_{O 1}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{\\text {out }}=g_{m 1} v_{i n} \\frac{r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}}{r_{O 1}\\left\\|r_{\\pi 2}+\\frac{1}{g_{m 2}}\\right\\| r_{O 2}} \\tag{9.47}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor typical transistors, $1 / g_{m 2} \\ll r_{O 2}, r_{O 1}$, and hence\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{\\text {out }} \\approx g_{m 1} v_{\\text {in }} \\tag{9.48}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThat is, the approximation $G_{m}=g_{m 1}$ is reasonable. To obtain the overall voltage gain, we write from Eqs. (9.33) and (9.5),\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nA_{v} & =-G_{m} R_{\\text {out }}  \\tag{9.49}\\\\\n& =-g_{m 1}\\left\\{\\left[1+g_{m 2}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right)\\right] r_{O 2}+r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right\\}  \\tag{9.50}\\\\\n& \\approx-g_{m 1}\\left[g_{m 2}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right) r_{O 2}+r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right] . \\tag{9.51}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nAlso, since $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ carry approximately equal bias currents, $g_{m 1} \\approx g_{m 2}$ and $r_{O 1} \\approx r_{O 2}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nA_{v} & =-g_{m 1} r_{O 1}\\left[g_{m 1}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right)+1\\right]  \\tag{9.52}\\\\\n& \\approx-g_{m 1} r_{O 1} g_{m 1}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right) . \\tag{9.53}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nCompared to the simple CE stage of Fig. 9.16(a), the cascode amplifier exhibits a gain that is higher by a factor of $g_{m 1}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right)$-a relatively large value because $r_{O 1}$ and $r_{\\pi 2}$ are much greater than $1 / g_{m 1}$. $\\beta=100$ for both transistors, determine the voltage gain.

(9.53),\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left|A_{v}\\right|=12,654 . \\tag{9.55}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nCascoding thus raises the voltage gain by a factor of 65.8.\n\nExercise: What Early voltage gives a gain of 5,000?\n\nIt is possible to view the cascode amplifier as a common-emitter stage followed by a common-base stage. Illustrated in Fig. 9.18, the idea is to consider the cascode device, $Q_{2}$, as a common-base transistor that senses the small-signal current produced by $Q_{1}$. This perspective may prove useful in some cases.\n\nThe high voltage gain of the cascode topology makes it attractive for many applications. But, in the circuit of Fig. 9.16(b), the load is assumed to be an ideal current source. An actual current source lowers the impedance seen at the output node and hence the voltage gain. For example, the circuit illustrated in Fig. 9.19(a) suffers from a low gain because the pnp current source introduces an impedance of only $r_{O 3}$ from the output node to ac ground, dropping the output impedance to\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nR_{\\text {out }} & =r_{O 3} \\|\\left\\{\\left[1+g_{m 2}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right)\\right] r_{O 2}+r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right\\}  \\tag{9.56}\\\\\n& \\approx r_{O 3} \\|\\left[g_{m 2} r_{O 2}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right)+r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right] . \\tag{9.57}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nHow should we realize the load current source to maintain a high gain? We know from Section 9.1.1 that cascoding also raises the output impedance of current sources, postulating that the circuit of Fig. 9.5 is a good candidate and arriving at the stage depicted in Fig. 9.19(b). The output impedance is now given by the parallel combination of those of the $n p n$ and $p n p$ cascodes, $R_{o n}$ and $R_{o p}$, respectively. Using Eq. (9.7), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& R_{o n} \\approx g_{m 2} r_{O 2}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right)  \\tag{9.58}\\\\\n& R_{o p} \\approx g_{m 3} r_{O 3}\\left(r_{o 4} \\| r_{\\pi 3}\\right) \\tag{9.59}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nNote that, since $n p n$ and $p n p$ devices may display different Early voltages, $r_{O 1}\\left(=r_{O 2}\\right)$ may not be equal to $r_{O 3}\\left(=r_{O 4}\\right)$.\n\nRecognizing that the short-circuit transconductance, $G_{m}$, of the stage is still approximately equal to $g_{m 1}$, we express the voltage gain as\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nA_{v} & =-g_{m 1}\\left(R_{o n} \\| R_{o p}\\right)  \\tag{9.60}\\\\\n& \\approx-g_{m 1}\\left\\{\\left[g_{m 2} r_{O 2}\\left(r_{o 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right)\\right] \\|\\left[g_{m 3} r_{O 3}\\left(r_{O 4} \\| r_{\\pi 3}\\right)\\right]\\right\\} . \\tag{9.61}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis result represents the highest voltage gain that can be obtained in a cascode stage. For comparable values of $R_{o n}$ and $R_{o p}$, this gain is about half of that expressed by Eq. (9.53).\n\nExample: Suppose the circuit of Example 9.9 incorporates a cascode load using pnp transistors with $V_{A}=4 \\mathrm{~V}$ and $\\beta=50$. What is the voltage gain?\n\nSolution: The load transistors carry a collector current of approximately 1 mA . Thus,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nR_{o p} & =g_{m 3} r_{O 3}\\left(r_{O 4} \\| r_{\\pi 3}\\right)  \\tag{9.62}\\\\\n& =151 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega \\tag{9.63}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{o n}=329 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega \\tag{9.64}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIt follows that\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\left|A_{v}\\right| & =g_{m 1}\\left(R_{o n} \\| R_{o p}\\right)  \\tag{9.65}\\\\\n& =3,981 . \\tag{9.66}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nCompared to the ideal current source case, the gain has fallen by approximately a factor of 3 because the $p n p$ devices suffer from a lower Early voltage and $\\beta$.\n\nExercise: Repeat the above example for a collector bias current of 0.5 mA.\n\nIt is important to take a step back and appreciate our analysis techniques. The cascode of Fig. 9.19(b) proves quite formidable if we attempt to replace each transistor with its small-signal model and solve the resulting circuit. Our gradual approach to constructing this stage reveals the role of each device, allowing straightforward calculation of the output impedance. Moreover, the lemma illustrated in Fig. 9.14 utilizes our knowledge of the output impedance to quickly provide the voltage gain of the stage.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe cascode stage was originally invented to suppress an undesirable high-frequency phenomenon called the \"Miller effect\" (Chapter 11). In fact, many discrete bipolar amplifiers still employ cascoding for the same reason. However, it was recognized in early days of CMOS technology that cascodes could also provide a high output impedance and a high voltage gain, hence their widespread use.\n\n"

As shown in Fig. 9.17(a), the short-circuit transconductance is $i_{\\text {out }} / v_{\\text {in }}$. As a common-emitter stage, $Q_{1}$ still produces a collector current of $g_{m 1} v_{i n}$, which flows through $Q_{2}$ and hence through the output short:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{\\text {out }}=g_{m 1} v_{i n} \\tag{9.45}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThat is,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nG_{m}=g_{m 1} \\tag{9.46}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe reader might doubt Eq. (9.46). After all, as shown in Fig. 9.17(b), the collector current of $Q_{1}$ must divide between $r_{O 1}$ and the impedance seen looking into the emitter of $Q_{2}$. We must verify that only a negligible fraction of $g_{m 1} v_{i n}$ is \"lost\" in $r_{O 1}$. Since the base and collector voltages of $Q_{2}$ are equal, this transistor can be viewed as a diode-connected device having an impedance of $\\left(1 / g_{m 2}\\right) \\| r_{O 2}$.

The idea is to consider the cascode device, $Q_{2}$, as a common-base transistor that senses the small-signal current produced by $Q_{1}$. This perspective may be useful in some cases.\n\nFigure 9.18 depicts the cascode amplifier as a cascade of a CE stage and a CB stage.\n\nThe high voltage gain of the cascode topology makes it attractive for many applications. However, in the circuit of Fig. 9.16(b), the load is assumed to be an ideal current source. An actual current source lowers the impedance seen at the output node and hence the voltage gain. For example, the circuit in Fig. 9.19(a) has low gain because the pnp current source introduces an impedance of only $r_{O 3}$ from the output node to ac ground, dropping the output impedance to\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nR_{\\text {out }} & =r_{O 3} \\|\\left\\{\\left[1+g_{m 2}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right)\\right] r_{O 2}+r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right\\}  \\tag{9.56}\\\\\n& \\approx r_{O 3} \\|\\left[g_{m 2} r_{O 2}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right)+r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right] . \\tag{9.57}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nHow should we realize the load current source to maintain a high gain? We know from Section 9.1.1 that cascoding also raises the output impedance of current sources, suggesting that the circuit of Fig. 9.5 is a good candidate, leading to the stage depicted in Fig. 9.19(b). The output impedance is now given by the parallel combination of those of the $n p n$ and $p n p$ cascodes, $R_{o n}$ and $R_{o p}$, respectively. Using Eq. (9.7), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& R_{o n} \\approx g_{m 2} r_{O 2}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right)  \\tag{9.58}\\\\\n& R_{o p} \\approx g_{m 3} r_{O 3}\\left(r_{o 4} \\| r_{\\pi 3}\\right) \\tag{9.59}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nNote that, since $n p n$ and $p n p$ devices may have different Early voltages, $r_{O 1}\\left(=r_{O 2}\\right)$ may not be equal to $r_{O 3}\\left(=r_{O 4}\\right)$.\n\nRecognizing that the short-circuit transconductance, $G_{m}$, of the stage is still approximately equal to $g_{m 1}$ (why?), we express the voltage gain as\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nA_{v} & =-g_{m 1}\\left(R_{o n} \\| R_{o p}\\right)  \\tag{9.60}\\\\\n& \\approx-g_{m 1}\\left\\{\\left[g_{m 2} r_{O 2}\\left(r_{o 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right)\\right] \\|\\left[g_{m 3} r_{O 3}\\left(r_{O 4} \\| r_{\\pi 3}\\right)\\right]\\right\\} . \\tag{9.61}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis result represents the highest voltage gain that can be obtained in a cascode stage.

    "text": "The cascode topology serves not only as a current source with high output impedance but also functions as a high-gain amplifier, with the output impedance and gain being intrinsically linked.\n\nIn our subsequent analysis, we must comprehend the transconductance concept as it applies to circuits. In previous chapters, we defined transconductance as the ratio of the change in collector or drain current to the change in base-emitter or gate-source voltage for a transistor. This idea extends to circuits as well. As shown in Fig. 9.12, the output voltage is set to zero by grounding the output node, and the circuit's \"short-circuit transconductance\" is defined as\n\n$$\nG_{m}=\\left.\\frac{i_{\\text {out }}}{v_{\\text {in }}}\\right|_{v o u t=0} \\tag{9.29}\n$$\n\nTransconductance represents a circuit's \"strength\" in converting input voltage to current. Note the direction of $i_{\\text {out }}$ in Fig. 9.12.\n\nThe circuit diagram in Fig. 9.12 illustrates the calculation of transconductance by grounding the output.\n\nExample: Calculate the transconductance of the CS stage shown in Fig. 9.13(a).\n\nSolution: As depicted in Fig. 9.13(b), we short the output node to ac ground and, noting that $R_{D}$ carries no current (why?), write\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nG_{m} & =\\frac{i_{\\text {out }}}{v_{\\text {in }}}  \\tag{9.30}\\\\\n& =\\frac{i_{D 1}}{v_{G S 1}}  \\tag{9.31}\\\\\n& =g_{m 1} \\tag{9.32}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThus, in this case, the circuit's transconductance equals that of the transistor.\n\nExercise: How does $G_{m}$ change if the width and bias current of the transistor are doubled?\n\nLemma: The voltage gain of a linear circuit can be expressed as\n\n$$\nA_{v}=-G_{m} R_{\\text {out }} \\tag{9.33}\n$$\n\nwhere $R_{\\text {out }}$ denotes the output resistance of the circuit (with the input voltage set to zero).\n\nProof: A linear circuit can be replaced with its Norton equivalent [Fig. 9.14(a)]. Norton's theorem states that $i_{\\text {out }}$ is obtained by shorting the output to ground $\\left(v_{\\text {out }}=0\\right)$ and computing the short-circuit current [Fig. 9.14(b)]. We also relate $i_{\\text {out }}$ to $v_{\\text {in }}$ by the circuit's transconductance, $G_{m}=i_{\\text {out }} / v_{\\text {in }}$. Thus, in Fig. 9.14(a),\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv_{\\text {out }} & =-i_{\\text {out }} R_{\\text {out }}  \\tag{9.34}\\\\\n& =-G_{m} v_{\\text {in }} R_{\\text {out }} \\tag{9.35}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nand hence\n\n$$\n\\frac{v_{\\text {out }}}{v_{\\text {in }}}=-G_{m} R_{\\text {out }} \\tag{9.36}\n$$\n\nExample: Determine the voltage gain of the common-emitter stage shown in Fig. 9.15(a).\n\nSolution: To calculate the short-circuit transconductance of the circuit, we place an ac short from the output to ground and find the current through it [Fig. 9.15(b)]. In this case, $i_{\\text {out }}$ is simply equal to the collector current of $Q_{1}, g_{m 1} v_{i n}$, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nG_{m} & =\\frac{i_{\\text {out }}}{v_{\\text {in }}}  \\tag{9.37}\\\\\n& =g_{m 1} \\tag{9.38}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nNote that $r_{O}$ does not carry a current in this test (why?). Next, we obtain the output resistance as depicted in Fig. 9.15(c):\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nR_{\\text {out }} & =\\frac{v_{X}}{i_{X}}  \\tag{9.39}\\\\\n& =r_{O 1} \\tag{9.40}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIt follows that\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nA_{v} & =-G_{m} R_{\\text {out }}  \\tag{9.41}\\\\\n& =-g_{m 1} r_{O 1} . \\tag{9.42}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIf the transistor is degenerated by an emitter resistor equal to $R_{E}$, the transconductance decreases, but the output resistance increases. Does the voltage gain increase or decrease?\n\nThe above lemma serves as an alternative method of gain calculation. It also indicates that the voltage gain of a circuit can be increased by raising the output impedance, as in cascodes.\n\nBipolar Cascode Amplifier: To maximize the voltage gain of a common-emitter stage, the collector load impedance must be maximized, as discussed in Chapter 4. In the limit, an ideal current source serving as the load [Fig. 9.16(a)] yields a voltage gain of\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nA_{v} & =-g_{m 1} r_{O 1}  \\tag{9.43}\\\\\n& =-\\frac{V_{A}}{V_{T}} \\tag{9.44}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIn this case, the small-signal current, $g_{m 1} v_{i n}$, produced by $Q_{1}$ flows through $r_{O 1}$, thus generating an output voltage equal to $-g_{m 1} v_{i n} r_{O 1}$.\n\nNow, suppose we stack a transistor on top of $Q_{1}$ as shown in Fig. 9.16(b). We know from Section 9.1.1 that the circuit achieves a high output impedance and, from the above lemma, a voltage gain higher than that of a CE stage.\n\nLet us determine the voltage gain of the bipolar cascode with the aid of the above lemma. As shown in Fig. 9.17(a), the short-circuit transconductance is equal to $i_{\\text {out }} / v_{\\text {in }}$. As a common-emitter stage, $Q_{1}$ still produces a collector current of $g_{m 1} v_{i n}$, which subsequently flows through $Q_{2}$ and hence through the output short:\n\n$$\ni_{\\text {out }}=g_{m 1} v_{i n} \\tag{9.45}\n$$\n\nThat is,\n\n$$\nG_{m}=g_{m 1} \\tag{9.46}\n$$\n\nThe reader may view Eq. (9.46) dubiously. After all, as shown in Fig. 9.17(b), the collector current of $Q_{1}$ must split between $r_{O 1}$ and the impedance seen looking into the emitter of $Q_{2}$. We must therefore verify that only a negligible fraction of $g_{m 1} v_{i n}$ is \"lost\" in $r_{O 1}$. Since the base and collector voltages of $Q_{2}$ are equal, this transistor can be viewed as a diode-connected device having an impedance of $\\left(1 / g_{m 2}\\right) \\| r_{O 2}$. Dividing $g_{m 1} v_{i n}$ between this impedance and $r_{O 1}$, we have\n\n$$\ni_{\\text {out }}=g_{m 1} v_{i n} \\frac{r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}}{r_{O 1}\\left\\|r_{\\pi 2}+\\frac{1}{g_{m 2}}\\right\\| r_{O 2}} \\tag{9.47}\n$$\n\nFor typical transistors, $1 / g_{m 2} \\ll r_{O 2}, r_{O 1}$, and hence\n\n$$\ni_{\\text {out }} \\approx g_{m 1} v_{\\text {in }} \\tag{9.48}\n$$\n\nThat is, the approximation $G_{m}=g_{m 1}$ is reasonable.\n\nTo obtain the overall voltage gain, we write from Eqs. (9.33) and (9.5),\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nA_{v} & =-G_{m} R_{\\text {out }}  \\tag{9.49}\\\\\n& =-g_{m 1}\\left\\{\\left[1+g_{m 2}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right)\\right] r_{O 2}+r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right\\}  \\tag{9.50}\\\\\n& \\approx-g_{m 1}\\left[g_{m 2}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right) r_{O 2}+r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right] . \\tag{9.51}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nAlso, since $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ carry approximately equal bias currents, $g_{m 1} \\approx g_{m 2}$ and $r_{O 1} \\approx r_{O 2}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nA_{v} & =-g_{m 1} r_{O 1}\\left[g_{m 1}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right)+1\\right]  \\tag{9.52}\\\\\n& \\approx-g_{m 1} r_{O 1} g_{m 1}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right) . \\tag{9.53}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nCompared to the simple CE stage of Fig. 9.16(a), the cascode amplifier exhibits a gain that is higher by a factor of $g_{m 1}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right)$-a relatively large value because $r_{O 1}$ and $r_{\\pi 2}$ are much greater than $1 / g_{m 1}$. $\\beta=100$ for both transistors, determine the voltage gain. Assume the load is an ideal current source.\n\nSolution: We have $g_{m 1}=(26 \\Omega)^{-1}, r_{\\pi 1} \\approx r_{\\pi 2} \\approx 2600 \\Omega, r_{O 1} \\approx r_{O 2}=5 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$. Thus,\n\n$$\ng_{m 1}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right)=65.8 \\tag{9.54}\n$$\n\nand from Eq. (9.53),\n\n$$\n\\left|A_{v}\\right|=12,654 . \\tag{9.55}\n$$\n\nCascoding thus raises the voltage gain by a factor of 65.8.\n\nExercise: What Early voltage gives a gain of 5,000?\n\nIt is possible to view the cascode amplifier as a common-emitter stage followed by a common-base stage. Illustrated in Fig. 9.18, the idea is to consider the cascode device, $Q_{2}$, as a common-base transistor that senses the small-signal current produced by $Q_{1}$. This perspective may prove useful in some cases.\n\nThe high voltage gain of the cascode topology makes it attractive for many applications. But, in the circuit of Fig. 9.16(b), the load is assumed to be an ideal current source. An actual current source lowers the impedance seen at the output node and hence the voltage gain. For example, the circuit illustrated in Fig. 9.19(a) suffers from a low gain because the pnp current source introduces an impedance of only $r_{O 3}$ from the output node to ac ground, dropping the output impedance to\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nR_{\\text {out }} & =r_{O 3} \\|\\left\\{\\left[1+g_{m 2}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right)\\right] r_{O 2}+r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right\\}  \\tag{9.56}\\\\\n& \\approx r_{O 3} \\|\\left[g_{m 2} r_{O 2}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right)+r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right] . \\tag{9.57}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nHow should we realize the load current source to maintain a high gain? We know from Section 9.1.1 that cascoding also raises the output impedance of current sources, postulating that the circuit of Fig. 9.5 is a good candidate and arriving at the stage depicted in Fig. 9.19(b). The output impedance is now given by the parallel combination of those of the $n p n$ and $p n p$ cascodes, $R_{o n}$ and $R_{o p}$, respectively. Using Eq. (9.7), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& R_{o n} \\approx g_{m 2} r_{O 2}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right)  \\tag{9.58}\\\\\n& R_{o p} \\approx g_{m 3} r_{O 3}\\left(r_{o 4} \\| r_{\\pi 3}\\right) \\tag{9.59}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nNote that, since $n p n$ and $p n p$ devices may display different Early voltages, $r_{O 1}\\left(=r_{O 2}\\right)$ may not be equal to $r_{O 3}\\left(=r_{O 4}\\right)$.\n\nRecognizing that the short-circuit transconductance, $G_{m}$, of the stage is still approximately equal to $g_{m 1}$ (why?), we express the voltage gain as\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nA_{v} & =-g_{m 1}\\left(R_{o n} \\| R_{o p}\\right)  \\tag{9.60}\\\\\n& \\approx-g_{m 1}\\left\\{\\left[g_{m 2} r_{O 2}\\left(r_{o 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right)\\right] \\|\\left[g_{m 3} r_{O 3}\\left(r_{O 4} \\| r_{\\pi 3}\\right)\\right]\\right\\} . \\tag{9.61}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis result represents the highest voltage gain that can be obtained in a cascode stage. For comparable values of $R_{o n}$ and $R_{o p}$, this gain is about half of that expressed by Eq. (9.53).\n\nExample: Suppose the circuit of Example 9.9 incorporates a cascode load using pnp transistors with $V_{A}=4 \\mathrm{~V}$ and $\\beta=50$.

The cascode of Fig. 9.19(b) proves quite formidable if we attempt to replace each transistor with its small-signal model and solve the resulting circuit. Our gradual approach to constructing this stage reveals the role of each device, allowing straightforward calculation of the output impedance. Moreover, the lemma illustrated in Fig. 9.14 utilizes our knowledge of the output impedance to quickly provide the voltage gain of the stage.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe cascode stage was originally invented to suppress an undesirable high-frequency phenomenon called the \"Miller effect\" (Chapter 11). In fact, many discrete bipolar amplifiers still employ cascoding for the same reason.

In the limit, an ideal current source serving as the load [Fig. 9.16(a)] yields a voltage gain of\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nA_{v} & =-g_{m 1} r_{O 1}  \\tag{9.43}\\\\\n& =-\\frac{V_{A}}{V_{T}} \\tag{9.44}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIn this case, the small-signal current, $g_{m 1} v_{i n}$, produced by $Q_{1}$ flows through $r_{O 1}$, thus generating an output voltage equal to $-g_{m 1} v_{i n} r_{O 1}$.\n\nNow, suppose we stack a transistor on top of $Q_{1}$ as shown in Fig. 9.16(b).

In this case, $i_{\\text {out }}$ is simply equal to the collector current of $Q_{1}, g_{m 1} v_{i n}$, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nG_{m} & =\\frac{i_{\\text {out }}}{v_{\\text {in }}}  \\tag{9.37}\\\\\n& =g_{m 1} \\tag{9.38}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nNote that $r_{O}$ does not carry a current in this test (why?). Next, we obtain the output resistance as depicted in Fig. 9.15(c):\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nR_{\\text {out }} & =\\frac{v_{X}}{i_{X}}  \\tag{9.39}\\\\\n& =r_{O 1} \\tag{9.40}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIt follows that\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nA_{v} & =-G_{m} R_{\\text {out }}  \\tag{9.41}\\\\\n& =-g_{m 1} r_{O 1} . \\tag{9.42}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSuppose the transistor is degenerated by an emitter resistor equal to $R_{E}$. The transconductance falls but the output resistance rises. Does the voltage gain increase or decrease?\n\nThe above lemma serves as an alternative method of gain calculation. It also indicates that the voltage gain of a circuit can be increased by raising the output impedance, as in cascodes.\n\nBipolar Cascode Amplifier: Recall from Chapter 4 that to maximize the voltage gain of a common-emitter stage, the collector load impedance must be maximized. In the limit, an ideal current source serving as the load [Fig. 9.16(a)] yields a voltage gain of:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nA_{v} & =-g_{m 1} r_{O 1}  \\tag{9.43}\\\\\n& =-\\frac{V_{A}}{V_{T}} \\tag{9.44}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIn this case, the small-signal current, $g_{m 1} v_{i n}$, produced by $Q_{1}$ flows through $r_{O 1}$, thus generating an output voltage equal to $-g_{m 1} v_{i n} r_{O 1}$.\n\nNow, suppose we stack a transistor on top of $Q_{1}$ as shown in Fig. 9.16(b). We know from Section 9.1.1 that the circuit achieves a high output impedance and, from the above lemma, a voltage gain higher than that of a CE stage.\n\nLet us determine the voltage gain of the bipolar cascode with the aid of the above lemma. As shown in Fig. 9.17(a), the short-circuit transconductance is equal to $i_{\\text {out }} / v_{\\text {in }}$. As a common-emitter stage, $Q_{1}$ still produces a collector current of $g_{m 1} v_{i n}$, which subsequently flows through $Q_{2}$ and hence through the output short:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{\\text {out }}=g_{m 1} v_{i n} \\tag{9.45}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThat is,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nG_{m}=g_{m 1} \\tag{9.46}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFigure 9.17(a) shows a bipolar cascode configuration with transistor Q1 acting as a common-emitter stage, providing a collector current of gm1*Vin. The current flows through Q2, which is configured as a diode-connected transistor, to the output. The diagram illustrates the short-circuit output current of the cascode amplifier.\n\nFigure 9.17(b) shows a detailed view of the circuit in Fig. 9.17(a).\n\nThe reader may view Eq. (9.46) dubiously. After all, as shown in Fig. 9.17(b), the collector current of $Q_{1}$ must split between $r_{O 1}$ and the impedance seen looking into the emitter of $Q_{2}$. We must therefore verify that only a negligible fraction of $g_{m 1} v_{i n}$ is \"lost\" in $r_{O 1}$. Since the base and collector voltages of $Q_{2}$ are equal, this transistor can be viewed as a diode-connected device having an impedance of $\\left(1 / g_{m 2}\\right) \\| r_{O 2}$. Dividing $g_{m 1} v_{i n}$ between this impedance and $r_{O 1}$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{\\text {out }}=g_{m 1} v_{i n} \\frac{r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}}{r_{O 1}\\left\\|r_{\\pi 2}+\\frac{1}{g_{m 2}}\\right\\| r_{O 2}} \\tag{9.47}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor typical transistors, $1 / g_{m 2} \\ll r_{O 2}, r_{O 1}$, and hence:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{\\text {out }} \\approx g_{m 1} v_{\\text {in }} \\tag{9.48}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThat is, the approximation $G_{m}=g_{m 1}$ is reasonable.\n\nTo obtain the overall voltage gain, we write from Eqs. (9.33) and (9.5):\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nA_{v} & =-G_{m} R_{\\text {out }}  \\tag{9.49}\\\\\n& =-g_{m 1}\\left\\{\\left[1+g_{m 2}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right)\\right] r_{O 2}+r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right\\}  \\tag{9.50}\\\\\n& \\approx-g_{m 1}\\left[g_{m 2}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right) r_{O 2}+r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right] . \\tag{9.51}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nAlso, since $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ carry approximately equal bias currents, $g_{m 1} \\approx g_{m 2}$ and $r_{O 1} \\approx r_{O 2}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nA_{v} & =-g_{m 1} r_{O 1}\\left[g_{m 1}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right)+1\\right]  \\tag{9.52}\\\\\n& \\approx-g_{m 1} r_{O 1} g_{m 1}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right) . \\tag{9.53}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nCompared to the simple CE stage of Fig. 9.16(a), the cascode amplifier exhibits a gain that is higher by a factor of $g_{m 1}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right)$-a relatively large value because $r_{O 1}$ and $r_{\\pi 2}$ are much greater than $1 / g_{m 1}$. For $\\beta=100$ for both transistors, determine the voltage gain. Assume the load is an ideal current source.\n\nSolution: We have $g_{m 1}=(26 \\Omega)^{-1}, r_{\\pi 1} \\approx r_{\\pi 2} \\approx 2600 \\Omega, r_{O 1} \\approx r_{O 2}=5 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$. Thus:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ng_{m 1}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right)=65.8 \\tag{9.54}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand from Eq. (9.53):\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left|A_{v}\\right|=12,654 . \\tag{9.55}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nCascoding thus raises the voltage gain by a factor of 65.8.\n\nExercise: What Early voltage gives a gain of 5,000?\n\nIt is possible to view the cascode amplifier as a common-emitter stage followed by a common-base stage. Illustrated in Fig. 9.18, the idea is to consider the cascode device, $Q_{2}$, as a common-base transistor that senses the small-signal current produced by $Q_{1}$. This perspective may prove useful in some cases.\n\nFigure 9.18 shows a cascode amplifier with a common-emitter (CE) stage formed by Q1 and a common-base (CB) stage formed by Q2. The current source I1 provides biasing from VCC, and the output is taken from the collector of Q2.\n\nThe high voltage gain of the cascode topology makes it attractive for many applications. But, in the circuit of Fig. 9.16(b), the load is assumed to be an ideal current source. An actual current source lowers the impedance seen at the output node and hence the voltage gain. For example, the circuit illustrated in Fig. 9.19(a) suffers from a low gain because the pnp current source introduces an impedance of only $r_{O 3}$ from the output node to ac ground, dropping the output impedance to:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nR_{\\text {out }} & =r_{O 3} \\|\\left\\{\\left[1+g_{m 2}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right)\\right] r_{O 2}+r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right\\}  \\tag{9.56}\\\\\n& \\approx r_{O 3} \\|\\left[g_{m 2} r_{O 2}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right)+r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right] . \\tag{9.57}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nHow should we realize the load current source to maintain a high gain? We know from Section 9.1.1 that cascoding also raises the output impedance of current sources, postulating that the circuit of Fig. 9.5 is a good candidate and arriving at the stage depicted in Fig. 9.19(b). The output impedance is now given by the parallel combination of those of the $n p n$ and $p n p$ cascodes, $R_{o n}$ and $R_{o p}$, respectively. Using Eq. (9.7), we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& R_{o n} \\approx g_{m 2} r_{O 2}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right)  \\tag{9.58}\\\\\n& R_{o p} \\approx g_{m 3} r_{O 3}\\left(r_{o 4} \\| r_{\\pi 3}\\"

We relate $i_{\\text {out }}$ to $v_{\\text {in }}$ through the circuit's transconductance, $G_{m}=i_{\\text {out }} / v_{\\text {in }}$. Thus, in Fig. 9.14(a):\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv_{\\text {out }} & =-i_{\\text {out }} R_{\\text {out }}  \\tag{9.34}\\\\\n& =-G_{m} v_{\\text {in }} R_{\\text {out }} \\tag{9.35}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhich leads to:\n\n$$\n\\frac{v_{\\text {out }}}{v_{\\text {in }}}=-G_{m} R_{\\text {out }} \\tag{9.36}\n$$\n\nExample: Calculate the voltage gain of the common-emitter stage shown in Fig. 9.15(a).\n\nFigure 9.15(a) shows a common-emitter amplifier stage with an NMOS transistor Q1. The input voltage Vin controls the transistor, and the output is taken from Vout. Current source I1 provides biasing, and the circuit is powered by Vcc and grounded at GND.\n\nFigure 9.15(b) depicts a simplified representation for measuring the short-circuit transconductance of an NPN transistor. The output current $i_{\\text {out }}$ is equal to the collector current of Q1, which is $g_{m 1} v_{i n}$ when the output is shorted to ground.\n\nFigure 9.15(c) represents a simple NPN transistor setup with the collector connected to node ix, base and emitter to GND, and a voltage source Vx connected between node ix and GND.\n\nSolution: To calculate the short-circuit transconductance, we place an ac short from the output to ground and find the current through it, as in Fig. 9.15(b). In this case, $i_{\\text {out }}$ is simply the collector current of $Q_{1}$, $g_{m 1} v_{i n}$, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nG_{m} & =\\frac{i_{\\text {out }}}{v_{\\text {in }}}  \\tag{9.37}\\\\\n& =g_{m 1} \\tag{9.38}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nNoting that $r_{O}$ does not carry a current in this test, we obtain the output resistance as shown in Fig. 9.15(c):\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nR_{\\text {out }} & =\\frac{v_{X}}{i_{X}}  \\tag{9.39}\\\\\n& =r_{O 1} \\tag{9.40}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThus:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nA_{v} & =-G_{m} R_{\\text {out }}  \\tag{9.41}\\\\\n& =-g_{m 1} r_{O 1} . \\tag{9.42}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIf the transistor is degenerated by an emitter resistor equal to $R_{E}$, the transconductance decreases, but the output resistance increases. Does the voltage gain increase or decrease?\n\nThe above lemma provides an alternative gain calculation method and indicates that increasing the output impedance, as in cascodes, raises the voltage gain.\n\nBipolar Cascode Amplifier: To maximize the voltage gain of a common-emitter stage, the collector load impedance must be maximized, as discussed in Chapter 4. An ideal current source as the load, as shown in Fig. 9.16(a), yields a voltage gain of:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nA_{v} & =-g_{m 1} r_{O 1}  \\tag{9.43}\\\\\n& =-\\frac{V_{A}}{V_{T}} \\tag{9.44}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIn this case, the small-signal current $g_{m 1} v_{i n}$ produced by $Q_{1}$ flows through $r_{O 1}$, generating an output voltage of $-g_{m 1} v_{i n} r_{O 1}$.\n\nBy stacking a transistor on top of $Q_{1}$, as shown in Fig. 9.16(b), we achieve a high output impedance and, according to the lemma, a higher voltage gain than a CE stage.\n\nFigure 9.16(a) shows a common-emitter amplifier with a current source I1 providing biasing, and the output taken across resistor rO1.\n\nFigure 9.16(b) depicts a cascode amplifier with a current source I1 providing biasing, and the output taken from the collector of Q2. The cascode configuration increases the output impedance.\n\nLet's determine the voltage gain of the bipolar cascode using the lemma. As shown in Fig. 9.17(a), the short-circuit transconductance is $i_{\\text {out }} / v_{\\text {in }}$. As a common-emitter stage, $Q_{1}$ still produces a collector current of $g_{m 1} v_{i n}$, which flows through $Q_{2}$ and hence through the output short:\n\n$$\ni_{\\text {out }}=g_{m 1} v_{i n} \\tag{9.45}\n$$\n\nThat is:\n\n$$\nG_{m}=g_{m 1} \\tag{9.46}\n$$\n\nFigure 9.17(a) illustrates the short-circuit output current of a cascode amplifier, with transistor Q1 acting as a common-emitter stage, providing a collector current of $g_{m 1} v_{i n}$, which flows through Q2, configured as a diode-connected transistor, to the output.\n\nFigure 9.17(b) shows a bipolar cascode configuration with two NMOS transistors Q1 and Q2. The output current Iout is derived from the collector of Q2, resistor rO2 is connected between the output and node X, and resistor rO1 is connected between node X and ground. Capacitor C1e2 is connected between node X and ground, and the input voltage Vin controls the gate of Q1, with the gate of Q2 grounded.\n\nThe reader might question Eq. (9.46). As shown in Fig. 9.17(b), the collector current of $Q_{1}$ splits between $r_{O 1}$ and the impedance seen looking into the emitter of $Q_{2}$. We must verify that only a negligible fraction of $g_{m 1} v_{i n}$ is \"lost\" in $r_{O 1}$. Since the base and collector voltages of $Q_{2}$ are equal, this transistor can be viewed as a diode-connected device having an impedance of $\\left(1 / g_{m 2}\\right) \\| r_{O 2}$. Dividing $g_{m 1} v_{i n}$ between this impedance and $r_{O 1}$, we have:\n\n$$\ni_{\\text {out }}=g_{m 1} v_{i n} \\frac{r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}}{r_{O 1}\\left\\|r_{\\pi 2}+\\frac{1}{g_{m 2}}\\right\\| r_{O 2}} \\tag{9.47}\n$$\n\nFor typical transistors, $1 / g_{m 2} \\ll r_{O 2}, r_{O 1}$, and hence:\n\n$$\ni_{\\text {out }} \\approx g_{m 1} v_{\\text {in }} \\tag{9.48}\n$$\n\nThat is, the approximation $G_{m}=g_{m 1}$ is reasonable.\n\nTo obtain the overall voltage gain, we write from Eqs. (9.33) and (9.5):\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nA_{v} & =-G_{m} R_{\\text {out }}  \\tag{9.49}\\\\\n& =-g_{m 1}\\left\\{\\left[1+g_{m 2}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right)\\right] r_{O 2}+r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right\\}  \\tag{9.50}\\\\\n& \\approx-g_{m 1}\\left[g_{m 2}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right) r_{O 2}+r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right] . \\tag{9.51}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nAlso, since $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ carry approximately equal bias currents, $g_{m 1} \\approx g_{m 2}$ and $r_{O 1} \\approx r_{O 2}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nA_{v} & =-g_{m 1} r_{O 1}\\left[g_{m 1}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right)+1\\right]  \\tag{9.52}\\\\\n& \\approx-g_{m 1} r_{O 1} g_{m 1}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right) . \\tag{9.53}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nCompared to the simple CE stage of Fig. 9.16(a), the cascode amplifier exhibits a gain that is higher by a factor of $g_{m 1}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right)$-a relatively large value because $r_{O 1}$ and $r_{\\pi 2}$ are much greater than $1 / g_{m 1}$. For $\\beta=100$ for both transistors, determine the voltage gain. Assume the load is an ideal current source.\n\nSolution: We have $g_{m 1}=(26 \\Omega)^{-1}, r_{\\pi 1} \\approx r_{\\pi 2} \\approx 2600 \\Omega, r_{O 1} \\approx r_{O 2}=5 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$. Thus:\n\n$$\ng_{m 1}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right)=65.8 \\tag{9.54}\n$$\n\nand from Eq. (9.53):\n\n$$\n\\left|A_{v}\\right|=12,654 . \\tag{9.55}\n$$\n\nCascoding thus raises the voltage gain by a factor of 65.8.\n\nExercise: What Early voltage gives a gain of 5,000?\n\nThe cascode amplifier can be viewed as a common-emitter stage followed by a common-base stage. As shown in Fig. 9.18, the idea is to consider the cascode device, $Q_{2}$, as a common-base transistor that senses the small-signal current produced by $Q_{1}$. This perspective may be useful in some cases.\n\nFigure 9.18 depicts a cascode amplifier with a common-emitter (CE) stage formed by Q1 and a common-base (CB) stage formed by Q2. Current source I1 provides biasing from VCC, and the output is taken from the collector of Q2.\n\nThe high voltage gain of the cascode topology makes it attractive for many applications. However, the load is assumed to be an ideal current source. An actual current source lowers the impedance seen at the output node and hence the voltage gain. For example, the circuit illustrated in Fig. 9.19(a) suffers from low gain because the pnp current source introduces an impedance of only $r_{O 3}$ from the output node to ac ground, dropping the output impedance to:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nR_{\\text {out }} & =r_{O 3} \\|\\left\\{\\left[1+g_{m 2}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right)\\right] r_{O 2}+r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right\\}  \\tag{9.56}\\\\\n& \\approx r_{O 3} \\|\\left[g_{m 2} r_{O 2}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right)+r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right] . \\tag{9.57}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nHow should we realize the load current source to maintain high gain? We know from Section 9.1.1 that cascoding also raises the output impedance of current sources, suggesting that the circuit of Fig. 9.5 is a good candidate, arriving at the stage depicted in Fig. 9.19(b). The output impedance is now given by the parallel combination of those of the $n p n$ and $p n p$ cascodes, $R_{o n}$ and $R_{o p}$, respectively. Using Eq. (9.7), we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& R_{o n} \\approx g_{m 2} r_{O 2}\\left(r_{O 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right)  \\tag{9.58}\\\\\n& R_{o p} \\approx g_{m 3} r_{O 3}\\left(r_{o 4} \\| r_{\\pi 3}\\right) \\tag{9.59}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nNote that, since $n p n$ and $p n p$ devices may display different Early voltages, $r_{O 1}\\left(=r_{O 2}\\right)$ may not be equal to $r_{O 3}\\left(=r_{O 4}\\right)$.\n\nRecognizing that the short-circuit transconductance, $G_{m}$, of the stage is still approximately equal to $g_{m 1}$, we express the voltage gain as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nA_{v} & =-g_{m 1}\\left(R_{o n} \\| R_{o p}\\right)  \\tag{9.60}\\\\\n& \\approx-g_{m 1}\\left\\{\\left[g_{m 2} r_{O 2}\\left(r_{o 1} \\| r_{\\pi 2}\\right)\\right] \\|\\left[g_{m 3} r_{O 3}\\left(r_{O 4} \\| r_{\\pi 3}\\right)\\right]\\right\\} . \\tag{9.61}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis result represents the highest voltage gain that can be obtained in a cascode stage. For comparable values of $R_{o n}$ and $R_{o p}$, this gain is about half of that expressed by Eq. (9.53).\n\nExample: Suppose the circuit of Example 9.9 incorporates a cascode load using pnp transistors with $V_{A}=4 \\mathrm{~V}$ and $\\beta=50$. What is the voltage gain?\n\nSolution: The load transistors carry a collector current of approximately 1 mA. Thus:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n"

    "text": "The cascode topology serves as both a current source with high output impedance and a high-gain amplifier. The relationship between output impedance and gain is closely tied together. To proceed with our study, we need to grasp the concept of transconductance in circuits, which was defined in Chapters 4 and 6 as the change in the collector or drain current divided by the change in the base-emitter or gate-source voltage. This concept can be extended to entire circuits as well. As depicted in Fig. 9.12, the output voltage is set to zero by shorting the output node to ground, and the \"short-circuit transconductance\" of the circuit is defined as the output current divided by the input voltage when the output voltage is zero.\n\nThe transconductance represents the \"strength\" of a circuit in converting the input voltage to a current. The direction of the output current in Fig. 9.12 is also important to note.\n\nThe circuit diagram in Fig. 9.12 illustrates the computation of transconductance by shorting the output to ground. The output current is directed towards the ground.\n\nAn example is provided to calculate the transconductance of the CS stage shown in Fig. 9.13(a). The solution involves shorting the output node to ac ground and noting that the resistor RD carries no current, leading to the conclusion that the transconductance of the circuit is equal to that of the transistor.\n\nThe voltage gain of a linear circuit can be expressed as the product of the negative transconductance and the output resistance of the circuit.\n\nAn example is provided to determine the voltage gain of the common-emitter stage shown in Fig. 9.15(a). The solution involves calculating the short-circuit transconductance and the output resistance, leading to the voltage gain expression.\n\nThe cascode topology is then discussed in the context of bipolar and CMOS amplifiers, highlighting how it maximizes voltage gain by increasing the output impedance. The analysis techniques and the role of each device in the cascode stage are explained, emphasizing the importance of cascoding in suppressing the Miller effect and achieving high output impedance and voltage gain.\n\nThe cascode amplifier can be viewed as a common-emitter stage followed by a common-base stage, providing an alternative perspective for gain calculation. The voltage gain can be increased by raising the output impedance, as demonstrated in the cascode topology.\n\nThe discussion concludes with examples of calculating the voltage gain for both bipolar and CMOS cascode amplifiers, considering the device parameters and the effect of bias currents on output impedance and gain. The analysis techniques and the gradual approach to constructing the cascode stage are emphasized as effective methods for understanding and calculating the output impedance and voltage gain."

The voltage $V_{B E}$ biases the NPN transistor $Q_{1}$. Components include resistors $R_{1}$ (between $V_{C C}$ and $V_{B E}$) and $R_{2}$ (between $V_{B E}$ and GND), and NPN transistor $Q_{1}$ (with connections: C to LOAD, B to $V_{B E}$, E to GND).\n- **Figure 9.21(b):** This figure illustrates a MOS current source using an NMOS transistor with resistors $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ forming a voltage divider to set the gate-source voltage $V_{G S}$. The current $I_{1}$ flows from $V_{D D}$ through the load to ground. Components include resistors $R_{1}$ (between $V_{D D}$ and $V_{G S}$) and $R_{2}$ (between $V_{G S}$ and GND), and NMOS transistor $M_{1}$ (with connections: S to GND, D to LOAD, G to $V_{G S}$).\n\n**Figure 9.22:** This system block diagram labeled \"Figure 9.22\" illustrates the concept of a current mirror. It includes:\n1. **Current Source (I_REF):** Located on the left, providing a constant reference current $I_{REF}$.\n2. **Current Mirror Block:** Centrally placed, replicating the reference current to produce an output current $I_{copy}$.\n3. **Output Current (I_copy):** On the right, representing the mirrored current flowing to an external load or circuit.\n4. **Voltage Supply (V_CC):** Positioned above the current mirror block, providing necessary power for the operation.\n\nThe primary function is to replicate $I_{REF}$ through the current mirror, generating $I_{copy}$ for use in other circuit parts.\n\nThe bandgap circuit alone does not resolve all issues. An integrated circuit may need hundreds of current sources, e.g., as load impedances in CE or CS stages for high gain. However, the bandgap's complexity precludes its use for each current source in a large circuit.\n\nTo summarize, a bandgap reference can provide a \"golden current\" to avoid supply and temperature dependence, using a few tens of devices. We must then find a way to \"copy\" this golden current without replicating the entire bandgap circuitry. Current mirrors fulfill this role.\n\nAs depicted in Figure 9.22, the golden current from a bandgap reference is \"read\" by the current mirror, producing a copy with the same characteristics as $I_{R E F}$, such as $I_{\\text {copy }}=I_{R E F}$ or $2 I_{R E F}$."

For a target current $I_{1}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} V_{C C}=V_{T} \\ln \\frac{I_{1}}{I_{S}} \\tag{9.83}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nassuming the base current is negligible. However, what occurs if the temperature changes? The left-hand side remains stable if the resistors are of the same material and thus vary equally. The right-hand side, though, includes two temperature-dependent parameters: $V_{T}=k T / q$ and $I_{S}$. Therefore, even if the base-emitter voltage stays constant with temperature, $I_{1}$ does not.\n\nA comparable issue occurs in CMOS circuits. As shown in Fig. 9.21(b), a MOS current source biased via a resistive divider is affected by $V_{D D}$ and temperature. Here, we can express\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{1} & =\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}\\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\\right)^{2}  \\tag{9.84}\\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}\\left(\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} V_{D D}-V_{T H}\\right)^{2} . \\tag{9.85}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSince both mobility and threshold voltage vary with temperature, $I_{1}$ is not stable even if $V_{G S}$ is.\n\nIn essence, the conventional biasing schemes from Chapters 4 and 6 fail to maintain a constant collector or drain current when the supply voltage or ambient temperature changes. Fortunately, an advanced method for creating supply- and temperature-independent voltages and currents exists and is used in nearly all microelectronic systems. Known as the \"bandgap reference circuit\" and involving several tens of devices, this approach is detailed in more advanced texts [1].\n\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:\n[\nname: R1, type: Resistor, value: R1, ports: {N1: VCC, N2: VBE}\nname: R2, type: Resistor, value: R2, ports: {N1: VBE, N2: GND}\nname: Q1, type: NPN, ports: {C: LOAD, B: VBE, E: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:This circuit exemplifies an impractical biasing method for a bipolar current source, focusing on maintaining a steady current I1 through the load.

This diagram includes the following main components:\n\n1. **Current Source (I_REF):**\n- Positioned on the left, this is a reference current source providing a constant current denoted as \\( I_{REF} \\). This current serves as the baseline for generating a mirrored current.\n\n2. **Current Mirror Block:**\n- Located centrally, this block replicates the reference current. It is labeled \"Current Mirror\" and functions to produce a copy of the input current \\( I_{REF} \\) as the output current \\( I_{copy} \\).\n\n3. **Output Current (I_copy):**\n- On the right, \\( I_{copy} \\) represents the mirrored output current based on \\( I_{REF} \\). This current flows from the current mirror block to an external load or circuit.\n\n4. **Voltage Supply (V_CC):**\n- Positioned above the current mirror block, \\( V_{CC} \\) is the supply voltage required for the current mirror's operation, providing necessary power for the mirroring process.\n\n**Flow of Information or Control:**\n- The reference current \\( I_{REF} \\) flows into the current mirror block, generating a proportional output current \\( I_{copy} \\). The current flow direction is from the current source to the current mirror and then to the load.\n- The supply voltage \\( V_{CC} \\) ensures proper operation of the current mirror by providing the required voltage level.\n\n**Overall System Function:**\n- The primary function of this system is to replicate a reference current \\( I_{REF} \\) through the current mirror, producing an output current \\( I_{copy} \\) for use in other parts of an integrated circuit. This is crucial for applications needing matched currents, such as biasing in amplifiers or other analog circuits.\n\nFigure 9.22 Concept of current mirror.\n\nThe bandgap circuit alone does not resolve all issues! An integrated circuit may contain hundreds of current sources, e.g., as load impedances for CE or CS stages to achieve high gain. However, the complexity of the bandgap circuit precludes its use for each current source in a large integrated circuit.\n\nTo summarize our discussion, to avoid dependence on supply and temperature, a bandgap reference can provide a \"golden current\" using a few tens of devices. We must therefore find a way to \"copy\" this golden current without replicating the entire bandgap circuitry. Current mirrors fulfill this role.\n\nFigure 9.22 conceptually demonstrates our objective. The golden current generated by a bandgap reference is \"read\" by the current mirror, producing a copy with the same characteristics as $I_{R E F}$, such as $I_{\\text {copy }}=I_{R E F}$ or $2 I_{R E F}$.\n```"

    "text": "Given that the current source depicted in Figure 9.22 must be realized through a bipolar or MOS transistor, it is inferred that the current mirror likely resembles the configuration shown in Figure 9.23(a), where transistor \\( Q_1 \\) operates in the forward active region. The black box within this figure ensures that \\( I_{\\text{copy}} = I_{\\text{REF}} \\), irrespective of variations in temperature or transistor characteristics. A comparable configuration exists for MOS transistors.\n\nThe realization of the black box in Figure 9.23(a) involves generating an output voltage, \\( V_X \\) (equivalent to \\( V_{BE} \\)), such that \\( Q_1 \\) conducts a current equal to \\( I_{\\text{REF}} \\):\n\n\\[\nI_{S1} \\exp \\left( \\frac{V_X}{V_T} \\right) = I_{\\text{REF}}, \\tag{9.86}\n\\]\n\nneglecting the Early effect. Consequently, the black box adheres to the following relationship:\n\n\\[\nV_X = V_T \\ln \\left( \\frac{I_{\\text{REF}}}{I_{S1}} \\right) \\tag{9.87}\n\\]\n\nThe circuit represented in diagram (a) is configured to produce a voltage \\( V_{BE} \\) across transistor \\( Q1 \\), ensuring that it conducts a current equivalent to \\( I_{\\text{REF}} \\). The black box acts as a voltage generator, providing an output voltage proportional to the natural logarithm of the input current. In diagram (b), \\( Q_{\\text{REF}} \\) is utilized to generate a voltage \\( V1 \\), which satisfies the equation \\( V1 = V_T \\ln \\left( \\frac{I_{\\text{REF}}}{I_{S1}} \\right) \\). Diagram (c) illustrates a current mirror setup using \\( Q1 \\) and \\( Q_{\\text{REF}} \\) to replicate the reference current \\( I_{\\text{REF}} \\) to the load.\n\nFigure 9.23(b) depicts a circuit where a diode-connected NPN transistor (\\( Q_{\\text{REF}} \\)) is employed to generate a voltage \\( V1 \\) proportional to the natural logarithm of the current \\( I_{\\text{REF}} \\), forming a fundamental current mirror configuration.\n\nThe circuit shown in Figure 9.23(c) is a current mirror that duplicates the reference current \\( I_{\\text{REF}} \\) to the load, maintaining the same current \\( I_{\\text{copy}} \\) through \\( Q1 \\). The node X serves as a shared base connection for both transistors, ensuring the proper operation of the current mirror.\n\nIn Figure 9.23, (a) illustrates the conceptual model of current copying, (b) shows a voltage that is proportional to the natural logarithm of the current, and (c) presents a bipolar current mirror.\n\nTherefore, the objective is to find a circuit whose output voltage is proportional to the natural logarithm of its input, which corresponds to the inverse function of bipolar transistor characteristics. Fortunately, a single diode-connected device satisfies Equation (9.87). Disregarding the base current in Figure 9.23(b), we obtain:\n\n\\[\nV_1 = V_T \\ln \\left( \\frac{I_{\\text{REF}}}{I_{S,\\text{REF}}} \\right) \\tag{9.88}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( I_{S,\\text{REF}} \\) represents the reverse saturation current of \\( Q_{\\text{REF}} \\). In other words, \\( V_1 = V_X \\) if \\( I_{S,\\text{REF}} = I_{S1} \\), i.e., if \\( Q_{\\text{REF}} \\) is identical to \\( Q_1 \\).\n\nFigure 9.23(c) encapsulates the concept, displaying the current mirror circuit. We state that \\( Q_1 \\) \"mirrors\" or duplicates the current flowing through \\( Q_{\\text{REF}} \\). For the time being, base currents are neglected. From one perspective, \\( Q_{\\text{REF}} \\) computes the natural logarithm of \\( I_{\\text{REF}} \\) and \\( Q_1 \\) computes the exponential of \\( V_X \\), resulting in \\( I_{\\text{copy}} = I_{\\text{REF}} \\). From another viewpoint, since \\( Q_{\\text{REF}} \\) and \\( Q_1 \\) share equal base-emitter voltages, the following equations can be written:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{\\text{REF}} &= I_{S,\\text{REF}} \\exp \\left( \\frac{V_X}{V_T} \\right) \\tag{9.89}\\\\\nI_{\\text{copy}} &= I_{S1} \\exp \\left( \\frac{V_X}{V_T} \\right) \\tag{9.90}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nConsequently:\n\n\\[\nI_{\\text{copy}} = \\frac{I_{S1}}{I_{S,\\text{REF}}} I_{\\text{REF}} \\tag{9.91}\n\\]\n\nwhich simplifies to \\( I_{\\text{copy}} = I_{\\text{REF}} \\) if \\( Q_{\\text{REF}} \\) and \\( Q_1 \\) are identical. This holds true even though \\( V_T \\) and \\( I_S \\) vary with temperature. Note that \\( V_X \\) does change with temperature but in a manner that ensures \\( I_{\\text{copy}} \\) remains constant.\n\nShould an electrical engineering student, enthusiastic about the current mirror concept, construct the circuit but inadvertently omit the connection between the base and collector of \\( Q_{\\text{REF}} \\) (Figure 9.24), the outcome would be as follows.\n\nFigure 9.24 shows a current mirror configuration lacking the base-collector connection for \\( Q_{\\text{REF}} \\). This absence results in an undefined base-emitter voltage for the transistors, leading to \\( I_{\\text{copy}} \\) being zero.\n\nFigure 9.24: The circuit lacks a path for the base currents of the transistors. Fundamentally, the base-emitter voltage of the devices is not established. The absence of base currents results in \\( I_{\\text{copy}} = 0 \\).\n\nExample 9.13 involves a student who, upon realizing the oversight in the previous circuit, makes the adjustment shown in Figure 9.25, anticipating that the battery \\( V_X \\) will supply the base currents and define the base-emitter voltage of \\( Q_{\\text{REF}} \\) and \\( Q_1 \\). The outcome of this modification is as follows.\n\nFigure 9.25 incorporates two NPN transistors, \\( Q_{\\text{REF}} \\) and \\( Q_1 \\), sharing a common base voltage \\( V_X \\). The current source \\( I_{\\text{REF}} \\) supplies current to the node \\( CREF \\). A capacitor \\( C_{\\text{ref}} \\) is connected between \\( V_X \\) and ground.\n\nFigure 9.25: Although \\( Q_1 \\) now carries a finite current, the biasing of \\( Q_1 \\) remains unchanged from that in Figure 9.21; i.e.,\n\n\\[\nI_{\\text{copy}} = I_{S1} \\exp \\left( \\frac{V_X}{V_T} \\right) \\tag{9.92}\n\\]\n\nwhich depends on temperature if \\( V_X \\) is constant. The student has overlooked the necessity of a diode-connected device to ensure that \\( V_X \\) stays proportional to \\( \\ln \\left( \\frac{I_{\\text{REF}}}{I_{S,\\text{REF}}} \\right) \\).\n\nTwo critical questions must be addressed. First, how can additional copies of \\( I_{\\text{REF}} \\) be generated to supply different sections of an integrated circuit? Second, how can different current values be obtained for these copies, such as \\( 2 I_{\\text{REF}} \\), \\( 5 I_{\\text{REF}} \\), and so forth? Considering the topology in Figure 9.22(c), it is recognized that \\( V_X \\) can function as the base-emitter voltage for multiple transistors, leading to the circuit shown in Figure 9.26(a). For simplicity, this circuit is often depicted as in Figure 9.26(b). In this setup, transistor \\( Q_j \\) conducts a current \\( I_{\\text{copy},j} \\), given by:\n\n\\[\nI_{\\text{copy},j} = I_{S,j} \\exp \\left( \\frac{V_X}{V_T} \\right) \\tag{9.93}\n\\]\n\nCombining this with Equation (9.87) yields:\n\n\\[\nI_{\\text{copy},j} = \\frac{I_{S,j}}{I_{S,\\text{REF}}} I_{\\text{REF}} \\tag{9.94}\n\\]\n\nThe key point is that multiple copies of \\( I_{\\text{REF}} \\) can be generated with minimal additional complexity since \\( I_{\\text{REF}} \\) and \\( Q_{\\text{REF}} \\) need not be replicated.\n\nEquation (9.94) also answers the second question: If \\( I_{S,j} \\) (proportional to the emitter area of \\( Q_j \\)) is set to be \\( n \\) times \\( I_{S,\\text{REF}} \\) (proportional to the emitter area of \\( Q_{\\text{REF}} \\)), then \\( I_{\\text{copy},j} = n I_{\\text{REF}} \\). We refer to these copies as being \"scaled\" relative to \\( I_{\\text{REF}} \\). As discussed in Chapter 4, this is analogous to placing \\( n \\) unit transistors in parallel. Figure 9.26(c) provides an example where \\( Q_1 \\) through \\( Q_3 \\) are identical to \\( Q_{\\text{REF}} \\), resulting in \\( I_{\\text{copy}} = 3 I_{\\text{REF}} \\).\n\nFigure 9.26(a) shows multiple copies of a reference current, (b) presents a simplified depiction of (a), and (c) demonstrates combining output currents to generate larger copies.\n\nAn example involves a multistage amplifier that includes two current sources with values of 0.75 mA and 0.5 mA. Utilizing a bandgap reference current of 0.25 mA, the task is to design the required current sources, disregarding the effect of the base current for the moment.\n\nFigure 9.27 illustrates the circuit. Here, all transistors are identical to ensure accurate scaling of \\( I_{\\text{REF}} \\).\n\nFigure 9.27: The circuit employs a bandgap reference current of 0.25 mA to generate multiple copies of reference currents using current mirrors. Transistors \\( Q1 \\), \\( Q2 \\), and \\( Q3 \\) form a mirror to deliver a 0.75 mA output, while \\( Q4 \\) and \\( Q5 \\) provide a 0.5 mA output.\n\nHowever, the method of using multiple transistors in parallel to scale the reference in current mirrors raises the question of how to create fractions of \\( I_{\\text{REF}} \\). This is achieved by configuring \\( Q_{\\text{REF}} \\) itself as multiple parallel transistors. The circuit in Figure 9.28 exemplifies this idea, starting with a larger \\( I_{S,\\text{REF}} \\) (equal to \\( 3 I_S \\) here) so that a single transistor, \\( Q_1 \\), can generate a smaller current. Reiterating the expressions in Equations (9.89) and (9.90), we obtain:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{\\text{REF}} &= 3 I_S \\exp \\left( \\frac{V_X}{V_T} \\right) \\tag{9.95}\\\\\nI_{\\text{copy}} &= I_S \\exp \\left( \\frac{V_X}{V_T} \\right) \\tag{9.96}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\nI_{\\text{copy}} = \\frac{1}{3} I_{\\text{REF}} \\tag{9.97}\n\\]\n\nAn example requires generating two currents equal to \\( 50 \\mu \\text{A} \\) and \\( 500 \\mu \\text{A} \\) from a reference of \\( 200 \\mu \\text{A} \\). The task is to design the current mirror circuit.\n\nTo generate the smaller current, four unit transistors must be employed for \\( Q_{\\text{REF}} \\) so that each carries \\( 50 \\mu \\text{A} \\). A single transistor thus generates \\( 50 \\mu \\text{A} \\) (Figure 9.29). The current of \\( 500 \\mu \\text{A} \\) necessitates 10 unit transistors, denoted as \\( 10 A_E \\) for simplicity.\n\nFigure 9.29: The circuit is a current mirror designed to produce two output currents, \\( I_{\\text{copy}1} \\) and \\( I_{\\text{copy}2} \\), from a reference current \\( I_{\\text{REF}} \\) of \\( 0.2 \\text{mA} \\). Transistors \\( Q1 \\) and \\( Q2 \\) are NPN transistors configured to mirror the reference current. \\( Q1 \\) is used to generate a smaller current, while \\( Q2 \\) generates a larger current. The circuit uses parallel transistors to achieve the desired current ratios.\n\nThe effect of base current, hitherto neglected, becomes significant as the number of copies (i.e., the total copied current) increases. The error arises because a portion of \\( I_{\\text{REF}} \\) flows through the bases rather than the collector of \\( Q_{\\text{REF}} \\). Analyzing the error with the help of Figure 9.30, where \\( A_E \\) and \\( n A_E \\) denote one unit transistor and \\( n \\) unit transistors, respectively, the objective is to calculate \\( I_{\\text{copy}} \\), recognizing that \\( Q_{\\text{REF}} \\) and \\( Q_1 \\) still have equal base-emitter voltages and hence carry currents in a ratio of \\( n \\). Therefore, the base currents of \\( Q_1 \\) and \\( Q_{\\text{REF}} \\) can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{gather*}\nI_{B1} = \\frac{I_{\\text{copy}}}{\\beta} \\tag{9.98}\\\\\nI_{B,\\text{REF}} = \\frac{I_{\\text{copy}}}{\\beta} \\cdot \\frac{1}{n} \\tag{9.99}\n\\end{gather*}\n\\]\n\nApplying a KCL at node \\( X \\) yields:\n\n\\[\nI_{\\text{REF}} = I_{C,\\text{REF}} + \\frac{I_{\\text{copy}}}{\\beta} \\cdot \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{I_{\\text{copy}}}{\\beta} \\tag{9.100}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( I_{C,\\text{REF}} = \\frac{I_{\\text{copy}}}{n} \\), this leads to:\n\n\\[\nI_{\\text{copy}} = \\frac{n I_{\\text{REF}}}{1 + \\frac{1}{\\beta}(n+1)} \\tag{9.101}\n\\]\n\nFor a large \\( \\beta \\) and moderate \\( n \\), the second term in the denominator is much smaller than unity, and \\( I_{\\text{copy}} \\approx n I_{\\text{REF}} \\). However, as the copied current ( \\( \\alpha n \\) ) increases, so does the error in \\( I_{\\text{copy}} \\).\n\nTo mitigate this error, the bipolar current mirror can be modified as shown in Figure 9.31. Here, an emitter follower \\( Q_F \\) is inserted between the collector of \\( Q_{\\text{REF}} \\) and node \\( X \\), thereby reducing the impact of the base currents by a factor of \\( \\beta \\). Specifically, assuming \\( I_{C,F} \\approx I_{E,F} \\), the analysis can be repeated by applying a KCL at \\( X \\):\n\n\\[\nI_{C,F} = \\frac{I_{\\text{copy}}}{\\beta} + \\frac{I_{\\text{copy}}}{\\beta} \\cdot \\frac{1}{n} \\tag{9.102}\n\\]\n\nyielding the base current of \\( Q_F \\) as:\n\n\\[\nI_{B,F} = \\frac{I_{\\text{copy}}}{\\beta^2} \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{n} \\right) \\tag{9.103}\n\\]\n\nAnother KCL at node \\( P \\) gives:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{\\text{REF}} &= I_{B,F} + I_{C,\\text{REF}} \\tag{9.104}\\\\\n&= \\frac{I_{\\text{copy}}}{\\beta^2} \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{n} \\right) + \\frac{I_{\\text{copy}}}{n} \\tag{9.105}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\nI_{\\text{copy}} = \\frac{n I_{\\text{REF}}}{1 + \\frac{1}{\\beta^2}(n+1)} \\tag{9.106}\n\\]\n\nThis indicates that the error is reduced by a factor of \\( \\beta \\).\n\nThe error in \\( I_{\\text{copy}1} \\) and \\( I_{\\text{copy}2} \\) in Figure 9.29 is calculated before and after adding an emitter follower.\n\nNoting that \\( I_{\\text{copy}1} \\), \\( I_{\\text{copy}2} \\), and \\( I_{C,\\text{REF}} \\) (the total current through four unit transistors) still maintain their nominal ratios, a KCL at \\( X \\) is written:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{\\text{REF}} &= I_{C,\\text{REF}} + \\frac{I_{\\text{copy}1}}{\\beta} + \\frac{I_{\\text{copy}2}}{\\beta} + \\frac{I_{C,\\text{REF}}}{\\beta} \\tag{9.107}\\\\\n&= 4 I_{\\"

    "text": "Given that the current source generating $I_{\\text {copy }}$ in Fig. 9.22 must be realized through either a bipolar or MOS transistor, it's inferred that the current mirror likely follows the topology depicted in Fig. 9.23(a), where transistor $Q_{1}$ functions in the forward active region, and the black box ensures $I_{\\text {copy }}=I_{R E F}$, irrespective of temperature or transistor attributes. (The MOS equivalent is analogous.)\n\nThe realization of the black box in Fig. 9.23(a) should produce an output voltage, $V_{X}\\left(=V_{B E}\\right)$, which ensures that $Q_{1}$ conducts a current equivalent to $I_{R E F}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{S 1} \\exp \\frac{V_{X}}{V_{T}}=I_{R E F}, \\tag{9.86}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere the Early effect is disregarded.

The black box acts as a voltage generator that outputs a voltage proportional to the natural logarithm of its input current. In diagram (b), transistor $QREF$ is employed to generate voltage $V1$, which adheres to the equation $V1 = V_T \\ln(I_{REF}/I_{S1})$. Diagram (c) presents a current mirror configuration using $Q1$ and $QREF$ to replicate the reference current $I_{REF}$ to the load.\n\nFigure 9.23(b) depicts a circuit where a diode-connected NPN transistor ($QREF$) generates a voltage $V1$ proportional to the natural logarithm of current $I_{REF}$. This setup constitutes a fundamental current mirror.\n\nThe depicted circuit serves as a current mirror configuration that duplicates the reference current $I_{REF}$ to the load, preserving the same current $I_{copy}$ through $Q1$. The node X serves as a shared base connection for both transistors, guaranteeing the current mirror functionality.\n\nFigure 9.23 (a) represents a conceptual illustration of current copying, (b) shows a voltage proportional to the natural logarithm of current, and (c) displays a bipolar current mirror.\n\nTherefore, the pursuit lies in a circuit whose output voltage is proportional to the natural logarithm of its input—the inverse of bipolar transistor characteristics. Conveniently, a single diode-connected device satisfies Eq. (9.87). Ignoring the base current in Fig. 9.23(b), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{1}=V_{T} \\ln \\frac{I_{R E F}}{I_{S, R E F}}, \\tag{9.88}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $I_{S, R E F}$ denotes the reverse saturation current of $Q_{R E F}$. Hence, $V_{1}=V_{X}$ if $I_{S, R E F}=I_{S 1}$, i.e., if $Q_{R E F}$ is indistinguishable from $Q_{1}$.\n\nFigure 9.23(c) encapsulates our understanding, exhibiting the current mirror circuit. We say $Q_{1}$ \"mirrors\" or duplicates the current flowing through $Q_{R E F}$. For the moment, base currents are ignored. From one viewpoint, $Q_{R E F}$ computes the natural logarithm of $I_{R E F}$, and $Q_{1}$ computes the exponential of $V_{X}$, thereby yielding $I_{copy}=I_{R E F}$.

This holds true even though $V_{T}$ and $I_{S}$ fluctuate with temperature. Note that $V_{X}$ does vary with temperature but in such a manner that $I_{\\text {copy }}$ remains constant.\n\nAn enthusiastic electrical engineering student, intrigued by the current mirror concept, constructs the circuit but overlooks connecting the base of $Q_{R E F}$ to its collector (Fig. 9.24). What occurs in this scenario?\n\nFigure 9.24 illustrates the consequences of a missing base-collector connection for $Q_{R E F}$ in a current mirror configuration. This omission results in an undefined base-emitter voltage for the transistors, leading to $I_{\\text {copy }}=0$.\n\nUpon realizing the error, the student makes the adjustment shown in Fig. 9.25, anticipating that the battery $V_{X}$ will supply the base currents and define the base-emitter voltage of $Q_{R E F}$ and $Q_{1}$. What happens now?\n\nFigure 9.25 portrays the consequences of the modification. While $Q_{1}$ now carries a finite current, the biasing of $Q_{1}$ mimics that in Fig. 9.21; i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{copy}=I_{S 1} \\exp \\frac{V_{X}}{V_{T}}, \\tag{9.92}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhich depends on temperature if $V_{X}$ remains constant.

First, how can additional copies of $I_{R E F}$ be produced to supply different sections of an integrated circuit? Second, how can varying values of these copies be achieved, such as $2 I_{R E F}, 5 I_{R E F}$, etc.? Referring to the topology in Fig. 9.22(c), it's recognized that $V_{X}$ can act as the base-emitter voltage for multiple transistors, leading to the circuit depicted in Fig. 9.26(a). For simplicity, the circuit is often depicted as in Fig. 9.26(b). Here, transistor $Q_{j}$ conducts a current $I_{copy, j}$, given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{copy, j}=I_{S, j} \\exp \\frac{V_{X}}{V_{T}}, \\tag{9.93}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhich, in conjunction with Eq.

(9.94) also answers the second question: If $I_{S, j} (\\propto$ the emitter area of $Q_{j}$) is set to be $n$ times $I_{S, R E F} (\\propto$ the emitter area of $Q_{R E F}$), then $I_{copy, j}=n I_{R E F}$. We refer to these copies as \"scaled\" with respect to $I_{R E F}$. As discussed in Chapter 4, this is analogous to placing $n$ unit transistors in parallel. Figure 9.26(c) exemplifies this where $Q_{1}-Q_{3}$ are identical to $Q_{R E F}$, providing $I_{\\text {copy }}=3 I_{R E F}$.\n\nAn example involves a multistage amplifier that incorporates two current sources of 0.75 mA and 9.14 0.5 mA. Utilizing a bandgap reference current of 0.25 mA, the task is to design the necessary current sources, disregarding the base current for now.\n\nFigure 9.27 presents the circuit. Here, all transistors are identical to ensure accurate scaling of $I_{R E F}$.\n\nTo generate fractions of $I_{R E F}$, $Q_{R E F}$ itself is realized as multiple parallel transistors. As shown in the circuit of Fig. 9.28, the idea is to start with a larger $I_{S, R E F}$ ($=3 I_{S}$ here) so that a unit transistor, $Q_{1}$, can produce a smaller current. Reiterating the expressions in Eqs. (9.89) and (9.90), we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& I_{R E F}=3 I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{X}}{V_{T}}  \\tag{9.95}\\\\\n& I_{\\text {copy }}=I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{X}}{V_{T}} \\tag{9.96}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nthus,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{\\text {copy }}=\\frac{1}{3} I_{R E F} \\tag{9.97}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAn example requires generating two currents of $50 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$ and $500 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$ from a reference of 9.15 $200 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$. The design of the current mirror circuit follows.\n\nTo generate the smaller current, four unit transistors must be employed for $Q_{R E F}$ such that each carries $50 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$. A unit transistor thus produces $50 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$ (Fig. 9.29). The current of $500 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$ necessitates 10 unit transistors, denoted by $10 A_{E}$ for brevity.\n\nThe effect of base current, heretofore neglected, draws from node $X$ in Fig. 9.26(a) by all transistors, leading to a significant error as the number of copies (i.e., the total copied current) increases. The error originates because a portion of $I_{R E F}$ traverses the bases rather than the collector of $Q_{R E F}$. Analyzing the error with the help of the diagram in Fig. 9.30, where $A_{E}$ and $n A_{E}$ represent one unit transistor and $n$ unit transistors, respectively, the goal is to calculate $I_{\\text {copy }}$, acknowledging that $Q_{R E F}$ and $Q_{1}$ still possess equal base-emitter voltages and hence carry currents in a ratio of $n$. Therefore, the base currents of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{R E F}$ can be expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{gather*}\nI_{B 1}=\\frac{I_{copy}}{\\beta}  \\tag{9.98}\\\\\nI_{B, R E F}=\\frac{I_{copy}}{\\beta} \\cdot \\frac{1}{n} . \\tag{9.99}\n\\end{gather*}\n$$\n\nA KCL at $X$ yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{R E F}=I_{C, R E F}+\\frac{I_{copy}}{\\beta} \\cdot \\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{I_{copy}}{\\beta}, \\tag{9.100}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhich, since $I_{C, R E F}=I_{\\text {copy }} / n$, results in\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{copy}=\\frac{n I_{R E F}}{1+\\frac{1}{\\beta}(n+1)} \\tag{9.101}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor a high $\\beta$ and moderate $n$, the second term in the denominator is much smaller than unity, and $I_{\\text {copy }} \\approx n I_{R E F}$. However, as the copied current ($\\alpha n$) increases, so does the error in $I_{\\text {copy }}$.\n\nTo mitigate the aforementioned error, the bipolar current mirror can be modified as shown in Fig. 9.31. Here, an emitter follower $Q_{F}$ is inserted between the collector of $Q_{R E F}$ and node $X$, thereby reducing the impact of the base currents by a factor of $\\beta$. Specifically, assuming $I_{C, F} \\approx I_{E, F}$, the analysis is repeated by writing a KCL at $X$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C, F}=\\frac{I_{copy}}{\\beta}+\\frac{I_{copy}}{\\beta} \\cdot \\frac{1}{n} \\tag{9.102}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nyielding the base current of $Q_{F}$ as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{B, F}=\\frac{I_{copy}}{\\beta^{2}}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}\\right) \\tag{9.103}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAnother KCL at node $P$ provides\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{R E F} & =I_{B, F}+I_{C, R E F}  \\tag{9.104}\\\\\n& =\\frac{I_{\\text {copy }}}{\\beta^{2}}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}\\right)+\\frac{I_{\\text {copy }}}{n} \\tag{9.105}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nand thus\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{\\text {copy }}=\\frac{n I_{R E F}}{1+\\frac{1}{\\beta^{2}}(n+1)} \\tag{9.106}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe error is thereby reduced by a factor of $\\beta$.\n\nThe error in $I_{copy 1}$ and $I_{copy 2}$ in Fig. 9.29 is calculated before and after adding an emitter follower.\n\nRecognizing that $I_{\\text {copy1}}, I_{\\text {copy } 2}$, and $I_{C, R E F}$ (the total current through four unit transistors) still maintain their nominal ratios, a KCL at $X$ is written:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{R E F} & =I_{C, R E F}+\\frac{I_{copy 1}}{\\beta}+\\frac{I_{\\text {copy } 2}}{\\beta}+\\frac{I_{C, R E F}}{\\beta}  \\tag{9.107}\\\\\n& =4 I_{copy 1}+\\frac{I_{\\text {copy } 1}}{\\beta}+\\frac{10 I_{\\text {copy } 1}}{\\beta}+\\frac{I_{C, R E F}}{\\beta} \\tag{9.108}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nHence,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{copy 1} & =\\frac{I_{R E F}}{4+\\frac{15}{\\beta}}  \\tag{9.109}\\\\\nI_{\\text {copy } 2} & =\\frac{10 I_{R E F}}{4+\\frac{15}{\\beta}} \\tag{9.110}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nWith the addition of an emitter follower (Fig. 9.32), a KCL at $X$ yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{C, F} & =\\frac{I_{C, R E F}}{\\beta}+\\frac{I_{\\text {copy } 1}}{\\beta}+\\frac{I_{\\text {copy } 2}}{\\beta}  \\tag{9.111}\\\\\n& =\\frac{4 I_{\\text {copy } 1}}{\\beta}+\\frac{I_{\\text {copy } 1}}{\\beta}+\\frac{10 I_{\\text {copy } 1}}{\\beta}  \\tag{9.112}\\\\\n& =\\frac{15 I_{\\text {copy } 1}}{\\beta} \\tag{9.113}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nA KCL at $P$ therefore gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{R E F} & =\\frac{15 I_{\\text {copy } 1}}{\\beta^{2}}+I_{C, R E F}  \\tag{9.114}\\\\\n& =\\frac{15 I_{\\text {copy } 1}}{\\beta^{2}}+4 I_{\\text {copy } 1}, \\tag{9.115}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nand thus\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& I_{copy 1}=\\frac{I_{R E F}}{4+\\frac{15}{\\beta^{2}}}  \\tag{9.116}\\\\\n& I_{\\text {copy } 2}=\\frac{10 I_{R E F}}{4+\\frac{15}{\\beta^{2}}} . \\tag{9.117}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nPNP mirrors are considered next, with a common-emitter stage shown in Fig. 9.33(a), where a current source"

\"镜像\" 或复制通过 $Q_{R E F}$ 的电流。目前，我们忽略了基极电流。从一个角度来看，$Q_{R E F}$ 取 $I_{R E F}$ 的自然对数，$Q_{1}$ 取 $V_{X}$ 的指数，从而产生 $I_{c o p y}=I_{R E F}$。从另一个角度来看，由于 $Q_{R E F}$ 和 $Q_{1}$ 具有相同的基极-发射极电压，我们可以写出：\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& I_{R E F}=I_{S, R E F} \\exp \\frac{V_{X}}{V_{T}}  \\tag{9.89}\\\\\n& I_{c o p y}=I_{S 1} \\exp \\frac{V_{X}}{V_{T}}

y}=I_{R E F}$。即使 $V_{T}$ 和 $I_{S}$ 随温度变化，这也成立。请注意，$V_{X}$ 确实随温度变化，但以 $I_{\\text {copy }}$ 不变的方式变化。\n\n一个对电流镜概念感兴趣的电子工程学生构建了电路，但忘记了将 $Q_{R E F}$ 的基极连接到其集电极（图 9.24）。解释会发生什么。\n\n图 9.24\n\n解决方案：电路没有为晶体管的基极电流提供路径。更根本的是，设备的基极-发射极电压未定义。基极电流的缺乏导致 $I_{\\text {copy }}=0$。\n\n练习：$Q_{R E F}$ 的操作区域是什么？\n\n示例 9.13\n\n意识到上述电路中的错误，该学生进行了如图 9.25 所示的修改，希望电池 $V_{X}$ 提供基极电流并定义 $Q_{R E F}$ 和 $Q_{1}$ 的基极-发射极电压。解释会发生什么。\n\n图 9.25\n\n解决方案：虽然 $Q_{1}$ 现在承载有限电流，但 $Q_{1}$ 的偏置与图 9.21 中的偏置没有区别；即：\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{c o p y}=I_{S 1} \\exp \\frac{V_{X}}{V_{T}},

F})$。$Q_{R E F}$ 在什么区域工作？\n\n我们现在必须解决两个重要问题。首先，我们如何生成 $I_{R E F}$ 的额外副本以供集成电路的不同部分使用？其次，我们如何获得这些副本的不同值，例如 $2 I_{R E F}$、$5 I_{R E F}$ 等？考虑到图 9.22(c) 中的拓扑结构，我们认识到 $V_{X}$ 可以用作多个晶体管的基极-发射极电压，从而得到图 9.26(a) 中所示的电路。为了简单起见，该电路通常如图 9.26(b) 所示绘制。在这里，晶体管 $Q_{j}$ 承载的电流 $I_{c o p y, j}$ 由下式给出：\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{c o p y}, j=I_{S, j} \\exp \\frac{V_{X}}{V_{T}}, \\tag{9.93}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n结合方程式 (9.87)，我们得到：\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{\\text {copy }, j}=\\frac{I_{S, j}}{I_{S, R E F}} I_{R E F} \\tag{9.94}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n关键点是，多个 $I_{R E F}$ 副本可以以最小的额外复杂性生成，因为 $I_{R E F}$ 和 $Q_{R E F}$ 本身不需要复制。\n\n方程式 (9.94) 也轻易地回答了第二个问题：如果 $I_{S, j}$（与 $Q_{j}$ 的发射极面积成正比）选择为 $n$ 倍 $I_{S, R E F}$（与 $Q_{R E F}$ 的发射极面积成正比），则 $I_{c o p y, j}=n I_{R E F}$。我们说这些副本相对于 $I_{R E F}$ 进行了“缩放”。回想一下第 4 章中的内容，这相当于将 $n$ 个单位晶体管并联。图 9.26(c) 显示了一个示例，其中 $Q_{1}-Q_{3}$ 与 $Q_{R E F}$ 相同，提供 $I_{\\text {copy }}=3 I_{R E F}$。\n\n示例：一个多级放大器包含两个电流源，其值分别为 0.75 mA 和 9.14 0.5 mA。使用 0.25 mA 的 bandgap 参考电流，设计所需的电流源。现在忽略基极电流的影响。\n\n解决方案：图 9.27 显示了电路。在这里，所有晶体管都是相同的，以确保 $I_{R E F}$ 的适当缩放。\n\n图 9.27\n\n练习：如果 bandgap 参考电流为 0.1 mA，请重复上述示例。\n\n使用多个晶体管并联为电流镜中的参考提供了精确的缩放方法。但是，我们如何创建 $I_{R E F}$ 的分数？这是通过将 $Q_{R E F}$ 本身实现为多个并联晶体管来完成的。如图 9.28 中的电路所示，该想法是首先具有更大的 $I_{S, R E F}$（在这里是 $3 I_{S}$），以便单位晶体管 $Q_{1}$ 可以产生较小的电流。重复方程式 (9.89) 和 (9.90) 中的表达式，我们得到：\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& I_{R E F}=3 I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{X}}{V_{T}}  \\tag{9.95}\\\\\n& I_{\\text {copy }}=I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{X}}{V_{T}} \\tag{9.96}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\n因此：\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{\\text {copy }}=\\frac{1}{3} I_{R E F} \\tag{9.97}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n示例：希望从 9.15 200 μA 的参考生成两个等于 50 μA 和 500 μA 的电流。设计电流镜电路。\n\n解决方案：为了产生较小的电流，我们必须为 $Q_{R E F}$ 雇佣四个单位晶体管，每个晶体管承载 50 μA。单位晶体管因此产生 50 μA（图 9.29）。500 μA 的电流需要 10 个单位晶体管，用 $10 A_{E}$ 表示简化。\n\n图 9.29\n\n练习：如果参考电流为 150 μA，请重复上述示例。\n\n基极电流的影响\n\n到目前为止，我们忽略了在图 9.26(a) 中由所有晶体管从节点 $X$ 抽取的基极电流，随着副本数量（即总复制电流）的增加，这将导致显着的误差。误差源于部分 $I_{R E F}$ 流经基极而不是 $Q_{R E F}$ 的集电极。我们使用图 9.30 中所示的图来分析误差，其中 $A_{E}$ 和 $n A_{E}$ 表示一个单位晶体管和 $n$ 个单位晶体管。我们的目标是计算 $I_{\\text {copy }}$，认识到 $Q_{R E F}$ 和 $Q_{1}$ 仍然具有相同的基极-发射极电压，因此承载的电流比例是 $n$。因此，$Q_{1}$ 和 $Q_{R E F}$ 的基极电流可以表示为：\n\n$$\n\\begin{gather*}\nI_{B 1}=\\frac{I_{c o p y}}{\\beta}  \\tag{9.98}\\\\\nI_{B, R E F}=\\frac{I_{c o p y}}{\\beta} \\cdot \\frac{1}{n} . \\tag{9.99}\n\\end{gather*}\n$$\n\n在 $X$ 处编写 KCL 因此得到：\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{R E F}=I_{C, R E F}+\\frac{I_{c o p

F}}{1+\\frac{1}{\\beta}(n+1)} \\tag{9.101}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n对于大的 $\\beta$ 和适中的 $n$，分母中的第二项远小于 1，并且 $I_{\\text {copy }} \\approx n I_{R E F}$。但是，随着复制电流（$\\alpha n$）的增加，$I_{\\text {copy }}$ 的误差也随之增加。\n\n为了抑制上述误差，可以修改双极性电流镜，如图 9.31 所示。在这里，发射极跟随器 $Q_{F}$ 位于 $Q_{R E F}$ 的集电极和节点 $X$ 之间，从而将基极电流的影响降低一个 $\\beta$ 因子。更具体地说，假设 $I_{C, F} \\approx I_{E, F}$，我们可以通过在 $X$ 处编写 KCL 来重复上述分析：\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C, F}=\\frac{I_{c o p y}}{\\beta}+\\frac{I_{c o p y}}{\\beta} \\cdot \\frac{1}{n} \\tag{9.102}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n得到 $Q_{F}$ 的基极电流为：\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{B, F}=\\frac{I_{c o p y}}{\\beta^{2}}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}\\right) \\tag{9.103}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n在节点 $P$ 处的另一个 KCL 给出：\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{R E F} &

    "text": "Given that the current source generating \\( I_{\\text {copy }} \\) in Fig. 9.22 is typically realized with a bipolar or MOS transistor, it is inferred that the current mirror likely has a topology akin to that shown in Fig. 9.23(a), where transistor \\( Q_{1} \\) operates in the forward active region and a black box ensures \\( I_{\\text {copy }} = I_{R E F} \\) irrespective of temperature or transistor characteristics. (The equivalent MOS version is similar.)\n\nTo implement the black box from Fig. 9.23(a), it should produce an output voltage \\( V_{X} \\) (which equals \\( V_{B E} \\)) such that \\( Q_{1} \\) conducts a current equal to \\( I_{R E F} \\):\n\n\\[\nI_{S 1} \\exp \\left( \\frac{V_{X}}{V_{T}} \\right) = I_{R E F}, \\tag{9.86}\n\\]\n\nneglecting the Early effect. Hence, the black box must adhere to the following relationship:\n\n\\[\nV_{X} = V_{T} \\ln \\left( \\frac{I_{R E F}}{I_{S 1}} \\right) \\tag{9.87}\n\\]\n\nIn the circuit diagrams:\n\n- **(a)** represents a conceptual current copying setup where the black box is a voltage generator that produces a voltage proportional to the natural logarithm of its input current. This circuit ensures that transistor \\( Q1 \\) carries a current equal to \\( I_{R E F} \\).\n\n- **(b)** illustrates a configuration using a diode-connected NPN transistor \\( Q_{\\text{REF}} \\) to generate a voltage \\( V1 \\) that satisfies \\( V1 = V_{T} \\ln \\left( \\frac{I_{R E F}}{I_{S 1}} \\right) \\). This setup forms a basic current mirror.\n\n- **(c)** shows a current mirror configuration with \\( Q1 \\) and \\( Q_{\\text{REF}} \\) copying the reference current \\( I_{R E F} \\) to the load.\n\nThe current mirror in Fig. 9.23(c) is conceptualized as \\( Q1 \\) \"mirroring\" or copying the current through \\( Q_{\\text{REF}} \\), ignoring base currents for the moment. From one viewpoint, \\( Q_{\\text{REF}} \\) computes the natural logarithm of \\( I_{R E F} \\) and \\( Q1 \\) computes the exponential of \\( V_{X} \\), resulting in \\( I_{\\text{copy}} = I_{R E F} \\). From another perspective, since \\( Q_{\\text{REF}} \\) and \\( Q1 \\) share equal base-emitter voltages, the following equations can be written:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{R E F} &= I_{S, R E F} \\exp \\left( \\frac{V_{X}}{V_{T}} \\right) \\tag{9.89}\\\\\nI_{\\text{copy}} &= I_{S 1} \\exp \\left( \\frac{V_{X}}{V_{T}} \\right) \\tag{9.90}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nleading to\n\n\\[\nI_{\\text{copy}} = \\frac{I_{S 1}}{I_{S, R E F}} I_{R E F} \\tag{9.91}\n\\]\n\nwhich simplifies to \\( I_{\\text{copy}} = I_{R E F} \\) if \\( Q_{\\text{REF}} \\) and \\( Q1 \\) are identical. This holds true even with the variations in \\( V_{T} \\) and \\( I_{S} \\) due to temperature changes. Notably, \\( V_{X} \\) does change with temperature, but in a manner that keeps \\( I_{\\text{copy}} \\) constant.\n\nFor creating additional copies of \\( I_{R E F} \\) to supply different sections of an integrated circuit and for generating different current values (e.g., \\( 2 I_{R E F}, 5 I_{R E F} \\), etc.), the topology in Fig. 9.22(c) is utilized. Here, \\( V_{X} \\) acts as the base-emitter voltage for multiple transistors, leading to the circuit in Fig. 9.26(a). For simplicity, this circuit is often depicted as in Fig. 9.26(b). Each transistor \\( Q_{j} \\) in this circuit carries a current \\( I_{\\text{copy}, j} \\) given by\n\n\\[\nI_{\\text{copy}, j} = I_{S, j} \\exp \\left( \\frac{V_{X}}{V_{T}} \\right) \\tag{9.93}\n\\]\n\nwhich, combined with Eq. (9.87), results in\n\n\\[\nI_{\\text{copy}, j} = \\frac{I_{S, j}}{I_{S, R E F}} I_{R E F} \\tag{9.94}\n\\]\n\nThis demonstrates that multiple copies of \\( I_{R E F} \\) can be generated with minimal complexity, as \\( I_{R E F} \\) and \\( Q_{\\text{REF}} \\) do not need to be duplicated.\n\nTo generate fractions of \\( I_{R E F} \\), \\( Q_{\\text{REF}} \\) itself is realized as multiple parallel transistors. An example circuit is shown in Fig. 9.28, where the idea is to start with a larger \\( I_{S, R E F} \\) (three times \\( I_{S} \\) here) so that a single transistor \\( Q1 \\) can produce a smaller current. By reiterating the expressions in Eqs. (9.89) and (9.90), we obtain\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{R E F} &= 3 I_{S} \\exp \\left( \\frac{V_{X}}{V_{T}} \\right) \\tag{9.95}\\\\\nI_{\\text{copy}} &= I_{S} \\exp \\left( \\frac{V_{X}}{V_{T}} \\right) \\tag{9.96}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nand thus\n\n\\[\nI_{\\text{copy}} = \\frac{1}{3} I_{R E F} \\tag{9.97}\n\\]\n\nFor an electrical engineering student who forgets to connect the base of \\( Q_{\\text{REF}} \\) to its collector in the circuit of Fig. 9.24, this results in undefined base-emitter voltages for the transistors, causing \\( I_{\\text{copy}} \\) to be zero.\n\nIn Fig. 9.25, where the student adds a voltage source \\( V_{X} \\) hoping to provide base currents and define the base-emitter voltage of \\( Q_{\\text{REF}} \\) and \\( Q1 \\), the circuit behaves similarly to that in Fig. 9.21, with \\( I_{\\text{copy}} \\) dependent on temperature if \\( V_{X} \\) is constant.\n\nThe effect of base currents, which have been neglected thus far, becomes significant as the number of copies (total copied current) increases. This error arises because a portion of \\( I_{R E F} \\) flows through the bases rather than the collector of \\( Q_{\\text{REF}} \\). The analysis of this error is facilitated by the diagram in Fig. 9.30, where \\( A_{E} \\) and \\( n A_{E} \\) represent one unit transistor and \\( n \\) unit transistors, respectively.\n\nTo mitigate the error, a modified bipolar current mirror can be used, as shown in Fig. 9.31, where an emitter follower \\( Q_{F} \\) is inserted between the collector of \\( Q_{\\text{REF}} \\) and node \\( X \\), reducing the effect of the base currents by a factor of \\( \\beta \\).\n\nPNP mirrors can also be constructed, as demonstrated in Fig. 9.33, where a current source is realized as a pnp transistor operating in the active region.

    "text": "To achieve the desired functionality depicted in Figure 9.22, it is inferred that the current source generating \\( I_{\\text {copy }} \\) must be realized through a bipolar or MOSFET configuration, similar to the topology in Figure 9.23(a).

Diagram (c) presents a current mirror configuration utilizing \\( Q1 \\) and \\( QREF \\) to replicate the reference current \\( I_{R E F} \\) to the load.\n\nIn Figure 9.23(b), the circuit demonstrates the use of a diode-connected NPN transistor (\\( QREF \\)) to generate a voltage \\( V1 \\) that is proportional to the natural logarithm of the current \\( I_{R E F} \\). This configuration represents a fundamental current mirror setup.\n\nFigure 9.23(c) illustrates a current mirror circuit that duplicates the reference current \\( I_{R E F} \\) to the load, sustaining the same current \\( I_{\\text {copy }} \\) through \\( Q1 \\). The node X serves as a shared base connection for both transistors, ensuring the current mirror operation.\n\nFigure 9.23 displays conceptual illustrations of current copying (a), voltage proportional to the natural logarithm of the current (b), and a bipolar current mirror (c).\n\nThus, we aim to design a circuit where the output voltage is proportional to the natural logarithm of the input, which is the inverse of the bipolar transistor characteristics. Fortunately, a single diode-connected device fulfills Eq. (9.87). Ignoring the base current in Figure 9.23(b), we obtain\n\n\\[\nV_{1} = V_{T} \\ln \\left( \\frac{I_{R E F}}{I_{S, R E F}} \\right) \\tag{9.88}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( I_{S, R E F} \\) represents the reverse saturation current of \\( QR EF \\). In other words, \\( V_{1} = V_{X} \\) if \\( I_{S, R E F} = I_{S 1} \\), meaning \\( Q_{R E F} \\) is identical to \\( Q_{1} \\).\n\nFigure 9.23(c) encapsulates our understanding, showcasing the current mirror circuit.

From one standpoint, \\( Q_{R E F} \\) computes the natural logarithm of \\( I_{R E F} \\) and \\( Q_{1} \\) computes the exponential of \\( V_{X} \\), thus yielding \\( I_{c o p y} = I_{R E F} \\). From another perspective, since \\( Q_{R E F} \\) and \\( Q_{1} \\) share equal base-emitter voltages, we can write\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{R E F} &= I_{S, R E F} \\exp \\left( \\frac{V_{X}}{V_{T}} \\right) \\tag{9.89}\\\\\nI_{c o p y} &= I_{S 1} \\exp \\left( \\frac{V_{X}}{V_{T}} \\right) \\tag{9.90}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nwhich leads to\n\n\\[\nI_{c o p y} = \\frac{I_{S 1}}{I_{S, R E F}} I_{R E F} \\tag{9.91}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to \\( I_{c o p y} = I_{R E F} \\) if \\( Q_{R E F} \\) and \\( Q_{1} \\) are identical.

It is important to note that \\( V_{X} \\) does vary with temperature but in such a way that \\( I_{\\text {copy }} \\) remains unaffected.\n\nAn enthusiastic electrical engineering student, intrigued by the current mirror concept, assembles the circuit but overlooks the connection between the base and collector of \\( Q_{R E F} \\) (Figure 9.24). What transpires in this scenario?\n\nFigure 9.24 depicts a current mirror configuration with a missing base-collector connection for \\( QREF \\). This omission results in an undefined base-emitter voltage for the transistors, causing \\( I_{\\text {copy }} \\) to be zero.\n\nFigure 9.24 solution: The circuit lacks a path for the base currents of the transistors. More fundamentally, the base-emitter voltage of the devices is not defined. The absence of base currents results in \\( I_{\\text {copy }} = 0 \\).\n\nExercise: Determine the region of operation for \\( Q_{R E F} \\).\n\nExample 9.13: Upon realizing the oversight in the previous circuit, the student modifies the setup as shown in Figure 9.25, anticipating that the voltage source \\( V_{X} \\) will supply the base currents and establish the base-emitter voltage for \\( Q_{R E F} \\) and \\( Q_{1} \\). Analyze the outcome of this modification.\n\nFigure 9.25 presents a circuit with two NPN transistors, \\( Q_{REF} \\) and \\( Q_{1} \\), sharing a common base voltage \\( Vx \\). The current source \\( I_{REF} \\) supplies current to the node \\( CREF \\). A capacitor \\( C_{ref} \\) is connected between \\( Vx \\) and ground.\n\nFigure 9.25 solution: Although \\( Q_{1} \\) now carries a finite current, the biasing of \\( Q_{1} \\) remains unchanged from that in Figure 9.21; that is,\n\n\\[\nI_{c o p y} = I_{S 1} \\exp \\left( \\frac{V_{X}}{V_{T}} \\right) \\tag{9.92}\n\\]\n\nThis is temperature-dependent if \\( V_{X} \\) is constant. The student has overlooked the need for a diode-connected device to ensure \\( V_{X} \\) remains proportional to \\( \\ln(I_{R E F} / I_{S, R E F}) \\).\n\nExercise: If \\( V_{X} \\) is slightly greater than the required value, \\( V_{T} \\ln(I_{R E F} / I_{S, R E F}) \\), in what region does \\( Q_{R E F} \\) operate?\n\nNext, we address two crucial questions. First, how can we generate multiple copies of \\( I_{R E F} \\) to supply various sections of an integrated circuit? Second, how can we obtain different current levels for these copies, such as \\( 2 I_{R E F} \\), \\( 5 I_{R E F} \\), etc.? Examining the topology in Figure 9.22(c), we recognize that \\( V_{X} \\) can function as the base-emitter voltage for multiple transistors, leading to the circuit shown in Figure 9.26(a). For simplicity, the circuit is often depicted as in Figure 9.26(b). Here, transistor \\( Q_{j} \\) conducts a current \\( I_{c o p y, j} \\), given by\n\n\\[\nI_{c o p y, j} = I_{S, j} \\exp \\left( \\frac{V_{X}}{V_{T}} \\right) \\tag{9.93}\n\\]\n\nCombining this with Eq. (9.87) yields\n\n\\[\nI_{\\text {copy }, j} = \\frac{I_{S, j}}{I_{S, R E F}} I_{R E F} \\tag{9.94}\n\\]\n\nThe critical point is that multiple copies of \\( I_{R E F} \\) can be generated with minimal added complexity since \\( I_{R E F} \\) and \\( Q_{R E F} \\) do not need to be replicated.\n\nEq. (9.94) also answers the second question: If \\( I_{S, j} \\) (proportional to the emitter area of \\( Q_{j} \\)) is set to \\( n \\) times \\( I_{S, R E F} \\) (proportional to the emitter area of \\( Q_{R E F} \\)), then \\( I_{c o p y, j} = n I_{R E F} \\). We refer to these copies as being \"scaled\" relative to \\( I_{R E F} \\). As discussed in Chapter 4, this is akin to placing \\( n \\) unit transistors in parallel. Figure 9.26(c) illustrates an instance where \\( Q_{1} \\)-\\( Q_{3} \\) are identical to \\( Q_{R E F} \\), providing \\( I_{\\text {copy }} = 3 I_{R E F} \\).\n\nExample: A multistage amplifier incorporates two current sources with values of 0.75 mA and 9.14 0.5 mA.

From Chapter 6, we recall that a diode-connected MOSFET exhibits this characteristic [Fig. 9.35(b)], leading to the NMOS current mirror depicted in Fig. 9.35(c). Similar to the bipolar version, the circuit's operation can be understood from two perspectives: (1) $M_{\\text {REF }}$ computes the square root of $I_{R E F}$ and $M_{1}$ squares the result; or (2) the drain currents of the two transistors can be expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{D, R E F} & =\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{o x}\\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)_{R E F}\\left(V_{X}-V_{T H}\\right)^{2}  \\tag{9.127}\\\\\nI_{c o p y} & =\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{o x}\\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)_{1}\\left(V_{X}-V_{T H}\\right)^{2} \\tag{9.128}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere the threshold voltages are assumed to be equal.

The gate-source voltage V_GS for both transistors is set by the voltage at node X, which is common to both gates.\n\nFigure 9.35 (a) Conceptual illustration of copying a current by an NMOS device, (b) generation of a voltage proportional to the square root of current, (c) MOS current mirror.\n\nThus, it must function as a \"square-root\" circuit. From Chapter 6, we recall that a diode-connected MOSFET provides such a characteristic [Fig. 9.35(b)], leading to the NMOS current mirror depicted in Fig. 9.35(c). Similar to the bipolar version, we can interpret the circuit's operation in two ways: (1) $M_{\\text {REF }}$ computes the square root of $I_{R E F}$ and $M_{1}$ squares the result; or (2) the drain currents of the two transistors can be expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{D, R E F} & =\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{o x}\\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)_{R E F}\\left(V_{X}-V_{T H}\\right)^{2}  \\tag{9.127}\\\\\nI_{c o p y} & =\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{o x}\\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)_{1}\\left(V_{X}-V_{T H}\\right)^{2} \\tag{9.128}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nassuming equal threshold voltages. It follows that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{c o p y}=\\frac{\\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)_{1}}{\\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)_{R E F}} I_{R E F} \\tag{9.129}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhich simplifies to $I_{c o p y}=I_{R E F}$ if the two transistors are identical.\n\nExample\n9.20\n\nA student working on the circuits in Examples 9.12 and 9.13 decides to try the MOS equivalent, assuming the gate current is zero and hence leaving the gates floating (Fig. 9.36). Explain the outcome.\nimage_name:Figure 9.36\ndescription:\n[\nname: M_REF, type: NMOS, ports: {S: GND, D: dref, G: X}\nname: M_1, type: NMOS, ports: {S: GND, D: LOAD, G: X}\nname: I_REF, type: CurrentSource, ports: {Np: VDD, Nn: dref}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit is intended to be a current mirror, but it is not functioning as such because the gates of M_REF and M_1 are floating. This results in a poorly defined copy current (I_copy). The floating node X does not establish a stable gate voltage for either transistor, leading to unpredictable operation. The circuit lacks a diode-connected transistor to properly mirror the current.\n\nFigure 9.36\n\nSolution This circuit fails to function as a current mirror because only a diode-connected device can establish Eq. (9.129) and hence a copy current independent of device parameters and temperature. Since the gates of $M_{R E F}$ and $M_{1}$ are floating, they can assume any voltage, e.g., an initial condition created at node $X$ when the power supply is turned on. In other words, $I_{\\text {copy }}$ is very poorly defined.\n\nExercise Is $M_{R E F}$ always off in this circuit?\n\nGenerating additional copies of $I_{R E F}$ with different scaling factors follows the principles shown in Fig. 9.26. The following example demonstrates these concepts.\n\nExample An integrated circuit employs the source follower and the common-source stage shown\n9.21 in Fig. 9.37(a).

The NMOS M1 is configured with its source connected to Vout1, drain to VDD, and gate to Vin1. The PMOS M2 has its source connected to VDD, drain to Vout2, and gate to Vin2.
