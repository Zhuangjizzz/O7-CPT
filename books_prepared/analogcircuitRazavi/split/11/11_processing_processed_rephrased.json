    "text": "We have previously observed that operational amplifiers feature two inputs, contrasting with the amplifiers discussed in earlier chapters. To deepen our understanding of the necessity for differential circuits, let's initially examine an example.\n\nExample: After learning about rectifier design and basic amplifier stages, an electrical engineering student builds the circuit shown in Fig. 10.1(a) to amplify a microphone signal. However, when the output is connected to a speaker, the student notices significant \"humming\" noise, characterized by a consistent low-frequency component. Explain this phenomenon.\n\nRecall from Chapter 3 that the current drawn from the rectified output generates a ripple waveform at twice the AC line frequency (either 50 or 60 Hz) [Fig. 10.1(b)]. Analyzing the common-emitter stage's output reveals two components: (1) the amplified microphone signal and (2) the ripple waveform present on $V_{CC}$. For the latter, we can express:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {out }}=V_{C C}-R_{C} I_{C} \\tag{10.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHere, $V_{\\text {out }}$ essentially \"tracks\" $V_{C C}$, thereby incorporating the entire ripple. The \"hum\" originates from this ripple. Figure 10.1(c) displays the overall output, which includes both the signal and the ripple. As depicted in Fig. 10.1(d), this is summarized as \"supply noise reaching the output with a gain of unity.\" (A MOS implementation would encounter the same issue.)\n\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:The circuit is a common-emitter amplifier stage powered by a rectifier, illustrating how power supply ripple can influence the output signal. The ripple frequency for a full-wave rectifier is 120 Hz, while for a half-wave rectifier, it is 60 Hz. Enhancing C1 can reduce the ripple amplitude.\n\nimage_name:(b)\ndescription:The graph labeled (b) shows a time-domain waveform of the ripple on the supply voltage, $V_{CC}$. The x-axis represents time $t$, without specific units, and the y-axis represents voltage, specifically $V_{CC}$. The waveform has a periodic, sawtooth-like pattern, indicating ripple presence. This ripple results from the rectification process in circuit (a), likely from a full-wave or half-wave rectifier.\n\nThe ripple exhibits a steady, repeating pattern, suggesting a constant frequency, typically double the input AC frequency for a full-wave rectifier (e.g., 120 Hz if the input is 60 Hz) or the same frequency for a half-wave rectifier. The waveform doesn't reach a steady DC level but oscillates around a mean value, reflecting incomplete smoothing by capacitor $C_1$ in the circuit.\n\nNo specific annotations or markers indicate particular voltage levels or time intervals. The behavior suggests that increasing $C_1$'s capacitance could reduce the ripple amplitude, as noted.\n\nimage_name:(c)\ndescription:The graph in Fig. 10.1(c) shows a time-domain waveform of the output voltage, $V_{\\text{out}}$, from a common-emitter (CE) stage circuit. The horizontal axis represents time $t$, and the vertical axis represents the output voltage $V_{\\text{out}}$, without specific units.\n\nThe waveform illustrates the combined effect of a voice signal and power supply ripple. It shows irregular oscillations, indicating both the desired voice signal and unwanted ripple noise. The oscillations are superimposed, with the ripple frequency likely lower than the voice signal, resulting in a noisy output.\n\nThe graph highlights the issue of supply noise being transferred to the output without attenuation, as mentioned. The ripple can cause voice signal distortion, leading to a \"hum\" in the output. This visual underscores the importance of addressing power supply noise for signal integrity in audio applications.\n\nimage_name:(d)\ndescription:The diagram labeled Fig. 10.1(d) illustrates the paths of both ripple and signal to the output. Key components include a resistor $R$, a transistor, and the power supply voltage $V_{CC}$. It shows how the ripple from $V_{CC}$ and the input signal affect the transistor, highlighted in a red box.\n\n1. **Main Components:**\n- **Resistor (R):** Connected to $V_{CC}$, it sets the transistor's biasing conditions.\n- **Transistor:** The active component amplifying the input signal, connected to ground (GND) and receiving both ripple and input signal.\n- **Power Supply ($V_{CC}$):** Provides necessary voltage for circuit operation, containing a ripple component.\n\n2. **Flow of Information or Control:**\n- The ripple from $V_{CC}$ directly influences the output by passing through resistor $R$ and affecting the transistor, indicated by a gray arrow labeled 'Ripple.'\n- The input signal also reaches the transistor, affecting its operation, indicated by another arrow labeled 'Signal.'\n- Both ripple and signal converge at the transistor, driving the output.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n- Annotated with labels like 'Ripple' and 'Signal' to indicate paths to the output.\n- The transistor is highlighted in a red box, emphasizing its role in processing both ripple and signal.\n\n4. **Overall System Function:**\n- Demonstrates how both supply voltage ripple and input signal affect the output. The ripple is not attenuated and directly affects the output, causing noise or 'hum.' The diagram shows that supply noise is transferred to the output with a gain of unity, meaning it is neither diminished nor amplified.\n\nFigure 10.1: (a) CE stage powered by a rectifier, (b) ripple on supply voltage, (c) effect at output, (d) ripple and signal paths to output.\n\nExercise: Determine the hum frequency for a full-wave or half-wave rectifier.\n\nHow can we suppress the hum in the example? Increasing $C_{1}$ reduces the ripple amplitude, but the required capacitor size may become impractically large if multiple circuits draw current from the rectifier. Alternatively, we can alter the amplifier topology to make the output insensitive to $V_{CC}$. How is this feasible? Equation (10.1) suggests that changes in $V_{CC}$ directly affect $V_{\\text {out }}$, as both are measured relative to ground and differ by $R_{C} I_{C}$. But what if $V_{\\text {out }}$ is not referenced to ground? Specifically, what if $V_{\\text {out }}$ is measured relative to another point that also experiences the supply ripple? This could eliminate the ripple from the \"net\" output.\n\nThough abstract, this idea can be practically implemented. Figure 10.2(a) presents the core concept. The CE stage is duplicated on the right, and the output is now measured between nodes $X$ and $Y$ instead of from $X$ to ground. What occurs if $V_{CC}$ contains ripple? Both $V_{X}$ and $V_{Y}$ rise and fall equally, so the difference between $V_{X}$ and $V_{Y}$ remains ripple-free.\n\nIndeed, denoting the ripple as $v_{r}$, the small-signal voltages at these nodes are:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& v_{X}=A_{v} v_{i n}+v_{r}  \\tag{10.2}\\\\\n& v_{Y}=v_{r} \\tag{10.3}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{X}-v_{Y}=A_{v} v_{i n} \\tag{10.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nNote that $Q_{2}$ carries no signal, serving merely as a constant current source. This development forms the basis for differential amplifiers: symmetric CE stages provide two output nodes whose voltage difference remains free from supply ripple.\n\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:\n[\nname: Vin, type: VoltageSource, value: Vin, ports: {Np: Vin, Nn: GND}\nname: RC1, type: Resistor, value: RC1, ports: {N1: VCC, N2: X}\nname: RC2, type: Resistor, value: RC2, ports: {N1: VCC, N2: Y}\nname: Q1, type: NPN, ports: {C: X, B: P, E: GND}\nname: Q2, type: NPN, ports: {C: Y, B: Bias, E: GND}\nname: C, type: Capacitor, ports: {N1: Vin, N2: P}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit uses two NPN transistors in a common-emitter configuration to eliminate ripple by measuring the output between nodes X and Y.

    "text": "We have observed that operational amplifiers possess two inputs, contrasting with the amplifiers discussed in earlier chapters. To deepen our understanding of the necessity for differential circuits, let's examine an example.\n\nExample: After learning about rectifier design and basic amplifier stages, an electrical engineering student builds the circuit shown in Fig. 10.1(a) to amplify a microphone signal. However, when the output is connected to a speaker, the student notices a significant \"humming\" noise, i.e., a persistent low-frequency component. Explain this occurrence.\n\nRecall from Chapter 3 that the current drawn from the rectified output generates a ripple waveform at twice the AC line frequency (50 or 60 Hz) [Fig. 10.1(b)]. Analyzing the common-emitter stage output reveals two components: (1) the amplified microphone signal and (2) the ripple waveform present on \\( V_{CC} \\). For the latter, we can express:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {out }}=V_{C C}-R_{C} I_{C} \\tag{10.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nnoting that \\( V_{\\text {out }} \\) merely \"tracks\" \\( V_{C C} \\) and thus includes the entire ripple. The \"hum\" originates from this ripple. Figure 10.1(c) illustrates the combined output with both the signal and the ripple. As depicted in Fig. 10.1(d), this phenomenon is summarized as \"supply noise reaching the output with a gain of unity.\" (A MOS implementation would encounter the same issue.)\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:The circuit is a common-emitter amplifier stage powered by a rectifier. It demonstrates how ripple from the power supply can impact the output signal. The ripple frequency for a full-wave rectifier would be 120 Hz, while for a half-wave rectifier it would be 60 Hz. Increasing C1 can reduce the ripple amplitude.\nimage_name:(b)\ndescription:The graph labeled (b) shows a time-domain waveform of the ripple on the supply voltage, \\( V_{CC} \\). The x-axis represents time \\( t \\), without specific units, and the y-axis represents voltage, specifically \\( V_{CC} \\). The waveform features a periodic, sawtooth-like pattern, indicating ripple presence. This ripple results from the rectification process in the circuit diagram (a), likely from a full-wave or half-wave rectifier.\n\nThe ripple displays a consistent, repeating pattern, suggesting a steady frequency, typically double the input AC frequency for a full-wave rectifier (e.g., 120 Hz if the input is 60 Hz) or the same frequency for a half-wave rectifier. The waveform does not reach a steady DC level but oscillates around a mean value, indicating incomplete smoothing by the capacitor \\( C_1 \\) in the circuit.\n\nThe graph lacks specific annotations or markers for voltage levels or time intervals. The overall behavior suggests that increasing \\( C_1 \\)'s capacitance could reduce the ripple amplitude, as mentioned.\nimage_name:(c)\ndescription:The graph in Figure 10.1(c) shows a time-domain waveform of the output voltage, \\( V_{\\text{out}} \\), from a common-emitter (CE) stage circuit. The horizontal axis represents time \\( t \\), and the vertical axis represents the output voltage \\( V_{\\text{out}} \\), without specific units.\n\nThe waveform shows the combined effect of a voice signal and power supply ripple. It exhibits irregular oscillations, indicating the presence of both the desired voice signal and unwanted ripple noise. The oscillations seem superimposed, with the ripple frequency likely lower than the voice signal, resulting in a noisy output.\n\nThe graph highlights the issue of supply noise being transferred to the output without attenuation, as noted. The ripple can cause voice signal distortion, leading to a \"hum\" in the output.

As shown in Fig. 10.3(c), a straightforward method is to use a transformer to convert the microphone signal into two components with a phase difference of $180^{\\circ}$.\n\nOur analysis leads us to the specific waveforms in Fig. 10.3(b): the circuit detects two inputs that vary by equal and opposite amounts and generates two outputs that exhibit similar behavior. These waveforms exemplify \"differential\" signals, contrasting with \"single-ended\" signals—those familiar from basic circuits and previous chapters. Specifically, a single-ended signal is measured relative to the common ground [Fig. 10.4(a)] and \"carried by one line,\" whereas a differential signal is measured between two nodes with equal and opposite swings [Fig. 10.4(b)] and is thus \"carried by two lines.\"\n\nFigure 10.4(c) encapsulates the preceding discussion.

Here, $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ vary by equal and opposite amounts and share the same average (dc) level, $V_{CM}$, relative to ground:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& V_{1}=V_{0} \\sin \\omega t+V_{C M}  \\tag{10.11}\\\\\n& V_{2}=-V_{0} \\sin \\omega t+V_{C M} \\tag{10.12}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSince both $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ have a peak-to-peak swing of $2 V_{0}$, the \"differential swing\" is $4 V_{0}$. We can also say $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ are differential signals to emphasize they vary by equal and opposite amounts around a fixed level, $V_{CM}$.\n\nThe dc voltage common to both $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ [ $V_{CM}$ in Fig. 10.4(c)] is termed the \"common-mode (CM) level.\" In the absence of differential signals, both nodes remain at a potential equal to $V_{CM}$ relative to the global ground.

    "text": "To analyze the bias conditions of the circuit, it is helpful to first consider the absence of signals. As discussed in Section 10.1.2, differential nodes are at the common-mode level when no signals are present. Consequently, we depict the circuit as shown in Fig. 10.7, with both inputs connected to $V_{C M}$ to signify the absence of an input signal. Due to the symmetry of the circuit,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{B E 1} & =V_{B E 2}  \\tag{10.13}\\\\\nI_{C 1} & =I_{C 2}=\\frac{I_{E E}}{2}, \\tag{10.14}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere Fig. 10.7 illustrates the circuit's response to a change in common-mode input. The collector and emitter currents are assumed to be equal, indicating that the circuit is in \"equilibrium.\"\n\nThus, the voltage across each load resistor is $R_{C} I_{E E} / 2$, leading to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{X}=V_{Y}=V_{C C}-R_{C} \\frac{I_{E E}}{2} . \\tag{10.15}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn essence, if the input voltages are equal, the output voltages will also be equal. A zero differential input results in a zero differential output. Additionally, the circuit \"rejects\" the impact of supply ripple: any change in $V_{C C}$ does not affect the differential output, $V_{X}-V_{Y}$.\n\nTo ensure that $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ remain in the active region and avoid saturation, the collector voltages must not drop below the base voltages:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{C C}-R_{C} \\frac{I_{E E}}{2} \\geq V_{C M}, \\tag{10.16}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nshowing that $V_{C M}$ cannot be set arbitrarily high.\n\nIt is worth noting that the amplifiers discussed in previous chapters have one input referenced to ground, whereas the differential pair has two separate inputs. An important application of the differential pair is at the input of operational amplifiers, where inverting and noninverting input terminals are required. Without this second input, many op-amp-based functions would be challenging to implement, such as the noninverting amplifier and the precision rectifier, which utilize both inputs.\n\nNow, let's consider varying $V_{C M}$ in Fig. 10.7 by a small amount and observe the circuit's response. Interestingly, Eqs. (10.13)-(10.15) remain unchanged, suggesting that neither the collector current nor the collector voltage of the transistors is affected. We conclude that the circuit does not respond to changes in the input common-mode level; it \"rejects\" input CM variations. Figure 10.8 summarizes these findings.\n\nThe \"common-mode rejection\" capability of the differential pair distinguishes it from our initial circuit in Fig. 10.4(b). In the latter, changes in the base voltage of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ lead to changes in their collector currents and voltages. The presence of a tail current source in the differential pair ensures constant collector currents, thereby rejecting the input CM level.\n\nHaving examined the common-mode response, we now turn to the more intriguing case of differential response. We maintain one input constant, vary the other, and observe the currents flowing through the two transistors. While not exactly differential, such input signals provide a simple, intuitive starting point. We recall that $I_{C 1}+I_{C 2}=I_{E E}$.\n\nConsider the circuit shown in Fig. 10.9(a), where the two transistors are depicted with a vertical offset to emphasize that $Q_{1}$ senses a more positive base voltage. Given the significant difference in base voltages, we hypothesize that $Q_{1}$ \"hogs\" all of the tail current, effectively turning $Q_{2}$ off:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{C 1} & =I_{E E}  \\tag{10.19}\\\\\nI_{C 2} & =0, \\tag{10.20}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nresulting in\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& V_{X}=V_{C C}-R_{C} I_{E E}  \\tag{10.21}\\\\\n& V_{Y}=V_{C C} \\tag{10.22}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nTo prove that $Q_{1}$ indeed absorbs all of $I_{E E}$, let's assume the contrary; i.e., $I_{C 1}<I_{E E}$ and $I_{C 2} \\neq 0$. If $Q_{2}$ carries a significant current, its base-emitter voltage must reach a typical value, say, 0.8 V. With its base held at +1 V, the device would require an emitter voltage of $V_{P} \\approx 0.2 \\mathrm{~V}$. However, this implies that $Q_{1}$ sustains a base-emitter voltage of $V_{i n 1}-V_{P}=+2 \\mathrm{~V}-0.2 \\mathrm{~V}=1.8 \\mathrm{~V}$! Since a typical transistor with $V_{B E}=1.8 \\mathrm{~V}$ carries a large current, and since $I_{C 1}$ cannot exceed $I_{E E}$, we conclude that the conditions $V_{B E 1}=1.8 \\mathrm{~V}$ and $V_{P} \\approx 0.2 \\mathrm{~V}$ cannot occur. In fact, with a typical base-emitter voltage of $0.8 \\mathrm{~V}$, $Q_{1}$ holds node $P$ at approximately +1.2 V, ensuring that $Q_{2}$ remains off.\n\nThe symmetry of the circuit implies that swapping the base voltages of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ reverses the situation [Fig. 10.9(b)], giving\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{C 2} & =I_{E E}  \\tag{10.23}\\\\\nI_{C 1} & =0 \\tag{10.24}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nand hence\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{Y} & =V_{C C}-R_{C} I_{E E}  \\tag{10.25}\\\\\nV_{X} & =V_{C C} \\tag{10.26}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThese experiments reveal that as the difference between the two inputs deviates from zero, the differential pair \"steers\" the tail current from one transistor to the other. Based on Eqs. (10.14), (10.19), and (10.23), we can illustrate the collector currents of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ as a function of the input difference [Fig. 10.10(a)]. We observe that the collector current of each transistor ranges from 0 to $I_{E E}$ as $\\left|V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}\\right|$ becomes sufficiently large.\n\nIt is also crucial to note that $V_{X}$ and $V_{Y}$ vary differentially in response to $V_{i n 1}-V_{\\text {in } 2}$. From Eqs. (10.15), (10.21), and (10.25), we can illustrate the input/output characteristics of the circuit as shown in Fig. 10.10(b). A nonzero differential input produces a nonzero differential output—a behavior contrasting sharply with the CM response. Since $V_{X}$ and $V_{Y}$ are differential, we can define a common-mode level for them. This level, given by $V_{C C}-R_{C} I_{E E} / 2$, is called the \"output CM level.\"\n\nNow, we \"zoom in\" around $V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}=0$ (the equilibrium condition) and study the circuit's behavior for a small input difference. As illustrated in Fig. 10.11(a), the base voltage of $Q_{1}$ is raised from $V_{C M}$ by $\\Delta V$ while that of $Q_{2}$ is lowered from $V_{C M}$ by the same amount. We postulate that $I_{C 1}$ increases slightly, and since $I_{C 1}+I_{C 2}=I_{E E}$, $I_{C 2}$ decreases by the same amount:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& I_{C 1}=\\frac{I_{E E}}{2}+\\Delta I  \\tag{10.27}\\\\\n& I_{C 2}=\\frac{I_{E E}}{2}-\\Delta I \\tag{10.28}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nHow is $\\Delta I$ related to $\\Delta V$? If the emitters of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ were directly tied to ground, then $\\Delta I$ would simply be equal to $g_{m} \\Delta V$. However, in the differential pair, node $P$ is free to rise or fall. We must therefore compute the change in $V_{P}$.\n\nSuppose, as shown in Fig. 10.11(b), $V_{P}$ rises by $\\Delta V_{P}$. Consequently, the net increase in $V_{B E 1}$ is $\\Delta V-\\Delta V_{P}$, leading to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\Delta I_{C 1}=g_{m}\\left(\\Delta V-\\Delta V_{P}\\right) \\tag{10.29}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, the net decrease in $V_{B E 2}$ is $\\Delta V+\\Delta V_{P}$, resulting in\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\Delta I_{C 2}=-g_{m}\\left(\\Delta V+\\Delta V_{P}\\right) \\tag{10.30}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nBut recall from Eqs. (10.27) and (10.28) that $\\Delta I_{C 1}$ must be equal to $-\\Delta I_{C 2}$, implying that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ng_{m}\\left(\\Delta V-\\Delta V_{P}\\right)=g_{m}\\left(\\Delta V+\\Delta V_{P}\\right) \\tag{10.31}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand hence\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\Delta V_{P}=0 . \\tag{10.32}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nInterestingly, the tail voltage remains constant if the two inputs vary differentially and by a small amount—an observation crucial to the small-signal analysis of the circuit.\n\nThe reader may wonder why Eq. (10.32) does not hold if $\\Delta V$ is large. Which one of the above equations is violated? For a large differential input, $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ carry significantly different currents, thus exhibiting unequal transconductances and preventing the omission of $g_{m}$ 's from both sides of Eq. (10.31).\n\nWith $\\Delta V_{P}=0$ in Fig. 10.11(a), we can rewrite Eqs. (10.29) and (10.30) as\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& \\Delta I_{C 1}=g_{m} \\Delta V  \\tag{10.33}\\\\\n& \\Delta I_{C 2}=-g_{m} \\Delta V \\tag{10.34}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Delta V_{X} & =-g_{m} \\Delta V R_{C}  \\tag{10.35}\\\\\n\\Delta V_{Y} & =g_{m} \\Delta V R_{C} . \\tag{10.36}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe differential output therefore varies from 0 to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\Delta V_{X}-\\Delta V_{Y}=-2 g_{m} \\Delta V R_{C} \\tag{10.37}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWe define the small-signal differential gain of the circuit as\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nA_{v} & =\\frac{\\text { Change in Differential Output }}{\\text { Change in Differential Input }}  \\tag{10.38}\\\\\n& =\\frac{-2 g_{m} \\Delta V R_{C}}{2 \\Delta V}  \\tag{10.39}\\\\\n& =-g_{m} R_{C} \\tag{10.40}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\n(Note that the change in the differential input is equal to $2 \\Delta V$.) This expression resembles that of the common-emitter stage.\n\nFor example, to design a bipolar differential pair with a gain of 10 and a power budget of 1 mW with a supply voltage of 2 V, we can use the following calculations:\n\nGiven $V_{C C}=2 \\mathrm{~V}$, the power budget translates to a tail current of 0.5 mA. Each transistor carries a current of 0.25 mA near equilibrium, providing a transconductance of $0.25 \\mathrm{~mA} / 26 \\mathrm{mV}=(104 \\Omega)^{-1}$. It follows that\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nR_{C} & =\\frac{\\left|A_{v}\\right|}{g_{m}}  \\tag{10.41}\\\\\n& =1040 \\Omega . \\tag{10.42}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nTo compare the power dissipation of a bipolar differential pair with that of a CE stage if both circuits are designed for equal voltage gains, collector resistances, and supply voltages, we can use the following analysis:\n\nThe gain of the differential pair is expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left|A_{V, \\mathrm{diff}}\\right|=g_{m 1,2} R_{C} \\tag{10.43}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $g_{m 1,2}$ denotes the transconductance of each of the two transistors. For a CE stage, the gain is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left|A_{V, C E}\\right|=g_{m} R_{C} \\tag{10.44}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ng_{m 1,2} R_{C}=g_{m} R_{C} \\tag{10.45}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand hence\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{I_{E E}}{2 V_{T}}=\\frac{I_{C}}{V_{T}} \\tag{10.46}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $I_{E E} / 2$ is the bias current of each transistor in the differential pair, and $I_{C}$ represents the bias current of the CE stage. In other words,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{E E}=2 I_{C} \\tag{10.47}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nindicating that the differential pair consumes twice as much power. This is one of the drawbacks of differential circuits.\n\nBy analyzing the behavior of the differential pair under various conditions, we gain a deeper understanding of its operation and its applications in circuits such as operational amplifiers."

    "text": "To begin, it's beneficial to analyze the bias conditions inherent in the circuit. As previously discussed in Section 10.1.2, when no signals are present, the differential nodes are at the common-mode level.

Additionally, the circuit effectively \"rejects\" supply ripple, as any change in $V_{C C}$ does not affect the differential output, $V_{X} - V_{Y}$.\n\nRegarding the active region of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$, to prevent saturation, the collector voltages must be above the base voltages:\n\n\\[\nV_{C C} - R_{C} \\frac{I_{E E}}{2} \\geq V_{C M} \\tag{10.16}\n\\]\n\nshowing that $V_{C M}$ cannot be excessively high.\n\nThe differential pair, distinct from single-ended amplifiers studied earlier, features two separate inputs, making it crucial for applications like op amps, where inverting and noninverting input terminals are essential. Functions such as the noninverting amplifier and precision rectifier rely on both inputs.\n\nIn analyzing the response to input CM changes, we observe that the circuit's collector and emitter currents remain equal, maintaining equilibrium. By slightly altering $V_{C M}$ in Fig. 10.7, we find that Eqs. (10.13)-(10.15) remain unchanged, suggesting that neither the collector current nor the collector voltage is affected by input common-mode level changes. This indicates that the circuit \"rejects\" input CM variations, a feature not present in the original circuit of Fig. 10.4(b).\n\nTurning to the differential response, we examine the circuit's behavior when one input is held constant while the other varies. This analysis reveals that as the input difference increases, the differential pair directs the tail current from one transistor to the other. Based on Eqs. (10.14), (10.19), and (10.23), we can plot the collector currents as a function of the input difference.\n\nFurthermore, the output voltages $V_{X}$ and $V_{Y}$ respond differentially to the input difference. From Eqs. (10.15), (10.21), and (10.25), we can plot the input/output characteristics, demonstrating that a non-zero differential input produces a non-zero differential output, contrasting with the CM response.\n\nConsidering the circuit's symmetry, swapping the base voltages of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ reverses the current distribution, illustrating the differential pair's ability to \"steer\" the tail current. This behavior is essential for applications requiring differential amplification.\n\nIn summary, the differential pair's common-mode rejection and differential amplification properties make it a critical component in various electronic circuits, including op amps and amplifiers requiring high input impedance and differential output."

Interestingly, Eqs. (10.13)-(10.15) remain unchanged, thereby suggesting that neither the collector current nor the collector voltage of the transistors is affected. We say the circuit does not respond to changes in the input common-mode level, or the circuit \"rejects\" input CM variations. Figure 10.8 summarizes these results.\n\nThe \"common-mode rejection\" capability of the differential pair distinctly sets it apart from our original circuit in Fig. 10.4(b). In the latter, if the base voltage of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ changes, so do their collector currents and voltages (why?). The reader may recognize that it is the tail current source in the differential pair that guarantees constant collector currents and hence rejection of the input CM level.\n\nWith our treatment of the common-mode response, we now turn to the more interesting case of differential response. We hold one input constant, vary the other, and examine the currents flowing in the two transistors. While not exactly differential, such input signals provide a simple, intuitive starting point. Recall that $I_{C 1}+I_{C 2}=I_{E E}$.\n\nConsider the circuit shown in Fig. 10.9(a), where the two transistors are drawn with a vertical offset to emphasize that $Q_{1}$ senses a more positive base voltage. Since the difference between the base voltages of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ is so large, we postulate that $Q_{1}$ \"hogs\" all of the tail current, thereby turning $Q_{2}$ off. That is,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{C 1} & =I_{E E}  \\tag{10.19}\\\\\nI_{C 2} & =0, \\tag{10.20}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:\n[\nname: Q1, type: NPN, ports: {C: X, B: Vin1, E: P}\nname: Q2, type: NPN, ports: {C: Y, B: Vin2, E: P}\nname: RC1, type: Resistor, value: RC, ports: {N1: VCC, N2: X}\nname: RC2, type: Resistor, value: RC, ports: {N1: VCC, N2: Y}\nname: IEE, type: CurrentSource, ports: {Np: P, Nn: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit is a differential pair with NPN transistors Q1 and Q2.

Let us assume that it is not so; i.e., $I_{C 1}<I_{E E}$ and $I_{C 2} \\neq 0$. If $Q_{2}$ carries an appreciable current, then its base-emitter voltage must reach a typical value of, say, 0.8 V . With its base held at +1 V , the device therefore requires an emitter voltage of $V_{P} \\approx 0.2 \\mathrm{~V}$. However, this means that $Q_{1}$ sustains a baseemitter voltage of $V_{i n 1}-V_{P}=+2 \\mathrm{~V}-0.2 \\mathrm{~V}=1.8 \\mathrm{~V}$ !! Since with $V_{B E}=1.8 \\mathrm{~V}$, a typical transistor carries an enormous current, and since $I_{C 1}$ cannot exceed $I_{E E}$, we conclude that the conditions $V_{B E 1}=1.8 \\mathrm{~V}$ and $V_{P} \\approx 0.2 \\mathrm{~V}$ cannot occur. In fact, with a typical baseemitter voltage of $0.8 \\mathrm{~V}, Q_{1}$ holds node $P$ at approximately +1.2 V , ensuring that $Q_{2}$ remains off.\n\nSymmetry of the circuit implies that swapping the base voltages of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ reverses the situation [Fig. 10.9(b)], giving\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{C 2} & =I_{E E}  \\tag{10.23}\\\\\nI_{C 1} & =0 \\tag{10.24}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nand hence\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{Y} & =V_{C C}-R_{C} I_{E E}  \\tag{10.25}\\\\\nV_{X} & =V_{C C} \\tag{10.26}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe above experiments reveal that, as the difference between the two inputs departs from zero, the differential pair \"steers\" the tail current from one transistor to the other. In fact, based on Eqs. (10.14), (10.19), and (10.23), we can sketch the collector currents of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ as a function of the input difference [Fig. 10.10(a)]. We have not yet formulated these characteristics but we do observe that the collector current of each transistor goes from 0 to $I_{E E}$ if $\\left|V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}\\right|$ becomes sufficiently large.\n\nIt is also important to note that $V_{X}$ and $V_{Y}$ vary differentially in response to $V_{i n 1}-V_{\\text {in } 2}$. From Eqs. (10.15), (10.21), and (10.25), we can sketch the input/output characteristics of the circuit as shown in Fig. 10.10(b).

The graph is a schematic representation, not a plot with numerical axes.\n\nNow, let us vary $V_{C M}$ in Fig. 10.7 by a small amount and determine the circuit's response. Interestingly, Eqs. (10.13)-(10.15) remain unchanged, suggesting that neither the collector current nor the collector voltage of the transistors is affected. We describe this as the circuit not responding to changes in the input common-mode level, or the circuit \"rejecting\" input CM variations. Figure 10.8 summarizes these results.\n\nThe \"common-mode rejection\" capability of the differential pair distinctly sets it apart from our original circuit in Fig. 10.4(b). In the latter, if the base voltage of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ changes, so do their collector currents and voltages (why?). The reader may recognize that it is the tail current source in the differential pair that guarantees constant collector currents and hence rejection of the input CM level.\n\nWith our treatment of the common-mode response, we now turn to the more interesting case of differential response. We hold one input constant, vary the other, and examine the currents flowing in the two transistors. While not exactly differential, such input signals provide a simple, intuitive starting point. Recall that $I_{C 1}+I_{C 2}=I_{E E}$.\n\nConsider the circuit shown in Fig. 10.9(a), where the two transistors are drawn with a vertical offset to emphasize that $Q_{1}$ senses a more positive base voltage. Since the difference between the base voltages of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ is so large, we postulate that $Q_{1}$ \"hogs\" all of the tail current, thereby turning $Q_{2}$ off. That is,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{C 1} & =I_{E E}  \\tag{10.19}\\\\\nI_{C 2} & =0, \\tag{10.20}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nand hence\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& V_{X}=V_{C C}-R_{C} I_{E E}  \\tag{10.21}\\\\\n& V_{Y}=V_{C C} \\tag{10.22}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nBut, how can we prove that $Q_{1}$ indeed absorbs all of $I_{E E}$ ? Let us assume that it is not so; i.e., $I_{C 1}<I_{E E}$ and $I_{C 2} \\neq 0$. If $Q_{2}$ carries an appreciable current, then its base-emitter voltage must reach a typical value of, say, 0.8 V . With its base held at +1 V , the device therefore requires an emitter voltage of $V_{P} \\approx 0.2 \\mathrm{~V}$. However, this means that $Q_{1}$ sustains a baseemitter voltage of $V_{i n 1}-V_{P}=+2 \\mathrm{~V}-0.2 \\mathrm{~V}=1.8 \\mathrm{~V}$ !! Since with $V_{B E}=1.8 \\mathrm{~V}$, a typical transistor carries an enormous current, and since $I_{C 1}$ cannot exceed $I_{E E}$, we conclude that the conditions $V_{B E 1}=1.8 \\mathrm{~V}$ and $V_{P} \\approx 0.2 \\mathrm{~V}$ cannot occur. In fact, with a typical baseemitter voltage of $0.8 \\mathrm{~V}, Q_{1}$ holds node $P$ at approximately +1.2 V , ensuring that $Q_{2}$ remains off.\n\nSymmetry of the circuit implies that swapping the base voltages of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ reverses the situation [Fig. 10.9(b)], giving\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{C 2} & =I_{E E}  \\tag{10.23}\\\\\nI_{C 1} & =0 \\tag{10.24}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nand hence\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{Y} & =V_{C C}-R_{C} I_{E E}  \\tag{10.25}\\\\\nV_{X} & =V_{C C} \\tag{10.26}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe above experiments reveal that, as the difference between the two inputs departs from zero, the differential pair \"steers\" the tail current from one transistor to the other. In fact, based on Eqs. (10.14), (10.19), and (10.23), we can sketch the collector currents of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ as a function of the input difference [Fig. 10.10(a)]. We have not yet formulated these characteristics but we do observe that the collector current of each transistor goes from 0 to $I_{E E}$ if $\\left|V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}\\right|$ becomes sufficiently large.\n\nIt is also important to note that $V_{X}$ and $V_{Y}$ vary differentially in response to $V_{i n 1}-V_{\\text {in } 2}$. From Eqs. (10.15), (10.21), and (10.25), we can sketch the input/output characteristics of the circuit as shown in Fig. 10.10(b). That is, a nonzero differential input yields a nonzero differential output-a behavior in sharp contrast to the CM response. Since $V_{X}$ and $V_{Y}$\nare differential, we can define a common-mode level for them. Given by $V_{C C}-R_{C} I_{E E} / 2$, this quantity is called the \"output CM level.\"\n\n| Example | A bipolar differential pair employs a tail current of 0.5 mA and a collector resistance <br> of $1 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$. What is the maximum allowable base voltage if the differential input is large <br> enough to completely steer the tail current?

Thus, the base voltage must remain below this value so as to avoid <br> saturation. |\n\nExercise Repeat the above example if the tail current is raised to 1 mA .\n\nIn the last step of our qualitative analysis, we \"zoom in\" around $V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}=0$ (the equilibrium condition) and study the circuit's behavior for a small input difference. As illustrated in Fig. 10.11(a), the base voltage of $Q_{1}$ is raised from $V_{C M}$ by $\\Delta V$ while that of $Q_{2}$ is lowered from $V_{C M}$ by the same amount. We surmise that $I_{C 1}$ increases slightly and, since $I_{C 1}+I_{C 2}=I_{E E}, I_{C 2}$ decreases by the same amount:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& I_{C 1}=\\frac{I_{E E}}{2}+\\Delta I  \\tag{10.27}\\\\\n& I_{C 2}=\\frac{I_{E E}}{2}-\\Delta I \\tag{10.28}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nHow is $\\Delta I$ related to $\\Delta V$ ? If the emitters of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ were directly tied to ground, then $\\Delta I$ would simply be equal to $g_{m} \\Delta V$. In the differential pair, however, node $P$ is free to rise or fall. We must therefore compute the change in $V_{P}$.\n\nSuppose, as shown in Fig. 10.11(b), $V_{P}$ rises by $\\Delta V_{P}$. As a result, the net increase in $V_{B E 1}$ is equal to $\\Delta V-\\Delta V_{P}$ and hence\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\Delta I_{C 1}=g_{m}\\left(\\Delta V-\\Delta V_{P}\\right) \\tag{10.29}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, the net decrease in $V_{B E 2}$ is equal to $\\Delta V+\\Delta V_{P}$, yielding\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\Delta I_{C 2}=-g_{m}\\left(\\Delta V+\\Delta V_{P}\\right) \\tag{10.30}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nBut recall from Eqs.

(10.32) does not hold if $\\Delta V$ is large. Which one of the above equations is violated? For a large differential input, $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ carry significantly different currents, thus exhibiting unequal transconductances and prohibiting the omission of $g_{m}$ 's from the two sides of Eq. (10.31).\n\nWith $\\Delta V_{P}=0$ in Fig. 10.11(a), we can rewrite Eqs. (10.29) and (10.30) respectively as\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& \\Delta I_{C 1}=g_{m} \\Delta V  \\tag{10.33}\\\\\n& \\Delta I_{C 2}=-g_{m} \\Delta V \\tag{10.34}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Delta V_{X} & =-g_{m} \\Delta V R_{C}  \\tag{10.35}\\\\\n\\Delta V_{Y} & =g_{m} \\Delta V R_{C} . \\tag{10.36}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe differential output therefore goes from 0 to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\Delta V_{X}-\\Delta V_{Y}=-2 g_{m} \\Delta V R_{C} \\tag{10.37}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWe define the small-signal differential gain of the circuit as\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nA_{v} & =\\frac{\\text { Change in Differential Output }}{\\text { Change in Differential Input }}  \\tag{10.38}\\\\\n& =\\frac{-2 g_{m} \\Delta V R_{C}}{2 \\Delta V}  \\tag{10.39}\\\\\n& =-g_{m} R_{C} \\tag{10.40}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\n(Note that the change in the differential input is equal to $2 \\Delta V$.)

As you may recall from Section 10.1.2, when there are no signals present, the differential nodes are at the common-mode level.

The bases of Q1 and Q2 are connected together and to a common-mode voltage source VCM, while the collectors are connected to resistors RC1 and RC2, respectively, which are then connected to the VCC voltage source.\n\nThis circuit operates in equilibrium when the input voltages are equal, leading to equal collector currents and voltages at nodes X and Y. When the collector and emitter currents are equal, we say the circuit is in \"equilibrium.\"\n\nConsequently, the voltage drop across each load resistor is equal to $R_{C} I_{E E} / 2$, which implies\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{X}=V_{Y}=V_{C C}-R_{C} \\frac{I_{E E}}{2} . \\tag{10.15}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn essence, if the two input voltages are equal, the two outputs will also be equal. We refer to this as a zero differential input producing a zero differential output. Additionally, the circuit \"rejects\" the effect of supply ripple: if $V_{C C}$ undergoes a change, the differential output, $V_{X}-V_{Y}$, remains unaffected.\n\nTo ensure that $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ are in the active region and avoid saturation, the collector voltages must not fall below the base voltages:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{C C}-R_{C} \\frac{I_{E E}}{2} \\geq V_{C M}, \\tag{10.16}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis indicates that $V_{C M}$ cannot be arbitrarily high.\n\nIt's worth noting that the amplifiers discussed in previous chapters have one input with respect to ground [Fig. (a)], whereas the differential pair has two distinct inputs.

The circuit's symmetry ensures that it operates in equilibrium when the input voltages are equal, resulting in equal collector currents and voltages at nodes X and Y.\n\nFigure 10.7 depicts the differential pair's response to a change in the input CM. Here, it is assumed that the collector and emitter currents are equal, and we refer to this state as the circuit being in \"equilibrium.\"\n\nConsequently, the voltage drop across each load resistor is equal to $R_{C} I_{E E} / 2$, leading to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{X}=V_{Y}=V_{C C}-R_{C} \\frac{I_{E E}}{2} . \\tag{10.15}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn essence, if the two input voltages are equal, the two outputs will be as well. We describe this as a zero differential input producing a zero differential output. The circuit also \"rejects\" the impact of supply ripple: if $V_{C C}$ undergoes a change, the differential output, $V_{X}-V_{Y}$, remains unaffected.\n\nRegarding whether $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ are in the active region, to prevent saturation, the collector voltages must not drop below the base voltages:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{C C}-R_{C} \\frac{I_{E E}}{2} \\geq V_{C M}, \\tag{10.16}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis reveals that $V_{C M}$ cannot be arbitrarily high.\n\nYou might be interested to know that the amplifiers discussed in previous chapters have one input in relation to ground [Fig. (a)] whereas the differential pair has two separate inputs. A significant application of the differential pair is at the input of op amps, where inverting and noninverting input terminals are required [Fig. (b)]. Without this additional input, many op-amp-based functions would be challenging to implement. For instance, the noninverting amplifier and the precision rectifier make use of both inputs.\n\nFigure 10.8 illustrates the effect of common-mode input voltages $V_{C M 1}$ and $V_{C M 2}$ on the output voltages $V_X$ and $V_Y$ of a bipolar differential pair circuit. The graph is a schematic representation, not a plot with numerical axes.\n\nNow, let's modify $V_{C M}$ in Fig. 10.7 by a small amount and ascertain the circuit's response. Notably, Eqs. (10.13)-(10.15) remain unchanged, suggesting that neither the collector current nor the collector voltage of the transistors is affected. We conclude that the circuit does not respond to changes in the input common-mode level, or the circuit \"rejects\" input CM variations. Figure 10.8 encapsulates these findings.\n\nThe \"common-mode rejection\" ability of the differential pair distinctly separates it from our initial circuit in Fig. 10.4(b). In the latter, if the base voltage of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ changes, their collector currents and voltages also change (why?). The reader may recognize that it is the tail current source in the differential pair that ensures constant collector currents and, consequently, rejection of the input CM level.\n\nWith our discussion of the common-mode response, we now shift our focus to the more intriguing case of differential response. We maintain one input as constant, vary the other, and inspect the currents flowing through the two transistors. Although not exactly differential, such input signals provide a straightforward, intuitive starting point. Remember that $I_{C 1}+I_{C 2}=I_{E E}$.\n\nConsider the circuit depicted in Fig. 10.9(a), where the two transistors are drawn with a vertical offset to stress that $Q_{1}$ senses a more positive base voltage. Given the significant difference between the base voltages of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$, we posit that $Q_{1}$ \"captures\" all of the tail current, effectively turning $Q_{2}$ off. Thus,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{C 1} & =I_{E E}  \\tag{10.19}\\\\\nI_{C 2} & =0, \\tag{10.20}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nand as a result\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& V_{X}=V_{C C}-R_{C} I_{E E}  \\tag{10.21}\\\\\n& V_{Y}=V_{C C} \\tag{10.22}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nHowever, how can we confirm that $Q_{1}$ indeed absorbs all of $I_{E E}$ ? Let's assume that it does not; i.e., $I_{C 1}<I_{E E}$ and $I_{C 2} \\neq 0$. If $Q_{2}$ carries a considerable current, then its base-emitter voltage must reach a typical value, say, 0.8 V. With its base held at +1 V, the device would thus require an emitter voltage of $V_{P} \\approx 0.2 \\mathrm{~V}$. However, this implies that $Q_{1}$ sustains a base-emitter voltage of $V_{i n 1}-V_{P}=+2 \\mathrm{~V}-0.2 \\mathrm{~V}=1.8 \\mathrm{~V}$ !! Since with $V_{B E}=1.8 \\mathrm{~V}$, a typical transistor carries a massive current, and since $I_{C 1}$ cannot exceed $I_{E E}$, we conclude that the conditions $V_{B E 1}=1.8 \\mathrm{~V}$ and $V_{P} \\approx 0.2 \\mathrm{~V}$ cannot occur. In fact, with a typical base-emitter voltage of $0.8 \\mathrm{~V}, Q_{1}$ holds node $P$ at approximately +1.2 V, ensuring that $Q_{2}$ remains off.\n\nThe circuit's symmetry implies that swapping the base voltages of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ reverses the situation [Fig. 10.9(b)], giving\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{C 2} & =I_{E E}  \\tag{10.23}\\\\\nI_{C 1} & =0 \\tag{10.24}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nand consequently\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{Y} & =V_{C C}-R_{C} I_{E E}  \\tag{10.25}\\\\\nV_{X} & =V_{C C} \\tag{10.26}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThese experiments reveal that, as the difference between the two inputs deviates from zero, the differential pair \"directs\" the tail current from one transistor to the other. In fact, based on Eqs. (10.14), (10.19), and (10.23), we can sketch the collector currents of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ as a function of the input difference [Fig. 10.10(a)]. We have not yet formalized these characteristics, but we do observe that the collector current of each transistor ranges from 0 to $I_{E E}$ if $\\left|V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}\\right|$ becomes sufficiently large.\n\nIt is also crucial to note that $V_{X}$ and $V_{Y}$ vary differentially in response to $V_{i n 1}-V_{\\text {in } 2}$.

    "text": "To analyze the bias conditions of the circuit, it is helpful to first consider the state of the differential nodes when no signals are present. As mentioned in Section 10.1.2, these nodes typically rest at the common-mode level. Therefore, we represent the circuit as shown in Fig. 10.7, with both inputs grounded at $V_{C M}$ to signify the absence of an input signal. Due to the symmetry of the circuit,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{B E 1} & = V_{B E 2} \\tag{10.13}\\\\\nI_{C 1} & = I_{C 2} = \\frac{I_{E E}}{2}, \\tag{10.14}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe circuit depicted in Fig. 10.7 consists of a differential pair of NPN transistors, Q1 and Q2, which share a common emitter node, e1e2, connected to a current source IEE. The bases of Q1 and Q2 are linked and connected to a common-mode voltage source VCM. The collectors of Q1 and Q2 are each connected to a resistor, RC1 and RC2, respectively, which are in turn connected to the VCC voltage source. The circuit operates in a balanced state when the input voltages are equal, leading to balanced collector currents and equal voltages at nodes X and Y.\n\nFigure 10.7 illustrates the differential pair's response to a change in the common-mode input. It is assumed that the collector and emitter currents are equal, indicating that the circuit is in \"equilibrium.\"\n\nConsequently, the voltage across each load resistor is equal to $R_{C} I_{E E} / 2$, leading to\n\n$$\nV_{X} = V_{Y} = V_{C C} - R_{C} \\frac{I_{E E}}{2}. \\tag{10.15}\n$$\n\nThis implies that if the input voltages are equal, the output voltages will also be equal. A zero differential input will yield a zero differential output. Additionally, the circuit \"rejects\" the impact of supply fluctuations: if $V_{C C}$ changes, the differential output, $V_{X} - V_{Y}$, remains unaffected.\n\nTo ensure that Q1 and Q2 remain in the active region and avoid saturation, the collector voltages must not drop below the base voltages:\n\n$$\nV_{C C} - R_{C} \\frac{I_{E E}}{2} \\geq V_{C M}. \\tag{10.16}\n$$\n\nThis indicates that $V_{C M}$ cannot be set arbitrarily high.\n\nDifferential amplifiers, unlike the amplifiers discussed in previous chapters, which have a single input referenced to ground, have two separate inputs. An important application of the differential pair is at the input of operational amplifiers, where separate inverting and noninverting input terminals are required. Without this second input, many op-amp-based functions would be challenging to implement, such as the noninverting amplifier and the precision rectifier, which utilize both inputs.\n\nThe diagrams (a) and (b) show amplifiers with single-ended and differential inputs, respectively.

(10.13)-(10.15) remain valid, suggesting that neither the collector current nor the collector voltage of the transistors is influenced. This indicates that the circuit does not respond to changes in the input common-mode level; it \"rejects\" input CM variations.

By holding one input constant and varying the other, we observe the currents flowing through the two transistors. When the input signals are not exactly differential, such input conditions provide a simple, intuitive starting point.

This implies that Q1 maintains a base-emitter voltage of $V_{i n 1} - V_{P} = +2 \\mathrm{~V} - 0.2 \\mathrm{~V} = 1.8 \\mathrm{~V}$.

From Eqs. (10.15), (10.21), and (10.25), we can illustrate the input/output characteristics of the circuit as shown in Fig. 10.10(b). This indicates that a non-zero differential input produces a non-zero differential output, a behavior that contrasts sharply with the CM response. Since $V_{X}$ and $V_{Y}$ are differential, we can define a common-mode level for them, given by $V_{C C} - R_{C} I_{E E} / 2$, which is referred to as the \"output CM level.\"\n\nExamples and exercises are provided to further demonstrate the design considerations and power dissipation comparisons between bipolar differential pairs and common-emitter stages, highlighting the trade-offs and advantages of each configuration."

We observe that the collector current of each transistor goes from 0 to $I_{E E}$ if $\\left|V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}\\right|$ becomes sufficiently large.\n\nIt is also important to note that $V_{X}$ and $V_{Y}$ vary differentially in response to $V_{i n 1}-V_{\\text {in } 2}$. From Eqs. (10.15), (10.21), and (10.25), we can sketch the input/output characteristics of the circuit as shown in Fig. 10.10(b). A nonzero differential input yields a nonzero differential output, contrasting with the CM response. Since $V_{X}$ and $V_{Y}$ are differential, we can define a common-mode level for them. Given by $V_{C C}-R_{C} I_{E E} / 2$, this quantity is called the \"output CM level.\"\n\nExample: A bipolar differential pair employs a tail current of 0.5 mA and a collector resistance of $1 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$. What is the maximum allowable base voltage if the differential input is large enough to completely steer the tail current? Assume $V_{C C}=2.5 \\mathrm{~V}$.\n\nSolution: If $I_{E E}$ is completely steered, the transistor carrying the current lowers its collector voltage to $V_{C C}-R_{C} I_{E E}=2 \\mathrm{~V}$. Thus, the base voltage must remain below this value to avoid saturation.\n\nExercise: Repeat the above example if the tail current is raised to 1 mA.\n\nIn the last step of our qualitative analysis, we \"zoom in\" around $V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}=0$ (the equilibrium condition) and study the circuit's behavior for a small input difference. As illustrated in Fig. 10.11(a), the base voltage of $Q_{1}$ is raised from $V_{C M}$ by $\\Delta V$ while that of $Q_{2}$ is lowered from $V_{C M}$ by the same amount. We surmise that $I_{C 1}$ increases slightly and, since $I_{C 1}+I_{C 2}=I_{E E}$, $I_{C 2}$ decreases by the same amount:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& I_{C 1}=\\frac{I_{E E}}{2}+\\Delta I  \\tag{10.27}\\\\\n& I_{C 2}=\\frac{I_{E E}}{2}-\\Delta I \\tag{10.28}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nHow is $\\Delta I$ related to $\\Delta V$? If the emitters of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ were directly tied to ground, then $\\Delta I$ would simply be equal to $g_{m} \\Delta V$. In the differential pair, however, node $P$ is free to rise or fall. We must therefore compute the change in $V_{P}$.\n\nSuppose, as shown in Fig. 10.11(b), $V_{P}$ rises by $\\Delta V_{P}$. As a result, the net increase in $V_{B E 1}$ is equal to $\\Delta V-\\Delta V_{P}$ and hence:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\Delta I_{C 1}=g_{m}\\left(\\Delta V-\\Delta V_{P}\\right) \\tag{10.29}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, the net decrease in $V_{B E 2}$ is equal to $\\Delta V+\\Delta V_{P}$, yielding:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\Delta I_{C 2}=-g_{m}\\left(\\Delta V+\\Delta V_{P}\\right) \\tag{10.30}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nBut recall from Eqs. (10.27) and (10.28) that $\\Delta I_{C 1}$ must be equal to $-\\Delta I_{C 2}$, dictating that:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ng_{m}\\left(\\Delta V-\\Delta V_{P}\\right)=g_{m}\\left(\\Delta V+\\Delta V_{P}\\right) \\tag{10.31}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand hence:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\Delta V_{P}=0 . \\tag{10.32}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nInterestingly, the tail voltage remains constant if the two inputs vary differentially and by a small amount, which is crucial for the small-signal analysis of the circuit.\n\nThe reader may wonder why Eq. (10.32) does not hold if $\\Delta V$ is large. Which one of the above equations is violated? For a large differential input, $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ carry significantly different currents, thus exhibiting unequal transconductances and prohibiting the omission of $g_{m}$ 's from the two sides of Eq. (10.31).\n\nWith $\\Delta V_{P}=0$ in Fig. 10.11(a), we can rewrite Eqs. (10.29) and (10.30) respectively as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& \\Delta I_{C 1}=g_{m} \\Delta V  \\tag{10.33}\\\\\n& \\Delta I_{C 2}=-g_{m} \\Delta V \\tag{10.34}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nand:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Delta V_{X} & =-g_{m} \\Delta V R_{C}  \\tag{10.35}\\\\\n\\Delta V_{Y} & =g_{m} \\Delta V R_{C} . \\tag{10.36}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe differential output therefore goes from 0 to:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\Delta V_{X}-\\Delta V_{Y}=-2 g_{m} \\Delta V R_{C} \\tag{10.37}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWe define the small-signal differential gain of the circuit as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nA_{v} & =\\frac{\\text { Change in Differential Output }}{\\text { Change in Differential Input }}  \\tag{10.38}\\\\\n& =\\frac{-2 g_{m} \\Delta V R_{C}}{2 \\Delta V}  \\tag{10.39}\\\\\n& =-g_{m} R_{C} \\tag{10.40}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\n(Note that the change in the differential input is equal to $2 \\Delta V$.) This expression is similar to that of the common-emitter stage.\n\nExample: Design a bipolar differential pair for a gain of 10 and a power budget of 1 mW with a supply voltage of 2 V.\n\nSolution: With $V_{C C}=2 \\mathrm{~V}$, the power budget translates to a tail current of 0.5 mA. Each transistor thus carries a current of 0.25 mA near equilibrium, providing a transconductance of $0.25 \\mathrm{~mA} / 26 \\mathrm{mV}=(104 \\Omega)^{-1}$. It follows that:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nR_{C} & =\\frac{\\left|A_{v}\\right|}{g_{m}}  \\tag{10.41}\\\\\n& =1040 \\Omega . \\tag{10.42}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nExercise: Redesign the circuit for a power budget of 0.5 mW and compare the results.\n\nExample: Compare the power dissipation of a bipolar differential pair with that of a CE stage if both circuits are designed for equal voltage gains, collector resistances, and supply voltages.\n\nSolution: The gain of the differential pair is written from Eq. (10.40) as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left|A_{V, \\mathrm{diff}}\\right|=g_{m 1,2} R_{C} \\tag{10.43}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $g_{m 1,2}$ denotes the transconductance of each of the two transistors. For a CE stage:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left|A_{V, C E}\\right|=g_{m} R_{C} \\tag{10.44}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ng_{m 1,2} R_{C}=g_{m} R_{C} \\tag{10.45}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand hence:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{I_{E E}}{2 V_{T}}=\\frac{I_{C}}{V_{T}} \\tag{10.46}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $I_{E E} / 2$ is the bias current of each transistor in the differential pair, and $I_{C}$ represents the bias current of the CE stage. In other words:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{E E}=2 I_{C} \\tag{10.47}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nindicating that the differential pair consumes twice as much power. This is one of the drawbacks of differential circuits.\n\nExercise: If both circuits are designed for the same power budget, equal collector resistances, and equal supply voltages, compare their voltage gains."

Not having seen any large-signal analysis in the previous chapters, the reader may naturally wonder why we are suddenly interested in this aspect of the differential pair. Our interest arises from (a) the need to understand the circuit's limitations in serving as a linear amplifier, and (b) the application of the differential pair as a (nonlinear) current-steering circuit.\n\nIn order to derive the relationship between the differential input and output of the circuit, we first note from Fig. 10.12 that\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& V_{\\text {out } 1}=V_{C C}-R_{C} I_{C 1}  \\tag{10.48}\\\\\n& V_{\\text {out } 2}=V_{C C}-R_{C} I_{C 2} \\tag{10.49}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nand hence\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{\\text {out }} & =V_{\\text {out } 1}-V_{\\text {out } 2}  \\tag{10.50}\\\\\n& =-R_{C}\\left(I_{C 1}-I_{C 2}\\right) \\tag{10.51}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nWe must therefore compute $I_{C 1}$ and $I_{C 2}$ in terms of the input difference. Assuming $\\alpha=1$ and $V_{A}=\\infty$, and recalling from Chapter 4 that $V_{B E}=V_{T} \\ln \\left(I_{C} / I_{S}\\right)$, we write a KVL around\nimage_name:Figure 10.12 Bipolar differential pair for large-signal analysis\ndescription:\n[\nname: Q1, type: NPN, ports: {C: Vout1, B: Vin1, E: P}\nname: Q2, type: NPN, ports: {C: Vout2, B: Vin2, E: P}\nname: RC1, type: Resistor, value: RC, ports: {N1: Vout1, N2: VCC}\nname: RC2, type: Resistor, value: RC, ports: {N1: Vout2, N2: VCC}\nname: IEE, type: CurrentSource, value: IEE, ports: {Np: P, Nn: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit is a bipolar differential pair for large-signal analysis, with two NPN transistors (Q1 and Q2) sharing a common emitter node connected to a current source IEE.

For the sinusoids in Fig. 10.14(b), the circuit operates linearly because the maximum differential input is equal to $\\pm 2 \\mathrm{mV}$. The outputs are therefore sinusoids with a peak amplitude of $1 \\mathrm{mV} \\times g_{m} R_{C}$ [Fig.10.14(d)]. On the other hand, the sinusoids in Fig. 10.14(c) force a maximum input difference of $\\pm 200 \\mathrm{mV}$, turning $Q_{1}$ or $Q_{2}$ off. For example, as $V_{\\text {in } 1}$ approaches 50 mV above $V_{C M}$ and $V_{i n 2}$ reaches 50 mV below $V_{C M}$ (at $t=t_{1}$ ), $Q_{1}$ absorbs most of the tail current, resulting in:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& V_{\\text {out } 1} \\approx V_{C C}-R_{C} I_{E E}  \\tag{10.79}\\\\\n& V_{\\text {out } 2} \\approx V_{C C} . \\tag{10.80}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThereafter, the outputs remain saturated until $\\left|V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}\\right|$ falls to less than 100 mV . The result is sketched in Fig. 10.14(e). We say the circuit operates as a \"limiter\" in this case, playing a role similar to the diode limiters studied in Chapter 3.\n\nExercise: What happens to the above results if the tail current is halved?\n\nDifferential pairs can operate as limiters if their input difference is large. In this case, they \"clip\" the top and bottom of the signal waveform. While clipping a signal such as your voice creates distortion and is undesirable, limiting is useful in certain applications, such as in FM radios, where it removes noise from the amplitude, improving signal quality."

Assuming $\\alpha=1$ and $V_{A}=\\infty$, and recalling from Chapter 4 that $V_{B E}=V_{T} \\ln \\left(I_{C} / I_{S}\\right)$, we apply a KVL around the input network,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{i n 1}-V_{B E 1}=V_{P}=V_{i n 2}-V_{B E 2} \\tag{10.52}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nresulting in\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2} & =V_{B E 1}-V_{B E 2}  \\tag{10.53}\\\\\n& =V_{T} \\ln \\frac{I_{C 1}}{I_{S 1}}-V_{T} \\ln \\frac{I_{C 2}}{I_{S 2}}  \\tag{10.54}\\\\\n& =V_{T} \\ln \\frac{I_{C 1}}{I_{C 2}} \\tag{10.55}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nAdditionally, a KCL at node $P$ yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C 1}+I_{C 2}=I_{E E} \\tag{10.56}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquations (10.55) and (10.56) include two unknowns. Substituting for $I_{C 1}$ from Eq. (10.55) in Eq. (10.56) gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C 2} \\exp \\frac{V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}}{V_{T}}+I_{C 2}=I_{E E} \\tag{10.57}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C 2}=\\frac{I_{E E}}{1+\\exp \\frac{V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}}{V_{T}}} \\tag{10.58}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe symmetry of the circuit with respect to $V_{i n 1}$ and $V_{i n 2}$ and $I_{C 1}$ and $I_{C 2}$ suggests that $I_{C 1}$ follows the same behavior as Eq. (10.58) but with the roles of $V_{i n 1}$ and $V_{i n 2}$ reversed:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{C 1} & =\\frac{I_{E E}}{1+\\exp \\frac{V_{i n 2}-V_{i n 1}}{V_{T}}}  \\tag{10.59}\\\\\n& =\\frac{I_{E E} \\exp \\frac{V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}}{V_{T}}}{1+\\exp \\frac{V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}}{V_{T}}} \\tag{10.60}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nAlternatively, the reader can substitute for $I_{C 2}$ from Eq. (10.58) in Eq. (10.56) to find $I_{C 1}$.\n\n[^0]:    ${ }^{6}$ The reader can show that placing $V_{o s}$ in series with the inverting input of the op amp yields the same result.\n\n[^1]:    ${ }^{7}$ Recall that in a linear system, if $x(t) \\rightarrow y(t)$, then $2 x(t) \\rightarrow 2 y(t)$.\n\n[^2]:    ${ }^{8} \\mathrm{Op}$ amps employing MOS transistors at their input exhibit a very high input impedance at low frequencies.\n\n[^3]:    ${ }^{1}$ Coined in the vacuum-tube era, the term \"cascode\" is believed to be an abbreviation of \"cascaded triodes.\"\n\n[^4]:    ${ }^{3}$ In integrated circuits, all bipolar transistors fabricated on the same wafer exhibit the same Early voltage.

In particular, if $V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}$ is very negative, then $\\exp \\left(V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}\\right) / V_{T} \\rightarrow 0$ and\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{C 1} & \\rightarrow 0  \\tag{10.61}\\\\\nI_{C 2} & \\rightarrow I_{E E} \\tag{10.62}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nas predicted by our qualitative analysis [Fig.10.9(b)].

From Example 10.8, we recognize that even a differential input of $4 V_{T} \\approx 104 \\mathrm{mV}$ \"switches\" the differential pair, thereby concluding that $\\left|V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}\\right|$ must remain well below this value for linear operation.\nimage_name:I_C1, I_C2 vs V_in1 - V_in2\ndescription:This graph shows the relationship between the differential input voltage $V_{in1} - V_{in2}$ and the collector currents $I_{C1}$ and $I_{C2}$ in a bipolar differential pair circuit.\n\n1. **Top Plot: $I_{C1}$ and $I_{C2}$ vs $V_{in1} - V_{in2}$**\n- **Axes:**\n- Horizontal Axis: $V_{in1} - V_{in2}$\n- Vertical Axis: Collector currents $I_{C1}$ and $I_{C2}$\n- **Behavior:**\n- As $V_{in1} - V_{in2}$ increases from negative to positive, $I_{C1}$ decreases from $I_{EE}$ to zero, while $I_{C2}$ increases from zero to $I_{EE}$.\n- The currents cross at $I_{EE}/2$ when $V_{in1} - V_{in2} = 0$.\n- For very positive $V_{in1} - V_{in2}$, $I_{C1}$ approaches zero, and $I_{C2}$ approaches $I_{EE}$.\n- Conversely, for very negative $V_{in1} - V_{in2}$, $I_{C1}$ approaches $I_{EE}$, and $I_{C2}$ approaches zero.\n\n2. **Middle Plot: $V_{out1}$ and $V_{out2}$ vs $V_{in1} - V_{in2}$**\n- **Axes:**\n- Horizontal Axis: $V_{in1} - V_{in2}$\n- Vertical Axis: Output voltages $V_{out1}$ and $V_{out2}$\n- **Behavior:**\n- As $V_{in1} - V_{in2}$ increases, $V_{out1}$ decreases from $V_{CC}$ to $V_{CC} - R_C I_{EE}$, while $V_{out2}$ increases from $V_{CC} - R_C I_{EE}$ to $V_{CC}$.\n- The voltages cross at $V_{CC} - R_C I_{EE}/2$ when $V_{in1} - V_{in2} = 0$.\n- For very positive $V_{in1} - V_{in2}$, $V_{out1}$ approaches $V_{CC}$, and $V_{out2}$ approaches $V_{CC} - R_C I_{EE}$.\n- For very negative $V_{in1} - V_{in2}$, $V_{out1}$ approaches $V_{CC} - R_C I_{EE}$, and $V_{out2}$ approaches $V_{CC}$.\n\n3. **Bottom Plot: $V_{out1} - V_{out2}$ vs $V_{in1} - V_{in2}$**\n- **Axes:**\n- Horizontal Axis: $V_{in1} - V_{in2}$\n- Vertical Axis: Differential output voltage $V_{out1} - V_{out2}$\n- **Behavior:**\n- The differential output voltage decreases linearly from $+R_C I_{EE}$ to $-R_C I_{EE}$ as $V_{in1} - V_{in2}$ increases.\n- The curve is linear around $V_{in1} - V_{in2} = 0$ and saturates at the positive and negative extremes.\n- At $V_{in1} - V_{in2} = 0$, the differential output voltage is zero.\n\nOverall, the plots demonstrate the linear and saturating behavior of the bipolar differential pair as the differential input voltage varies.

Node P serves as a virtual ground for differential small-signal inputs, simplifying the analysis. The circuit encompasses two NPN transistors, Q1 and Q2, with their collectors linked to ground and their emitters connected to the respective input voltages. The resistors r_π1 and r_π2 are connected to the bases of Q1 and Q2, respectively. The current sources g_m1v_π1 and g_m2v_π2 are governed by the voltages across r_π1 and r_π2, respectively.\n\nThe simplified small-signal model illustrated in Fig. 10.15(b) comprises two voltage sources vin1 and vin2, resistors rπ1, rπ2, and RC, and voltage-controlled current sources g_m1v_π1 and g_m2v_π2. Node P acts as a virtual ground for differential small-signal inputs.\n\nFig. 10.15(c) displays a simplified diagram of a differential amplifier with two NPN transistors Q1 and Q2. It incorporates capacitors C1 and C2 for coupling and resistors RC for load. The circuit is tailored for differential input signals Vin1 and Vin2, with a virtual ground at the base node B.\n\nHence,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv_{P} & =v_{i n 1}-v_{\\pi 1}  \\tag{10.85}\\\\\n& =0 . \\tag{10.86}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThus, the small-signal model validates the prediction made by Eq. (10.32). In Problem 10.28, we demonstrate that this attribute persists even in the presence of the Early effect.\n\nThe virtual-ground characteristic of node $P$ for differential small-signal inputs significantly simplifies the analysis. Since $v_{P}=0$, this node can be connected to ac ground, reducing the differential pair of Fig. 10.15(a) to two \"half circuits\" [Fig. 10.15(b)]. With each half resembling a common-emitter stage, we can write\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv_{\\text {out } 1} & =-g_{m} R_{C} v_{\\text {in } 1}  \\tag{10.87}\\\\\nv_{\\text {out } 2} & =-g_{m} R_{C} v_{\\text {in } 2} \\tag{10.88}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nConsequently, the differential voltage gain of the differential pair is equal to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{v_{\\text {out } 1}-v_{\\text {out } 2}}{v_{\\text {in } 1}-v_{\\text {in } 2}}=-g_{m} R_{C} \\tag{10.89}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as that expressed by Eq. (10.40). For simplicity, we may depict the two half circuits as in Fig. 10.15(c), with the understanding that the incremental inputs are small and differential. Also, since the two halves are identical, we may depict only one half.\n\nExample Compute the differential gain of the circuit shown in Fig. 10.16(a), where ideal current 10.10 sources are used as loads to maximize the gain.\n\nThe circuit depicted in Fig. 10.16(a) is a differential amplifier with two NPN transistors (Q1 and Q2), each having its base connected to separate input voltages (Vin1 and Vin2). The emitters are connected together to a current source (I_EE) which is grounded. The collectors of both transistors are connected to the output node (Vout), which is also connected to V_CC through current sources, maximizing the gain.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nSolution With ideal current sources, the Early effect in $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ cannot be overlooked, and the half circuits must be visualized as depicted in Fig. 10.16(b).

As such, this gain is equal to the single-ended gain of each half circuit.\n\nWe now make an observation that proves useful in the analysis of differential circuits. As noted above, the symmetry of the circuit $\\left(g_{m 1}=g_{m 2}\\right)$ establishes a virtual ground at node $P$ in Fig. 10.12 if the incremental inputs are small and differential.

    "text": "Our preliminary examination of the differential pair illustrated in Fig. 10.11 showed that, with minor differential inputs, the tail node sustains a steady voltage ( thus earning the mon \"virtual ground.\" Additionally, we derived a voltage gain of $g_{m} R_{C}$. We are now delve deeper into the small-signal characteristics of the circuit. As previously in earlier chapters, the term \"small signals\" is somewhat subjective, but the key criterion is that the input signals should not significantly affect the bias currents of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$. To put it another\nOur\nOurifferently, the two transistors must have nearly equal transconductances—the same condition necessary for node $P$ to function as a virtual ground. Practically, an input difference of less than 10 mV is deemed \"small\" for the majority of applications.\n\nAssuming perfect symmetry, an ideal tail current source, and $V_{A}=\\infty$, we derive the small-signal model of the circuit, as depicted in Fig. 10.15(a). Here, $v_{i n 1}$ and $v_{i n 2}$ signify small fluctuations in each input and must adhere to $v_{i n 1}=-v_{i n 2}$ for differential operation. It's worth noting that the tail current source is substituted with an open circuit. Following the previous large-signal analysis, let's apply KVL around the input network and KCL at node $P$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gather*}\nv_{i n 1}-v_{\\pi 1}=v_{P}=v_{i n 2}-v_{\\pi 2}  \\tag{10.81}\\\\\n\\frac{v_{\\pi 1}}{r_{\\pi 1}}+g_{m 1} v_{\\pi 1}+\\frac{v_{\\pi 2}}{r_{\\pi 2}}+g_{m 2} v_{\\pi 2}=0 \\tag{10.82}\n\\end{gather*}\n$$\n\nGiven $r_{\\pi 1}=r_{\\pi 2}$ and $g_{m 1}=g_{m 2}$, Eq. (10.82) simplifies to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{\\pi 1}=-v_{\\pi 2} \\tag{10.83}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand since $v_{i n 1}=-v_{i n 2}$, Eq. (10.81) can be rewritten as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n2 v_{i n 1}=2 v_{\\pi 1} \\tag{10.84}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe small-signal model in Fig. 10.15(a) represents a bipolar pair with node P acting as a virtual ground for differential small-signal inputs, facilitating the analysis. The circuit comprises two NPN transistors, Q1 and Q2, with their collectors grounded and their emitters linked to the respective input voltages. Resistors r_π1 and r_π2 are connected to the bases of Q1 and Q2, respectively. The current sources g_m1v_π1 and g_m2v_π2 are governed by the voltages across r_π1 and r_π2, respectively.\n\nFigure 10.15 (a) Small-signal model of bipolar pair, (b) simplified small-signal model, (c) simplified diagram.\n\nThis leads to:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv_{P} & =v_{i n 1}-v_{\\pi 1}  \\tag{10.85}\\\\\n& =0 . \\tag{10.86}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nHence, the small-signal model validates the prediction made by Eq. (10.32). In Problem 10.28, we demonstrate that this attribute persists even in the presence of the Early effect.\n\nThe virtual-ground characteristic of node $P$ for differential small-signal inputs significantly simplifies the analysis. Since $v_{P}=0$, this node can be treated as ac ground, simplifying the differential pair in Fig. 10.15(a) to two \"half circuits\" [Fig. 10.15(b)]. With each half resembling a common-emitter stage, we can express\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv_{\\text {out } 1} & =-g_{m} R_{C} v_{\\text {in } 1}  \\tag{10.87}\\\\\nv_{\\text {out } 2} & =-g_{m} R_{C} v_{\\text {in } 2} \\tag{10.88}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nConsequently, the differential voltage gain of the differential pair equals\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{v_{\\text {out } 1}-v_{\\text {out } 2}}{v_{\\text {in } 1}-v_{\\text {in } 2}}=-g_{m} R_{C} \\tag{10.89}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhich is consistent with Eq. (10.40). For simplicity, we may represent the two half circuits as in Fig. 10.15(c), acknowledging that the incremental inputs are small and differential. Moreover, since the two halves are identical, we may depict only one half.\n\nExample Calculate the differential gain of the circuit shown in Fig. 10.16(a), where ideal current sources are used as loads to maximize the gain.\nFigure 10.16 (a) Circuit diagram for differential gain calculation.\n\nThe circuit in Fig. 10.16(a) is a differential amplifier with two NPN transistors (Q1 and Q2), each with its base connected to separate input voltages (Vin1 and Vin2). The emitters are connected together to a current source (I_EE) that is grounded. The collectors of both transistors are connected to the output node (Vout), which is also connected to V_CC through current sources, maximizing the gain.\n\nFor ideal current sources, the Early effect in $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ cannot be ignored, and the half circuits must be visualized as shown in Fig. 10.16(b). Thus,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& v_{\\text {out } 1}=-g_{m} r_{O} v_{\\text {in } 1}  \\tag{10.90}\\\\\n& v_{\\text {out } 2}=-g_{m} r_{O} v_{\\text {in } 2} \\tag{10.91}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nand therefore\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{v_{\\text {out } 1}-v_{\\text {out } 2}}{v_{\\text {in } 1}-v_{\\text {in } 2}}=-g_{m} r_{O} \\tag{10.92}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nExercise Compute the gain for $V_{A}=5 \\mathrm{~V}$.\n\nExample Figure 10.17(a) illustrates an implementation of the topology shown in Fig. 10.16(a).\nCalculate the differential voltage gain.\n\nThe circuit in Fig. 10.17(a) is a differential amplifier with two NPN transistors (Q1 and Q2), each with its base connected to separate input voltages (Vin1 and Vin2). The emitters are connected together to a current source (IEE) that is grounded. The collectors of both transistors are connected to the output node (Vout), which is also connected to V_CC through current sources, maximizing the gain.\n\nNoting that each pnp device introduces a resistance of $r_{O P}$ at the output nodes and drawing the half circuit as in Fig. 10.17(b), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{v_{\\text {out } 1}-v_{\\text {out } 2}}{v_{\\text {in } 1}-v_{\\text {in } 2}}=-g_{m}\\left(r_{O N} \\| r_{O P}\\right) \\tag{10.93}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $r_{O N}$ denotes the output impedance of the $n p n$ transistors.\n\nExercise Calculate the gain if $Q_{3}$ and $Q_{4}$ are configured as diode-connected devices.\n\nIt is crucial to note that the differential voltage gain is defined as the difference between the outputs divided by the difference between the inputs. Thus, this gain is equivalent to the single-ended gain of each half circuit.\n\nWe now make an observation that is valuable in the analysis of differential circuits. As mentioned earlier, the symmetry of the circuit ($g_{m 1}=g_{m 2}$) establishes a virtual ground at node $P$ in Fig. 10.12 if the incremental inputs are small and differential. This property holds for any other node that lies on the axis of symmetry. For instance, the two resistors in Fig. 10.18 create a virtual ground at $X$ if (1) $R_{1}=R_{2}$ and (2) nodes $A$ and $B$ vary by equal and opposite amounts. This principle is further elucidated with additional examples, assuming perfect symmetry in each case.\n\nFigure 10.18 illustrates a circuit where a virtual ground is established at node X when R1 equals R2 and nodes A and B vary by equal and opposite amounts.\n\nExample Determine the differential gain of the circuit in Fig. 10.19(a) if $V_{A}<\\infty$ and the circuit is symmetric.\n\nFigure 10.19 (a) Circuit diagram for differential gain calculation.\n\nDrawing one of the half circuits as shown in Fig. 10.19(b), we express the total resistance seen at the collector of $Q_{1}$ as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{o u t}=r_{O 1}\\left\\|r_{O 3}\\right\\| R_{1} \\tag{10.94}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, the voltage gain is equal to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nA_{v}=-g_{m 1}\\left(r_{O 1}\\left\\|r_{O 3}\\right\\| R_{1}\\right) \\tag{10.95}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nExercise Repeat the above example if $R_{1} \\neq R_{2}$.\n\nCalculate the differential gain of the circuit depicted in Fig. 10.20(a) if $V_{A}<\\infty$.\n\nFigure 10.20 (a) Circuit diagram for differential gain calculation.\n\nFor small differential inputs and outputs, $V_{X}$ remains constant, leading to the conceptual half circuit shown in Fig. 10.20(b) -the same as that in the above example. This is because $Q_{3}$ and $Q_{4}$ experience a constant base-emitter voltage in both cases, thereby acting as current sources and exhibiting only an output resistance. It follows that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nA_{v}=-g_{m 1}\\left(r_{O 1}\\left\\|r_{O 3}\\right\\| R_{1}\\right) \\tag{10.96}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nExercise Calculate the gain if $V_{A}=4 \\mathrm{~V}$ for all transistors, $R_{1}=R_{2}=10 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$, and $I_{E E}=1 \\mathrm{~mA}$.\n\nExample\nDetermine the gain of the degenerated differential pairs shown in Figs. 10.21(a) and (b).\nAssume $V_{A}=\\infty$.\n\nFigure 10.21 (a) and (b) Circuit diagrams for gain calculation of degenerated differential pairs.\n\nIn the topology of Fig. 10.21(a), node $P$ is a virtual ground, yielding the half circuit depicted in Fig. 10.21(c). From Chapter 5, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nA_{v}=-\\frac{R_{C}}{R_{E}+\\frac{1}{g_{m}}} \\tag{10.97}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn the circuit of Fig. 10.21(b), the line of symmetry passes through the \"midpoint\" of $R_{E}$. In other words, if $R_{E}$ is regarded as two $R_{E} / 2$ units in series, then the node between the units acts as a virtual ground [Fig. 10.21(d)]. It follows that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nA_{v}=-\\frac{R_{C}}{\\frac{R_{E}}{2}+\\frac{1}{g_{m}}} \\tag{10.98}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe two circuits provide equal gains if the pair in Fig. 10.21(b) incorporates a total degeneration resistance of $2 R_{E}$.\n\nExercise Design each circuit for a gain of 5 and power consumption of 2 mW.

    "text": "An initial examination of the differential pair in Fig. 10.11 indicated that, for small differential inputs, the tail node sustains a constant voltage (thus it's referred to as a \"virtual ground\"). Additionally, we obtained a voltage gain equivalent to $g_{m} R_{C}$. We now delve deeper into the small-signal behavior of the circuit. As previously discussed, the term \"small signals\" is somewhat subjective, but the critical aspect is that the input signals should not significantly affect the bias currents of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$. In essence, the two transistors must exhibit nearly identical transconductances - the same condition necessary for node $P$ to behave as a virtual ground. Practically, an input difference of less than 10 mV is deemed \"small\" for the majority of applications.\n\nPresuming perfect symmetry, an ideal tail current source, and $V_{A}=\\infty$, we construct the small-signal model of the circuit as depicted in Fig. 10.15(a). Here, $v_{i n 1}$ and $v_{i n 2}$ signify small variations in each input and must adhere to $v_{i n 1}=-v_{i n 2}$ for differential operation. It's worth noting that the tail current source is substituted with an open circuit.

The node P acts as a virtual ground for differential small-signal inputs, simplifying the analysis. The circuit comprises two NPN transistors, Q1 and Q2, with their collectors connected to ground and their emitters connected to the respective input voltages. The resistors r_π1 and r_π2 are connected to the bases of Q1 and Q2, respectively. The current sources g_m1v_π1 and g_m2v_π2 are controlled by the voltages across r_π1 and r_π2, respectively.\n- Fig. 10.15(b) is a simplified small-signal model of a differential amplifier with two voltage sources vin1 and vin2, resistors rπ1, rπ2, and RC, and voltage-controlled current sources g_m1v_π1 and g_m2v_π2.

(10.32). In Problem 10.28, we demonstrate that this property holds true even in the presence of the Early effect.\n\nThe virtual-ground characteristic of node $P$ for differential small-signal inputs significantly simplifies the analysis. Since $v_{P}=0$, this node can be linked to ac ground, reducing the differential pair of Fig. 10.15(a) to two \"half circuits\" [Fig. 10.15(b)]. With each half resembling a common-emitter stage, we can write\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv_{\\text {out } 1} & =-g_{m} R_{C} v_{\\text {in } 1}  \\tag{10.87}\\\\\nv_{\\text {out } 2} & =-g_{m} R_{C} v_{\\text {in } 2} \\tag{10.88}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nConsequently, the differential voltage gain of the differential pair is equal to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{v_{\\text {out } 1}-v_{\\text {out } 2}}{v_{\\text {in } 1}-v_{\\text {in } 2}}=-g_{m} R_{C} \\tag{10.89}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as that expressed by Eq.

The circuit is designed to amplify the difference between Vin1 and Vin2.\n\nFigure 10.19(b) simplifies one of the half circuits.\n\nThe voltage gain is equal to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nA_{v}=-g_{m 1}\\left(r_{O 1}\\left\\|r_{O 3}\\right\\| R_{1}\\right) \\tag{10.95}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nExample: Calculate the differential gain of the circuit illustrated in Fig. 10.20(a) if $V_{A}<\\infty$.\n\nFigure 10.20(a) shows a differential amplifier with two NPN transistors (Q1 and Q2) and two PNP transistors (Q3 and Q4). The resistors R1 and R2 are connected to the output nodes Vout1 and Vout2, respectively. The current source I_EE provides biasing current.\n\nFigure 10.20(b) simplifies the half circuit.\n\nFor small differential inputs and outputs, $V_{X}$ remains constant, leading to the conceptual half circuit shown in Fig. 10.20(b) -the same as that in the above example. This is because $Q_{3}$ and $Q_{4}$ experience a constant base-emitter voltage in both cases, thereby serving as current sources and exhibiting only an output resistance. It follows that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nA_{v}=-g_{m 1}\\left(r_{O 1}\\left\\|r_{O 3}\\right\\| R_{1}\\right) \\tag{10.96}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nExample: Determine the gain of the degenerated differential pairs shown in Figs. 10.21(a) and (b).\n\nFigures 10.21(a) and (b) depict differential amplifier circuits with two NPN transistors (Q1 and Q2) sharing a common emitter node P. The circuit is powered by VCC and has a current source IEE connected to the common emitter node.\n\nFigures 10.21(c) and (d) show simplified half circuits.\n\nIn the topology of Fig. 10.21(a), node $P$ is a virtual ground, yielding the half circuit depicted in Fig. 10.21(c). From Chapter 5, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nA_{v}=-\\frac{R_{C}}{R_{E}+\\frac{1}{g_{m}}} \\tag{10.97}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn the circuit of Fig. 10.21(b), the line of symmetry passes through the \"midpoint\" of $R_{E}$. In other words, if $R_{E}$ is regarded as two $R_{E} / 2$ units in series, then the node between the units acts as a virtual ground [Fig. 10.21(d)]. It follows that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nA_{v}=-\\frac{R_{C}}{\\frac{R_{E}}{2}+\\frac{1}{g_{m}}} \\tag{10.98}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe two circuits provide equal gains if the pair in Fig. 10.21(b) incorporates a total degeneration resistance of $2 R_{E}$.\n\nFor a differential pair, we can define the input impedance as illustrated in Fig. 10.22(a). From the equivalent circuit in Fig. 10.22(b), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{v_{\\pi 1}}{r_{\\pi 1}}=i_{X}=-\\frac{v_{\\pi 2}}{r_{\\pi 2}} \\tag{10.99}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAlso,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv_{X} & =v_{\\pi 1}-v_{\\pi 2}  \\tag{10.100}\\\\\n& =2 r_{\\pi 1} i_{X} \\tag{10.101}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIt follows that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{v_{X}}{i_{X}}=2 r_{\\pi 1} \\tag{10.102}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis quantity is called the \"differential input impedance\" of the circuit. It is also possible to define a \"single-ended input impedance\" with the aid of a half circuit (Fig. 10.23), obtaining\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{v_{X}}{i_{X}}=r_{\\pi 1} \\tag{10.103}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn a similar vein, the reader can demonstrate that the differential and single-ended output impedances are equal to $2 R_{C}$ and $R_{C}$, respectively."

By examining Eq. (10.142), we find that the right-hand side is an odd function of $V_{i n 1} - V_{i n 2}$, which decreases to zero for zero input difference. However, it's unclear if the argument under the square root can also vanish, suggesting that $I_{D 1} - I_{D 2}$ reaches zero as $(V_{i n 1} - V_{i n 2})^2$ approaches $4 I_{S S} / (\\mu_{n} C_{o x} W / L)$, a scenario not predicted by our qualitative sketches.\n\nThe assumption that both transistors are on breaks down as $(|V_{i n 1} - V_{i n 2}|)$ increases.

Instead, we infer from Figure 10.30 that if $M_{1}$ approaches the edge of conduction, its gate-source voltage falls to $V_{T H}$. The gate-source voltage of $M_{2}$ must be high enough to maintain a drain current of $I_{S S}$:\n\n$$\nV_{G S 1} = V_{T H} \\\\\nV_{G S 2} = V_{T H} + \\sqrt{\\frac{2 I_{S S}}{\\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}}}\n$$\n\nFrom Eq.

Equation (10.145) is invalid for input differences greater than this value. Indeed, substituting from Eq. (10.145) into (10.142) also yields $|I_{D 1} - I_{D 2}| = I_{S S}$. We also note that $|V_{i n 1} - V_{i n 2}|_{\\max}$ can be related to the equilibrium overdrive [Eq.

By examining Eq. (10.142) closely, we observe that the right-hand side is an odd function of $V_{i n 1} - V_{i n 2}$, decreasing to zero for zero input difference. However, the argument under the square root cannot vanish, as this would imply that $I_{D 1} - I_{D 2}$ reaches zero as $(V_{i n 1} - V_{i n 2})^2$ reaches $4 I_{S S} / (\\mu_{n} C_{o x} W / L)$, an effect not predicted by our qualitative sketches. Furthermore, the argument of the square root becomes negative as $(V_{i n 1} - V_{i n 2})^2$ exceeds this value! How should these results be interpreted?\n\nThe assumption that both transistors are on breaks down as $(|V_{i n 1} - V_{i n 2}|)$ increases.

Equation (10.146) provides insights into the operation of the MOS pair. Specifically, by plotting $I_{D 1}$ and $I_{D 2}$ as in Figure 10.31(a), we arrive at the differential characteristics in Figures 10.31(b) and (c). The circuit behaves linearly for small input voltage differences and becomes nonlinear for differences greater than $\\Delta V_{i n, \\max}$. Thus, $\\Delta V_{i n, \\max}$ acts as an absolute limit on the input signal levels that affect the output.\n\nFor instance, consider the input/output characteristic of a MOS differential pair when (a) the tail current is doubled, or (b) the transistor aspect ratio is doubled.\n\nSolution (a): Doubling $I_{S S}$ increases $\\Delta V_{i n, \\max}$ by a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$. Thus, the characteristic of Figure 10.31(c) expands horizontally. Furthermore, since $I_{S S} R_{D}$ doubles, the characteristic expands vertically as well, as shown in Figure 10.32(a).\n\nSolution (b): Doubling $W / L$ lowers $\\Delta V_{i n, \\max}$ by a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$ while keeping $I_{S S} R_{D}$ constant. The characteristic thus contracts horizontally, as seen in Figure 10.32(b), and exhibits a steeper slope near $\\Delta V_{i n} = 0$.\n\nExercise: Repeat the above example if (a) the tail current is halved, or (b) the transistor aspect ratio is halved.\n\nThe tail current must not exceed $3 \\mathrm{~mW} / 1.8 \\mathrm{~V} = 1.67 \\mathrm{~mA}$. From Eq. (10.145), we write:\n\n$$\n\\frac{W}{L} = \\frac{2 I_{S S}}{\\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\Delta V_{i n, \\max}^2} = 133.6\n$$\n\nThe value of the load resistors is determined by the required voltage gain.\n\nExercise: How does the above design change if the power budget is raised to 5 mW?"

The gate of M1 is at the threshold voltage VTH, indicating it is at the edge of conduction.\n\nEquations (10.140)-(10.142) form the basis of our understanding of the MOS differential pair.\n\nA close examination of Eq. (10.142) reveals that the right-hand side is an odd function of $V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}$, which is expected from the characteristics in Fig. 10.25 (c), and it drops to zero for a zero input difference. However, the term under the square root can also vanish, suggesting that $I_{D 1}-I_{D 2}$ falls to zero as $\\left(V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}\\right)^{2}$ reaches $4 I_{S S} /\\left(\\mu_{n} C_{o x} W / L\\right)$. This is an effect not predicted by our qualitative sketches in Fig. 10.25(c). Moreover, the argument of the square root becomes negative as $\\left(V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}\\right)^{2}$ exceeds this value! How should these results be interpreted?\n\nOur derivations implicitly assume both transistors are on. However, as $\\left|V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}\\right|$ increases, one of the transistors, say $M_{1}$ or $M_{2}$, will turn off, invalidating the above equations. We must therefore determine the input difference that places one of the transistors at the edge of conduction. This can be achieved by equating Eqs. (10.140), (10.141), or (10.142) to $I_{S S}$, but this leads to lengthy algebra. Instead, we observe from Fig. 10.30 that if, for instance, $M_{1}$ approaches the edge of conduction, then its gate-source voltage falls to a value equal to $V_{T H}$. Additionally, the gate-source voltage of $M_{2}$ must be sufficiently large to accommodate a drain current of $I_{S S}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{G S 1} & =V_{T H}  \\tag{10.143}\\\\\nV_{G S 2} & =V_{T H}+\\sqrt{\\frac{2 I_{S S}}{\\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}}} \\tag{10.144}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIt follows from Eq.

    "text": "The analysis we are focusing on aims to establish the input/output attributes of the MOS pair as the differential input fluctuates from significantly negative to highly positive. As shown in Fig. 10.29, the output voltage \\( V_{\\text{out}} \\) is the difference between \\( V_{\\text{out }1} \\) and \\( V_{\\text{out }2} \\), which can be expressed as the product of the resistance \\( R_D \\) and the current difference \\( I_{D1} - I_{D2} \\).\n\nTo calculate \\( I_{D1} - I_{D2} \\), we simplify by disregarding channel-length modulation and apply Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) to the input circuit and Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at the tail node, resulting in two equations. The MOS differential pair is an extension of the bipolar version with the key benefit of very low input current. Despite the need for high-input-impedance operational amplifiers existing before MOS technology was ready for mass production, the challenge of integrating field-effect transistors with small gate currents on the same chip as bipolar devices persisted. The FETs were difficult to control and exhibited significant offset. It was not until the 1970s that high-input-impedance op amps became widespread, with MOS op amps taking on a crucial role in analog integrated circuits, including \"switched-capacitor\" filters and analog-to-digital converters.\n\nGiven the drain current equation \\( I_D = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} (V_{GS} - V_{TH})^2 \\), we can express \\( V_{GS} \\) in terms of \\( I_D \\) as follows:\n\nSubstituting \\( V_{GS1} \\) and \\( V_{GS2} \\) into equation (10.128), we derive:\n\nThe symmetry of the circuit implies:\n\nEquations (10.140)-(10.142) provide the basis for understanding the MOS differential pair. Examining equation (10.142) closely reveals an odd function of \\( V_{in1} - V_{in2} \\), which diminishes to zero with no input difference. However, the square root term can also vanish, indicating that \\( I_{D1} - I_{D2} \\) reaches zero as \\( (V_{in1} - V_{in2})^2 \\) reaches \\( 4 I_{SS} / (\\mu_n C_{ox} W/L) \\), an effect not predicted by our qualitative sketches. Moreover, the argument of the square root becomes negative as \\( (V_{in1} - V_{in2})^2 \\) exceeds this value! The interpretation of these results is crucial.\n\nOur analysis assumes both transistors are in an active state. However, as \\( |V_{in1} - V_{in2}| \\) increases, one of the transistors, say \\( M_1 \\), approaches the non-conducting state, invalidating the equations. We must identify the input difference that causes one transistor to reach the edge of conduction. This is achieved by setting Eqs. (10.140), (10.141), or (10.142) equal to \\( I_{SS} \\), leading to complex algebra. Alternatively, we observe from Fig. 10.30 that if \\( M_1 \\) is at the edge of conduction, its gate-source voltage equals \\( V_{TH} \\). The gate-source voltage of \\( M_2 \\) must be sufficient to maintain a drain current of \\( I_{SS} \\):\n\nThese equations lead to the maximum input difference \\( |V_{in1} - V_{in2}|_{\\max} \\) that places one transistor at the edge of conduction. Equation (10.145) is inapplicable for input differences greater than this value. In fact, substituting from Eq. (10.145) into (10.142) also yields \\( |I_{D1} - I_{D2}| = I_{SS} \\). We also note that \\( |V_{in1} - V_{in2}|_{\\max} \\) can be related to the equilibrium overdrive [Eq. (10.106)] as follows:\n\nThe above insights are significant and differ from the bipolar differential pair behavior described by Eq. (10.78): the MOS pair directs all of the tail current for \\( |V_{in1} - V_{in2}|_{\\max} \\), whereas the bipolar version only approaches this condition for a finite input difference.\n\nGraphs (a), (b), and (c) illustrate the variations of drain currents, the difference between drain currents, and the differential output voltage as functions of the input voltage difference. These graphs are typical of a differential amplifier, where the output is proportional to the input difference up to a certain point, beyond which saturation occurs.\n\nExample solutions show that doubling the tail current expands the characteristics horizontally and vertically, while doubling the transistor aspect ratio contracts the characteristics horizontally. Halving the tail current or aspect ratio would have the opposite effects.\n\nThe design must adhere to a power budget, and the tail current is calculated based on this constraint. The load resistor value is determined by the required voltage gain, and the aspect ratio is calculated to ensure the circuit operates within the specified power budget. Adjusting the power budget affects these calculations accordingly."

(10.142). As anticipated from the characteristics in Fig. 10.25 (c), the right-hand side is an odd function of $V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}$, reaching zero at zero input difference. However, can the quantity under the square root also vanish? This would suggest that $I_{D 1}-I_{D 2}$ diminishes to zero as $\\left(V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}\\right)^{2}$ reaches $4 I_{S S} /\\left(\\mu_{n} C_{o x} W / L\\right)$, an outcome not anticipated by our qualitative sketches in Fig. 10.25(c). Moreover, it seems that the argument of the square root becomes negative as $\\left(V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}\\right)^{2}$ surpasses this value! How should these results be understood?\n\nOur prior derivations inherently assume both transistors are active. However, as $\\left|V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}\\right|$ increases, at some juncture $M_{1}$ or $M_{2}$ shuts off, breaching the aforementioned equations. We must therefore identify the input difference that positions one of the transistors at the brink of conduction. This can be achieved by setting Eqs. (10.140), (10.141), or (10.142) equal to $I_{S S}$, but this necessitates extensive algebra. Instead, we discern from Fig. 10.30 that if, for instance, $M_{1}$ nears the brink of conduction, then its gate-source voltage diminishes to a value equal to $V_{T H}$. Additionally, the gate-source voltage of $M_{2}$ must be adequately high to accommodate a drain current of $I_{S S}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{G S 1} &= V_{T H}  \\tag{10.143}\\\\\nV_{G S 2} &= V_{T H}+\\sqrt{\\frac{2 I_{S S}}{\\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}}} \\tag{10.144}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIt follows from Eq. (10.128) that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left|V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}\\right|_{\\max }=\\sqrt{\\frac{2 I_{S S}}{\\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}}} \\tag{10.145}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\left|V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}\\right|_{\\text {max }}$ signifies the input difference that positions one transistor at the brink of conduction. Equation (10.145) is inapplicable for input differences greater than this value. Indeed, substituting from Eq. (10.145) in (10.142) also yields $\\left|I_{D 1}-I_{D 2}\\right|=I_{S S}$. We also note that $\\left|V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}\\right|_{\\max }$ can be related to the equilibrium overdrive [Eq. (10.106)] as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left|V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}\\right|_{\\max }=\\sqrt{2}\\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\\right)_{\\text {equil. }} . \\tag{10.146}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe aforementioned discoveries are of great significance and contrast with the behavior of the bipolar differential pair and Eq. (10.78): the MOS pair directs all of the tail current ${ }^{3}$ for $\\left|V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}\\right|_{\\text {max }}$ whereas the bipolar counterpart only approaches this state for a finite value"
