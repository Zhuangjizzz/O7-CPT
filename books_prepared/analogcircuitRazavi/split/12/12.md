# Frequency Response

The need for operating circuits at increasingly higher speeds has always challenged designers. From radar and television systems in the 1940s to gigahertz microprocessors today, the demand to push circuits to higher frequencies has required a solid understanding of their speed limitations.

In this chapter, we study the effects that limit the speed of transistors and circuits, identifying topologies that better lend themselves to high-frequency operation. We also develop skills for deriving transfer functions of circuits, a critical task in the study of stability and frequency compensation (12). We assume bipolar transistors remain in the active mode and MOSFETs in the saturation region. The outline is shown below.

## 11.1 FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS

### 11.1.1 General Considerations

What do we mean by "frequency response?" Illustrated in Fig. 11.1(a), the idea is to apply a sinusoid at the input of the circuit and observe the output while the input frequency is varied. As exemplified by Fig. 11.1(a), the circuit may exhibit a high gain at low frequencies but a "roll-off" as the frequency increases. We plot the magnitude of the gain as in Fig. 11.1(b) to represent the circuit's behavior at all frequencies of interest. We may loosely call $f_{1}$ the useful bandwidth of the circuit. Before investigating the cause of this roll-off,

Figure 11.1 (a) Conceptual test of frequency response, (b) gain roll-off with frequency.
we must ask: why is frequency response important? The following examples illustrate the issue.

Example Explain why people's voices over the phone sound different from their voices in face11.1 to-face conversation.

Solution The human voice contains frequency components from 20 Hz to 20 kHz [Fig. 11.2(a)]. Thus, circuits processing the voice must accommodate this frequency range. Unfortunately, the phone system suffers from a limited bandwidth, exhibiting the frequency response shown in Fig. 11.2(b). Since the phone suppresses frequencies above 3.5 kHz , each person's voice is altered. In high-quality audio systems, on the other hand, the circuits are designed to cover the entire frequency range.

Exercise Whose voice does the phone system alter more, men's or women's?

Example
11.2

Solution During recording, your voice propagates through the air and reaches the audio recorder. On the other hand, when you speak and listen to your own voice simultaneously, your voice propagates not only through the air but also from your mouth through your skull to your ear. Since the frequency response of the path through your skull is different
from that through the air (i.e., your skull passes some frequencies more easily than others), the way you hear your own voice is different from the way other people hear your voice.

Exercise Explain what happens to your voice when you have a cold.

Example Video signals typically occupy a bandwidth of about 5 MHz . For example, the graphics

11.3 card delivering the video signal to the display of a computer must provide at least 5 MHz of bandwidth. Explain what happens if the bandwidth of a video system is insufficient.

Solution With insufficient bandwidth, the "sharp" edges on a display become "soft," yielding a fuzzy picture. This is because the circuit driving the display is not fast enough to abruptly change the contrast from, e.g., complete white to complete black from one pixel to the next. Figures 11.3(a) and (b) illustrate this effect for a high-bandwidth and low-bandwidth driver, respectively. (The display is scanned from left to right.)

Figure 11.3

Exercise What happens if the display is scanned from top to bottom?

What causes the gain roll-off in Fig. 11.1? As a simple example, let us consider the low-pass filter depicted in Fig. 11.4(a). At low frequencies, $C_{1}$ is nearly open and the current through $R_{1}$ nearly zero; thus, $V_{\text {out }}=V_{\text {in }}$. As the frequency increases, the impedance of $C_{1}$ falls and the voltage divider consisting of $R_{1}$ and $C_{1}$ attenuates $V_{i n}$ to a greater extent. The circuit therefore exhibits the behavior shown in Fig. 11.4(b).

As a more interesting example, consider the common-source stage illustrated in Fig. 11.5(a), where a load capacitance, $C_{L}$, appears at the output. At low frequencies, the signal current produced by $M_{1}$ prefers to flow through $R_{D}$ because the impedance of

Figure 11.5 (a) CS stage with load capacitance, (b) small-signal model of the circuit.
$C_{L}, 1 /\left(C_{L} s\right)$, remains high. At high frequencies, on the other hand, $C_{L}$ "steals" some of the signal current and shunts it to ground, leading to a lower voltage swing at the output. In fact, from the small-signal equivalent circuit of Fig. 11.5(b), ${ }^{1}$ we note that $R_{D}$ and $C_{L}$ are in parallel and hence:

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text {out }}=-g_{m} V_{\text {in }}\left(R_{D} \| \frac{1}{C_{L} S}\right) \tag{11.1}
\end{equation*}
$$

That is, as the frequency increases, the parallel impedance falls and so does the amplitude of $V_{\text {out }} .{ }^{2}$ The voltage gain therefore drops at high frequencies.

The reader may wonder why we use sinusoidal inputs in our study of frequency response. After all, an amplifier may sense a voice or video signal that bears no resemblance to sinusoids. Fortunately, such signals can be viewed as a summation of many sinusoids with different frequencies (and phases). Thus, responses such as that in Fig. 11.5(b) prove useful so long as the circuit remains linear and hence superposition can be applied.

### 11.1.2 Relationship Between Transfer Function and Frequency Response

We know from basic circuit theory that the transfer function of a circuit can be written as

$$
\begin{equation*}
H(s)=A_{0} \frac{\left(1+\frac{s}{\omega_{z 1}}\right)\left(1+\frac{s}{\omega_{z 2}}\right) \ldots}{\left(1+\frac{s}{\omega_{p 1}}\right)\left(1+\frac{s}{\omega_{p 2}}\right) \ldots} \tag{11.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $A_{0}$ denotes the low-frequency gain because $H(s) \rightarrow A_{0}$ as $s \rightarrow 0$. The frequencies $\omega_{z j}$ and $\omega_{p j}$ represent the zeros and poles of the transfer function, respectively. If the input to the circuit is a sinusoid of the form $x(t)=A \cos (2 \pi f t)=A \cos \omega t$, then the output can be expressed as

$$
\begin{equation*}
y(t)=A|H(j \omega)| \cos [\omega t+\angle H(j \omega)] \tag{11.3}
\end{equation*}
$$

[^5]where $H(j \omega)$ is obtained by making the substitution $s=j \omega$. Called the "magnitude" and the "phase," $|H(j \omega)|$ and $\angle H(j \omega)$ respectively reveal the frequency response of the circuit. In this chapter, we are primarily concerned with the former. Note that $f$ (in Hz) and $\omega$ (in radians per second) are related by a factor of $2 \pi$. For example, we may write $\omega=5 \times 10^{10} \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}=2 \pi(7.96 \mathrm{GHz})$.

Example Determine the transfer function and frequency response of the CS stage shown in Fig. 11.4 11.5(a).

Solution From Eq. (11.1), we have

$$
\begin{align*}
H(s)=\frac{V_{\text {out }}}{V_{\text {in }}}(s) & =-g_{m}\left(R_{D} \| \frac{1}{C_{L} s}\right)  \tag{11.4}\\
& =\frac{-g_{m} R_{D}}{R_{D} C_{L} s+1} . \tag{11.5}
\end{align*}
$$

For a sinusoidal input, we replace $s=j \omega$ and compute the magnitude of the transfer function: ${ }^{3}$

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|\frac{V_{\text {out }}}{V_{\text {in }}}\right|=\frac{g_{m} R_{D}}{\sqrt{R_{D}^{2} C_{L}^{2} \omega^{2}+1}} \tag{11.6}
\end{equation*}
$$

As expected, the gain begins at $g_{m} R_{D}$ at low frequencies, rolling off as $R_{D}^{2} C_{L}^{2} \omega^{2}$ becomes comparable with unity. At $\omega=1 /\left(R_{D} C_{L}\right)$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|\frac{V_{\text {out }}}{V_{\text {in }}}\right|=\frac{g_{m} R_{D}}{\sqrt{2}} . \tag{11.7}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since $20 \log \sqrt{2} \approx 3 \mathrm{~dB}$, we say the -3 dB bandwidth of the circuit is equal to $1 /\left(R_{D} C_{L}\right)$ (Fig. 11.6).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_fa3a663eee928a6916c6g-43.jpg?height=663&width=1006&top_left_y=3801&top_left_x=1837)

Exercise Derive the above results if $\lambda \neq 0$.

Example Consider the common-emitter stage shown in Fig.11.7. Derive a relationship among the 11.5 gain, the -3 dB bandwidth, and the power consumption of the circuit. Assume $V_{A}=\infty$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_fa3a663eee928a6916c6g-44.jpg?height=606&width=749&top_left_y=873&top_left_x=2091)

Figure 11.7
Solution In a manner similar to the CS topology of Fig. 11.5(a), the bandwidth is given by $1 /\left(R_{C} C_{L}\right)$, the low-frequency gain by $g_{m} R_{C}=\left(I_{C} / V_{T}\right) R_{C}$, and the power consumption by $I_{C} \cdot V_{C C}$. For the highest performance, we wish to maximize both the gain and the bandwidth (and hence the product of the two) and minimize the power dissipation. We therefore define a "figure of merit" as

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\text { Gain } \times \text { Bandwidth }}{\text { Power Consumption }} & =\frac{\frac{I_{C}}{V_{T}} R_{C} \times \frac{1}{R_{C} C_{L}}}{I_{C} \cdot V_{C C}}  \tag{11.8}\\
& =\frac{1}{V_{T} \cdot V_{C C}} \frac{1}{C_{L}} . \tag{11.9}
\end{align*}
$$

Thus, the overall performance can be improved by lowering (a) the temperature; ${ }^{4}$ (b) $V_{C C}$ but at the cost of limiting the voltage swings; or (c) the load capacitance. In practice, the load capacitance receives the greatest attention. Equation (11.9) becomes more complex for CS stages (Problem 11.15).

Exercise Derive the above results if $V_{A}<\infty$.

Example Explain the relationship between the frequency response and step response of the simple 11.6 low-pass filter shown in Fig. 11.4(a).

Solution To obtain the transfer function, we view the circuit as a voltage divider and write

$$
\begin{align*}
H(s)=\frac{V_{\text {out }}}{V_{\text {in }}}(s) & =\frac{\frac{1}{C_{1} s}}{\frac{1}{C_{1} s}+R_{1}}  \tag{11.10}\\
& =\frac{1}{R_{1} C_{1} s+1} . \tag{11.11}
\end{align*}
$$

[^6]The frequency response is determined by replacing $s$ with $j \omega$ and computing the magnitude:

$$
\begin{equation*}
|H(s=j \omega)|=\frac{1}{\sqrt{R_{1}^{2} C_{1}^{2} \omega^{2}+1}} \tag{11.12}
\end{equation*}
$$

The -3 dB bandwidth is equal to $1 /\left(R_{1} C_{1}\right)$.
The circuit's response to a step of the form $V_{0} u(t)$ is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text {out }}(t)=V_{0}\left(1-\exp \frac{-t}{R_{1} C_{1}}\right) u(t) \tag{11.13}
\end{equation*}
$$

The relationship between Eqs. (11.12) and (11.13) is that, as $R_{1} C_{1}$ increases, the bandwidth drops and the step response becomes slower. Figure 11.8 plots this behavior, revealing that a narrow bandwidth results in a sluggish time response. This observation explains the effect seen in Fig. 11.3(b): since the signal cannot rapidly jump from low (white) to high (black), it spends some time at intermediate levels (shades of gray), creating "fuzzy" edges.

Exercise At what frequency does $|H|$ fall by a factor of two?

### 11.1.3 Bode's Rules

The task of obtaining $|H(j \omega)|$ from $H(s)$ and plotting the result is somewhat tedious. For this reason, we often utilize Bode's rules (approximations) to construct $|H(j \omega)|$ rapidly. Bode's rules for $|H(j \omega)|$ are as follows:

- As $\omega$ passes each pole frequency, the slope of $|H(j \omega)|$ decreases by $20 \mathrm{~dB} /$ dec. (A slope of $20 \mathrm{~dB} /$ dec simply means a tenfold change in $H$ for a tenfold increase in frequency);
- As $\omega$ passes each zero frequency, the slope of $|H(j \omega)|$ increases by $20 \mathrm{~dB} / \mathrm{dec} .^{5}$

Example

11.7

Construct the Bode plot of $|H(j \omega)|$ for the CS stage depicted in Fig. 11.5(a).

Solution Equation (11.5) indicates a pole frequency of

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|\omega_{p 1}\right|=\frac{1}{R_{D} C_{L}} \tag{11.14}
\end{equation*}
$$

[^7]The magnitude thus begins at $g_{m} R_{D}$ at low frequencies and remains flat up to $\omega=\left|\omega_{p 1}\right|$. At this point, the slope changes from zero to $-20 \mathrm{~dB} / \mathrm{dec}$. Figure 11.9 illustrates the result. In contrast to Fig. 11.5(b), the Bode approximation ignores the 3 dB roll-off at the pole frequency-but it greatly simplifies the algebra. As evident from Eq. (11.6), for $R_{D}^{2} C_{L}^{2} \omega^{2} \gg 1$, Bode's rule provides a good approximation.

Exercise Construct the Bode plot for $g_{m}=(150 \Omega)^{-1}, R_{D}=2 \mathrm{k} \Omega$, and $C_{L}=100 \mathrm{fF}$.

### 11.1.4 Association of Poles with Nodes

The poles of a circuit's transfer function play a central role in the frequency response. The designer must therefore be able to identify the poles intuitively so as to determine which parts of the circuit appear as the "speed bottleneck."

The CS topology studied in Example 11.4 serves as a good example for identifying poles by inspection. Equation (11.5) reveals that the pole frequency is given by the inverse of the product of the total resistance seen between the output node and ground and the total capacitance seen between the output node and ground. Applicable to many circuits, this observation can be generalized as follows: if node $j$ in the signal path exhibits a small-signal resistance of $R_{j}$ to ground and a capacitance of $C_{j}$ to ground, then it contributes a pole of magnitude $\left(R_{j} C_{j}\right)^{-1}$ to the transfer function.

Did you know?

Bode's rules are an example of "necessity is mother of invention." While working on electronic filters and equalizers at Bell Labs in the 1930s, Hendrik Bode, like other researchers in the field, faced the problem of determining the stability of complex circuits and systems. With no computers or even calculators available, the engineers of that era had to perform lengthy hand calculations for this purpose. Bode thus came up with his approximations of the frequency response and, as seen in Chapter 12, a simple method of studying the stability of feedback systems.

Determine the poles of the circuit shown in Fig. 11.10. Assume $\lambda=0$.

Figure 11.10

Solution Setting $V_{i n}$ to zero, we recognize that the gate of $M_{1}$ sees a resistance of $R_{S}$ and a capacitance of $C_{i n}$ to ground. Thus,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|\omega_{p 1}\right|=\frac{1}{R_{S} C_{i n}} . \tag{11.15}
\end{equation*}
$$

We may call $\omega_{p 1}$ the "input pole" to indicate that it arises in the input network. Similarly, the "output pole" is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|\omega_{p 2}\right|=\frac{1}{R_{D} C_{L}} \tag{11.16}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since the low-frequency gain of the circuit is equal to $-g_{m} R_{D}$, we can readily write the magnitude of the transfer function as:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|\frac{V_{\text {out }}}{V_{\text {in }}}\right|=\frac{g_{m} R_{D}}{\sqrt{\left(1+\omega^{2} / \omega_{p 1}^{2}\right)\left(1+\omega^{2} \omega_{p 2}^{2}\right)}} . \tag{11.17}
\end{equation*}

How do we choose the value of $R_{D}$ such that the output pole frequency is ten times the input pole frequency?

The reader may wonder how the foregoing technique can be applied if a node is loaded with a "floating" capacitor, i.e., a capacitor whose other terminal is also connected to a node in the signal path (Fig. 11.12). In general, we cannot utilize this technique and must

Figure 11.12 Circuit with floating capacitor.
write the circuit's equations and obtain the transfer function. However, an approximation given by "Miller's theorem" can simplify the task in some cases.

### 11.1.5 Miller's Theorem

Our above study and the example in Fig. 11.12 make it desirable to obtain a method that "transforms" a floating capacitor to two grounded capacitors, thereby allowing association of one pole with each node. Miller's theorem is such a method. Miller's theorem, however, was originally conceived for another reason. In the late 1910s, John Miller had observed that parasitic capacitances appearing between the input and output of an amplifier may drastically lower the input impedance. He then proposed an analysis that led to the theorem.

Consider the general circuit shown in Fig. 11.13(a), where the floating impedance, $Z_{F}$, appears between nodes 1 and 2 . We wish to transform $Z_{F}$ to two grounded impedances as depicted in Fig. 11.13(b), while ensuring all of the currents and voltages in the circuit remain unchanged. To determine $Z_{1}$ and $Z_{2}$, we make two observations: (1) the current drawn by $Z_{F}$ from node 1 in Fig. 11.13(a) must be equal to that drawn by $Z_{1}$ in Fig. 11.13(b); and (2) the current injected to node 2 in Fig. 11.13(a) must be equal to that injected by $Z_{2}$ in Fig. 11.13(b). (These requirements guarantee that the circuit does not "feel" the transformation.) Thus,

$$
\begin{align*}
& \frac{V_{1}-V_{2}}{Z_{F}}=\frac{V_{1}}{Z_{1}}  \tag{11.19}\\
& \frac{V_{1}-V_{2}}{Z_{F}}=-\frac{V_{2}}{Z_{2}} \tag{11.20}
\end{align*}
$$

Denoting the voltage gain from node 1 to node 2 by $A_{v}$, we obtain

$$
\begin{align*}
Z_{1} & =Z_{F} \frac{V_{1}}{V_{1}-V_{2}}  \tag{11.21}\\
& =\frac{Z_{F}}{1-A_{v}} \tag{11.22}
\end{align*}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_fa3a663eee928a6916c6g-48.jpg?height=760&width=2135&top_left_y=4055&top_left_x=1387)

Figure 11.13 (a) General circuit including a floating impedance, (b) equivalent of (a) as obtained from Miller's theorem.
and

$$
\begin{align*}
Z_{2} & =Z_{F} \frac{-V_{2}}{V_{1}-V_{2}}  \tag{11.23}\\
& =\frac{Z_{F}}{1-\frac{1}{A_{v}}} \tag{11.24}
\end{align*}
$$

Called Miller's theorem, the results expressed by Eqs. (11.22) and (11.24) prove extremely useful in analysis and design. In particular, Eq. (11.22) suggests that the floating impedance is reduced by a factor of $1-A_{v}$ when "seen" at node 1 .

As an important example of Miller's theorem, let us assume $Z_{F}$ is a single capacitor, $C_{F}$, tied between the input and output of an inverting amplifier [Fig. 11.14(a)]. Applying Eq. (11.22), we have

$$
\begin{align*}
Z_{1} & =\frac{Z_{F}}{1-A_{v}}  \tag{11.25}\\
& =\frac{1}{\left(1+A_{0}\right) C_{F} S} \tag{11.26}
\end{align*}
$$

where the substitution $A_{v}=-A_{0}$ is made. What type of impedance is $Z_{1}$ ? The $1 / s$ dependence suggests a capacitor of value $\left(1+A_{0}\right) C_{F}$, as if $C_{F}$ is "amplified" by a factor of $1+A_{0}$. In other words, a capacitor $C_{F}$ tied between the input and output of an inverting amplifier with a gain of $A_{0}$ raises the input capacitance by an amount equal to $\left(1+A_{0}\right) C_{F}$. We say such a circuit suffers from "Miller multiplication" of the capacitor.

The effect of $C_{F}$ at the output can be obtained from Eq. (11.24):

$$
\begin{align*}
Z_{2} & =\frac{Z_{F}}{1-\frac{1}{A_{v}}}  \tag{11.27}\\
& =\frac{1}{\left(1+\frac{1}{A_{0}}\right) C_{F} S} \tag{11.28}
\end{align*}
$$

which is close to $\left(C_{F} s\right)^{-1}$ if $A_{0} \gg 1$. Figure 11.14(b) summarizes these results.
The Miller multiplication of capacitors can also be explained intuitively. Suppose the input voltage in Fig. 11.14(a) goes up by a small amount $\Delta V$. The output then goes down by $A_{0} \Delta V$. That is, the voltage across $C_{F}$ increases by $\left(1+A_{0}\right) \Delta V$, requiring that the input provide a proportional charge. By contrast, if $C_{F}$ were not a floating capacitor and its right plate voltage did not change, it would experience only a voltage change of $\Delta V$ and require less charge.

Figure 11.14 (a) Inverting circuit with floating capacitor, (b) equivalent circuit as obtained from Miller's theorem.

The above study points to the utility of Miller's theorem for conversion of floating capacitors to grounded capacitors. The following example demonstrates this principle.

Did you know?

The Miller effect was discovered by John Miller in 1919. In his original paper, Miller observes that "the apparent input capacity can become a number of times greater than the actual capacities between the tube electrodes." (Back then, capacitance and capacitor were called "capacity" and "condensor," respectively.) A curious effect with respect to Miller multiplication is that, if the amplifier gain is positive and greater than unity, then we obtain a negative input capacitance, $\left(1-A_{v}\right) C_{F}$. Does this happen? Yes, indeed. Shown below is a circuit realizing a negative capacitance. Since the gain from $V_{i n 1}$ to $V_{Y}$ (and from $V_{i n 2}$ to $V_{X}$ ) is positive, $C_{F}$ can be multiplied by a negative number. This technique is used in many high-speed circuits to partially cancel the effect of undesired (positive) capacitances.

Solution Noting that $M_{1}$ and $R_{D}$ constitute an inverting amplifier having a gain of $-g_{m} R_{D}$, we utilize the results in Fig. 11.14(b) to write:

$$
\begin{align*}
C_{i n} & =\left(1+A_{0}\right) C_{F}  \tag{11.29}\\
& =\left(1+g_{m} R_{D}\right) C_{F} \tag{11.30}
\end{align*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{equation*}
C_{\text {out }}=\left(1+\frac{1}{g_{m} R_{D}}\right) C_{F}, \tag{11.31}
\end{equation*}
$$

thereby arriving at the topology depicted in Fig. 11.15(b). From our study in Example 11.8, we have:

$$
\begin{align*}
\omega_{\text {in }} & =\frac{1}{R_{S} C_{i n}}  \tag{11.32}\\
& =\frac{1}{R_{S}\left(1+g_{m} R_{D}\right) C_{F}} \tag{11.33}
\end{align*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{align*}
\omega_{\text {out }} & =\frac{1}{R_{D} C_{\text {out }}}  \tag{11.34}\\
& =\frac{1}{R_{D}\left(1+\frac{1}{g_{m} R_{D}}\right) C_{F}} . \tag{11.35}
\end{align*}
$$

Why does the circuit in (a) have one pole but that in (b) two? This is explained below.
Exercise Calculate $C_{i n}$ if $g_{m}=(150 \Omega)^{-1}, R_{D}=2 \mathrm{k} \Omega$, and $C_{F}=80 \mathrm{fF}$.

The reader may find the above example somewhat inconsistent. Miller's theorem requires that the floating impedance and the voltage gain be computed at the same frequency whereas Example 11.10 uses the low-frequency gain, $g_{m} R_{D}$, even for the purpose of finding high-frequency poles. After all, we know that the existence of $C_{F}$ lowers the voltage gain from the gate of $M_{1}$ to the output at high frequencies. Owing to this inconsistency, we call the procedure in Example 11.10 the "Miller approximation." Without this approximation, i.e., if $A_{0}$ is expressed in terms of circuit parameters at the frequency of interest, application of Miller's theorem would be no simpler than direct solution of the circuit's equations. Due to the approximation, the circuit in the above example exhibits two poles.

Another artifact of Miller's approximation is that it may eliminate a zero of the transfer function. We return to this issue in Section 11.4.3.

The general expression in Eq. (11.22) can be interpreted as follows: an impedance tied between the input and output of an inverting amplifier with a gain of $A_{v}$ is lowered by a factor of $1+A_{v}$ if seen at the input (with respect to ground). This reduction of impedance (hence increase in capacitance) is called "Miller effect." For example, we say Miller effect raises the input capacitance of the circuit in Fig. 11.15(a) to $\left(1+g_{m} R_{D}\right) C_{F}$.

### 11.1.6 General Frequency Response

Our foregoing study indicates that capacitances in a circuit tend to lower the voltage gain at high frequencies. It is possible that capacitors reduce the gain at low frequencies as well. As a simple example, consider the high-pass filter shown in Fig. 11.16(a), where the voltage
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_fa3a663eee928a6916c6g-51.jpg?height=795&width=2052&top_left_y=4232&top_left_x=1337)

Figure 11.16 (a) Simple high-pass filter, and (b) its frequency response.
division between $C_{1}$ and $R_{1}$ yields

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{V_{\text {out }}}{V_{\text {in }}}(s) & =\frac{R_{1}}{R_{1}+\frac{1}{C_{1} s}}  \tag{11.36}\\
& =\frac{R_{1} C_{1} s}{R_{1} C_{1} s+1} \tag{11.37}
\end{align*}
$$

and hence

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|\frac{V_{\text {out }}}{V_{\text {in }}}\right|=\frac{R_{1} C_{1} \omega}{\sqrt{R_{1}^{2} C_{1}^{2} \omega_{1}^{2}+1}} \tag{11.38}
\end{equation*}
$$

Plotted in Fig. 11.16(b), the response exhibits a roll-off as the frequency of operation falls below $1 /\left(R_{1} C_{1}\right)$. As seen from Eq. (11.37), this roll-off arises because the zero of the transfer function occurs at the origin.

The low-frequency roll-off may prove undesirable. The following example illustrates this point.

Example
11.11

Figure 11.17 depicts a source follower used in a high-quality audio amplifier. Here, $R_{i}$ establishes a gate bias voltage equal to $V_{D D}$ for $M_{1}$, and $I_{1}$ defines the drain bias current. Assume $\lambda=0, g_{m}=1 /(200 \Omega)$, and $R_{1}=100 \mathrm{k} \Omega$. Determine the minimum required value of $C_{1}$ and the maximum tolerable value of $C_{L}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_fa3a663eee928a6916c6g-52.jpg?height=754&width=954&top_left_y=2768&top_left_x=1989)

Figure 11.17
Solution Similar to the high-pass filter of Fig. 11.16, the input network consisting of $R_{i}$ and $C_{i}$ attenuates the signal at low frequencies. To ensure that audio components as low as 20 Hz experience a small attenuation, we set the corner frequency $1 /\left(R_{i} C_{i}\right)$ to $2 \pi \times(20 \mathrm{~Hz})$, thus obtaining

$$
\begin{equation*}
C_{i}=79.6 \mathrm{nF} \tag{11.39}
\end{equation*}
$$

This value is, of course, much too large to be integrated on a chip. Since Eq. (11.38) reveals a 3 dB attenuation at $\omega=1 /\left(R_{i} C_{i}\right)$, in practice we must choose even a larger capacitor if a lower attenuation is desired.

The load capacitance creates a pole at the output node, lowering the gain at high frequencies. Setting the pole frequency to the upper end of the audio range, 20 kHz , and recognizing that the resistance seen from the output node to ground is equal to $1 / g_{m}$, we have

$$
\begin{align*}
\omega_{p, \text { out }} & =\frac{g_{m}}{C_{L}}  \tag{11.40}\\
& =2 \pi \times(20 \mathrm{kHz}) \tag{11.41}
\end{align*}
$$

and hence

$$
\begin{equation*}
C_{L}=39.8 \mathrm{nF} \tag{11.42}
\end{equation*}
$$

An efficient driver, the source follower can tolerate a very large load capacitance (for the audio band).

Exercise $\quad$ Repeat the above example if $I_{1}$ and the width of $M_{1}$ are halved.

Why did we use capacitor $C_{i}$ in the above example? Without $C_{i}$, the circuit's gain would not fall at low frequencies, and we would not need perform the above calculations. Called a "coupling" capacitor, $C_{i}$ allows the signal frequencies of interest to pass through the circuit while blocking the dc content of $V_{i n}$. In other words, $C_{i}$ isolates the bias conditions of the source follower from those of the preceding stage. Figure 11.18(a) illustrates an example in which a CS stage precedes the source follower. The coupling capacitor permits independent bias voltages at nodes $X$ and $Y$. For example, $V_{Y}$ can be chosen relatively low (placing $M_{2}$ near the triode region) to allow a large drop across $R_{D}$, thereby maximizing the voltage gain of the CS stage (why?).

(b)

Figure 11.18 Cascade of CS stage and source follower with (a) capacitor coupling and (b) direct coupling.

To convince the reader that capacitive coupling proves essential in Fig. 11.18(a), we consider the case of "direct coupling" [Fig. 11.18(b)] as well. Here, to maximize the voltage gain, we wish to set $V_{P}$ just above $V_{G S 2}-V_{T H 2}$, e.g., 200 mV . On the other hand, the gate of $M_{2}$ must reside at a voltage of at least $V_{G S 1}+V_{I 1}$, where $V_{I 1}$ denotes the minimum voltage required by $I_{1}$. Since $V_{G S 1}+V_{I 1}$ may reach $600-700 \mathrm{mV}$, the two stages are quite incompatible in terms of their bias points, necessitating capacitive coupling.

Capacitive coupling (also called "ac coupling") is more common in discrete circuit design due to the large capacitor values required in many applications (e.g., $C_{i}$ in the above audio example). Nonetheless, many integrated circuits also employ capacitive coupling, especially at low supply voltages, if the necessary capacitor values are no more than a few picofarads.

Figure 11.19 shows a typical frequency response and the terminology used to refer to its various attributes. We call $\omega_{L}$ the lower corner or lower "cut-off" frequency and $\omega_{H}$ the upper corner or upper cut-off frequency. Chosen to accommodate the signal frequencies of interest, the band between $\omega_{L}$ and $\omega_{H}$ is called the "midband range" and the corresponding gain the "midband gain."

## 11.2 HIGH-FREQUENCY MODELS OF TRANSISTORS

The speed of many circuits is limited by the capacitances within each transistor. It is therefore necessary to study these capacitances carefully.

### 11.2.1 High-Frequency Model of Bipolar Transistor

Recall from Chapter 4 that the bipolar transistor consists of two pn junctions. The depletion region associated with the junctions ${ }^{6}$ gives rise to a capacitance between base and emitter, denoted by $C_{j e}$, and another between base and collector, denoted by $C_{\mu}$ [Fig. 11.20(a)]. We may then add these capacitances to the small-signal model to arrive at the representation shown in Fig. 11.20(b).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_fa3a663eee928a6916c6g-54.jpg?height=1776&width=2215&top_left_y=2457&top_left_x=1250)

Figure 11.20 (a) Structure of bipolar transistor showing junction capacitances, (b) small-signal model with junction capacitances, (c) complete model accounting for base charge.

Unfortunately, this model is incomplete because the base-emitter junction exhibits another effect that must be taken into account. As explained in Chapter 4, the operation of the transistor requires a (nonuniform) charge profile in the base region to allow the

[^8]diffusion of carriers toward the collector. In other words, if the transistor is suddenly turned on, proper operation does not begin until enough charge carriers enter the base region and accumulate so as to create the necessary profile. Similarly, if the transistor is suddenly turned off, the charge carriers stored in the base must be removed for the collector current to drop to zero.

The above phenomenon is quite similar to charging and discharging a capacitor: to change the collector current, we must change the base charge profile by injecting or removing some electrons or holes. Modeled by a second capacitor between the base and emitter, $C_{b}$, this effect is typically more significant than the depletion region capacitance. Since $C_{b}$ and $C_{j e}$ appear in parallel, they are lumped into one and denoted by $C_{\pi}$ [Fig. 11.20(c)].

In integrated circuits, the bipolar transistor is fabricated atop a grounded substrate [Fig. 11.21(a)]. The collector-substrate junction remains reverse-biased (why?), exhibiting a junction capacitance denoted by $C_{C S}$. The complete model is depicted in Fig. 11.21(b). We hereafter employ this model in our analysis. In modern integrated-circuit bipolar transistors, $C_{j e}, C_{\mu}$, and $C_{C S}$ are on the order of a few femtofarads for the smallest allowable devices.

In the analysis of frequency response, it is often helpful to first draw the transistor capacitances on the circuit diagram, simplify the result, and then construct the small-signal equivalent circuit. We may therefore represent the transistor as shown in Fig. 11.21(c).

Identify all of the capacitances in the circuit shown in Fig. 11.22(a).

Solution From Fig. 11.21(b), we add the three capacitances of each transistor as depicted in Fig. 11.22(b). Interestingly, $C_{C S 1}$ and $C_{\pi 2}$ appear in parallel, and so do $C_{\mu 2}$ and $C_{C S 2}$.

Exercise Construct the small-signal equivalent circuit of the above cascode.

### 11.2.2 High-Frequency Model of MOSFET

Our study of the MOSFET structure in Chapter 6 revealed several capacitive components. We now study these capacitances in the device in greater detail.

Illustrated in Fig. 11.23(a), the MOSFET displays three prominent capacitances: one between the gate and the channel (called the "gate oxide capacitance" and given by $W L C_{o x}$ ), and two associated with the reverse-biased source-bulk and drain-bulk junctions. The first component presents a modeling difficulty because the transistor model does not contain a "channel." We must therefore decompose this capacitance into one between the gate and the source and another between the gate and the drain [Fig. 11.23(b)]. The exact partitioning of this capacitance is beyond the scope of this book, but, in the saturation region, $C_{1}$ is about $2 / 3$ of the gate-channel capacitance whereas $C_{2} \approx 0$.

Two other capacitances in the MOSFET become critical in some circuits. Shown in Fig. 11.24, these components arise from both the physical overlap of the gate with source/drain areas ${ }^{7}$ and the fringe field lines between the edge of the gate and the top of the S/D regions. Called the gate-drain or gate-source "overlap" capacitance, this (symmetric) effect persists even if the MOSFET is off.

Figure 11.24 Overlap capacitance between gate and drain (or source).
We now construct the high-frequency model of the MOSFET. Depicted in Fig. 11.25(a), this representation consists of: (1) the capacitance between the gate and source, $C_{G S}$ (including the overlap component); (2) the capacitance between the gate and drain (including the overlap component); (3) the junction capacitances between the source and bulk and the drain and bulk, $C_{S B}$ and $C_{D B}$, respectively. (We assume the bulk remains at ac ground.)

The circuit therefore reduces to that in Fig. 11.26(c).

Exercise
Noting that $M_{2}$ is a diode-connected device, construct the small-signal equivalent circuit of the amplifier.

### 11.2.3 Transit Frequency

With various capacitances surrounding bipolar and MOS devices, is it possible to define a quantity that represents the ultimate speed of the transistor? Such a quantity would prove useful in comparing different types or generations of transistors as well as in predicting the performance of circuits incorporating the devices.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_fa3a663eee928a6916c6g-58.jpg?height=589&width=2136&top_left_y=630&top_left_x=1392)

Figure 11.27 Conceptual setup for measurement of $f_{T}$ of transistors.
A measure of the intrinsic speed of transistors ${ }^{8}$ is the "transit" or "cut-off" frequency, $f_{T}$, defined as the frequency at which the small-signal current gain of the device falls to unity. Illustrated in Fig. 11.27 (without the biasing circuitry), the idea is to inject a sinusoidal current into the base or gate and measure the resulting collector or drain current while the input frequency, $f_{i n}$, is increased. We note that, as $f_{i n}$ increases, the input capacitance of the device lowers the input impedance, $Z_{i n}$, and hence the input voltage $V_{i n}=I_{i n} Z_{i n}$ and the output current. We neglect $C_{\mu}$ and $C_{G D}$ here (but take them into account in Problem 11.26). For the bipolar device in Fig. 11.27(a),

$$
\begin{equation*}
Z_{i n}=\frac{1}{C_{\pi} s} \| r_{\pi} \tag{11.43}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since $I_{\text {out }}=g_{m} I_{\text {in }} Z_{\text {in }}$,

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{I_{\text {out }}}{I_{\text {in }}} & =\frac{g_{m} r_{\pi}}{r_{\pi} C_{\pi} s+1}  \tag{11.44}\\
& =\frac{\beta}{r_{\pi} C_{\pi} s+1} . \tag{11.45}
\end{align*}
$$

At the transit frequency, $\omega_{T}\left(=2 \pi f_{T}\right)$, the magnitude of the current gain falls to unity:

$$
\begin{align*}
r_{\pi}^{2} C_{\pi}^{2} \omega_{T}^{2} & =\beta^{2}-1  \tag{11.46}\\
& \approx \beta^{2} . \tag{11.47}
\end{align*}
$$

That is,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\omega_{T} \approx \frac{g_{m}}{C_{\pi}} \tag{11.48}
\end{equation*}
$$

The transit frequency of MOSFETs is obtained in a similar fashion. We therefore write:

$$
\begin{equation*}
2 \pi f_{T} \approx \frac{g_{m}}{C_{\pi}} \quad \text { or } \quad \frac{g_{m}}{C_{G S}} . \tag{11.49}
\end{equation*}
$$

Note that the collector-substrate or drain-bulk capacitance does not affect $f_{T}$ owing to the ac ground established at the output.

Modern bipolar and MOS transistors boast $f_{T}$ 's above 100 GHz . Of course, the speed of complex circuits using such devices is quite lower.

The minimum channel length of MOSFETs has been scaled from $1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in the late 1980s 11.14 to 65 nm today. Also, the inevitable reduction of the supply voltage has reduced the gate-source overdive voltage from about 400 mV to 100 mV . By what factor has the $f_{T}$ of MOSFETs increased?
${ }^{8}$ By "intrinsic" speed, we mean the performance of the device by itself, without any other limitations imposed or enhancements provided by the circuit.

Solution It can proved (Problem 11.28) that

$$
\begin{equation*}
2 \pi f_{T}=\frac{3}{2} \frac{\mu_{n}}{L^{2}}\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\right) \tag{11.50}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus, the transit frequency has increased by approximately a factor of 59. For example, if $\mu_{n}=400 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} /(\mathrm{V} \cdot \mathrm{s})$, then 65 nm devices having an overdrive of 100 mV exhibit an $f_{T}$ of 226 GHz .

Exercise
Determine the $f_{T}$ if the channel length is scaled down to 45 nm but the mobility degrades to $300 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} /(\mathrm{V} \cdot \mathrm{s})$.

Did you know?

If the $f_{T}$ of 65 nm MOSFETs is around 220 GHz , is it possible to operate such a device at a higher frequency? Yes, indeed. The key is to use inductors to cancel the effect of capacitors. Suppose as shown in Fig. (a), we place inductor $L_{1}$ in parallel with $C_{G S}$. (Realized as a metal spiral on the chip, the inductor has some resistance, $R_{S \text {.) }}$ At the resonance frequency, $\omega_{0}=1 / \sqrt{L_{1} C_{G S}}$, the parallel combination reduces to a single resistor, almost as if $M_{1}$ had no gate-source capacitance! For this reason, the use of on-chip inductors has become common in high-frequency design. Figure (b) shows the chip photograph of a 300 GHz oscillator designed by the author in 65 nm technology. Such high frequencies find application in medical imaging.

## 11.3 ANALYSIS PROCEDURE

We have thus far seen a number of concepts and tools that help us study the frequency response of circuits. Specifically, we have observed that:

- The frequency response refers to the magnitude of the transfer function of a system. ${ }^{9}$
- Bode's approximation simplifies the task of plotting the frequency response if the poles and zeros are known.

[^10]- In many cases, it is possible to associate a pole with each node in the signal path.
- Miller's theorem proves helpful in decomposing floating capacitors into grounded elements.
- Bipolar and MOS devices exhibit various capacitances that limit the speed of circuits.

In order to methodically analyze the frequency response of various circuits, we prescribe the following steps:

1. Determine which capacitors impact the low-frequency region of the response and compute the low-frequency cut-off. In this calculation, the transistor capacitances can be neglected as they typically impact only the high-frequency region.
2. Calculate the midband gain by replacing the above capacitors with short circuits while still neglecting the transistor capacitances.
3. Identify and add to the circuit the capacitances contributed by each transistor.
4. Noting ac grounds (e.g., the supply voltage or constant bias voltages), merge the capacitors that are in parallel and omit those that play no role in the circuit.
5. Determine the high-frequency poles and zeros by inspection or by computing the transfer function. Miller's theorem may prove useful here.
6. Plot the frequency response using Bode's rules or exact calculations.

We now apply this procedure to various amplifier topologies.

## 11.4 FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF CE AND CS STAGES

### 11.4.1 Low-Frequency Response

As mentioned in Section 11.1.6, the gain of amplifiers may fall at low frequencies due to certain capacitors in the signal path. Let us consider a general CS stage with its input bias network and an input coupling capacitor [Fig. 11.28(a)]. At low frequencies, the transistor capacitances negligibly affect the frequency response, leaving only $C_{i}$ as the frequency-dependent component. We write $V_{\text {out }} / V_{\text {in }}=\left(V_{\text {out }} / V_{X}\right)\left(V_{X} / V_{\text {in }}\right)$, neglect channellength modulation, and note that both $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ are tied between $X$ and ac ground. Thus, $V_{\text {out }} / V_{X}=-R_{D} /\left(R_{S}+1 / g_{m}\right)$ and

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{V_{X}}{V_{i n}}(s) & =\frac{R_{1} \| R_{2}}{R_{1} \| R_{2}+\frac{1}{C_{i} s}}  \tag{11.51}\\
& =\frac{\left(R_{1} \| R_{2}\right) C_{i} s}{\left(R_{1} \| R_{2}\right) C_{i} s+1} . \tag{11.52}
\end{align*}
$$

Similar to the high-pass filter of Fig. 11.16, this network attenuates the low frequencies, dictating that the lower cut-off be chosen below the lowest signal frequency, $f_{\text {sig,min }}$ (e.g., 20 Hz in audio applications):

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{2 \pi\left[\left(R_{1} \| R_{2}\right) C_{i}\right]}<f_{\text {sig,min }} \tag{11.53}
\end{equation*}
$$

In applications demanding a greater midband gain, we place a "bypass" capacitor in parallel with $R_{S}$ [Fig. 11.28(b)] so as to remove the effect of degeneration at midband frequencies. To quantify the role of $C_{b}$, we place its impedance, $1 /\left(C_{b} s\right)$, in parallel with $R_{S}$

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{V_{\text {out }}}{V_{X}}(s) & =\frac{-R_{D}}{R_{S} \| \frac{1}{C_{b} s}+\frac{1}{g_{m}}}  \tag{11.54}\\
& =\frac{-g_{m} R_{D}\left(R_{S} C_{b} s+1\right)}{R_{S} C_{b} s+g_{m} R_{S}+1} \tag{11.55}
\end{align*}
$$

Figure 11.28(c) shows the Bode plot of the frequency response in this case. At frequencies well below the zero, the stage operates as a degenerated CS amplifier, and at frequencies well above the pole, the circuit experiences no degeneration. Thus, the pole frequency must be chosen significantly smaller than the lowest signal frequency of interest.

The above analysis can also be applied to a CE stage. Both types exhibit low-frequency roll-off due to the input coupling capacitor and the degeneration bypass capacitor.

### 11.4.2 High-Frequency Response

Consider the CE and CS amplifiers shown in Fig. 11.29(a), where $R_{S}$ may represent the output impedance of the preceding stage, i.e., it is not added deliberately. Identifying the capacitances of $Q_{1}$ and $M_{1}$, we arrive at the complete circuits depicted in Fig. 11.29(b), where the source-bulk capacitance of $M_{1}$ is grounded on both ends. The small-signal equivalents of these circuits differ by only $r_{\pi}$ [Fig. 11.29(c)], ${ }^{10}$ and can be reduced to one if $V_{i n}, R_{S}$ and $r_{\pi}$ are replaced with their Thevenin equivalent [Fig. 11.29(d)]. In practice, $R_{S} \ll r_{\pi}$ and hence $R_{\text {Thev }} \approx R_{S}$. Note that the output resistance of each transistor would simply appear in parallel with $R_{L}$.

With this unified model, we now study the high-frequency response, first applying Miller's approximation to develop insight and then performing an accurate analysis to arrive at more general results.

### 11.4.3 Use of Miller's Theorem

With $C_{X Y}$ tied between two floating nodes, we cannot simply associate one pole with each node. However, following Miller's approximation as in Example 11.10, we can decompose

& C_{Y}=\left(1+\frac{1}{g_{m} R_{L}}\right) C_{X Y} \tag{11.57}
\end{align*}
$$

\end{aligned}
$$

Figure 11.30 Parameters in unified model of CE and CS stages with Miller's approximation.

Now, each node sees a resistance and capacitances only to ground. In accordance with our notations in Section 11.1, we write

$$
\begin{align*}
& \left|\omega_{p, \text { in }}\right|=\frac{1}{R_{\text {Thev }}\left[C_{\text {in }}+\left(1+g_{m} R_{L}\right) C_{X Y}\right]}  \tag{11.58}\\
& \left|\omega_{p, \text { out }}\right|=\frac{1}{R_{L}\left[C_{\text {out }}+\left(1+\frac{1}{g_{m} R_{L}}\right) C_{X Y}\right]}
\end{align*}
$$

If $g_{m} R_{L} \gg 1$, the capacitance at the output node is simply equal to $C_{o u t}+C_{X Y}$.
The intuition gained from the application of Miller's theorem proves invaluable. The input pole is approximately given by the source resistance, the base-emitter or gate-source capacitance, and the Miller multiplication of the base-collector or gate-drain capacitance. The Miller multiplication makes it undesirable to have a high gain in the circuit. The output pole is roughly determined by the load resistance, the collector-substrate or drain-bulk capacitance, and the base-collector or gate-drain capacitance.

Example In the CE stage of Fig. 11.29(a), $R_{S}=200 \Omega, I_{C}=1 \mathrm{~mA}, \beta=100, C_{\pi}=100 \mathrm{fF}, C_{\mu}=$ 11.15 20 fF , and $C_{C S}=30 \mathrm{fF}$.
(a) Calculate the input and output poles if $R_{L}=2 \mathrm{k} \Omega$. Which node appears as the speed bottleneck (limits the bandwidth)?
(b) Is it possible to choose $R_{L}$ such that the output pole limits the bandwidth?

Solution (a) Since $r_{\pi}=2.6 \mathrm{k} \Omega$, we have $R_{\text {Thev }}=186 \Omega$. Fig. 11.30 and Eqs. (11.58) and (11.59) thus give

$$
\begin{align*}
\left|\omega_{p, \text { in }}\right| & =2 \pi \times(516 \mathrm{MHz})  \tag{11.60}\\
\left|\omega_{p, \text { out }}\right| & =2 \pi \times(1.59 \mathrm{GHz}) . \tag{11.61}
\end{align*}
$$

We observe that the Miller effect multiplies $C_{\mu}$ by a factor of 78 , making its contribution much greater than that of $C_{\pi}$. As a result, the input pole limits the bandwidth.
(b) We must seek such a value of $R_{L}$ that yields $\left|\omega_{p, \text { in }}\right|>\omega_{p, \text { out }} \mid$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{\left(R_{S} \| r_{\pi}\right)\left[C_{\pi}+\left(1+g_{m} R_{L}\right) C_{\mu}\right]}>\frac{1}{R_{L}\left[C_{C S}+\left(1+\frac{1}{g_{m} R_{L}}\right) C_{\mu}\right]} . \tag{11.62}
\end{equation*}
$$

If $g_{m} R_{L} \gg 1$, then we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left[C_{C S}+C_{\mu}-g_{m}\left(R_{S} \| r_{\pi}\right) C_{\mu}\right] R_{L}>\left(R_{S} \| r_{\pi}\right) C_{\pi} \tag{11.63}
\end{equation*}
$$

With the values assumed in this example, the left-hand side is negative, implying that no solution exists. The reader can prove that this holds even if $g_{m} R_{L}$ is not much greater than unity. Thus, the input pole remains the speed bottleneck here.

Exercise Repeat the above example if $I_{C}=2 \mathrm{~mA}$ and $C_{\pi}=180 \mathrm{fF}$.

Example An electrical engineering student designs the CS stage of Fig. 11.29(a) for a certain low11.16 frequency gain and high-frequency response. Unfortunately, in the layout phase, the student uses a MOSFET half as wide as that in the original design. Assuming that the bias current is also halved, determine the gain and the poles of the circuit.

Solution Both the width and the bias current of the transistor are halved, and so is its transconductance (why?). The small-signal gain, $g_{m} R_{L}$, is therefore halved.

Reducing the transistor width by a factor of two also lowers all of the capacitances by the same factor. From Fig. 11.30 and Eqs. (11.58) and (11.59), we can express the poles as

$$
\begin{align*}
\left|\omega_{p, \text { in }}\right| & =\frac{1}{R_{S}\left[\frac{C_{\text {in }}}{2}+\left(1+\frac{g_{m} R_{L}}{2}\right) \frac{C_{X Y}}{2}\right]}  \tag{11.64}\\
\left|\omega_{p, \text { out }}\right| & =\frac{1}{R_{L}\left[\frac{C_{\text {out }}}{2}+\left(1+\frac{2}{g_{m} R_{L}}\right) \frac{C_{X Y}}{2}\right]} \tag{11.65}
\end{align*}
$$

where $C_{i n}, g_{m}, C_{X Y}$ and $C_{\text {out }}$ denote the parameters corresponding to the original device width. We observe that $\omega_{p, i n}$ has risen in magnitude by more than a factor of two, and $\omega_{p, \text { out }}$ by approximately a factor of two (if $g_{m} R_{L} \gg 2$ ). In other words, the gain is halved and the bandwidth is roughly doubled, suggesting that the gain-bandwidth product is approximately constant.

What happens if both the width and the bias current are twice their nominal values?

### 11.4.4 Direct Analysis

The use of Miller's theorem in the previous section provides a quick and intuitive perspective on the performance. However, we must carry out a more accurate analysis so as to understand the limitations of Miller's approximation in this case.

The circuit of Fig. 11.29(d) contains two nodes and can therefore be solved by writing two KCLs. That is, ${ }^{11}$

$$
\begin{align*}
& \text { At Node } X:\left(V_{\text {out }}-V_{X}\right) C_{X Y} s=V_{X} C_{\text {in }} s+\frac{V_{X}-V_{\text {Thev }}}{R_{\text {Thev }}}  \tag{11.66}\\
& \text { At Node } Y:\left(V_{X}-V_{\text {out }}\right) C_{X Y} s=g_{m} V_{X}+V_{\text {out }}\left(\frac{1}{R_{L}}+C_{\text {out }} s\right)
\end{align*}
$$

We compute $V_{X}$ from Eq. (11.67):

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{X}=V_{\text {out }} \frac{C_{X Y} s+\frac{1}{R_{L}}+C_{\text {out }} s}{C_{X Y} s-g_{m}} \tag{11.68}
\end{equation*}
$$

[^1]and substitute the result in Eq. (11.66) to arrive at
\$\$

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text {out }} C_{X Y} s-\left(C_{X Y} s+C_{\text {in }} s+\frac{1}{R_{\text {Thev }}}\right) \frac{C_{X Y} s+\frac{1}{R_{L}}+C_{\text {out }} s}{C_{X Y} s-g_{m}} V_{\text {out }}=\frac{-V_{\text {Thev }}}{R_{\text {Thev }}} \tag{11.69}
\end{equation*}
$$

\$\$

It follows that

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{V_{\text {out }}}{V_{\text {Thev }}}(s)=\frac{\left(C_{X Y} s-g_{m}\right) R_{L}}{a s^{2}+b s+1} \tag{11.70}
\end{equation*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{align*}
& a=R_{\text {Thev }} R_{L}\left(C_{\text {in }} C_{X Y}+C_{\text {out }} C_{X Y}+C_{\text {in }} C_{\text {out }}\right)  \tag{11.71}\\
& b=\left(1+g_{m} R_{L}\right) C_{X Y} R_{\text {Thev }}+R_{\text {Thev }} C_{\text {in }}+R_{L}\left(C_{X Y}+C_{\text {out }}\right) \tag{11.72}
\end{align*}
$$

Note from Fig. 11.30 that for a CE stage, Eq. (11.70) must be multiplied by $r_{\pi} /\left(R_{S}+r_{\pi}\right)$ to obtain $V_{\text {out }} / V_{\text {in }}$ —without affecting the location of the poles and the zero.

Let us examine the above results carefully. The transfer function exhibits a zero at

$$
\begin{equation*}
\omega_{z}=\frac{g_{m}}{C_{X Y}} \tag{11.73}
\end{equation*}
$$

(The Miller approximation fails to predict this zero.) Since $C_{X Y}$ (i.e., the base-collector or the gate-drain overlap capacitance) is relatively small, the zero typically appears at very high frequencies and hence is unimportant. ${ }^{12}$

As expected, the system contains two poles given by the values of $s$ that force the denominator to zero. We can solve the quadratic $a s^{2}+b s+1=0$ to determine the poles but the results provide little insight. Instead, we first make an interesting observation in regard to the quadratic denominator: if the poles are given by $\omega_{p 1}$ and $\omega_{p 2}$, we can write

$$
\begin{align*}
a s^{2}+b s+1 & =\left(\frac{s}{\omega_{p 1}}+1\right)\left(\frac{s}{\omega_{p 2}}+1\right)  \tag{11.74}\\
& =\frac{s^{2}}{\omega_{p 1} \omega_{p 2}}+\left(\frac{1}{\omega_{p 1}}+\frac{1}{\omega_{p 2}}\right) s+1 \tag{11.75}
\end{align*}
$$

Now suppose one pole is much farther from the origin than the other: $\omega_{p 2} \gg \omega_{p 1}$. (This is called the "dominant pole" approximation to emphasize that $\omega_{p 1}$ dominates the frequency response). Then, $\omega_{p 1}^{-1}+\omega_{p 2}^{-1} \approx \omega_{p 1}^{-1}$, i.e.,

$$
\begin{equation*}
b=\frac{1}{\omega_{p 1}} \tag{11.76}
\end{equation*}
$$

and from Eq. (11.72),

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|\omega_{p 1}\right|=\frac{1}{\left(1+g_{m} R_{L}\right) C_{X Y} R_{\text {Thev }}+R_{\text {Thev }} C_{\text {in }}+R_{L}\left(C_{X Y}+C_{\text {out }}\right)} \tag{11.77}
\end{equation*}
$$

How does this result compare with that obtained using the Miller approximation? Equation (11.77) does reveal the Miller effect of $C_{X Y}$ but it also contains the additional term $R_{L}\left(C_{X Y}+C_{\text {out }}\right)$ [which is close to the output time constant predicted by Eq. (11.59)].

[^2]To determine the "nondominant" pole, $\omega_{p 2}$, we recognize from Eqs. (11.75) and (11.76) that

$$
\begin{align*}
\left|\omega_{p 2}\right| & =\frac{b}{a}  \tag{11.78}\\
& =\frac{\left(1+g_{m} R_{L}\right) C_{X Y} R_{\text {Thev }}+R_{\text {Thev }} C_{\text {in }}+R_{L}\left(C_{X Y}+C_{\text {out }}\right)}{R_{\text {Thev }} R_{L}\left(C_{\text {in }} C_{X Y}+C_{\text {out }} C_{X Y}+C_{\text {in }} C_{\text {out }}\right)} . \tag{11.79}
\end{align*}
$$

Example Using the dominant-pole approximation, compute the poles of the circuit shown in Fig. 11.17 11.31(a). Assume both transistors operate in saturation and $\lambda \neq 0$.

Solution Noting that $C_{S B 1}, C_{G S 2}$, and $C_{S B 2}$ do not affect the circuit (why?), we add the remaining capacitances as depicted in Fig. 11.31(b), simplifying the result as illustrated in Fig. 11.31(c), where

$$
\begin{align*}
C_{\text {in }} & =C_{G S 1}  \tag{11.80}\\
C_{X Y} & =C_{G D 1}  \tag{11.81}\\
C_{\text {out }} & =C_{D B 1}+C_{G D 2}+C_{D B 2} \tag{11.82}
\end{align*}
$$

It follows from Eqs. (11.77) and (11.79) that

$$
\begin{align*}
& \omega_{p 1} \approx \frac{1}{\left[1+g_{m 1}\left(r_{O 1} \| r_{O 2}\right)\right] C_{X Y} R_{S}+R_{S} C_{\text {in }}+\left(r_{O 1} \| r_{O 2}\right)\left(C_{X Y}+C_{\text {out }}\right)}  \tag{11.83}\\
& \omega_{p 2} \approx \frac{\left[1+g_{m 1}\left(r_{O 1} \| r_{O 2}\right)\right] C_{X Y} R_{S}+R_{S} C_{\text {in }}+\left(r_{O 1} \| r_{O 2}\right)\left(C_{X Y}+C_{\text {out }}\right)}{R_{S}\left(r_{O 1} \| r_{O 2}\right)\left(C_{\text {in }} C_{X Y}+C_{\text {out }} C_{X Y}+C_{\text {in }} C_{\text {out }}\right)} \tag{11.84}
\end{align*}
$$

Exercise Repeat the above example if $\lambda \neq 0$.

Example In the CS stage of Fig. 11.29(a), we have $R_{S}=200 \Omega, C_{G S}=250 \mathrm{fF}, C_{G D}=80 \mathrm{fF}$, 11.18 $C_{D B}=100 \mathrm{fF}, g_{m}=(150 \Omega)^{-1}, \lambda=0$, and $R_{L}=2 \mathrm{k} \Omega$. Plot the frequency response with the aid of (a) Miller's approximation, (b) the exact transfer function, (c) the dominantpole approximation.

Solution (a) With $g_{m} R_{L}=13.3$, Eqs. (11.58) and (11.59) yield

$$
\begin{align*}
\left|\omega_{p, \text { in }}\right| & =2 \pi \times(571 \mathrm{MHz})  \tag{11.85}\\
\left|\omega_{p, \text { out }}\right| & =2 \pi \times(428 \mathrm{MHz}) \tag{11.86}
\end{align*}
$$

(b) The transfer function in Eq. (11.70) gives a zero at $g_{m} / C_{G D}=2 \pi \times(13.3 \mathrm{GHz})$. Also, $a=2.12 \times 10^{-20} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}$ and $b=6.39 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{~s}$. Thus,

$$
\begin{align*}
& \left|\omega_{p 1}\right|=2 \pi \times(264 \mathrm{MHz})  \tag{11.87}\\
& \left|\omega_{p 2}\right|=2 \pi \times(4.53 \mathrm{GHz}) \tag{11.88}
\end{align*}
$$

Note the large error in the values predicted by Miller's approximation. This error arises because we have multiplied $C_{G D}$ by the midband gain $\left(1+g_{m} R_{L}\right)$ rather than the gain at high frequencies. ${ }^{13}$
(c) The results obtained in part (b) predict that the dominant-pole approximation produces relatively accurate results as the two poles are quite far apart. From Eqs. (11.77) and (11.79), we have

$$
\begin{align*}
& \left|\omega_{p 1}\right|=2 \pi \times(249 \mathrm{MHz})  \tag{11.89}\\
& \left|\omega_{p 2}\right|=2 \pi \times(4.79 \mathrm{GHz}) \tag{11.90}
\end{align*}
$$

Figure 11.32 plots the results. The low-frequency gain is equal to $22 \mathrm{~dB} \approx 13$ and the -3 dB bandwidth predicted by the exact equation is around 250 MHz .

Figure 11.33 Input impedance of (a) CE and (b) CS stages.
the frequency response and particularly the Miller approximation readily yields this impedance.

As illustrated in Fig. 11.33(a), the input impedance of a CE stage consists of two parallel components: $C_{\pi}+\left(1+g_{m} R_{D}\right) C_{\mu}$ and $r_{\pi} \cdot{ }^{14}$ That is,

$$
\begin{equation*}
Z_{i n} \approx \frac{1}{\left[C_{\pi}+\left(1+g_{m} R_{D}\right) C_{\mu}\right] s} \| r_{\pi} \tag{11.91}
\end{equation*}
$$

Similarly, the MOS counterpart exhibits an input impedance given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
Z_{i n} \approx \frac{1}{\left[C_{G S}+\left(1+g_{m} R_{D}\right) C_{G D}\right] s} \tag{11.92}
\end{equation*}
$$

With a high voltage gain, the Miller effect may substantially lower the input impedance at high frequencies.

Did you know?

Most RF receivers incorporate a common-source or common-emitter amplifier at their front end. This "low-noise" amplifier must present an input resistance of $50 \Omega$ so as to "match" the impedance of the antenna [Fig. (a)]. But how could a CS stage have such a low input resistance? A clever technique is to add an inductor in series with the source of the transistor [Fig. (b)]. It can be shown that the input impedance is given by

$$
Z_{i n}(s)=\frac{1}{C_{G S S}}+L_{15}+\frac{L_{1} g_{m}}{C_{G S}}
$$

Note that the last term is a real quantity, reprsenting a resistance. Proper choice of $L_{1}, g_{m}$, and $C_{G S}$ provides a value of $50 \Omega$. Next time you turn on your cell phone or your GPS, you may be receiving an RF signal through an inductively-degenerated CS amplifier.

## 11.5 FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF CB AND CG STAGES

### 11.5.1 Low-Frequency Response

As with CE and CS stages, the use of capacitive coupling leads to low-frequency roll-off in CB and CG amplifiers. Consider the CB circuit depicted in Fig. 11.34(a), where $I_{1}$ defines the bias current of $Q_{1}$ and $V_{b}$ is chosen to ensure operation in the forward active region ( $V_{b}$ is less than the collector bias voltage). How large should $C_{i}$ be? Since $C_{i}$ appears in series with $R_{S}$, we replace $R_{S}$ with $R_{S}+\left(C_{i} s\right)^{-1}$ in the midband gain expression, $R_{C} /\left(R_{S}+1 / g_{m}\right)$, and write the resulting transfer function as

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{V_{\text {out }}}{V_{\text {in }}}(s) & =\frac{R_{C}}{R_{S}+\left(C_{i} s\right)^{-1}+1 / g_{m}}  \tag{11.93}\\
& =\frac{g_{m} R_{C} C_{i} s}{\left(1+g_{m} R_{S}\right) C_{i} s+g_{m}} \tag{11.94}
\end{align*}
$$

Equation (11.93) implies that the signal does not "feel" the effect of $C_{i}$ if $\left|\left(C_{i} s\right)^{-1}\right| \ll$ $R_{S}+1 / g_{m}$. From another perspective, Eq. (11.94) yields the response shown in Fig. 11.34(b), revealing a pole at

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|\omega_{p}\right|=\frac{g_{m}}{\left(1+g_{m} R_{S}\right) C_{i}} \tag{11.95}
\end{equation*}
$$

and suggesting that this pole must remain quite lower than the minimum signal frequency of interest. These two conditions are equivalent.

### 11.5.2 High-Frequency Response

We know from Chapters 5 and 7 that CB and CG stages exhibit a relatively low input impedance $\left(\approx 1 / g_{m}\right)$. The high-frequency response of these circuits does not suffer from Miller effect, an important advantage in some cases.

Consider the stages shown in Fig. 11.35, where $r_{O}=\infty$ and the transistor capacitances are included. Since $V_{b}$ is at ac ground, we note that (1) $C_{\pi}$ and $C_{G S}+C_{S B}$ go to ground; (2) $C_{C S}$ and $C_{\mu}$ of $Q_{1}$ appear in parallel to ground, and so do $C_{G D}$ and $C_{D B}$ of $M_{1}$; (3) no capacitance appears between the input and output networks, avoiding the Miller effect. In fact, with all of the capacitances seeing ground at one of their terminals, we can readily associate one pole with each node. At node $X$, the total resistance seen to ground is given

by $R_{S} \|\left(1 / g_{m}\right)$, yielding

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|\omega_{p, X}\right|=\frac{1}{\left(R_{S} \| \frac{1}{g_{m}}\right) C_{X}} \tag{11.96}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $C_{X}=C_{\pi}$ or $C_{G S}+C_{S B}$. Similarly, at $Y$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|\omega_{p, Y}\right|=\frac{1}{R_{L} C_{Y}} \tag{11.97}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $C_{Y}=C_{\mu}+C_{C S}$ or $C_{G D}+C_{D B}$.
It is interesting to note that the "input" pole magnitude is on the order of the $f_{T}$ of the transistor: $C_{X}$ is equal to $C_{\pi}$ or roughly equal to $C_{G S}$ while the resistance seen to ground is less than $1 / g_{m}$. For this reason, the input pole of the $\mathrm{CB} / \mathrm{CG}$ stage rarely creates a speed bottleneck. ${ }^{15}$

Figure 11.36
Solution Noting that $C_{G D 2}$ and $C_{S B 2}$ play no role in the circuit, we add the device capacitances as depicted in Fig. 11.36(b). The input pole is thus given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|\omega_{p, X}\right|=\frac{1}{\left(R_{S} \| \frac{1}{g_{m 1}}\right)\left(C_{S B 1}+C_{G D 1}\right)} \tag{11.98}
\end{equation*}
$$

[^5]Since the small-signal resistance at the output node is equal to $1 / g_{m 2}$, we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|\omega_{p, Y}\right|=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{g_{m 2}}\left(C_{D B 1}+C_{G D 1}+C_{G S 2}+C_{D B 2}\right)} \tag{11.99}
\end{equation*}
$$

Exercise Repeat the above example if $M_{2}$ operates as a current source, i.e., its gate is connected to a constant voltage.

Example The CS stage of Example 11.18 is reconfigured to a common-gate amplifier (with $R_{S}$ tied 11.20 to the source of the transistor). Plot the frequency response of the circuit.

Solution With the values given in Example 11.18 and noting that $C_{S B}=C_{D B},{ }^{16}$ we obtain from Eqs. (11.96) and (11.97),

$$
\begin{align*}
& \left|\omega_{p, \text { in }}\right|=2 \pi \times(5.31 \mathrm{GHz})  \tag{11.100}\\
& \left|\omega_{p, \text { out }}\right|=2 \pi \times(442 \mathrm{MHz}) \tag{11.101}
\end{align*}
$$

With no Miller effect, the input pole has dramatically risen in magnitude. The output pole, however, limits the bandwidth. Also, the low-frequency gain is now equal to $R_{D} /\left(R_{S}+1 / g_{m}\right)=5.7$, more than a factor of two lower than that of the CS stage. Figure 11.37 plots the result. The low-frequency gain is equal to $15 \mathrm{~dB} \approx 5.7$ and the -3 dB bandwidth is around 450 MHz .

## 11.6 FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF FOLLOWERS

The low-frequency response of followers is similar to that studied in Example 11.11 and that of CE/CS stages. We thus study the high-frequency behavior here.

In Chapters 5 and 7, we noted that emitter and source followers provide a high input impedance and a relatively low output impedance while suffering from a sub-unity (positive) voltage gain. Emitter followers, and occasionally source followers, are utilized as buffers and their frequency characteristics are of interest.

Figure 11.38 illustrates the stages with relevant capacitances. The emitter follower is loaded with $C_{L}$ to create both a more general case and greater similarity between the bipolar and MOS counterparts. We observe that each circuit contains two grounded capacitors and one floating capacitor. While the latter may be decomposed using Miller's approximation, the resulting analysis is beyond the scope of this book. We therefore perform a direct analysis by writing the circuit's equations. Since the bipolar and MOS versions in Fig. 11.38 differ by only $r_{\pi}$, we first analyze the emitter follower and subsequently let $r_{\pi}$ (or $\beta$ ) approach infinity to obtain the transfer function of the source follower.

Figure 11.38 (a) Emitter follower and (b) source follower including transistor capacitances.

Consider the small-signal equivalent shown in Fig. 11.39. Recognizing that $V_{X}=$ $V_{\text {out }}+V_{\pi}$ and the current through the parallel combination of $r_{\pi}$ and $C_{\pi}$ is given by $V_{\pi} / r_{\pi}+V_{\pi} C_{\pi} s$, we write a KCL at node $X$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{V_{\text {out }}+V_{\pi}-V_{\text {in }}}{R_{S}}+\left(V_{\text {out }}+V_{\pi}\right) C_{\mu} s+\frac{V_{\pi}}{r_{\pi}}+V_{\pi} C_{\pi} s=0 \tag{11.102}
\end{equation*}
$$

and another at the output node:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{V_{\pi}}{r_{\pi}}+V_{\pi} C_{\pi} s+g_{m} V_{\pi}=V_{o u t} C_{L} s \tag{11.103}
\end{equation*}
$$

Figure 11.39 Small-signal equivalent of emitter follower.

The latter gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{\pi}=\frac{V_{\text {out }} C_{L} s}{\frac{1}{r_{\pi}}+g_{m}+C_{\pi} s} \tag{11.104}
\end{equation*}
$$

which, upon substitution in Eq. (11.102) and with the assumption $r_{\pi} \gg g_{m}^{-1}$, leads to

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{V_{\text {out }}}{V_{\text {in }}}=\frac{1+\frac{C_{\pi}}{g_{m}} s}{a s^{2}+b s+1} \tag{11.105}
\end{equation*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{align*}
a & =\frac{R_{S}}{g_{m}}\left(C_{\mu} C_{\pi}+C_{\mu} C_{L}+C_{\pi} C_{L}\right)  \tag{11.106}\\
b & =R_{S} C_{\mu}+\frac{C_{\pi}}{g_{m}}+\left(1+\frac{R_{S}}{r_{\pi}}\right) \frac{C_{L}}{g_{m}} \tag{11.107}
\end{align*}
$$

The circuit thus exhibits a zero at

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|\omega_{z}\right|=\frac{g_{m}}{C_{\pi}} \tag{11.108}
\end{equation*}
$$

which, from Eq. (11.49), is near the $f_{T}$ of the transistor. The poles of the circuit can be computed using the dominant-pole approximation described in Section 11.4.4. In practice, however, the two poles do not fall far from each other, necessitating direct solution of the quadratic denominator.

The above results also apply to the source follower if $r_{\pi} \rightarrow \infty$ and corresponding capacitance substitutions are made ( $C_{S B}$ and $C_{L}$ are in parallel):

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{V_{\text {out }}}{V_{\text {in }}}=\frac{1+\frac{C_{G S}}{g_{m}} s}{a s^{2}+b s+1}, \tag{11.109}
\end{equation*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{align*}
a & =\frac{R_{S}}{g_{m}}\left[C_{G D} C_{G S}+C_{G D}\left(C_{S B}+C_{L}\right)+C_{G S}\left(C_{S B}+C_{L}\right)\right]  \tag{11.110}\\
b & =R_{S} C_{G D}+\frac{C_{G D}+C_{S B}+C_{L}}{g_{m}} \tag{11.111}
\end{align*}
$$

Example A source follower is driven by a resistance of $200 \Omega$ and drives a load capacitance of 11.21 100 fF . Using the transistor parameters given in Example 11.18, plot the frequency response of the circuit.

Solution The zero occurs at $g_{m} / C_{G S}=2 \pi \times(4.24 \mathrm{GHz})$. To compute the poles, we obtain $a$ and $b$ from Eqs. (11.110) and (11.111), respectively:

$$
\begin{align*}
& a=2.58 \times 10^{-21} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}  \tag{11.112}\\
& b=5.8 \times 10^{-11} \mathrm{~s} . \tag{11.113}
\end{align*}
$$

The two poles are then equal to

$$
\begin{align*}
& \omega_{p 1}=2 \pi[-1.79 \mathrm{GHz}+j(2.57 \mathrm{GHz})]  \tag{11.114}\\
& \omega_{p 2}=2 \pi[-1.79 \mathrm{GHz}-j(2.57 \mathrm{GHz})] \tag{11.115}
\end{align*}
$$

Solution Noting that $C_{G S 2}$ and $C_{S B 2}$ play no role in the circuit, we include the transistor capacitances as illustrated in Fig. 11.41(b). The result resembles that in Fig. 11.38, but with $C_{G D 2}$ and
$C_{D B 2}$ appearing in parallel with $C_{S B 1}$. Thus, Eq. (11.109) can be rewritten as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{V_{\text {out }}}{V_{\text {in }}}(s)=\frac{1+\frac{C_{G S 1}}{g_{m 1}} s}{a s^{2}+b s+1} \tag{11.116}

b & =R_{S} C_{G D 1}+\frac{C_{G D 1}+C_{S B 1}+C_{G D 2}+C_{D B 2}}{g_{m 1}} \tag{11.118}
\end{align*}
$$

Exercise Assuming $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ are identical and using the transistor parameters given in Example 11.18, calculate the pole frequencies.

### 11.6.1 Input and Output Impedances

In Chapter 5, we observed that the input resistance of the emitter follower is given by $r_{\pi}+(\beta+1) R_{L}$, where $R_{L}$ denotes the load resistance. Also, in Chapter 7 , we noted that the source follower input resistance approaches infinity at low frequencies. We now employ an approximate but intuitive analysis to obtain the input capacitance of followers.

Consider the circuits shown in Fig. 11.42, where $C_{\pi}$ and $C_{G S}$ appear between the input and output and can therefore be decomposed using Miller's theorem. Since the low-frequency gain is equal to

$$
\begin{equation*}
A_{v}=\frac{R_{L}}{R_{L}+\frac{1}{g_{m}}} \tag{11.119}
\end{equation*}
$$

we note that the "input" component of $C_{\pi}$ or $C_{G S}$ is expressed as

$$
\begin{align*}
C_{X} & =\left(1-A_{v}\right) C_{X Y}  \tag{11.120}\\
& =\frac{1}{1+g_{m} R_{L}} C_{X Y} . \tag{11.121}
\end{align*}
$$

Interestingly, the input capacitance of the follower contains only a fraction of $C_{\pi}$ or $C_{G S}$, depending on how large $g_{m} R_{L}$ is. Of course, $C_{\mu}$ or $C_{G D}$ directly adds to this value to yield the total input capacitance.

Figure 11.43

Solution From Chapter 7, the low-frequency gain of the circuit can be written as

$$
\begin{equation*}
A_{v}=\frac{r_{O 1} \| r_{O 2}}{r_{O 1} \| r_{O 2}+\frac{1}{g_{m 1}}} \tag{11.122}
\end{equation*}
$$

Also, from Fig. 11.42(b), the capacitance appearing between the input and output is equal to $C_{G S 1}$, thereby providing

$$
\begin{align*}
C_{i n} & =C_{G D 1}+\left(1-A_{v}\right) C_{G S 1}  \tag{11.123}\\
& =C_{G D 1}+\frac{1}{1+g_{m 1}\left(r_{O 1} \| r_{O 2}\right)} C_{G S 1} . \tag{11.124}
\end{align*}
$$

For example, if $g_{m 1}\left(r_{O 1} \| r_{O 2}\right) \approx 10$, then only $9 \%$ of $C_{G S 1}$ appears at the input.
Exercise Repeat the above example if $\lambda=0$.

Let us now turn our attention to the output impedance of followers. Our study of the emitter follower in Chapter 5 revealed that the output resistance is equal to $R_{S} /(\beta+1)+1 / g_{m}$. Similarly, Chapter 7 indicated an output resistance of $1 / g_{m}$ for the source follower. At high frequencies, these circuits display an interesting behavior.

Consider the followers depicted in Fig. 11.44(a), where other capacitances and resistances are neglected for the sake of simplicity. As usual, $R_{S}$ represents the output resistance of a preceding stage or device. We first compute the output impedance of the emitter follower and subsequently let $r_{\pi} \rightarrow \infty$ to determine that of the source follower. From the
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_9ec87a8d4dad7fdd2420g-16.jpg?height=823&width=2815&top_left_y=4138&top_left_x=1047)

Figure 11.44 (a) Output impedance of emitter and source followers, (b) small-signal model.
equivalent circuit in Fig. 11.44(b), we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left(I_{X}+g_{m} V_{\pi}\right)\left(r_{\pi} \| \frac{1}{C_{\pi} s}\right)=-V_{\pi} \tag{11.125}
\end{equation*}
$$

and also

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left(I_{X}+g_{m} V_{\pi}\right) R_{S}-V_{\pi}=V_{X} . \tag{11.126}
\end{equation*}
$$

Finding $V_{\pi}$ from Eq. (11.125)

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{\pi}=-I_{X} \frac{r_{\pi}}{r_{\pi} C_{\pi} s+\beta+1} \tag{11.127}
\end{equation*}
$$

and substituting in Eq. (11.126), we obtain

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{V_{X}}{I_{X}}=\frac{R_{S} r_{\pi} C_{\pi} s+r_{\pi}+R_{S}}{r_{\pi} C_{\pi} s+\beta+1} . \tag{11.128}
\end{equation*}
$$

As expected, at low frequencies $V_{X} / I_{X}=\left(r_{\pi}+R_{S}\right) /(\beta+1) \approx 1 / g_{m}+R_{S} /(\beta+1)$. On the other hand, at very high frequencies, $V_{X} / I_{X}=R_{S}$, a meaningful result considering that $C_{\pi}$ becomes a short circuit.

The two extreme values calculated above for the output impedance of the emitter follower can be used to develop greater insight. Plotted in Fig. 11.45, the magnitude of this impedance falls with $\omega$ if $R_{S}<1 / g_{m}+R_{S} /(\beta+1)$ or rises with $\omega$ if $R_{S}>1 / g_{m}+R_{S} /(\beta+1)$. In analogy with the impedance of capacitors and inductors, we say $Z_{\text {out }}$ exhibits a capacitive behavior in the former case and an inductive behavior in the latter.

Figure 11.45 Output impedance of emitter follower as a function of frequency for (a) small $R_{S}$ and (b) large $R_{S}$.

Which case is more likely to occur in practice? Since a follower serves to reduce the driving impedance, it is reasonable to assume that the follower low-frequency output impedance is lower than $R_{S} .{ }^{17}$ Thus, the inductive behavior is more commonly encountered. (It is even possible that the inductive output impedance leads to oscillation if the follower sees a certain amount of load capacitance.)

The above development can be extended to source followers by factoring $r_{\pi}$ from the numerator and denominator of Eq. (11.128) and letting $r_{\pi}$ and $\beta$ approach infinity:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{V_{X}}{I_{X}}=\frac{R_{S} C_{G S} s+1}{C_{G S} s+g_{m}} \tag{11.129}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $(\beta+1) / r_{\pi}$ is replaced with $g_{m}$, and $C_{\pi}$ with $C_{G D}$. The plots of Fig. 11.45 are redrawn for the source follower in Fig. 11.46, displaying a similar behavior.

## 11.7 FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF CASCODE STAGE

Our analysis of the CE/CS stage in Section 11.4 and the CB/CG stage in Section 11.5 reveals that the former provides a relatively high input resistance but suffers from Miller effect whereas the latter exhibits a relatively low input resistance but is free from Miller effect. We wish to combine the desirable properties of the two topologies, obtaining a circuit with a relatively high input resistance and no or little Miller effect. Indeed, this thought process led to the invention of the cascode topology in the 1940s.

Consider the cascodes shown in Fig. 11.48. As mentioned in Chapter 9, this structure can be viewed as a CE/CS transistor, $Q_{1}$ or $M_{1}$, followed by a CB/CG device, $Q_{2}$ or $M_{2}$. As

Figure 11.48 (a) Bipolar and (b) MOS cascode stages.

Did you know?

In addition to reducing Miller multiplication of $C_{\mu}$ or $C_{G D}$, the cascode structure provides a higher output impedance, a higher voltage gain, and greater stability. By stability, we mean the tendency of the amplifier not to oscillate. Since $C_{\mu}$ or $C_{G D}$ returns a fraction of the output signal to the input, it can cause instability in highfrequency amplifiers. For this reason, we commonly use the cascode topology at the front end of RF receivers, often with inductive degeneration as shown below.

Use of cascode in a cellphone low-noise amplifier.
such, the circuit still exhibits a relatively high (for $Q_{1}$ ) or infinite (for $M_{1}$ ) input resistance while providing a voltage gain equal to $g_{m 1} R_{L} \cdot{ }^{18}$ But, how about the Miller multiplication of $C_{\mu 1}$ or $C_{G D 1}$ ? We must first compute the voltage gain from node $X$ to node $Y$. Assuming $r_{O}=\infty$ for all transistors, we recognize that the impedance seen at $Y$ is equal to $1 / g_{m 2}$, yielding a smallsignal gain of

$$
\begin{align*}
A_{v, X Y} & =\frac{v_{Y}}{v_{X}}  \tag{11.131}\\
& =-\frac{g_{m 1}}{g_{m 2}} . \tag{11.132}
\end{align*}
$$

In the bipolar cascode, $g_{m 1}=g_{m 2}$ (why?), resulting in a gain of -1 . In the MOS counterpart, $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ need not be identical, but $g_{m 1}$ and $g_{m 2}$ are comparable because of their relatively weak dependence upon $W / L$. We therefore say the gain from $X$ to $Y$ remains near -1 in most practical cases, concluding that the Miller effect of $C_{X Y}=C_{\mu 1}$ or $C_{G D 1}$ is given by

$$
\begin{align*}
C_{X} & =\left(1-A_{v, X Y}\right) C_{X Y}  \tag{11.133}\\
& \approx 2 C_{X Y} . \tag{11.134}
\end{align*}
$$

This result stands in contrast to that expressed by Eq. (11.56), suggesting that the cascode transistor breaks the trade-off between the gain and the input capacitance due to Miller effect.

Let us continue our analysis and estimate the poles of the cascode topology with the aid of Miller's approximation. Illustrated in Fig. 11.49 is the bipolar cascode along with the transistor capacitances. Note that the effect of $C_{\mu 1}$ at $Y$ is also equal to $\left(1-A_{v, X Y}^{-1}\right) C_{\mu 1}=2 C_{\mu 1}$.

Figure 11.49 Bipolar cascode including transistor capacitances.
Associating one pole with each node gives

$$
\begin{align*}
\left|\omega_{p, X}\right| & =\frac{1}{\left(R_{S} \| r_{\pi 1}\right)\left(C_{\pi 1}+2 C_{\mu 1}\right)}  \tag{11.135}\\
\left|\omega_{p, Y}\right| & =\frac{1}{\frac{1}{g_{m 2}}\left(C_{C S 1}+C_{\pi 2}+2 C_{\mu 1}\right)}  \tag{11.136}\\
\left|\omega_{p, \text { out }}\right| & =\frac{1}{R_{L}\left(C_{C S 2}+C_{\mu 2}\right)} \tag{11.137}
\end{align*}
$$

It is interesting to note that the pole at node $Y$ falls near the $f_{T}$ of $Q_{2}$ if $C_{\pi 2} \gg C_{C S 1}+2 C_{\mu 1}$. Even for comparable values of $C_{\pi 2}$ and $C_{C S 1}+2 C_{\mu 1}$, we can say this pole is on the order of $f_{T} / 2$, a frequency typically much higher than the signal bandwidth. For this reason, the pole at node $Y$ often has negligible effect on the frequency response of the cascode stage.

The MOS cascode is shown in Fig. 11.50 along with its capacitances after the use of Miller's approximation. Since the gain from $X$ to $Y$ in this case may not be equal to -1 , we use the actual value, $-g_{m 1} / g_{m 2}$, to arrive at a more general solution. Associating one pole with each node, we have

$$
\begin{align*}
\left|\omega_{p, X}\right| & =\frac{1}{R_{S}\left[C_{G S 1}+\left(1+\frac{g_{m 1}}{g_{m 2}}\right) C_{G D 1}\right]}  \tag{11.138}\\
\left|\omega_{p, Y}\right| & =\frac{1}{\frac{1}{g_{m 2}}\left[C_{D B 1}+C_{G S 2}+\left(1+\frac{g_{m 2}}{g_{m 1}}\right) C_{G D 1}+C_{S B 2}\right]}  \tag{11.139}\\
\left|\omega_{p, \text { out }}\right| & =\frac{1}{R_{L}\left(C_{D B 2}+C_{G D 2}\right)} \tag{11.140}
\end{align*}
$$

Figure 11.50 MOS cascode including transistor capacitances.

We note that $\omega_{p, Y}$ is still in the range of $f_{T} / 2$ if $C_{G S 2}$ and $C_{D B 1}+\left(1+g_{m 2} / g_{m 1}\right) C_{G D 1}$ are comparable.

Example The CS stage studied in Example 11.18 is converted to a cascode topology. Assuming 11.25 the two transistors are identical, estimate the poles, plot the frequency response, and compare the results with those of Example 11.18. Assume $C_{D B}=C_{S B}$.

Solution Using the values given in Example 11.18, we write from Eqs. (11.138), (11.139), and (11.140):

$$
\begin{align*}
\left|\omega_{p, X}\right| & =2 \pi \times(1.95 \mathrm{GHz})  \tag{11.141}\\
\left|\omega_{p, Y}\right| & =2 \pi \times(1.73 \mathrm{GHz})  \tag{11.142}\\
\left|\omega_{p, \text { out }}\right| & =2 \pi \times(442 \mathrm{MHz}) \tag{11.143}
\end{align*}
$$

Note that the pole at node $Y$ is significantly lower than $f_{T} / 2$ in this particular example. Compared with the Miller approximation results obtained in Example 11.18, the input pole has risen considerably. Compared with the exact values derived in that example, the cascode bandwidth ( 442 MHz ) is nearly twice as large. Figure 11.51 plots the frequency response of the cascode stage.

Figure 11.51
Exercise Repeat the above example if the width of $M_{2}$ and hence all of its capacitances are doubled. Assume $g_{m 2}=(100 \Omega)^{-1}$.

In the cascode shown in Fig. 11.52, transistor $M_{3}$ serves as a constant current source, 11.26 allowing $M_{1}$ to carry a larger current than $M_{2}$. Estimate the poles of the circuit, assuming $\lambda=0$.

Solution Transistor $M_{3}$ contributes $C_{G D 3}$ and $C_{D B 3}$ to node $Y$, thus lowering the corresponding pole magnitude. The circuit contains the following poles:

$$
\begin{align*}
\left|\omega_{p, X}\right| & =\frac{1}{R_{S}\left[C_{G S 1}+\left(1+\frac{g_{m 1}}{g_{m 2}}\right) C_{G D 1}\right]}  \tag{11.144}\\
\left|\omega_{p, Y}\right| & =\frac{1}{\frac{1}{g_{m 2}}\left[C_{D B 1}+C_{G S 2}+\left(1+\frac{g_{m 2}}{g_{m 1}}\right) C_{G D 1}+C_{G D 3}+C_{D B 3}+C_{S B 2}\right]}  \tag{11.145}\\
\left|\omega_{p, \text { out }}\right| & =\frac{1}{R_{L}\left(C_{D B 2}+C_{G D 2}\right)} . \tag{11.146}
\end{align*}
$$

Note that $\omega_{p, X}$ also reduces in magnitude because the addition of $M_{3}$ lowers $I_{D 2}$ and hence $g_{m 2}$.

Figure 11.52
Exercise Calculate the pole frequencies in the above example using the transistor parameters given in Example 11.18 for $M_{1}-M_{3}$.

From our studies of the cascode topology in Chapter 9 and in this chapter, we identify two important, distinct attributes of this circuit: (1) the ability to provide a high output impedance and hence serve as a good current source and/or high-gain amplifier; (2) the reduction of the Miller effect and hence better high-frequency performance. Both of these properties are exploited extensively.

### 11.7.1 Input and Output Impedances

The foregoing analysis of the cascode stage readily provides estimates for the I/O impedances. From Fig. 11.49, the input impedance of the bipolar cascode is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
Z_{i n}=r_{\pi 1} \| \frac{1}{\left(C_{\pi 1}+2 C_{\mu 1}\right) s}, \tag{11.147}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $Z_{\text {in }}$ does not include $R_{S}$. The output impedance is equal to

$$
\begin{equation*}
Z_{\text {out }}=R_{L} \| \frac{1}{\left(C_{\mu 2}+C_{C S 2}\right) s}, \tag{11.148}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the Early effect is neglected. Similarly, for the MOS stage shown in Fig. 11.50, we have

$$
\begin{align*}
Z_{\text {in }} & =\frac{1}{\left[C_{G S 1}+\left(1+\frac{g_{m 1}}{g_{m 2}}\right) C_{G D 1}\right] s}  \tag{11.149}\\
Z_{\text {out }} & =\frac{1}{R_{L}\left(C_{G D 2}+C_{D B 2}\right)} \tag{11.150}
\end{align*}
$$

where it is assumed $\lambda=0$.
If $R_{L}$ is large, the output resistance of the transistors must be taken into account. This calculation is beyond the scope of this book.

## 11.8 FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF DIFFERENTIAL PAIRS

The half-circuit concept introduced in Chapter 10 can also be applied to the high-frequency model of differential pairs, thus reducing the circuit to those studied above.

Figure 11.53(a) depicts two bipolar and MOS differential pairs along with their capacitances. For small differential inputs, the half circuits can be constructed as shown in
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_9ec87a8d4dad7fdd2420g-23.jpg?height=2095&width=2934&top_left_y=2834&top_left_x=879)

Figure 11.53 (a) Bipolar and MOS differential pairs including transistor capacitances, (b) half circuits.

Fig. 11.53(b). The transfer function is therefore given by Eq. (11.70):

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{V_{\text {out }}}{V_{\text {Thev }}}(s)=\frac{\left(C_{X Y} s-g_{m}\right) R_{L}}{a s^{2}+b s+1} \tag{11.151}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the same notation is used for various parameters. Similarly, the input and output impedances (from each node to ground) are equal to those in Eqs. (11.91) and (11.92), respectively.

Example A differential pair employs cascode devices to lower the Miller effect [Fig. 11.54(a)]. 11.27 Estimate the poles of the circuit.

\left|\omega_{p, Y}\right| & =\frac{1}{\frac{1}{g_{m 3}}\left[C_{D B 1}+C_{G S 3}+\left(1+\frac{g_{m 3}}{g_{m 1}}\right) C_{G D 1}+C_{S B 3}\right]}  \tag{11.153}\\

### 11.8.1 Common-Mode Frequency Response*

The CM response studied in Chapter 10 included no transistor capacitances. At high frequencies, capacitances may raise the CM gain (and lower the differential gain), thus degrading the common-mode rejection ratio.

Let us consider the MOS differential pair shown in Fig. 11.55(a), where a finite capacitance appears between node $P$ and ground. Since $C_{S S}$ shunts $R_{S S}$, we expect the total impedance between $P$ and ground to fall at high frequencies, leading to a higher CM gain. In fact, we can simply replace $R_{S S}$ with $R_{S S} \|\left[1 /\left(C_{S S} s\right)\right]$ in Eq. (10.186):

$$
\begin{align*}
\left|\frac{\Delta V_{\text {out }}}{\Delta V_{C M}}\right| & =\frac{\Delta R_{D}}{\frac{1}{g_{m}}+2\left(R_{S S} \| \frac{1}{C_{S S} s}\right)}  \tag{11.155}\\
& =\frac{g_{m} \Delta R_{D}\left(R_{S S} C_{S S}+1\right)}{R_{S S} C_{S S} s+2 g_{m} R_{S S}+1} \tag{11.156}
\end{align*}
$$

Since $R_{S S}$ is typically quite large, $2 g_{m} R_{S S} \gg 1$, yielding the following zero and pole frequencies:

$$
\begin{align*}
& \left|\omega_{z}\right|=\frac{1}{R_{S S} C_{S S}}  \tag{11.157}\\
& \left|\omega_{p}\right|=\frac{2 g_{m}}{C_{S S}} \tag{11.158}
\end{align*}
$$

and the Bode approximation plotted in Fig. 11.55(b). The CM gain indeed rises dramatically at high frequencies-by a factor of $2 g_{m} R_{S S}$ (why?).

Figure 11.56 depicts the transistor capacitances that constitute $C_{S S}$. For example, $M_{3}$ is typically a wide device so that it can operate with a small $V_{D S}$, thereby adding large capacitances to node $P$.

## 11.9 ADDITIONAL EXAMPLES

Example The amplifier shown in Fig. 11.57(a) incorporates capacitive coupling both at the input
11.28 and between the two stages. Determine the low-frequency cut-off of the circuit. Assume $I_{S}=5 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{~A}, \beta=100$, and $V_{A}=\infty$.

(c)

Figure 11.57

Solution We must first compute the operating point and small-signal parameters of the circuit. From Chapter 5, we begin with an estimate of for $V_{B E 1}$, e.g., 800 mV , and express the base current of $Q_{1}$ as $\left(V_{C C}-V_{B E 1}\right) / R_{B 1}$ and hence

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{C 1} & =\beta \frac{V_{C C}-V_{B E 1}}{R_{B 1}}  \tag{11.159}\\
& =1.7 \mathrm{~mA} \tag{11.160}
\end{align*}
$$

It follows that $V_{B E 1}=V_{T} \ln \left(I_{C 1} / I_{S 1}\right)=748 \mathrm{mV}$ and $I_{C 1}=1.75 \mathrm{~mA}$. Thus, $g_{m 1}=$ $(14.9 \Omega)^{-1}$ and $r_{\pi 1}=1.49 \mathrm{k} \Omega$. For $Q_{2}$, we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{C C}=I_{B 2} R_{B 2}+V_{B E 2}+R_{E} I_{C 2} \tag{11.161}
\end{equation*}
$$

and therefore

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{C 2} & =\frac{V_{C C}-V_{B E 2}}{R_{B 2} / \beta+R_{E}}  \tag{11.162}\\
& =1.13 \mathrm{~mA} \tag{11.163}
\end{align*}
$$

where it is assumed $V_{B E 2} \approx 800 \mathrm{mV}$. Iteration yields $I_{C 2}=1.17 \mathrm{~mA}$. Thus, $g_{m 2}=$ $(22.2 \Omega)^{-1}$ and $r_{\pi 2}=2.22 \mathrm{k} \Omega$.

Let us now consider the first stage by itself. Capacitor $C_{1}$ forms a high-pass filter along with the input resistance of the circuit, $R_{i n 1}$, thus attenuating low frequencies. Since $R_{i n 1}=r_{\pi 2} \| R_{B 1}$, the low-frequency cut-off of this stage is equal to

$$
\begin{align*}
\omega_{L 1} & =\frac{1}{\left(r_{\pi 1} \| R_{B 1}\right) C_{1}}  \tag{11.164}\\
& =2 \pi \times(542 \mathrm{~Hz}) \tag{11.165}
\end{align*}
$$

The second coupling capacitor also creates a high-pass response along with the input resistance of the second stage, $R_{i n 2}=R_{B 2} \|\left[r_{\pi 2}+(\beta+1) R_{E}\right]$. To compute the cut-off frequency, we construct the simplified interface shown in Fig. 11.57(b) and determine $V_{Y} / I_{1}$. In this case, it is simpler to replace $I_{1}$ and $R_{C}$ with a Thevenin equivalent, Fig. 11.57(c), where $V_{\text {Thev }}=-I_{1} R_{C}$. We now have
obtaining a pole at

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{V_{Y}}{V_{T h e v}}(s)=\frac{R_{i n 2}}{R_{C}+\frac{1}{C_{2} s}+R_{i n 2}} \tag{11.166}
\end{equation*}
$$

obtaining a pole at

$$
\begin{align*}
\omega_{L 2} & =\frac{1}{\left(R_{C}+R_{i n 2}\right) C_{2}}  \tag{11.167}\\
& =\pi \times(22.9 \mathrm{~Hz}) \tag{11.168}
\end{align*}
$$

Since $\omega_{L 2} \ll \omega_{L 1}$, we conclude that $\omega_{L 1}$ "dominates" the low-frequency response, i.e., the gain drops by 3 dB at $\omega_{L 1}$.

Exercise Repeat the above example if $R_{E}=500 \Omega$.

Example 11.29

The circuit of Fig. 11.58(a) is an example of amplifiers realized in integrated circuits. It consists of a degenerated stage and a self-biased stage, with moderate values for

Figure 11.58
$C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$. Assuming $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ are identical and have the same parameters as those given in Example 11.18, plot the frequency response of the amplifier.

Solution
Low-Frequency Behavior We begin with the low-frequency region and first consider the role of $C_{1}$. From Eq. (11.55) and Fig. 11.28(c), we note that $C_{1}$ contributes a lowfrequency cut-off at

$$
\begin{align*}
\omega_{L 1} & =\frac{g_{m 1} R_{S 1}+1}{R_{S 1} C_{1}}  \tag{11.169}\\
& =2 \pi \times(37.1 \mathrm{MHz}) \tag{11.170}
\end{align*}
$$

A second low-frequency cut-off is contributed by $C_{2}$ and the input resistance of the second stage, $R_{i n 2}$. This resistance can be calculated with the aid of Miller's theorem:

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{i n 2}=\frac{R_{F}}{1-A_{v 2}} \tag{11.171}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $A_{v 2}$ denotes the voltage gain from $X$ to the output. Since $R_{F} \gg R_{D 2}$, we have $A_{v 2} \approx-g_{m 2} R_{D 2}=-6.67,{ }^{19}$ obtaining $R_{i n 2}=1.30 \mathrm{k} \Omega$. Using an analysis similar to that in the previous example, the reader can show that

$$
\begin{align*}
\omega_{L 2} & =\frac{1}{\left(R_{D 1}+R_{\text {in } 2}\right) C_{2}}  \tag{11.172}\\
& =2 \pi \times(6.92 \mathrm{MHz}) \tag{11.173}
\end{align*}
$$

Since $\omega_{L 1}$ remains well above $\omega_{L 2}$, the cut-off is dominated by the former.

Midband Behavior In the next step, we compute the midband gain. At midband frequencies, $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ act as a short circuit and the transistor capacitances play a negligible role, allowing the circuit to be reduced to that in Fig. 11.58(b). We note that $v_{\text {out }} / v_{\text {in }}=\left(v_{X} / v_{\text {in }}\right)\left(v_{\text {out }} / v_{X}\right)$ and recognize that the drain of $M_{1}$ sees two resistances to ac ground: $R_{D 1}$ and $R_{\text {in } 2}$. That is,

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{v_{X}}{v_{i n}} & =-g_{m 1}\left(R_{D 1} \| R_{i n 2}\right)  \tag{11.174}\\
& =-3.77 \tag{11.175}
\end{align*}
$$

The voltage gain from node $X$ to the output is approximately equal to $-g_{m 2} R_{D 2}$ because $R_{F} \gg R_{D 2}{ }^{20}$ The overall midband gain is therefore roughly equal to 25.1 .

High-Frequency Behavior To study the response of the amplifier at high frequencies, we insert the transistor capacitances, noting that $C_{S B 1}$ and $C_{S B 2}$ play no role because the source terminals of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ are at ac ground. We thus arrive at the simplified topology shown in Fig. 11.58(c), where the overall transfer function is given by $V_{\text {out }} / V_{\text {in }}=\left(V_{X} / V_{\text {in }}\right)\left(V_{\text {out }} / V_{X}\right)$.

[^10]How do we compute $V_{X} / V_{\text {in }}$ in the presence of the loading of the second stage? The two capacitances $C_{D B 1}$ and $C_{G S 2}$ are in parallel, but how about the effect of $R_{F}$ and $C_{G D 2}$ ? We apply Miller's approximation to both components so as to convert them to grounded elements. The Miller effect of $R_{F}$ was calculated above to be equivalent to $R_{\text {in } 2}=1.3 \mathrm{k} \Omega$. The Miller multiplication of $C_{G D 2}$ is given by $\left(1-A_{v 2}\right) C_{G D 2}=614 \mathrm{fF}$. The first stage can now be drawn as illustrated in Fig. 11.58(d), lending itself to the CS analysis performed in Section 11.4. The zero is given by $g_{m 1} / C_{G D 1}=2 \pi \times(13.3 \mathrm{GHz})$. The two poles can be calculated from Eqs. (11.70), (11.71), and (11.72):

$$
\begin{align*}
& \left|\omega_{p 1}\right|=2 \pi \times(242 \mathrm{MHz})  \tag{11.176}\\
& \left|\omega_{p 2}\right|=2 \pi \times(2.74 \mathrm{GHz}) \tag{11.177}
\end{align*}
$$

The second stage contributes a pole at its output node. The Miller effect of $C_{G D 2}$ at the output is expressed as $\left(1-A_{v 2}^{-1}\right) C_{G D 2} \approx 1.15 C_{G D 2}=92 \mathrm{fF}$. Adding $C_{D B 2}$ to this value yields the output pole as

$$
\begin{align*}
\left|\omega_{p 3}\right| & =\frac{1}{R_{L 2}\left(1.15 C_{G D 2}+C_{D B 2}\right)}  \tag{11.178}\\
& =2 \pi \times(0.829 \mathrm{GHz}) \tag{11.179}
\end{align*}
$$

We observe that $\omega_{p 1}$ dominates the high-frequency response. Figure 11.59 plots the overall response. The midband gain is about $26 \mathrm{~dB} \approx 20$, around $20 \%$ lower than the calculated result. This is primarily due to the use of Miller approximation for $R_{F}$. Also, the "useful" bandwidth can be defined from the lower -3 dB cut-off ( $\approx 40 \mathrm{MHz}$ ) to the upper -3 dB cut-off $(\approx 300 \mathrm{MHz})$ and is almost one decade wide. The gain falls to unity at about 2.3 GHz .

## 11.10 CHAPTER SUMMARY

- The speed of circuits is limited by various capacitances that the transistors and other components contribute to each node.
- The speed can be studied in the time domain (e.g., by applying a step) or in the frequency domain (e.g., by applying a sinusoid). The frequency response of a circuit corresponds to the latter test.
- As the frequency of operation increases, capacitances exhibit a lower impedance, reducing the gain. The gain thus rolls off at high signal frequencies.
- To obtain the frequency response, we must derive the transfer function of the circuit. The magnitude of the transfer function indicates how the gain varies with frequency.
- Bode's rules approximate the frequency response if the poles and zeros are known.
- A capacitance tied between the input and output of an inverting amplifier appears at the input with a factor equal to one minus the gain of the amplifier. This is called the Miller effect.
- In many circuits, it is possible to associate a pole with each node, i.e., calculate the pole frequency as the inverse of the product of the capacitance and resistance seen between the node and ac ground.
- Miller's theorem allows a floating impedance to be decomposed into to grounded impedances.
- Owing to coupling or degeneration capacitors, the frequency response may also exhibit roll-off as the frequency falls to very low values.
- Bipolar and MOS transistors contain capacitances between their terminals and from some terminals to ac ground. When solving a circuit, these capacitances must be identified and the resulting circuit simplified.
- The CE and CS stages exhibit a second-order transfer function and hence two poles. Miller's approximation indicates an input pole that embodies Miller multiplication of the base-collector or gate-drain capacitance.
- If the two poles of a circuit are far from each other, the "dominant-pole approximation" can be used to find a simple expression for each pole frequency.
- The CB and CG stages do not suffer from the Miller effect and achieve a higher speed than CE/CS stages, but their lower input impedance limits their applicability.
- Emitter and source followers provide a wide bandwidth. Their output impedance, however, can be inductive, causing instability in some cases.
- To benefit from the higher input impedance of CE/CS stages but reduce the Miller effect, a cascode stage can be used.
- The differential frequency response of differential pairs is similar to that of CE/CS stages.
