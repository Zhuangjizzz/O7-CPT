For example, in Fig. 11.18(a), Ci permits setting \\( V_Y \\) relatively low to maximize the voltage gain of the CS stage while maintaining the gate of \\( M_2 \\) at a higher voltage. This isolation of bias conditions is crucial for optimal performance of both stages."

Simultaneously, the CE or CS stage provides high input impedance. This combination allows the cascode stage to benefit from the high input impedance of CE/CS stages while mitigating the adverse effects of the Miller effect."

In a simple RC circuit, the capacitor C limits the speed by introducing a time constant τ = R*C. This can be studied in the time domain by applying a step input, where the voltage across the capacitor follows an exponential rise. In the frequency domain, by applying a sinusoidal input, the impedance of the capacitor decreases with increasing frequency, leading to a reduction in gain. As the frequency of operation increases, capacitances exhibit lower impedance, causing the gain to roll off at high signal frequencies."
