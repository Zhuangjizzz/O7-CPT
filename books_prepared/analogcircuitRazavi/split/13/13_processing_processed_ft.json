However, using a common-gate (CG) stage as in Figure 12.18(b) moves the input pole to gm/Cp, which is a much higher frequency. This is because the CG stage effectively isolates the parasitic capacitance from the resistor, allowing the circuit to operate efficiently at higher frequencies and thus improving the bandwidth."
