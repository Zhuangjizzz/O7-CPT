In contrast, the constant-voltage model simplifies the diode's behavior by assuming the forward bias voltage is constant, treating the diode as either fully off or fully on. This simplification allows for easier analysis but may introduce some error in the calculations, particularly when precise current-voltage characteristics are needed."

The high electric field across the narrow region can directly break covalent bonds, generating electron-hole pairs and resulting in a significant increase in current. This process is characterized by a sharp breakdown voltage and is reversible if the voltage is reduced.\n\nAvalanche breakdown, on the other hand, occurs in lightly doped junctions with a wider depletion region. The high electric field accelerates free carriers to high velocities, causing them to collide with lattice atoms and generate additional electron-hole pairs through impact ionization. This leads to a cascading effect, or 'avalanche', of carrier multiplication and a sudden increase in current. Avalanche breakdown typically occurs at higher voltages than Zener breakdown and involves a more gradual increase in current.\n\nThe key difference lies in the mechanism of carrier generation: Zener breakdown involves direct bond breaking due to a high field in a narrow region, while avalanche breakdown involves carrier multiplication through impact ionization in a wider region."
