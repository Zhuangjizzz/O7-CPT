    "text": "Recall from basic chemistry that electrons in an atom orbit the nucleus in various \"shells.\" The chemical activity of an atom is determined by the electrons in its outermost shell, known as \"valence\" electrons, and the completeness of this shell. For instance, neon has a fully completed outermost shell with eight electrons, hence it shows no tendency to undergo chemical reactions. Conversely, sodium has only one valence electron, which it readily gives up, while chlorine has seven valence electrons and is eager to gain one more. Both elements are thus highly reactive.\n\nThese principles indicate that atoms with approximately four valence electrons lie between inert gases and highly reactive elements, potentially exhibiting intriguing chemical and physical properties. Fig. 2.2 illustrates a segment of the periodic table featuring elements with three to five valence electrons. Silicon, being the most widely used material in microelectronics, deserves a detailed examination. ${ }^{2}$\n\nCovalent Bonds A solitary silicon atom possesses four valence electrons [Fig. 2.3(a)] and requires four more to complete its outermost shell. When properly processed, silicon can form a \"crystal\" where each atom is surrounded by exactly four others [Fig. 2.3(b)]. Consequently, each atom shares one valence electron with its neighbors, thereby completing its own shell and those of its neighbors. The \"bond\" formed between atoms is termed a \"covalent bond,\" highlighting the sharing of valence electrons.\n\nThe uniform crystal shown in Fig. 2.3(b) is pivotal in semiconductor devices. However, does it conduct current when a voltage is applied? At temperatures near absolute zero,\n\n[^3]image_name:Figure 2.2 Section of the periodic table\ndescription:This image, labeled \"Figure 2.2 Section of the periodic table,\" presents a portion of the periodic table focusing on groups III, IV, and V, each represented by a vertical column.\n\n- **Group III** includes:\n- Boron (B)\n- Aluminum (Al)\n- Gallium (Ga)\n\n- **Group IV** includes:\n- Carbon (C)\n- Silicon (Si)\n- Germanium (Ge)\n\n- **Group V** includes:\n- Phosphorus (P)\n- Arsenic (As)\n\nThe elements are arranged in a grid, with each element's name followed by its chemical symbol in parentheses. The image highlights elements commonly used in semiconductor technology, particularly Silicon (Si) from Group IV, which is emphasized in the context of covalent bonding in semiconductor devices.\n\nFigure 2.2 Section of the periodic table.\nthe valence electrons are confined to their respective covalent bonds and do not move freely. In other words, the silicon crystal acts as an insulator for $T \\rightarrow 0 K$. At higher temperatures, however, electrons gain thermal energy, occasionally breaking free from the bonds and acting as free charge carriers [Fig. 2.3(c)] until they rejoin another incomplete bond. Henceforth, we will refer to these as \"free electrons.\"\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:The image labeled \"(a)\" depicts a simplified representation of a silicon (Si) atom. At the center is the chemical symbol \"Si,\" with four lines extending outward in a cross-like formation, representing the four valence electrons of the silicon atom. These lines indicate the potential for forming covalent bonds with other atoms, consistent with silicon's tetravalent nature. The diagram is a conceptual illustration focusing on silicon's bonding capabilities rather than its detailed atomic structure.\nimage_name:(b)\ndescription:The image labeled \"(b)\" shows a simplified diagram of covalent bonds between silicon atoms. At the center is a symbol \"Si,\" representing a silicon atom. Four lines extend outward, each symbolizing a covalent bond with neighboring silicon atoms, forming a cross-like structure that represents the tetrahedral bonding arrangement typical in a silicon crystal lattice. This diagram illustrates how silicon atoms share electrons with adjacent atoms, creating a stable crystal structure. The diagram is a conceptual representation without additional labels or annotations.\nimage_name:(c)\ndescription:The image labeled \"(c)\" depicts a simplified representation of a silicon (Si) atom within a crystal lattice. At the center is the chemical symbol \"Si,\" with four lines extending outward in a cross-like pattern, symbolizing the covalent bonds with neighboring atoms. One of the bonds is broken, and an electron is shown as freed from the lattice, indicated by an arrow pointing away and labeled \"Free Electron.\" The freed electron is denoted by 'e⁻', highlighting its negative charge.

Thus, the generation of an \"electron-hole pair\" occurs when an electron is freed, and \"electron-hole recombination\" happens when an electron fills a hole.\n\nWhy focus on the concept of holes? After all, it is the free electrons that actually move in the crystal. To appreciate the utility of holes, consider the time evolution illustrated in Fig. 2.4.

At $t=t_{2}$, an electron breaks away from bond number 2 and recombines with the hole in bond number 1. Similarly, at $t=t_{3}$, an electron leaves bond number 3 and fills the hole in bond number 2. Observing these three \"snapshots,\" we can infer that one electron has moved from right to left, or, alternatively, one hole has moved from left to right. This perspective of current flow via holes is extremely useful in analyzing semiconductor devices.\n\nBandgap Energy We must now address two crucial questions. First, does any thermal energy create free electrons (and holes) in silicon? No, a minimum energy is required to dislodge an electron from a covalent bond. This minimum energy, termed the \"bandgap energy\" and denoted by $E_{g}$, is a fundamental property of the material. For silicon, $E_{g}=1.12 \\mathrm{eV}^{3}$.\n\nThe second question concerns the material's conductivity: How many free electrons are created at a given temperature? From our observations, we hypothesize that the number of electrons depends on both $E_{g}$ and $T$: a larger $E_{g}$ results in fewer electrons, while a higher $T$ increases the number of electrons. To simplify future calculations, we consider the density (or concentration) of electrons, $n_{i}$, which is the number of electrons per unit volume, and for silicon, we write:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nn_{i}=5.2 \\times 10^{15} T^{3 / 2} \\exp \\frac{-E_{g}}{2 k T} \\text { electrons } / \\mathrm{cm}^{3} \\tag{2.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $k=1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\mathrm{~J} / \\mathrm{K}$ is the Boltzmann constant. The derivation can be found in semiconductor physics textbooks, e.g., [1]. As expected, materials with a larger $E_{g}$ exhibit a smaller $n_{i}$. Also, as $T \\rightarrow 0$, both $T^{3 / 2}$ and $\\exp \\left[-E_{g} /(2 k T)\\right]$ approach zero, causing $n_{i}$ to approach zero.\n\nThe exponential dependence of $n_{i}$ on $E_{g}$ highlights the impact of bandgap energy on material conductivity. Insulators have a high $E_{g}$; for example, diamond has $E_{g}=2.5 \\mathrm{eV}$. Conductors have a small bandgap. Semiconductors, however, have a moderate $E_{g}$, typically ranging from 1 eV to 1.5 eV.\n\nExample Determine the electron density in silicon at $T=300 \\mathrm{~K}$ (room temperature) and $T=600 \\mathrm{~K}$.\n\nSolution Since $E_{g}=1.12 \\mathrm{eV}=1.792 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& n_{i}(T=300 \\mathrm{~K})=1.08 \\times 10^{10} \\text { electrons } / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}  \\tag{2.2}\\\\\n& n_{i}(T=600 \\mathrm{~K})=1.54 \\times 10^{15} \\text { electrons } / \\mathrm{cm}^{3} \\tag{2.3}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSince each free electron leaves behind a hole, the hole density is also given by (2.2) and (2.3).\n\nExercise Repeat the above calculation for a material with a bandgap of 1.5 eV.\n\nThe $n_{i}$ values obtained in the example may seem high, but considering silicon has $5 \\times 10^{22}$ atoms $/ \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$, only one in $5 \\times 10^{12}$ atoms has a free electron at room temperature. Thus, silicon still appears to be a poor conductor. However, do not despair! We will next introduce a method to enhance silicon's usefulness."

    "text": "Remember from basic chemistry that electrons in an atom orbit the nucleus in distinct \"shells.\" The atom's chemical behavior is dictated by the electrons in the outermost shell, known as \"valence\" electrons, and the completeness of this shell.

Conversely, sodium possesses just one valence electron, ready to be released, while chlorine has seven valence electrons, eager to gain one more. Both elements are thus highly reactive.\n\nThese principles imply that atoms with around four valence electrons lie between inert gases and highly reactive elements, potentially exhibiting intriguing chemical and physical properties.

From our observations, we postulate that the number of electrons depends on both $E_{g}$ and $T$: a larger $E_{g}$ results in fewer electrons, while a higher $T$ increases electron count. To simplify future calculations, we consider the electron density, or concentration, per unit volume, $n_{i}$, and for silicon, we write:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nn_{i}=5.2 \\times 10^{15} T^{3 / 2} \\exp \\frac{-E_{g}}{2 k T} \\text { electrons } / \\mathrm{cm}^{3} \\tag{2.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $k=1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\mathrm{~J} / \\mathrm{K}$ is the Boltzmann constant.

Thus, an \"electron-hole pair\" is generated when an electron is freed, and \"electron-hole recombination\" occurs when an electron fills a hole.\n\nWhy focus on the concept of holes? After all, it is the free electron that actually moves in the crystal. To understand the utility of holes, consider the time evolution shown in Fig. 2.4.

At $ t = t_2 $, an electron breaks away from bond number 2 and recombines with the hole in bond number 1. Similarly, at $ t = t_3 $, an electron leaves bond number 3 and fills the hole in bond number 2. Observing these three \"snapshots,\" we can infer that one electron has moved from right to left, or equivalently, one hole has moved from left to right. This perspective of current flow via holes is extremely useful in analyzing semiconductor devices.\n\nBandgap Energy We must now address two crucial questions. First, does any thermal energy create free electrons (and holes) in silicon? No, a minimum energy is required to dislodge an electron from a covalent bond. This minimum energy, termed the \"bandgap energy\" and denoted by $ E_g $, is a fundamental material property. For silicon, $ E_g = 1.12 \\mathrm{eV}^{3} $.\n\nThe second question concerns the material's conductivity: How many free electrons are generated at a given temperature? From our observations, we hypothesize that the number of electrons depends on both $ E_g $ and $ T $: a larger $ E_g $ results in fewer electrons, while a higher $ T $ yields more electrons. To simplify future derivations, we consider the electron density (or concentration), $ n_i $, which is the number of electrons per unit volume, and for silicon, we write:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nn_i = 5.2 \\times 10^{15} T^{3/2} \\exp \\left( \\frac{-E_g}{2 k T} \\right) \\text{ electrons/cm}^3 \\tag{2.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $ k = 1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\mathrm{J/K} $ is the Boltzmann constant. The derivation can be found in semiconductor physics texts, e.g., [1]. As expected, materials with a larger $ E_g $ exhibit a smaller $ n_i $. Also, as $ T \\rightarrow 0 $, both $ T^{3/2} $ and $ \\exp \\left( -E_g / (2 k T) \\right) $ approach zero, reducing $ n_i $ to near zero.\n\nThe exponential dependence of $ n_i $ on $ E_g $ highlights the impact of bandgap energy on material conductivity. Insulators have a high $ E_g $; for example, diamond has $ E_g = 2.5 \\mathrm{eV} $. Conductors have a small bandgap. Semiconductors have a moderate $ E_g $, typically between 1 eV and 1.5 eV.\n\nExample Determine the electron density in silicon at $ T = 300 \\mathrm{K} $ (room temperature) and $ T = 600 \\mathrm{K} $.\n\nSolution Since $ E_g = 1.12 \\mathrm{eV} = 1.792 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J} $, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& n_i (T = 300 \\mathrm{K}) = 1.08 \\times 10^{10} \\text{ electrons/cm}^3 \\tag{2.2} \\\\\n& n_i (T = 600 \\mathrm{K}) = 1.54 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ electrons/cm}^3 \\tag{2.3}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSince each free electron leaves behind a hole, the hole density is also given by (2.2) and (2.3).\n\nExercise Repeat the above calculation for a material with a bandgap of 1.5 eV.\n\nThe $ n_i $ values from the example may seem high, but considering silicon has $ 5 \\times 10^{22} $ atoms/cm$^3$, only one in $ 5 \\times 10^{12} $ atoms has a free electron at room temperature. Thus, silicon still appears to be a poor conductor. However, do not despair! We will next introduce a method to enhance silicon's utility."

To simplify future calculations, we consider the electron density (or concentration), $n_{i}$, the number of electrons per unit volume, and for silicon, we write:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nn_{i}=5.2 \\times 10^{15} T^{3 / 2} \\exp \\frac{-E_{g}}{2 k T} \\text { electrons } / \\mathrm{cm}^{3} \\tag{2.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $k=1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\mathrm{~J} / \\mathrm{K}$ is the Boltzmann constant. The derivation is found in semiconductor physics texts, e.g., [1]. As expected, materials with a larger $E_{g}$ exhibit a smaller $n_{i}$. Also, as $T \\rightarrow 0$, both $T^{3 / 2}$ and $\\exp \\left[-E_{g} /(2 k T)\\right]$ approach zero, reducing $n_{i}$ to zero.\n\nThe exponential dependence of $n_{i}$ on $E_{g}$ highlights the impact of bandgap energy on material conductivity. Insulators have a high $E_{g}$; for example, diamond has $E_{g}=2.5 \\mathrm{eV}$. Conductors have a small bandgap. Semiconductors have a moderate $E_{g}$, typically between 1 eV and 1.5 eV.\n\nExample Determine the electron density in silicon at $T=300 \\mathrm{~K}$ (room temperature) and\n2.1 $T=600 \\mathrm{~K}$.\n\nSolution Since $E_{g}=1.12 \\mathrm{eV}=1.792 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& n_{i}(T=300 \\mathrm{~K})=1.08 \\times 10^{10} \\text { electrons } / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}  \\tag{2.2}\\\\\n& n_{i}(T=600 \\mathrm{~K})=1.54 \\times 10^{15} \\text { electrons } / \\mathrm{cm}^{3} \\tag{2.3}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSince each free electron leaves behind a hole, the hole density is also given by (2.2) and (2.3).\n\nExercise Repeat the above calculation for a material with a bandgap of 1.5 eV.\n\nThe $n_{i}$ values obtained in the example may seem high, but considering silicon has $5 \\times 10^{22}$ atoms $/ \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$, only one in $5 \\times 10^{12}$ atoms has a\n\n[^4]free electron at room temperature. Thus, silicon still appears to be a poor conductor. However, do not despair! We will next introduce a method to enhance silicon's utility."

As depicted in Fig. 2.5, each P atom shares four electrons with neighboring silicon atoms, leaving the fifth electron \"unattached.\" This electron is free to move, acting as a charge carrier. Therefore, if $N$ phosphorus atoms are uniformly introduced per cubic centimeter of silicon, the density of free electrons increases by the same amount.\n\nimage_name:Figure 2.5\ndescription:Figure 2.5 illustrates a silicon crystal lattice doped with phosphorus atoms.

A phosphorus (P) atom is centrally located, replacing one silicon atom in the lattice.

This electron is shown as \"unattached\" or loosely bound, symbolizing its ability to move throughout the crystal lattice. This free electron acts as a charge carrier, enhancing the electrical conductivity of the silicon crystal. The presence of this free electron is a key feature of n-type semiconductor behavior, where phosphorus doping increases the number of free electrons, thereby boosting conductivity.\n\nThe diagram effectively highlights the concept of doping in semiconductors, demonstrating how introducing phosphorus atoms into a silicon lattice alters its electronic properties by providing additional free electrons.\n\nFigure 2.5 Loosely-attached electron with phosphorus doping.\n\nThe deliberate addition of an \"impurity\" like phosphorus to an intrinsic semiconductor is termed \"doping,\" with phosphorus being a \"dopant.\" This doped silicon crystal, now providing many more free electrons than in its intrinsic state, is called \"extrinsic,\" specifically an \"n-type\" semiconductor, emphasizing the abundance of free electrons.\n\nAs previously noted, the electron and hole densities in an intrinsic semiconductor are equal.

    "text": "Intrinsic and Extrinsic Semiconductors\n\nThe \"pure\" form of silicon discussed so far exemplifies \"intrinsic semiconductors,\" characterized by very high resistance. Fortunately, it is feasible to alter silicon's resistivity by substituting some of its atoms with atoms from another material.

Thus,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nn p = n_i^2 \\tag{2.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWe will revisit this equation later.\nRecall from Fig. 2.2 that phosphorus (P) has five valence electrons. What occurs if P atoms are introduced into a silicon crystal? As depicted in Fig. 2.5, each P atom shares four electrons with neighboring silicon atoms, leaving the fifth electron \"unattached.\" This electron is free to move, acting as a charge carrier. Hence, if $N$ phosphorus atoms are uniformly introduced per cubic centimeter of silicon, the free electron density increases by the same amount.\nimage_name:Figure 2.5\ndescription:Figure 2.5 shows a silicon crystal lattice doped with phosphorus atoms. The diagram features several silicon (Si) atoms arranged in a grid, each labeled 'Si' and connected to neighboring atoms by lines indicating covalent bonds. A phosphorus (P) atom is centrally positioned, replacing one silicon atom in the lattice. This P atom shares four of its five valence electrons with adjacent silicon atoms, forming covalent bonds similar to those between silicon atoms.\n\nHowever, unlike silicon, phosphorus has an extra valence electron, depicted as 'e⁻' in the diagram. This electron is shown as \"unattached\" or loosely bound, indicating its ability to move freely within the crystal lattice. This free electron acts as a charge carrier, enhancing the electrical conductivity of the silicon crystal. The presence of this free electron is a key characteristic of n-type semiconductor behavior, where phosphorus doping increases the number of free electrons, thereby boosting conductivity.\n\nThe diagram effectively illustrates the concept of doping in semiconductors, demonstrating how introducing phosphorus atoms into a silicon lattice modifies its electronic properties by providing additional free electrons.\n\nFigure 2.5 Loosely-attached electron with phosphorus doping.\n\nThe deliberate addition of an \"impurity\" like phosphorus to an intrinsic semiconductor is termed \"doping,\" with phosphorus being a \"dopant.\" This doped silicon crystal, now enriched with many more free electrons than in its intrinsic state, is classified as \"extrinsic,\" specifically an \"n-type\" semiconductor to highlight the abundance of free electrons.\n\nAs previously noted, the electron and hole densities in an intrinsic semiconductor are equal. But what about these densities in a doped material? It can be demonstrated that even in this scenario,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nn p = n_i^2 \\tag{2.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $n$ and $p$ denote the electron and hole densities in the extrinsic semiconductor, respectively.

(2.1) for silicon].\n\nSolution Equation (2.5) indicates that $p$ must decrease below its intrinsic level as more n-type dopants are added to the crystal. This happens because many of the new electrons from the dopant \"recombine\" with the holes present in the intrinsic material.\n\nExercise Why can't we assert that $n + p$ should remain constant?\n\nExample A piece of crystalline silicon is uniformly doped with phosphorus atoms. The doping density is $10^{16}$ atoms/cm³. Determine the electron and hole densities in this material at room temperature.\n\nSolution The addition of $10^{16}$ P atoms introduces an equivalent number of free electrons per cubic centimeter.

One might naturally wonder if a \"p-type\" semiconductor can be created, reversing the roles of electrons and holes.\n\nIndeed, doping silicon with an atom that provides fewer electrons can result in many incomplete covalent bonds. For instance, as indicated in Fig. 2.2, a boron (B) atom, with three valence electrons, can form only three complete covalent bonds in a silicon crystal (Fig. 2.6). Consequently, the fourth bond remains incomplete, creating a hole ready to accept a free electron. In other words, $N$ boron atoms contribute $N$ holes to the conduction of current in silicon.

    "text": "Intrinsic and Extrinsic Semiconductors\n\nThe \"pure\" form of silicon discussed so far exemplifies \"intrinsic semiconductors,\" characterized by a very high resistance. Fortunately, it is feasible to alter the resistivity of silicon by substituting some of its atoms in the crystal lattice with atoms of another material. In an intrinsic semiconductor, the electron density, $n(=n_{i})$, equals the hole density, $p$. Hence,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nnp = n_{i}^{2} \\tag{2.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWe will revisit this equation later.\nRecall from Fig. 2.2 that phosphorus (P) has five valence electrons. What occurs if some P atoms are incorporated into a silicon crystal? As depicted in Fig. 2.5, each P atom shares four electrons with neighboring silicon atoms, leaving the fifth electron \"unattached.\" This electron is free to move, acting as a charge carrier. Thus, if $N$ phosphorus atoms are uniformly introduced per cubic centimeter of a silicon crystal, the density of free electrons increases by that same amount.\nimage_name:Figure 2.5\ndescription:Figure 2.5 shows a silicon crystal lattice doped with phosphorus atoms. The diagram features several silicon (Si) atoms arranged in a grid-like pattern, each represented by the symbol 'Si' and connected to neighboring silicon atoms by lines, indicating covalent bonds. The phosphorus (P) atom is centrally located, replacing one of the silicon atoms in the lattice. This phosphorus atom shares four of its five valence electrons with adjacent silicon atoms, forming covalent bonds similar to those between silicon atoms.\n\nHowever, unlike silicon, phosphorus has an extra valence electron, depicted in the diagram by the symbol 'e⁻'. This electron is shown as being \"unattached\" or loosely bound, indicating its ability to move freely throughout the crystal lattice. This free electron acts as a charge carrier, enhancing the electrical conductivity of the silicon crystal. The presence of this free electron is a key characteristic of n-type semiconductor behavior, where doping with phosphorus increases the number of free electrons, thereby boosting conductivity.\n\nThe diagram effectively illustrates the concept of doping in semiconductors, demonstrating how the introduction of phosphorus atoms into a silicon lattice modifies its electronic properties by providing additional free electrons.\n\nFigure 2.5 Loosely-attached electron with phosphorus doping.\n\nThe deliberate addition of an \"impurity\" like phosphorus to an intrinsic semiconductor is termed \"doping,\" with phosphorus itself being a \"dopant.\" This results in a significantly higher number of free electrons compared to the intrinsic state, transforming the silicon crystal into an \"extrinsic\" semiconductor, specifically an \"n-type\" semiconductor due to the abundance of free electrons.\n\nAs previously noted, the electron and hole densities in an intrinsic semiconductor are equal. But what about these densities in a doped material? It can be demonstrated that even in this case,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nnp = n_{i}^{2} \\tag{2.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $n$ and $p$ represent the electron and hole densities in the extrinsic semiconductor, respectively. The quantity $n_{i}$ denotes the densities in the intrinsic semiconductor (hence the subscript $i$) and is independent of the doping level [e.g., Eq. (2.1) for silicon].\n\nSolution Equation (2.5) indicates that $p$ must decrease below its intrinsic level as more n-type dopants are added to the crystal. This happens because many of the new electrons provided by the dopant \"recombine\" with the holes present in the intrinsic material.\n\nExercise Why can we not assert that $n+p$ should remain constant?\n\nExample A piece of crystalline silicon is uniformly doped with phosphorus atoms. The doping density is $10^{16}$ atoms/cm³. Determine the electron and hole densities in this material at room temperature.\n\nSolution The addition of $10^{16}$ P atoms introduces an equivalent number of free electrons per cubic centimeter. Since this electron density exceeds that calculated in Example 2.1 by six orders of magnitude, we can assume\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nn = 10^{16} \\text{ electrons/cm}^{3} \\tag{2.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFrom (2.2) and (2.5), it follows that\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\np & = \\frac{n_{i}^{2}}{n} \\tag{2.7}\\\\\n& = 1.17 \\times 10^{4} \\text{ holes/cm}^{3} \\tag{2.8}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nNote that the hole density has decreased below the intrinsic level by six orders of magnitude. Thus, if a voltage is applied across this silicon piece, the resulting current will predominantly consist of electrons.\n\nExercise At what doping level does the hole density decrease by three orders of magnitude?\n\nThis example explains why electrons are termed the \"majority carriers\" and holes the \"minority carriers\" in an n-type semiconductor. One might naturally wonder if it is possible to create a \"p-type\" semiconductor, thereby reversing the roles of electrons and holes.\n\nIndeed, if silicon is doped with an atom that provides fewer electrons, it can result in many incomplete covalent bonds. For instance, the table in Fig. 2.2 suggests that a boron (B) atom, with three valence electrons, can form only three complete covalent bonds in a silicon crystal (Fig. 2.6). Consequently, the fourth bond remains incomplete, creating a hole ready to accept a free electron. In other words, $N$ boron atoms contribute $N$ holes to the conduction of current in silicon. The structure in Fig. 2.6 thus exemplifies a p-type semiconductor, where holes serve as the majority carriers. The boron atom is referred to as an \"acceptor\" dopant.\nimage_name:Figure 2.6 Available hole with boron doping\ndescription:The image titled \"Figure 2.6 Available hole with boron doping\" illustrates a schematic representation of a silicon crystal lattice doped with a boron atom, highlighting the concept of a p-type semiconductor.\n\n1. **Identification of Components and Structure:**\n- The diagram displays a grid-like structure where most elements are labeled as \"Si,\" representing silicon atoms.

    "text": "Having explored the concepts of charge carriers and doping, we are now prepared to delve into the dynamics of charge movement in semiconductors, specifically the processes that enable current flow.\n\nDrift is a phenomenon rooted in fundamental physics and Ohm's law, where a material's ability to conduct current is a response to a potential difference, thereby creating an electric field. This field propels charge carriers within the material, driving them from one end to the other. The movement of these carriers due to the electric field is referred to as \"drift.\"\n\nAn illustration, \"Figure 2.8 Drift in a semiconductor,\" depicts a semiconductor block subjected to an electric field. Charge carriers are shown moving in a zigzag pattern, indicating both acceleration by the electric field and collisions with the crystal lattice. This results in a net drift of carriers in the direction of the electric field. The block is connected to a battery that generates the necessary potential difference, establishing the electric field across the semiconductor.\n\nIn semiconductors, this drift process mirrors the behavior of electrons, which are accelerated by the electric field but collide with the crystal lattice, ultimately reaching the opposite end and flowing into the battery. This balance of acceleration and collisions results in a steady velocity for the carriers, which is proportional to the electric field strength:\n\n$$\nv = \\mu E\n$$\n\nHere, $\\mu$ denotes the mobility, typically measured in $\\mathrm{cm}^2 /(\\mathrm{V} \\cdot \\mathrm{s})$. For instance, in silicon, the electron mobility $\\mu_n$ is $1350 \\mathrm{~cm}^2 /(\\mathrm{V} \\cdot \\mathrm{s})$, while the hole mobility $\\mu_p$ is $480 \\mathrm{~cm}^2 /(\\mathrm{V} \\cdot \\mathrm{s})$.

The diagram highlights the movement of charge carriers over time, showing their position at two different time frames.\n\nGiven the velocity of carriers, the current can be determined by considering the charge of an electron and the free electron density in the semiconductor bar. The current is calculated as the product of the charge velocity and the charge density.\n\nThe Einstein Relation connects mobility and diffusion constant, stating that they are related by the equation:\n\n$$\n\\frac{D}{\\mu} = \\frac{k T}{q}\n$$\n\nwhere $k T / q \\approx 26 \\mathrm{mV}$ at $T=300 \\mathrm{~K}$.\n\nDiffusion is a separate mechanism of current flow, akin to the dispersion of ink in water. When charge carriers are injected into a semiconductor, they tend to move from regions of high concentration to low concentration, even in the absence of an electric field. This movement constitutes an electric current.\n\nAn example of diffusion in a semiconductor bar is provided, where charge carriers are injected, creating a nonuniform density and leading to current flow. The diffusion current is proportional to the concentration gradient.\n\nVelocity saturation occurs when the electric field becomes sufficiently high that the carriers' velocity no longer increases linearly with the field. Instead, it reaches a saturation velocity due to frequent collisions with the lattice.\n\nThe effective mobility, which accounts for velocity saturation, is expressed as:\n\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{\\mu_0}{1 + b E}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mu_0$ is the low-field mobility and $b$ is a proportionality factor.\n\nLastly, a summary diagram, \"Figure 2.15 Summary of drift and diffusion mechanisms,\" illustrates the two primary mechanisms of charge transport in semiconductors: drift and diffusion. Drift current is driven by an external electric field, while diffusion current results from concentration gradients within the material. These mechanisms are fundamental to understanding charge transport in semiconductor devices, such as the pn junction."

It is divided into two segments, each corresponding to a distinct timeframe: \\(t = t_1\\) and \\(t = t_1 + 1\\) second.\n\nMain Components:\n1. **Semiconductor Bar**: The central structure of the diagram is a bar-shaped figure representing a semiconductor material. It is labeled with dimensions as \\(W\\) (width), \\(L\\) (length), and \\(h\\) (height).\n2. **Voltage Source \\(V_1\\)**: A voltage \\(V_1\\) is applied across the semiconductor bar, shown by a battery icon with positive and negative terminals.\n3. **Charge Density**: The shaded region within the semiconductor indicates the area where charge carriers are present.\n\nFlow of Information or Control:\n- **Electron Movement**: Electrons migrate from the negative terminal to the positive terminal of the voltage source, as indicated by the direction of the arrow labeled \\(x\\).\n- **Velocity \\(v\\)**: The velocity of the electrons is represented by the arrow labeled \\(v\\), demonstrating the direction and magnitude of the electron flow.\n- **Change Over Time**: The two segments of the diagram depict the position of the charge density at two separate times, \\(t = t_1\\) and \\(t = t_1 + 1\\) second, illustrating the movement of charge carriers over time.\n\nLabels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:\n- **\\(x_1\\)**: A specific point along the x-axis, indicating the initial position of the charge density at \\(t = t_1\\).\n- **Meters**: The diagram specifies the measurement of distance in meters, highlighting the scale of the semiconductor bar.\n\nOverall System Function:\nThe primary purpose of this system is to depict how charge density, represented by the shaded area, traverses a semiconductor bar when a voltage is applied. The diagram illustrates how the position of the charge density shifts over time due to the applied voltage, leading to current flow. This shift is quantified by the velocity \\(v\\), which is influenced by the applied voltage \\(V_1\\) and the properties of the semiconductor material.\n\nFigure 2.9 Current flow in terms of charge density.\n\n Knowing the velocity of carriers, how does one calculate the current? We initially note that an electron carries a negative charge of $q=1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$. Equivalently, a hole carries a positive charge of the same magnitude. Now, suppose a voltage $V_{1}$ is applied across a uniform semiconductor bar with a free electron density of $n$ (Fig. 2.9). Assuming the electrons move with a velocity of $v \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$, considering a cross section of the bar at $x=x_{1}$ and taking two \"snapshots\" at $t=t_{1}$ and $t=t_{1}+1$ second, we observe that the total charge contained in $v$ meters passes through the cross section in 1 second. In other words, the current is equal to the total charge enclosed within $v$ meters of the bar's length. Since the bar has a width of $W$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI=-v \\cdot W \\cdot h \\cdot n \\cdot q, \\tag{2.17}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $v \\cdot W \\cdot h$ represents the volume, $n \\cdot q$ denotes the charge density in coulombs, and the negative sign takes into account the fact that electrons carry negative charge.\n\nLet us now simplify Eq. (2.13) to a more convenient form. Since for electrons, $v=-\\mu_{n} E$, and since $W \\cdot h$ is the cross section area of the bar, we write\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nJ_{n}=\\mu_{n} E \\cdot n \\cdot q, \\tag{2.18}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $J_{n}$ denotes the \"current density,\" which is the current passing through a unit cross section area and is expressed in $\\mathrm{A} / \\mathrm{cm}^{2}$. We can loosely state, \"the current is equal to the charge velocity times the charge density,\" with the understanding that \"current\" actually refers to current density, and negative or positive signs are properly considered.\n\nIn the presence of both electrons and holes, Eq. (2.18) is modified to\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nJ_{\\text {tot }} & =\\mu_{n} E \\cdot n \\cdot q+\\mu_{p} E \\cdot p \\cdot q  \\tag{2.19}\\\\\n& =q\\left(\\mu_{n} n+\\mu_{p} p\\right) E . \\tag{2.20}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis equation provides the drift current density in response to an electric field E in a semiconductor having uniform electron and hole densities.\n\nExample In an experimental setting, it is aimed to achieve equal electron and hole drift currents. What 2.6 should the carrier densities be set at?\n\nSolution We must ensure\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mu_{n} n=\\mu_{p} p \\tag{2.21}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand hence\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{n}{p}=\\frac{\\mu_{p}}{\\mu_{n}} \\tag{2.22}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWe also recall that $n p=n_{i}^{2}$. Thus,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& p=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_{n}}{\\mu_{p}}} n_{i}  \\tag{2.23}\\\\\n& n=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_{p}}{\\mu_{n}}} n_{i} \\tag{2.24}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nFor instance, in silicon, $\\mu_{n} / \\mu_{p}=1350 / 480=2.81$, yielding\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\np & =1.68 n_{i}  \\tag{2.25}\\\\\nn & =0.596 n_{i} \\tag{2.26}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSince $p$ and $n$ are of the same order as $n_{i}$, equal electron and hole drift currents can occur only for a very lightly doped material. This confirms our previous understanding of majority carriers in semiconductors having typical doping levels of $10^{15}-10^{18}$ atoms $/ \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$.\n\nExercise How should the carrier densities be adjusted so that the electron drift current is double that of the hole drift current?\nVelocity Saturation: To date, we have assumed that the mobility of carriers in semiconductors is independent of the electric field and that the velocity increases linearly with E according to \\(v=\\mu E\\). In reality, if the electric field reaches sufficiently high levels, v no longer increases linearly with E. This is because carriers collide with the lattice so frequently that the time between collisions is so short that they cannot accelerate much. Consequently, v changes non-linearly at high electric fields, ultimately reaching a maximum value, \\(v_{s a t}\\) (Fig. 2.10). Known as \"velocity saturation,\" this phenomenon can be observed in certain modern transistors, which limits the performance of circuits.\n\nTo depict velocity saturation, we must modify the expression \\(v=\\mu E\\) accordingly. A simple approach is to view the slope, μ, as a field-dependent parameter. The equation\n\n[^6]image_name:Figure 2.10 Velocity saturation\ndescription:The graph shown in \"Figure 2.10 Velocity Saturation\" illustrates the concept of velocity saturation in transistors, labeled as Figure 2.10. The graph is a two-dimensional plot with the x-axis representing the electric field \\(E\\), and the y-axis representing velocity, with no specific units indicated, suggesting a general conceptual representation rather than a precise quantitative one.\n\nThe graph depicts a curve that starts at the origin and rises rapidly at first, indicating a rapid increase in velocity with increasing electric field. This initial steep slope corresponds to the low-field mobility, \\( \\mu_0 \\), where the velocity \\( v \\) is proportional to the electric field \\( E \\). As the electric field continues to increase, the curve begins to flatten, indicating a sub-linear increase in velocity.\n\nThe graph features a horizontal dashed line labeled \\( v_{sat} \\), which represents the saturation velocity. This line indicates the maximum velocity that can be achieved regardless of further increases in the electric field. The curve asymptotically approaches this saturation velocity, demonstrating the effect of velocity saturation.\n\nTwo points along the curve are marked with dotted lines extending to the y-axis, labeled \\( \\mu_1 \\) and \\( \\mu_2 \\). These points represent different effective mobilities at specific electric field strengths, illustrating how mobility changes with increasing electric field.\n\nOverall, the graph effectively conveys the relationship between electric field and velocity in the context of velocity saturation, highlighting the transition from linear to saturated behavior as the electric field increases.\n\nFigure 2.10 Velocity saturation.\n\nfor μ must thus gradually decrease towards zero as E increases, but approach a constant value for small E; i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mu=\\frac{\\mu_{0}}{1+b E} \\tag{2.27}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mu_{0}$ is the \"low-field\" mobility and $b$ is a proportionality factor. We can consider μ as the \"effective\" mobility at an electric field E. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv=\\frac{\\mu_{0}}{1+b E} E \\tag{2.28}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince for $E \\rightarrow \\infty, v \\rightarrow v_{s a t}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{s a t}=\\frac{\\mu_{0}}{b} \\tag{2.29}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand hence $b=\\mu_{0} / v_{s a t}$. In other words,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv=\\frac{\\mu_{0}}{1+\\frac{\\mu_{0} E}{v_{s a t}}} E \\tag{2.30}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nA uniform piece of semiconductor $0.2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ long sustains a voltage of 1 V . If the low-field mobility is equal to $1350 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2} /(\\mathrm{V} \\cdot \\mathrm{s})$ and the saturation velocity of the carriers is $10^{7} \\mathrm{~cm} / \\mathrm{s}$, determine the effective mobility. Additionally, calculate the maximum permissible voltage so that the effective mobility is only 10% lower than μ₀.\n\nSolution We have\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nE & =\\frac{V}{L}  \\tag{2.31}\\\\\n& =50 \\mathrm{kV} / \\mathrm{cm} \\tag{2.32}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIt follows that\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mu & =\\frac{\\mu_{0}}{1+\\frac{\\mu_{0} E}{v_{s a t}}}  \\tag{2.33}\\\\\n& =\\frac{\\mu_{0}}{7.75}  \\tag{2.34}\\\\\n& =174 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2} /(\\mathrm{V} \\cdot \\mathrm{~s}) \\tag{2.35}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIf the mobility must remain within 10% of its low-field value, then\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n0.9 \\mu_{0}=\\frac{\\mu_{0}}{1+\\frac{\\mu_{0} E}{v_{s a t}}} \\tag{2.36}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand hence\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nE & =\\frac{1}{9} \\frac{v_{\\text {sat }}}{\\mu_{0}}  \\tag{2.37}\\\\\n& =823 \\mathrm{~V} / \\mathrm{cm} . \\tag{2.38}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nA device of length $0.2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ subjected to such a field would experience a voltage of $(823 \\mathrm{~V} / \\mathrm{cm}) \\times\\left(0.2 \\times 10^{-4} \\mathrm{~cm}\\right)=16.5 \\mathrm{mV}$.\n\nThis example indicates that modern (submicron) devices may experience significant velocity saturation due to their operation at voltages much greater than 16.5 mV.\n\nExercise At what voltage does the mobility decrease by 20%?\nDiffusion: In addition to drift, another mechanism can cause current flow. Imagine a drop of ink falling into a glass of water. When a high local concentration of ink molecules is introduced, the drop starts to \"diffuse,\" meaning the ink molecules tend to move from an area of high concentration to areas of lower concentration. This process is called \"diffusion.\"\n\nA similar situation arises when charge carriers are \"injected\" (introduced) into a semiconductor to create an uneven density. Even in the absence of an electric field, the carriers move towards regions of lower concentration, thereby carrying an electric current as long as the unevenness persists. Diffusion is therefore inherently different from drift.\nimage_name:Figure 2.11 Diffusion in a semiconductor\ndescription:The diagram illustrates the concept of diffusion in a semiconductor.

The image includes a rectangular shape to symbolize the semiconductor, across which an electric field (E) is applied, denoted by an arrow stretching horizontally from left to right.\n\nWithin the semiconductor, numerous jagged arrows trace the path of charge carriers as they traverse the material. These arrows indicate that the charge carriers are pushed forward by the electric field but also collide with the atoms in the crystal lattice, producing a zigzag or erratic walking pattern. This interaction results in a net drift of carriers in the direction of the electric field.\n\nThe semiconductor block is connected to a battery positioned beneath it, with the positive terminal on the left and the negative terminal on the right.

As depicted in Fig. 2.8, charge carriers are propelled by the field and occasionally collide with the crystal atoms, ultimately reaching the other side and flowing into the battery. The acceleration induced by the field and the collisions with the crystal balance each other out, resulting in a consistent velocity for the carriers.6 We anticipate that the velocity, denoted by \\(v\\), will be directly proportional to the strength of the electric field, \\(E\\):\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv \\propto E \\tag{2.13}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand consequently\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv=\\mu E \\tag{2.14}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere \\(\\mu\\) is termed the \"mobility\" and is typically expressed in \\(\\mathrm{cm}^{2} /(\\mathrm{V} \\cdot \\mathrm{s})\\).

    "text": "---\n\nImage Descriptions: Textual descriptions have been created for any images referenced within the [Context Provided]. Please revise the text in the [Context Provided] Section to preserve its original meaning and overall length.\n\n---\n\nThe [Context Provided] text has been rephrased as follows:\n\n---\n\nIn our exploration of charge carriers and the principles of doping, we are now poised to investigate the dynamics of charge movement within semiconductors, specifically the processes that facilitate the flow of electric current.\n\nThe term \"drift\" refers to the motion of charge carriers in a semiconductor material under the influence of an electric field. This movement is a direct result of the acceleration imparted by the electric field, which compels carriers to migrate from one end of the material to the other. The effect of the electric field on charge carriers, causing them to move in a direction opposite to the field, constitutes \"drift.\"\n\nRefer to Figure 2.8, which visually depicts the concept of drift in a semiconductor. The illustration includes a semiconductor block represented by a rectangle, across which an electric field (E) is exerted. The field is indicated by an arrow extending horizontally from left to right.\n\nWithin the semiconductor, the path of charge carriers is indicated by zigzagging arrows, demonstrating how they are accelerated by the electric field while simultaneously colliding with the atoms within the crystal lattice, leading to a meandering or irregular trajectory. This interplay between acceleration and collisions results in a net drift of carriers in the direction of the electric field.\n\nThe semiconductor block is connected to a battery positioned below it, with the positive terminal on the left and the negative terminal on the right. This arrangement establishes the potential difference that generates the electric field within the semiconductor.\n\nThe diagram effectively portrays the drift process, highlighting how charge carriers are influenced by the electric field and exhibit a combination of acceleration and scattering due to lattice collisions.\n\nIn Figure 2.8, the behavior of semiconductors is analogous. As depicted, charge carriers are accelerated by the electric field and inadvertently collide with the crystal atoms, ultimately reaching the opposite end and returning to the battery. The interplay between acceleration and collisions results in a constant velocity for the carriers. We anticipate that the velocity, denoted by 'v', will be directly proportional to the strength of the electric field, 'E':\n\n\\[ v \\propto E \\tag{2.13} \\]\n\nConsequently,\n\n\\[ v = \\mu E \\tag{2.14} \\]\n\nHere, 'μ' is known as the \"mobility\" and is typically expressed in units of cm²/(V·s). For instance, in silicon, the mobility of electrons, \\( \\mu_n \\), is approximately 1350 cm²/(V·s), and that of holes, \\( \\mu_p \\), is approximately 480 cm²/(V·s). As electrons travel in the opposite direction to the electric field, we must represent the velocity vector as:\n\n\\[ \\vec{v_e} = -\\mu_n \\vec{E} \\tag{2.15} \\]\n\nIn contrast, for holes,\n\n\\[ \\vec{v_h} = \\mu_p \\vec{E} \\tag{2.16} \\]\n\n[^5]Example: A uniform chunk of n-type silicon, 1 μm in length, is subjected to a voltage of 1 V. Determine the velocity of the electrons.\n\nSolution: Since the material is uniform, the electric field strength is given by \\( E = \\frac{V}{L} \\), where 'L' is the length. Thus, \\( E = 10,000 V/cm \\) and hence \\( v = \\mu_n E = 1.35 \\times 10^7 cm/s \\). In other words, electrons take \\( (1 μm) / (1.35 \\times 10^7 cm/s) = 7.4 ps \\) to traverse the 1-μm length.\n\nExercise: What occurs if the mobility is halved?\n\nRefer to Figure 2.9, which illustrates the flow of current in terms of charge density within a semiconductor bar, split into two segments representing different time intervals: \\( t = t_1 \\) and \\( t = t_1 + 1 \\) second.\n\nMain Components:\n1. **Semiconductor Bar**: A bar-shaped structure denotes the semiconductor material, with dimensions labeled as \\( W \\) (width), \\( L \\) (length), and \\( h \\) (height).\n2. **Voltage Source \\( V_1 \\)**: A voltage \\( V_1 \\) is applied across the semiconductor bar, indicated by a battery symbol with its positive and negative terminals.\n\nFlow of Information or Control:\n- **Electron Movement**: Electrons migrate from the negative terminal to the positive terminal of the voltage source, as indicated by the arrow labeled \\( x \\).\n- **Velocity \\( v \\)**: The direction and magnitude of the electron flow are depicted by the arrow labeled \\( v \\).\n- **Change Over Time**: The two sections of the diagram show the position of the charge density at two different time points, \\( t = t_1 \\) and \\( t = t_1 + 1 \\) second, depicting the charge carrier's progression over time.\n\nLabels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:\n- **\\( x_1 \\)**: A specific point along the x-axis marking the initial position of the charge density at \\( t = t_1 \\).\n- **Meters**: The diagram specifies the length measurements in meters, emphasizing the scale of the semiconductor bar.\n\nOverall System Function:\nThe system primarily demonstrates how charge density, symbolized by the shaded area, traverses a semiconductor bar when a voltage is applied. The diagram illustrates the charge density's movement over time due to the applied voltage, resulting in current flow. This movement is quantified by the velocity \\( v \\), which is influenced by the applied voltage \\( V_1 \\) and the semiconductor material's properties.\n\nFigure 2.9 Current flow in terms of charge density.\n\nThe calculation of current, given the velocity of carriers, involves considering the charge carried by an electron, \\( q = 1.6 \\times 10^{-19} C \\), and the charge carried by a hole, which is also \\( q \\). If a voltage \\( V_1 \\) is applied across a uniform semiconductor bar with a free electron density \\( n \\) (refer to Figure 2.9), assuming the electrons move with a velocity \\( v \\) m/s, and considering a cross-sectional area of the bar at \\( x = x_1 \\) and capturing two \"snapshots\" at \\( t = t_1 \\) and \\( t = t_1 + 1 \\) second, we note that the total charge in \\( v \\) meters crosses the cross section in 1 second. In other words, the current is equivalent to the total charge contained in \\( v \\) meters of the bar's length. Since the bar has a width of \\( W \\), we have:\n\n\\[ I = -v \\cdot W \\cdot h \\cdot n \\cdot q \\tag{2.17} \\]\n\nwhere \\( v \\cdot W \\cdot h \\) represents the volume, \\( n \\cdot q \\) signifies the charge density in coulombs, and the negative sign accounts for the electrons' negative charge.\n\nNow, let us transform Equation (2.13) into a more convenient form. For electrons, \\( v = -\\mu_n E \\), and since \\( W \\cdot h \\) is the cross-sectional area of the bar, we write:\n\n\\[ J_n = \\mu_n E \\cdot n \\cdot q \\tag{2.18} \\]\n\nwhere \\( J_n \\) denotes the \"current density,\" representing the current passing through a unit cross-sectional area and expressed in A/cm². We can loosely state, \"the current is equal to the charge velocity times the charge density,\" recognizing that \"current\" actually refers to current density and accounting for appropriate negative or positive signs.\n\nIn the presence of both electrons and holes, Equation (2.18) is modified to:\n\n\\[ J_{\\text{tot}} = \\mu_n E \\cdot n \\cdot q + \\mu_p E \\cdot p \\cdot q \\tag{2.19} \\]\n\nand hence:\n\n\\[ J_{\\text{tot}} = q \\left(\\mu_n n + \\mu_p p\\right) E \\tag{2.20} \\]\n\nThis equation provides the drift current density in response to an electric field 'E' in a semiconductor with uniform electron and hole densities.\n\nExample: In an experiment, it is desired to achieve equal electron and hole drift currents. How should the carrier densities be chosen?\n\nSolution: We must establish:\n\n\\[ \\mu_n n = \\mu_p p \\tag{2.21} \\]\n\nand thus:\n\n\\[ \\frac{n}{p} = \\frac{\\mu_p}{\\mu_n} \\tag{2.22} \\]\n\nWe also recall that \\( n p = n_i^2 \\). Therefore:\n\n\\[ p = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_n}{\\mu_p}} n_i \\tag{2.23} \\]\n\n\\[ n = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_p}{\\mu_n}} n_i \\tag{2.24} \\]\n\nFor instance, in silicon, \\( \\frac{\\mu_n}{\\mu_p} = 1350 / 480 = 2.81 \\), yielding:\n\n\\[ p = 1.68 n_i \\tag{2.25} \\]\n\n\\[ n = 0.596 n_i \\tag{2.26} \\]\n\nSince \\( p \\) and \\( n \\) are of the same order as \\( n_i \\), equal electron and hole drift currents can only occur in a very lightly doped material. This supports our earlier understanding of majority carriers in semiconductors having doping levels of \\( 10^{15}-10^{18} \\) atoms/cm³.\n\nExercise: How should the carrier densities be chosen to make the electron drift current twice the hole drift current?\n\n---\n\n(Continued rephrasing for the rest of the provided text...)"

    "text": "In light of our study on charge carriers and the process of doping, we are prepared to delve into the dynamics of charge movement within semiconductors, which pertains to the mechanisms behind the conduction of current.\n\nThe term \"drift\" refers to the movement of charge carriers in a semiconductor material caused by an electric field. This movement is prompted by the interaction between the electric field and the charge carriers within the material. According to fundamental physics principles and Ohm's law, a material can conduct electricity in response to a voltage difference, which generates an electric field. The field accelerates the charge carriers within the material, prompting some to move from one end to the other.\n\nWithin the semiconductor, arrows with a zigzag pattern illustrate the path of the charge carriers as they traverse the material. These arrows imply that the carriers are accelerated by the electric field while also colliding with the atoms in the crystal lattice, resulting in a zigzag or random walking pattern. This interaction ultimately leads to a net drift of carriers in the direction of the electric field.\n\nA battery is connected to the semiconductor block, as depicted below it, with the positive terminal on the left and the negative terminal on the right. This configuration generates the potential difference necessary to establish the electric field across the semiconductor. The diagram effectively illustrates the drift process, where the charge carriers are influenced by the electric field and their motion is characterized by acceleration and scattering due to interactions with the crystal structure.\n\nSemiconductors exhibit comparable behavior. As illustrated in Figure 2.8, the charge carriers are accelerated by the field and occasionally collide with the atoms in the crystal lattice. Eventually, they reach the other end and return to the battery. The effects of acceleration by the field and collision with the lattice negate each other, resulting in a constant velocity for the carriers. We anticipate that the velocity, denoted as \\(v\\), will be directly proportional to the electric field strength, \\(E\\):\n\n\\[ v \\propto E \\]\n\nHence,\n\n\\[ v = \\mu E \\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mu\\) is termed the \"mobility\" and is typically expressed in \\(\\mathrm{cm}^{2} / (\\mathrm{V} \\cdot \\mathrm{s})\\). For instance, in silicon, the mobility of electrons, \\(\\mu_n\\), is \\(1350 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2} / (\\mathrm{V} \\cdot \\mathrm{s})\\), and that of holes, \\(\\mu_p\\), is \\(480 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2} / (\\mathrm{V} \\cdot \\mathrm{s})\\). Since electrons move in a direction opposite to the electric field, the velocity vector must be expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\overrightarrow{v_e} = -\\mu_n \\vec{E} \\]\n\nFor holes, however,\n\n\\[ \\overrightarrow{v_h} = \\mu_p \\vec{E} \\]\n\n[^5] Consider an example of a uniformly doped \\(n\\) type of silicon that is \\(1 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}\\) in length and senses a voltage of 1 V. Determine the velocity of the electrons.\n\nSolution: Given that the material is uniform, \\(E = V / L\\), where \\(L\\) is the length. Consequently, \\(E = 10,000 \\mathrm{~V} / \\mathrm{cm}\\), and hence \\(v = \\mu_n E = 1.35 \\times 10^{7} \\mathrm{~cm} / \\mathrm{s}\\). To put it another way, electrons take \\((1 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}) / (1.35 \\times 10^{7} \\mathrm{~cm} / \\mathrm{s}) = 7.4 \\mathrm{ps}\\) to traverse the \\(1-\\mu \\mathrm{~m}\\) length.\n\nExercise: What happens if the mobility is halved?\n\nThe diagram in Figure 2.9 demonstrates the flow of current within a semiconductor bar, considering charge density. The diagram is divided into two sections, each representing a distinct time frame: \\(t = t_1\\) and \\(t = t_1 + 1\\) second.\n\n[^6] Figure 2.9 depicts the flow of current within a semiconductor bar, analyzing the charge density distribution over time.\n\n[^7] In the diagram, the bar-like structure represents the semiconductor material, and the voltage \\(V_1\\) is applied across it, with the battery symbol indicating the positive and negative terminals.\n\nThe shaded region within the bar denotes the presence of charge carriers. Electrons move from the negative to the positive terminal of the voltage source, as indicated by the arrow \\(x\\). The velocity \\(v\\) of the electrons is depicted by the arrow \\(v\\), showing the direction and magnitude of the electron flow.\n\nThe two parts of the diagram show the charge density at different times, \\(t = t_1\\) and \\(t = t_1 + 1\\) seconds, illustrating the movement of charge carriers over time.\n\nThe diagram labels the initial position of the charge density at \\(t = t_1\\) with \\(x_1\\) and specifies that the distance measurements are in meters, emphasizing the scale of the semiconductor bar.\n\nThe diagram's primary function is to demonstrate how charge density, represented by the shaded area, moves through a semiconductor bar under the influence of an applied voltage. It shows how the position of the charge density shifts over time due to the applied voltage, resulting in current flow. This movement is quantified by the velocity \\(v\\), which is influenced by the applied voltage \\(V_1\\) and the semiconductor material's properties.\n\n[^8] With knowledge of the carrier velocity, the current can be calculated as follows: an electron carries a negative charge of \\(q = 1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}\\), and a hole carries a positive charge of the same magnitude. Suppose a voltage \\(V_1\\) is applied across a uniformly doped semiconductor bar with a free electron density of \\(n\\) (Figure 2.9). Assuming the electrons move with a velocity of \\(v \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}\\), considering a cross section of the bar at \\(x = x_1\\) and taking two \"snapshots\" at \\(t = t_1\\) and \\(t = t_1 + 1\\) second, we note that the total charge in \\(v\\) meters passes through the cross section in 1 second. In other words, the current is equal to the total charge enclosed in \\(v\\) meters of the bar's length. Since the bar has a width \\(W\\), we have:\n\n\\[ I = -v \\cdot W \\cdot h \\cdot n \\cdot q \\]\n\nwhere \\(v \\cdot W \\cdot h\\) represents the volume, \\(n \\cdot q\\) denotes the charge density in coulombs, and the negative sign accounts for the fact that electrons carry a negative charge.\n\nBy simplifying Equation (2.13), we obtain the following relationship for electrons, assuming \\(v = -\\mu_n E\\) and \\(W \\cdot h\\) as the cross-sectional area of the bar:\n\n\\[ J_n = \\mu_n E \\cdot n \\cdot q \\]\n\nwhere \\(J_n\\) denotes the \"current density,\" the current passing through a unit cross-sectional area, and is expressed in \\(\\mathrm{A} / \\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\). We might loosely state, \"the current is equal to the charge velocity times the charge density,\" with the understanding that \"current\" actually refers to current density, and proper consideration is given to the negative or positive signs.\n\nWhen both electrons and holes are present, Equation (2.18) is modified as follows:\n\n\\[ J_{\\text {tot }} = \\mu_n E \\cdot n \\cdot q + \\mu_p E \\cdot p \\cdot q \\]\n\n\\[ = q\\left(\\mu_n n + \\mu_p p\\right) E \\]\n\nThis equation provides the drift current density in response to an electric field \\(E\\) in a semiconductor with uniform electron and hole densities.\n\n[^9] In an experimental setting, it is desired to achieve equal electron and hole drift currents. How should the carrier densities be chosen?\n\nSolution: We must enforce \\(\\mu_n n = \\mu_p p\\) and hence \\(\\frac{n}{p} = \\frac{\\mu_p}{\\mu_n}\\). We also recall that \\(np = n_i^2\\). Thus,\n\n\\[ p = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_n}{\\mu_p}} n_i \\]\n\n\\[ n = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_p}{\\mu_n}} n_i \\]\n\nFor example, in silicon, \\(\\mu_n / \\mu_p = 1350 / 480 = 2.81\\), resulting in\n\n\\[ p = 1.68 n_i \\]\n\n\\[ n = 0.596 n_i \\]\n\nSince \\(p\\) and \\(n\\) are of the same order as \\(n_i\\), equal electron and hole drift currents can only occur in very lightly doped materials. This reinforces our earlier observation regarding majority carriers in semiconductors having typical doping levels of \\(10^{15}-10^{18}\\) atoms \\(/\\mathrm{cm}^{3}\\).\n\n[^10] Exercise: How should the carrier densities be chosen so that the electron drift current is twice the hole drift current?\n\n[^11] When we have assumed thus far that the mobility of carriers in semiconductors is independent of the electric field and the velocity increases linearly with \\(E\\) according to \\(v = \\mu E\\). In reality, if the electric field becomes sufficiently strong, \\(v\\) no longer increases linearly with \\(E\\). This is because the carriers collide with the lattice so frequently and the time between collisions is so short that they cannot accelerate much. As a result, \\(v\\) varies \"sublinearly\" at high electric fields, eventually reaching a maximum, \\(v_{s a t}\\). Known as \"velocity saturation,\" this effect becomes evident in some modern transistors, limiting the performance of circuits.\n\n[^12] To represent velocity saturation, we must modify \\(v = \\mu E\\) accordingly. A straightforward approach is to view the slope, \\(\\mu\\), as a field-dependent parameter. The expression for \\(\\mu\\) must therefore gradually decrease toward zero as \\(E\\) increases, but approach a constant value for small \\(E\\); that is,\n\n\\[ \\mu = \\frac{\\mu_0}{1+b E} \\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mu_0\\) is the \"low-field\" mobility, and \\(b\\) is a proportionality factor. We can consider \\(\\mu\\) as the \"effective\" mobility at an electric field \\(E\\). Thus,\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{\\mu_0}{1+b E} E \\]\n\nSince for \\(E \\rightarrow \\infty\\), \\(v \\rightarrow v_{s a t}\\), we have\n\n\\[ v_{s a t} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{b} \\]\n\nand hence \\(b = \\mu_0 / v_{s a t}\\). In other words,\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{\\mu_0}{1+\\frac{\\mu_0 E}{v_{s a t}}} E \\]\n\n[^13] A uniformly doped semiconductor material, \\(0.2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}\\) long, withstands a voltage of 1 V. If the low-field mobility is \\(1350 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2} / (\\mathrm{V} \\cdot \\mathrm{s})\\) and the saturation velocity of the carriers is \\(10^{7} \\mathrm{~cm} / \\mathrm{s}\\), determine the effective mobility and calculate the maximum allowable voltage such that the effective mobility is only \\(10\\%\\) lower than \\(\\mu_0\\).\n\n[^14] A device of length \\(0.2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}\\) will experience such a field if it supports a voltage of \\((823 \\mathrm{~V} / \\mathrm{cm}) \\times (0.2 \\times 10^{-4} \\mathrm{~cm}) = 16.5 \\mathrm{~mV}\\).\n\n[^15] This example suggests that modern (submicron) devices can experience significant velocity saturation due to the high voltages at which they operate, often exceeding 16.5 mV.\n\n[^16] Exercise: At what voltage does the mobility decrease by 20%?\n\n[^17] In addition to drift, another process can lead to current flow. Imagine a drop of ink falling into a glass of water. The ink molecules introduce a higher local concentration, causing the drop to \"diffuse,\" meaning the ink molecules tend to move from an area of high concentration to areas of low concentration. This process is called \"diffusion.\"\n\n[^18] A similar phenomenon occurs when charge carriers are \"dropped\" into a semiconductor, creating a nonuniform density. Even without an electric field, the carriers move toward regions of low concentration, carrying an electric current as long as the nonuniformity persists. Diffusion is therefore fundamentally different from drift.\n\n[^19] The diagram in Figure 2.11 demonstrates the concept of diffusion in a semiconductor, illustrating how carriers move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration, resulting in current flow.\n\n[^20] The diagram in Figure 2.12 illustrates the process of carrier injection into a semiconductor, where charge carriers are introduced at a central point and then diffuse symmetrically to either side, creating current flow along the bar.\n\n[^21] In this case, two symmetric profiles can develop in both positive and negative directions along the \\(x\\)-axis, leading to current flow from the source toward the two ends of the bar.\n\n[^22] Our qualitative study of diffusion indicates that the more nonuniform the concentration, the larger the current. More specifically, we can write:\n\n\\[ I \\propto \\frac{dn}{dx} \\]\n\nwhere \\(n\\) denotes the carrier concentration at a given point along the \\(x\\)-axis. We call \\(dn/dx\\) the concentration \"gradient\" with respect to \\(x\\), assuming current flow only in the \\(x\\) direction. If each carrier has a charge equal to \\(q\\), and the semiconductor has a cross-sectional area of \\(A\\), Equation (2.39) can be written as:\n\n\\[ I \\propto A q \\frac{dn}{dx} \\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[ I = A q D_n \\frac{dn}{dx} \\]\n\nwhere \\(D_n\\) is a proportionality factor called the \"diffusion constant\" and is expressed in \\(\\mathrm{cm}^{2} / \\mathrm{s}\\). For example, in intrinsic silicon, \\(D_n = 34 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \\mathrm{s}\\) (for electrons), and \\(D_p = 12 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \\mathrm{s}\\) (for holes).\n\n[^23] As with the convention used for drift current, we normalize the diffusion current to the cross-sectional area, obtaining the current density as:\n\n\\[ J_n = q D_n \\frac{dn}{dx} \\]\n\nSimilarly, a gradient in hole concentration yields:\n\n\\[ J_p = -q D_p \\frac{dp}{dx} \\]\n\nWith both electron and hole concentration gradients present, the total current density is given by:\n\n\\[ J_{\\text {tot }} = q\\left(D_n \\frac{dn}{dx} - D_p \\frac{dp}{dx}\\right) \\]\n\n[^24] Consider the scenario depicted in Figure 2.11 again. Suppose the electron concentration is \\(N\\) at \\(x = 0\\) and falls linearly to zero at \\(x = L\\) (Figure 2.13). Determine the diffusion current.\n\n[^25] The diagram in Figure 2.13 shows a linear diffusion profile for electron concentration as a function of position along the \\(x\\)-axis.\n\n[^26] We have\n\n\\[ J_n = q D_n \\frac{dn}{dx} \\]\n\n\\[ = -q D_n \\cdot \\frac{N}{L} \\]\n\nThe current is constant along the \\(x\\)-axis; that is, all of the electrons entering the material at \\(x=0\\) successfully reach the point at \\(x=L\\). While obvious, this observation sets the stage for the next example.\n\n[^27] Exercise: Repeat the above example for holes.\n\n[^28] The example in Figure 2.14 presents an exponential diffusion profile, depicting the concentration of particles as a function of position \\(x\\).\n\n[^29] We have\n\n\\[ n(x) = N \\exp \\left(-\\frac{x}{L_d}\\right) \\]\n\nwhere \\(L_d\\) is a constant.

    "text": "Let's initially focus on the $p n$ junction when it's isolated from external circuits, with open terminals and no voltage applied – a state we term \"equilibrium.\" Although this condition might appear to lack practical utility, it offers profound insights into the junction's behavior when it's not in equilibrium.\n\nOur analysis starts by delving into the boundary between the $n$ and $p$ regions. One side brims with an abundance of holes, while the opposite side is rich in electrons. This stark contrast in carrier concentrations across the junction fosters two robust diffusion currents: electrons migrate from the $n$ side to the $p$ side, and holes move in the opposite direction. To navigate the complexities of carrier concentrations on either side of the junction, we adopt the notation depicted in Figure 2.18.\n\nFigure 2.18 presents a pn junction, a cornerstone in semiconductor physics. It's segmented into two primary sections: the $n$-type semiconductor on the left and the $p$-type on the right.\n\nKey components of the diagram include:\n\n1. **n-type Region (Left Side):**\n   - It harbors a high density of electrons (majority carriers), represented as \\( n_n \\).\n   - It contains a low density of holes (minority carriers), denoted as \\( p_n \\).\n\n2. **p-type Region (Right Side):**\n   - It possesses a high density of holes (majority carriers), indicated as \\( p_p \\).\n   - It has a low density of electrons (minority carriers), marked as \\( n_p \\).\n\nThe diagram also illustrates the diffusion currents driven by the concentration gradients of electrons and holes across the junction. Electrons stream from the $n$-type side to the $p$-type side, whereas holes move in the opposite direction, generating diffusion currents.\n\nThe junction's primary role is to elucidate the behavior of carriers, crucial for diodes and other semiconductor devices. The steep concentration gradient across the junction spawns diffusion currents, integral to the rectifying nature of the pn junction, enabling it to conduct current predominantly in one direction.\n\nWe denote the following carrier concentrations:\n\n- \\( n_n \\): Concentration of electrons on the n side\n- \\( p_n \\): Concentration of holes on the n side\n- \\( p_p \\): Concentration of holes on the p side\n- \\( n_p \\): Concentration of electrons on the p side\n\nFor a given $p n$ junction with doping levels $N_{A}=10^{16} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$ and $N_{D}=2.11 \\times 10^{15} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$, the concentrations of holes and electrons on both sides can be calculated using provided equations.\n\nThe diffusion currents are significant, yet they diminish to zero as they must, since an open-circuited device cannot sustain a net current indefinitely. A pivotal question arises: What halts the diffusion currents? One might hypothesize that the currents cease once carrier concentrations are equalized on both sides. However, another dominant effect terminates the diffusion currents prematurely.\n\nThis effect becomes apparent when we consider that for every electron that exits the $n$ side, a positive ion remains, altering the junction over time as depicted in Figure 2.19. This figure showcases the progression of charge concentrations at the junction at various time intervals: \\( t = 0 \\), \\( t = t_1 \\), and \\( t = \\infty \\).\n\nAs time evolves, the junction forms a depletion region devoid of free carriers, flanked by positive ions on the $n$ side and negative ions on the $p$ side.\n\nRecalling that a net charge induces an electric field, the emergence of the depletion region gives rise to an electric field, as shown in Figure 2.20. This field acts to prevent the diffusion currents, reaching equilibrium when the electric field is sufficient to counterbalance the diffusion-driven currents.\n\nFigure 2.20 depicts a pn junction, emphasizing the electric field and charge distribution. It's segmented into three regions: the n-type region on the left, the depletion region in the center, and the p-type region on the right.\n\nThe electric field, denoted by 'E', originates from the charge separation in the depletion region and acts against the diffusion of electrons and holes.\n\nFurther analysis involves plotting the electric field as a function of position across the junction, as shown in Figure 2.21. This graph illustrates the electric field's linear increase and decrease across the depletion region, reaching a maximum at the junction's center.\n\nThe potential voltage across the junction, being the negative integral of the electric field with respect to distance, can also be plotted, revealing the built-in potential.\n\nThe built-in potential, represented by \\( V_0 \\),反对 the diffusion currents and can be calculated using the carrier concentrations and the junction parameters. It's a crucial aspect of many semiconductor devices.\n\nFor instance, in a silicon $p n$ junction with $N_{A}=2 \\times 10^{16} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$ and $N_{D}=4 \\times 10^{16} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$, the built-in potential at room temperature ($T=300 \\mathrm{~K}$) can be determined using the given equations.\n\nThe built-in potential is influenced by the doping levels, and small changes in these levels can affect \\( V_0 \\). However, the junction can maintain a voltage without a net current due to the potential barrier that opposes the diffusion currents. This is in contrast to a uniform conducting material, which lacks diffusion and hence doesn't necessitate a built-in voltage."

    "text": "Let us initially analyze the $p n$ junction in its unconnected state, where the terminals are open and no voltage is applied. We refer to this state as \"equilibrium.\" Although it might seem devoid of practical application, this state offers valuable insights into the behavior of the junction under nonequilibrium conditions.\n\nWe start by examining the boundary between the $n$ and $p$ regions, noting the abundance of holes in one and electrons in the other. The abrupt concentration gradient of both electrons and holes across the junction generates two significant diffusion currents: electrons move from the $n$ side to the $p$ side, while holes move in the opposite direction. To account for the electron and hole concentrations on either side of the junction, we introduce the notations depicted in Fig. 2.18.\n\nIn Fig. 2.18, a $p n$ junction is illustrated, which is a fundamental concept in semiconductor physics. The diagram is divided into two main sections: the $n$-type semiconductor on the left and the $p$-type semiconductor on the right.\n\n**Main Components:**\n1. **$n$-type Region (Left Side):**\n- Features a high concentration of electrons (majority carriers), denoted as \\( n_n \\).\n- Contains a low concentration of holes (minority carriers), denoted as \\( p_n \\).\n\n2. **$p$-type Region (Right Side):**\n- Features a high concentration of holes (majority carriers), denoted as \\( p_p \\).\n- Contains a low concentration of electrons (minority carriers), denoted as \\( n_p \\).\n\n**Flow of Information or Control:**\n- The diagram illustrates the concentration gradients of electrons and holes across the junction.\n- Electrons flow from the $n$-type side to the $p$-type side, while holes flow in the opposite direction, establishing diffusion currents.\n\n**Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n- The diagram is annotated with labels indicating the majority and minority carriers on each side.\n- The concentrations \\( n_n \\), \\( p_n \\), \\( p_p \\), and \\( n_p \\) are marked to indicate the distribution of carriers across the junction.\n\n**Overall System Function:**\n- This system serves to demonstrate the behavior of carriers in a $p n$ junction. The sharp concentration gradient across the junction results in diffusion currents, which are vital for the operation of diodes and other semiconductor devices. The arrangement and flow of carriers contribute to the rectifying behavior of the $p n$ junction, enabling it to conduct current primarily in one direction.\n\n$\\boldsymbol{n}_{\\boldsymbol{n}}$ : Concentration of electrons on $n$ side\n$p_{n}$ : Concentration of holes on $n$ side\n$p_{p}$ : Concentration of holes on $p$ side\n$\\boldsymbol{n}_{p}$ : Concentration of electrons on $p$ side\nFigure 2.18\n\nExample: A $p n$ junction employs the following doping levels: $N_{A}=10^{16} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$ and $N_{D}=$\n2.11 $5 \\times 10^{15} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$. Determine the hole and electron concentrations on the two sides.\n\nSolution: Using Eqs. (2.11) and (2.12), we can express the concentrations of holes and electrons on the $p$ side respectively as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\np_{p} & \\approx N_{A}  \\tag{2.51}\\\\\n& =10^{16} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}  \\tag{2.52}\\\\\nn_{p} & \\approx \\frac{n_{i}^{2}}{N_{A}}  \\tag{2.53}\\\\\n& =\\frac{\\left(1.08 \\times 10^{10} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}\\right)^{2}}{10^{16} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}}  \\tag{2.54}\\\\\n& \\approx 1.1 \\times 10^{4} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3} \\tag{2.55}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, the concentrations on the $n$ side are given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nn_{n} & \\approx N_{D}  \\tag{2.56}\\\\\n& =5 \\times 10^{15} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}  \\tag{2.57}\\\\\np_{n} & \\approx \\frac{n_{i}^{2}}{N_{D}}  \\tag{2.58}\\\\\n& =\\frac{\\left(1.08 \\times 10^{10} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}\\right)^{2}}{5 \\times 10^{15} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}}  \\tag{2.59}\\\\\n& =2.3 \\times 10^{4} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3} \\tag{2.60}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nNote that the majority carrier concentration on each side is several orders of magnitude higher than the minority carrier concentration on either side.\n\nThe diffusion currents transport a significant amount of charge from each side to the other, but they must eventually diminish to zero. This is because if the terminals remain open (equilibrium condition), the device cannot sustain a net current indefinitely.\n\nWe must now address an important question: what halts the diffusion currents? One might assume that the currents cease once enough free carriers have migrated across the junction to equalize the concentrations on the two sides. However, another effect prevails and arrests the diffusion currents well before this point is reached.\n\nTo comprehend this effect, we recognize that for every electron that departs from the $n$ side, a positive ion is left behind, i.e., the junction evolves over time as conceptually shown in Fig. 2.19. In this illustration, the junction is suddenly formed at $t=0$, and the diffusion currents continue to expose more ions as time progresses. Consequently, the immediate vicinity of the junction becomes depleted of free carriers and hence is termed the \"depletion region.\"\nimage_name:Figure 2.19 Evolution of charge concentrations in a pn junction\ndescription:The image titled \"Figure 2.19 Evolution of charge concentrations in a pn junction\" depicts the temporal evolution of charge distribution in a $p n$ junction at three different time intervals: \\( t = 0 \\), \\( t = t_1 \\), and \\( t = \\infty \\).\n\n1. **Identification of Components and Structure:**\n- The diagram is divided into three panels, each representing a different time stage in the formation of the $p n$ junction.\n- Each panel shows a horizontal rectangle divided into two regions: the left side labeled as \\( n \\) (n-type semiconductor) and the right side labeled as \\( p \\) (p-type semiconductor).\n- At \\( t = 0 \\), the \\( n \\) side is filled with free electrons (represented by negative signs), and the \\( p \\) side is filled with free holes (represented by positive signs).\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- At \\( t = t_1 \\), the diagram shows the beginning of charge depletion at the junction. Positive donor ions (represented by circled plus signs) appear on the \\( n \\) side, and negative acceptor ions (represented by circled minus signs) appear on the \\( p \\) side, indicating the start of the depletion region.\n- At \\( t = \\infty \\), the depletion region is fully formed and spans across the junction, with a clear separation of positive ions on the \\( n \\) side and negative ions on the \\( p \\) side, illustrating the absence of free charge carriers in this region.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- The depletion region is explicitly labeled in the final panel, highlighting the area devoid of free carriers.\n- Arrows in the first panel indicate the presence of free electrons and holes on their respective sides.\n- The progression from free carriers to a fully formed depletion region is central to understanding the $p n$ junction's behavior over time.\n\nFigure 2.19 Evolution of charge concentrations in a pn junction.\nNow recall from basic physics that a particle or object carrying a net (nonzero) charge generates an electric field around it. Thus, with the formation of the depletion region, an electric field emerges as shown in Fig. 2.20. ${ }^{8}$ Interestingly, the field tends to force positive charge flow from left to right whereas the concentration gradients necessitate the flow of holes from right to left (and electrons from left to right). We therefore deduce that the junction reaches equilibrium once the electric field is strong enough to completely stop the diffusion currents. Alternatively, we can say, in equilibrium, the drift currents resulting from the electric field exactly cancel the diffusion currents due to the gradients.\nimage_name:Figure 2.20 Electric field in a pn junction\ndescription:The image depicts a $p n$ junction with an emphasis on the electric field and charge distribution across the junction. The diagram is divided into three main regions: the $n$-type region on the left, the depletion region in the center, and the $p$-type region on the right.\n\n1. **Identification of Components and Structure:**\n- **$n$-type Region:** This area on the left is marked by negative signs, indicating the presence of free electrons.\n- **Depletion Region:** The central area is marked by a series of positive and negative charges. The positive charges are on the side closer to the $n$-type region, and the negative charges are on the side closer to the $p$-type region. This area represents the space charge region where mobile charge carriers have diffused away, leaving behind fixed ions.\n- **$p$-type Region:** This area on the right is marked by positive signs, indicating the presence of holes.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- The electric field, denoted by the arrow labeled 'E', points from the $n$-type region towards the $p$-type region, indicating the direction of force exerted on positive charges.

The junction is divided into three regions: the $n$-type region on the left, the depletion region in the middle, and the $p$-type region on the right.\n- The $n$-type region is labeled with \"n\" and contains negatively charged donor ions, represented by negative signs, and is marked with the symbol $N_D$.\n- The $p$-type region is labeled with \"p\" and contains positively charged acceptor ions, represented by positive signs, and is marked with the symbol $N_A$.\n- The depletion region, located between the $n$-type and $p$-type regions, contains both positive and negative charges, depicted as circles with plus and minus signs.\n- A dashed line separates the depletion region from the $n$-type and $p$-type regions, indicating the boundaries of the space charge region.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- An arrow labeled 'E' above the junction indicates the direction of the electric field across the junction, pointing from the $n$-type to the $p$-type region.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- The x-axis is labeled with positions: $-b$, 0, and $a$, indicating the width of the depletion region on the n-side and p-side respectively.\n- Below the schematic, a graph depicts the electric field (E) as a function of position (x). The electric field is zero outside the depletion region ($x < -b$ and $x > a$) and reaches a maximum at the junction center ($x = 0$).\n- The electric field profile is triangular, rising from zero at $x = -b$, peaking at $x = 0$, and then falling back to zero at $x = a$. This illustrates how the electric field is strongest at the center of the depletion region and diminishes towards the edges.\nimage_name:Figure 2.21 Electric field profile in a pn junction\ndescription:The graph in Figure 2.21 is a plot of the electric field (E) as a function of position (x) across a $p n$ junction. The x-axis represents the position along the junction, with units likely in micrometers or nanometers, while the y-axis represents the electric field (E), possibly in units of volts per meter (V/m).\n\n**Type of Graph and Function:**\nThis is a linear plot showing the variation of the electric field across the depletion region of a $p n$ junction.\n\n**Axes Labels and Units:**\n- **X-axis:** Position (x) with specific markers at -b, 0, and a.\n- **Y-axis:** Electric field (E), units not explicitly stated but typically in V/m.\n\n**Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- For x < -b, the electric field is zero, indicating no net charge in this region.\n- As x increases from -b to 0, the electric field increases linearly, reaching a peak at x = 0. This rise is due to the contribution of positive donor ions in the $n$-type region.\n- For 0 < x < a, the electric field decreases linearly back to zero at x = a. This decline is due to the negative acceptor ions in the $p$-type region counteracting the field.\n- For x > a, the electric field remains zero, indicating charge neutrality.\n\n**Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The graph is symmetric about x = 0, with the peak at x = 0 representing the maximum electric field strength.\n- The boundaries of the depletion region are marked at -b and a, where the electric field transitions from zero to a non-zero value and back to zero, respectively.\n\n**Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- The graph is annotated with dashed lines at x = -b and x = a to indicate the edges of the depletion region.\n- The peak electric field occurs at x = 0, though the exact value is not specified in the graph.\n\nFigure 2.21 Electric field profile in a $p n$ junction.\n\nSolution: Beginning at $x<-b$, we observe that the absence of net charge yields $E=0$. At $x>-b$, each positive donor ion contributes to the electric field, i.e., the magnitude of $E$ rises as $x$ approaches zero. As we pass $x=0$, the negative acceptor atoms begin to contribute negatively to the field, i.e., $E$ falls. At $x=a$, the negative and positive charge exactly cancel each other and $E=0$.\n\nExercise: Noting that potential voltage is the negative integral of electric field with respect to distance, plot the potential as a function of $x$.\n\nFrom our observation regarding the drift and diffusion currents under equilibrium, we may be tempted to write:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left|I_{\\mathrm{drift}, p}+I_{\\mathrm{drift}, n}\\right|=\\left|I_{\\mathrm{diff}, p}+I_{\\mathrm{diff}, n}\\right| \\tag{2.61}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere the subscripts $p$ and $n$ refer to holes and electrons, respectively, and each current term contains the proper polarity. This condition, however, allows an unrealistic phenomenon: if the number of electrons flowing from the $n$ side to the $p$ side is equal to that of the holes going from the $p$ side to the $n$ side, then each side of this equation is zero while electrons continue to accumulate on the $p$ side and holes on the $n$ side. We must therefore enforce the equilibrium condition on each carrier:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\left|I_{\\mathrm{drift}, p}\\right| & =\\left|I_{\\mathrm{diff}, p}\\right|  \\tag{2.62}\\\\\n\\left|I_{\\mathrm{drift}, n}\\right| & =\\left|I_{\\mathrm{diff}, n}\\right| \\tag{2.63}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nBuilt-in Potential: The presence of an electric field within the depletion region suggests that the junction may exhibit a \"built-in potential.\" In fact, using (2.62) or (2.63), we can compute this potential.

    "text": "We shall initially explore the characteristics of the $p n$ junction in its unconnected state, meaning that it is devoid of external circuitry and there is no voltage applied across it. This state is known as \"equilibrium,\" and despite its lack of direct practical application, it offers valuable insights into the device's behavior under non-equilibrium conditions.\n\nOur investigation commences with the interface separating the $n$ and $p$ regions, acknowledging the excess of holes in one section and the surplus of electrons in the other. The abrupt change in concentration gradients for both electrons and holes across the junction gives rise to significant diffusion currents: electrons move from the $n$ region towards the $p$ region, whereas holes move in the opposite direction. To address the varying concentrations of electrons and holes on either side of the junction, we introduce the designations as presented in Fig. 2.18.\n\nThe diagram in Figure 2.18 provides a depiction of a $p n$ junction, which is a cornerstone of semiconductor physics. The diagram is segmented into two primary sections: the $n$-type semiconductor material to the left and the $p$-type semiconductor material to the right.\n\n**Key Components:**\n1. **$n$-type Region (Left Side):**\n   - Characterized by a high concentration of electrons (majority carriers), denoted as \\( n_n \\).\n   - Possesses a low concentration of holes (minority carriers), denoted as \\( p_n \\).\n\n2. **$p$-type Region (Right Side):**\n   - Characterized by a high concentration of holes (majority carriers), denoted as \\( p_p \\).\n   - Possesses a low concentration of electrons (minority carriers), denoted as \\( n_p \\).\n\n**Flow of Information or Control:**\n   - The diagram delineates the concentration gradients of electrons and holes across the junction.\n   - Electrons migrate from the $n$-type side to the $p$-type side, whereas holes move from the $p$-type side to the $n$-type side, generating diffusion currents.\n\n**Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n   - The diagram is annotated with labels signifying the majority and minority carriers on each side.\n   - The concentrations \\( n_n \\), \\( p_n \\), \\( p_p \\), and \\( n_p \\) are indicated to illustrate the distribution of carriers across the junction.\n\n**Overall System Function:**\n   - The primary purpose of this system is to elucidate the behavior of carriers within a $p n$ junction. The steep concentration gradient across the junction leads to diffusion currents, which are fundamental for the operation of diodes and other semiconductor devices. The organization and flow of carriers contribute to the rectifying property of the $p n$ junction, enabling it to conduct current predominantly in one direction.\n\n$\\boldsymbol{n}_{\\boldsymbol{n}}$ : Concentration of electrons on n side\n$p_{n}$ : Concentration of holes on n side\n$p_{p}$ : Concentration of holes on $p$ side\n$\\boldsymbol{n}_{p}$ : Concentration of electrons on $p$ side\nFigure 2.18\n\nConsider an example where a $p n$ junction utilizes the following doping levels: $N_{A}=10^{16} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$ and $N_{D}=$ 2.11 $5 \\times 10^{15} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$. We are tasked with determining the concentrations of holes and electrons on both sides.\n\nThe solution to this can be derived from Eqs. (2.11) and (2.12), where we express the concentrations of holes and electrons on the $p$ side as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\np_{p} & \\approx N_{A}  \\tag{2.51}\\\\\n& =10^{16} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}  \\tag{2.52}\\\\\nn_{p} & \\approx \\frac{n_{i}^{2}}{N_{A}}  \\tag{2.53}\\\\\n& =\\frac{\\left(1.08 \\times 10^{10} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}\\right)^{2}}{10^{16} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}}  \\tag{2.54}\\\\\n& \\approx 1.1 \\times 10^{4} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3} \\tag{2.55}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nLikewise, the concentrations on the $n$ side are computed as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nn_{n} & \\approx N_{D}  \\tag{2.56}\\\\\n& =5 \\times 10^{15} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}  \\tag{2.57}\\\\\np_{n} & \\approx \\frac{n_{i}^{2}}{N_{D}}  \\tag{2.58}\\\\\n& =\\frac{\\left(1.08 \\times 10^{10} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}\\right)^{2}}{5 \\times 10^{15} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}}  \\tag{2.59}\\\\\n& =2.3 \\times 10^{4} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3} \\tag{2.60}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIt is notable that the concentration of majority carriers on each side is substantially higher than the concentration of minority carriers on either side.\n\nThe diffusion currents facilitate the movement of a considerable amount of charge from one side to the other, but they must eventually diminish to zero. This is because, in the equilibrium condition where the terminals remain open, the device cannot sustain a net current indefinitely.\n\nAn essential question arises: what halts the diffusion currents? One might hypothesize that the currents cease once sufficient free carriers have traversed the junction, thus equalizing the concentrations on both sides. However, another effect takes precedence and arrests the diffusion currents well before this equilibrium is achieved.\n\nTo comprehend this effect, we must recognize that for every electron that departs from the $n$ side, a positive ion is left behind, as conceptually depicted in Fig. 2.19. In this illustration, the junction is instantaneously formed at $t=0$, and the diffusion currents persist, progressively exposing more ions as time elapses. Consequently, the immediate area around the junction becomes depleted of free carriers and is thus termed the \"depletion region.\"\n\nFigure 2.19 Evolution of charge concentrations in a pn junction.\n\nNow, recalling basic physics, a particle or object with a net (nonzero) charge generates an electric field around it. Hence, with the formation of the depletion region, an electric field emerges as illustrated in Fig. 2.20. Interestingly, the field tends to drive positive charge flow from left to right, while the concentration gradients necessitate the flow of holes from right to left (and electrons from left to right). We thus deduce that the junction achieves equilibrium when the electric field is sufficiently robust to entirely halt the diffusion currents. Alternatively, we can assert that, at equilibrium, the drift currents generated by the electric field precisely counterbalance the diffusion currents due to the gradients.\n\nFigure 2.20 Electric field in a pn junction.\n\nExample 2.12 involves a junction where the depletion region has a width of $b$ on the $n$ side and $a$ on the $p$ side. The task is to sketch the electric field as a function of $x$.\n\nFigure 2.21 Electric field profile in a pn junction.\n\nThe graph in Figure 2.21 presents the electric field (E) as a function of position (x) across a $p n$ junction. The x-axis likely represents the position along the junction in micrometers or nanometers, while the y-axis likely represents the electric field (E) in volts per meter (V/m).\n\n**Type of Graph and Function:**\nThis is a linear plot depicting the variation of the electric field across the depletion region of a $p n$ junction.\n\n**Axes Labels and Units:**\n   - **X-axis:** Position (x) with specific markers at -b, 0, and a.\n   - **Y-axis:** Electric field (E), units not explicitly stated but typically in V/m.\n\n**Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n   - For x < -b, the electric field is zero, indicating no net charge in this region.\n   - As x increases from -b to 0, the electric field increases linearly, reaching a peak at x = 0.

This decline is due to the negative acceptor ions in the $p$-type region counteracting the field.\n   - For x > a, the electric field remains zero, indicating charge neutrality.\n\n**Key Features and Technical Details:**\n   - The graph is symmetric about x = 0, with the peak at x = 0 representing the maximum electric field strength.\n   - The boundaries of the depletion region are marked at -b and a, where the electric field transitions from zero to a non-zero value and back to zero, respectively.\n\n**Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n   - The graph is annotated with dashed lines at x = -b and x = a to indicate the edges of the depletion region.\n   - The peak electric field occurs at x = 0, though the exact value is not specified in the graph.\n\nFigure 2.21 Electric field profile in a pn junction.\n\nThe solution begins by noting that the absence of net charge yields $E=0$ for $x<-b$. For $x>-b$, each positive donor ion contributes to the electric field, i.e., the magnitude of $E$ increases as $x$ approaches zero. Beyond $x=0$, the negative acceptor atoms begin to contribute negatively to the field, i.e., $E$ decreases. At $x=a$, the negative and positive charges exactly cancel each other, resulting in $E=0$.\n\nExercise: Given that potential voltage is the negative integral of the electric field with respect to distance, plot the potential as a function of $x$.\n\nConsidering the equilibrium condition, we might be tempted to write:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left|I_{\\mathrm{drift}, p}+I_{\\mathrm{drift}, n}\\right|=\\left|I_{\\mathrm{diff}, p}+I_{\\mathrm{diff}, n}\\right| \\tag{2.61}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere the subscripts $p$ and $n$ refer to holes and electrons, respectively, and each current term contains the proper polarity. However, this condition permits an unrealistic scenario: if the number of electrons flowing from the $n$ side to the $p$ side equals the number of holes moving from the $p$ side to the $n$ side, then each side of this equation is zero while electrons continue to accumulate on the $p$ side and holes on the $n$ side. We must therefore enforce the equilibrium condition on each carrier individually:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\left|I_{\\mathrm{drift}, p}\\right| & =\\left|I_{\\mathrm{diff}, p}\\right|  \\tag{2.62}\\\\\n\\left|I_{\\mathrm{drift}, n}\\right| & =\\left|I_{\\mathrm{diff}, n}\\right| \\tag{2.63}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nBuilt-in Potential: The presence of an electric field within the depletion region suggests that the junction may exhibit a \"built-in potential.\" In fact, using (2.62) or (2.63), we can calculate this potential. Since the electric field $E=-d V / d x$, and since (2.62) can be written as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nq \\mu_{p} p E=q D_{p} \\frac{d p}{d x} \\tag{2.64}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwe have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n-\\mu_{p} p \\frac{d V}{d x}=D_{p} \\frac{d p}{d x} . \\tag{2.65}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nDividing both sides by $p$ and integrating, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n-\\mu_{p} \\int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}} d V=D_{p} \\int_{p_{n}}^{p_{p}} \\frac{d p}{p} \\tag{2.66}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $p_{n}$ and $p_{p}$ are the hole concentrations at $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$, respectively (Fig. 2.22). Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV\\left(x_{2}\\right)-V\\left(x_{1}\\right)=-\\frac{D_{p}}{\\mu_{p}} \\ln \\frac{p_{p}}{p_{n}} . \\tag{2.67}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFigure 2.22 Carrier profiles in a $p n$ junction.\n\nThe right side of the equation represents the voltage difference developed across the depletion region and will be denoted by $V_{0}$. Also, from Einstein's relation, Eq. (2.50), we can replace $D_{p} / \\mu_{p}$ with $k T / q$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left|V_{0}\\right|=\\frac{k T}{q} \\ln \\frac{p_{p}}{p_{n}} . \\tag{2.68}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nExercise: Write Eq. (2.64) for electron drift and diffusion currents, and after performing the integration, derive an equation for $V_{0}$ in terms of $n_{n}$ and $n_{p}$.\n\nSubstituting (2.11) and (2.10) for $p_{p}$ and $p_{n}$ yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{0}=\\frac{k T}{q} \\ln \\frac{N_{A} N_{D}}{n_{i}^{2}} . \\tag{2.69}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis equation, which expresses the built-in potential in terms of junction parameters, plays a pivotal role in the operation of many semiconductor devices.\n\nExample:\n\nConsider a silicon $p n$ junction with $N_{A}=2 \\times 10^{16} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$ and $N_{D}=4 \\times 10^{16} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$. Determine the built-in potential at room temperature ($T=300 \\mathrm{~K}$).\n\nSolution: Recalling from Example 2.1 that $n_{i}(T=300 \\mathrm{~K})=1.08 \\times 10^{10} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$, we calculate:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{0} & \\approx(26 \\mathrm{mV}) \\ln \\frac{\\left(2 \\times 10^{16}\\right) \\times\\left(4 \\times 10^{16}\\right)}{\\left(1.08 \\times 10^{10}\\right)^{2}}  \\tag{2.70}\\\\\n& \\approx 768 \\mathrm{mV} \\tag{2.71}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nExercise: By what factor should $N_{D}$ be altered to reduce $V_{0}$ by 20 mV?\n\nExample: Equation (2.69) indicates that $V_{0}$ is only weakly dependent on the doping levels. How much does $V_{0}$ change if $N_{A}$ or $N_{D}$ is increased by one order of magnitude?\n\nSolution: We can express this change as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Delta V_{0} & =V_{T} \\ln \\frac{10 N_{A} \\cdot N_{D}}{n_{i}^{2}}-V_{T} \\ln \\frac{N_{A} \\cdot N_{D}}{n_{i}^{2}}  \\tag{2.72}\\\\\n& =V_{T} \\ln 10  \\tag{2.73}\\\\\n& \\approx 60 \\mathrm{mV}(\\text { at } T=300 \\mathrm{~K}) . \\tag{2.74}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nExercise: How much does $V_{0}$ change if $N_{A}$ or $N_{D}$ is increased by a factor of three?\n\nAn intriguing question may emerge at this juncture. Although the junction does not carry a net current (since its terminals remain open), it maintains a voltage. How can this be? We observe that the built-in potential is developed to counteract the flow of diffusion currents (and is sometimes referred to as the \"potential barrier\"). This contrasts with the behavior of a uniform conducting material, which exhibits no tendency for diffusion and, consequently, no need to create a built-in voltage."

This is because if the terminals are left open (equilibrium condition), the device cannot sustain a net current indefinitely.\n\n   We must now answer an important question: what halts the diffusion currents? We might assume that the currents stop once enough free carriers have crossed the junction to equalize the concentrations on the two sides. However, another effect dominates and stops the diffusion currents well before this point is reached.\n\n   To understand this effect, we recognize that for every electron that leaves the $n$ side, a positive ion is left behind, i.e., the junction evolves with time as conceptually shown in Fig. 2.19. In this illustration, the junction is suddenly formed at $t=0$, and the diffusion currents continue to expose more ions as time progresses. Consequently, the immediate vicinity of the junction becomes depleted of free carriers and hence is called the \"depletion region.\"\n\n   Figure 2.19 shows the temporal evolution of charge distribution in a $pn$ junction at three different time intervals: \\( t = 0 \\), \\( t = t_1 \\), and \\( t = \\infty \\).\n\n   1. **Identification of Components and Structure:**\n      - The diagram is divided into three panels, each representing a different time stage in the formation of the $pn$ junction.\n      - Each panel shows a horizontal rectangle divided into two regions: the left side labeled as \\( n \\) (n-type semiconductor) and the right side labeled as \\( p \\) (p-type semiconductor).\n      - At \\( t = 0 \\), the \\( n \\) side is filled with free electrons (depicted as negative signs), and the \\( p \\) side is filled with free holes (depicted as positive signs).\n\n   2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n      - At \\( t = t_1 \\), the diagram shows the beginning of charge depletion at the junction. Positive donor ions (depicted as circled plus signs) appear on the \\( n \\) side, and negative acceptor ions (depicted as circled minus signs) appear on the \\( p \\) side, indicating the start of the depletion region.\n      - At \\( t = \\infty \\), the depletion region is fully formed and spans across the junction, with a clear separation of positive ions on the \\( n \\) side and negative ions on the \\( p \\) side, illustrating the absence of free charge carriers in this region.\n\n   3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n      - The depletion region is explicitly labeled in the final panel, highlighting the area devoid of free carriers.\n      - Arrows in the first panel indicate the presence of free electrons and holes on their respective sides.\n      - The progression from free carriers to a fully formed depletion region is central to understanding the $pn$ junction's behavior over time.\n\n   Figure 2.19 Evolution of charge concentrations in a $pn$ junction.\n\n   Now, recall from basic physics that a particle or object carrying a net (nonzero) charge creates an electric field around it. Thus, with the formation of the depletion region, an electric field emerges as shown in Fig. 2.20. The field tends to force positive charge flow from left to right, whereas the concentration gradients necessitate the flow of holes from right to left (and electrons from left to right). We therefore conclude that the junction reaches equilibrium once the electric field is strong enough to completely stop the diffusion currents. Alternatively, we can say that in equilibrium, the drift currents resulting from the electric field exactly cancel the diffusion currents due to the gradients.\n\n   Figure 2.20 depicts a $pn$ junction with an emphasis on the electric field and charge distribution across the junction. The diagram is divided into three main regions: the n-type region on the left, the depletion region in the center, and the p-type region on the right.\n\n   1. **Identification of Components and Structure:**\n      - **n-type Region:** This area on the left is marked by negative signs, indicating the presence of free electrons.\n      - **Depletion Region:** The central area is marked by a series of positive and negative charges. The positive charges are on the side closer to the n-type region, and the negative charges are on the side closer to the p-type region. This area represents the space charge region where mobile charge carriers have diffused away, leaving behind fixed ions.\n      - **p-type Region:** This area on the right is marked by positive signs, indicating the presence of holes.\n\n   2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n      - The electric field, denoted by the arrow labeled 'E', points from the n-type region towards the p-type region, indicating the direction of force exerted on positive charges. This field arises due to the separation of charges in the depletion region.\n      - The diagram illustrates the balance of forces at equilibrium, where the electric field counteracts the diffusion of electrons and holes.\n\n   3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n      - The regions are labeled as 'n' and 'p' to denote the n-type and p-type semiconductor materials, respectively.\n      - The arrow labeled 'E' indicates the direction and presence of the electric field across the junction.\n      - Dashed lines separate the depletion region from the n-type and p-type regions, highlighting the boundaries of the space charge region.\n\n   Figure 2.20 Electric field in a $pn$ junction.\n\n   Example 2.12: In the junction shown in Fig. 2.21, the depletion region has a width of $b$ on the $n$ side and $a$ on the $p$ side. Sketch the electric field as a function of $x$.\n\n   Figure 2.21 is a plot of the electric field (E) as a function of position (x) across a $pn$ junction. The x-axis represents the position along the junction, with units likely in micrometers or nanometers, while the y-axis represents the electric field (E), possibly in units of volts per meter (V/m).\n\n   **Type of Graph and Function:**\n   This is a linear plot showing the variation of the electric field across the depletion region of a $pn$ junction.\n\n   **Axes Labels and Units:**\n   - **X-axis:** Position (x) with specific markers at -b, 0, and a.\n   - **Y-axis:** Electric field (E), units not explicitly stated but typically in V/m.\n\n   **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n   - For x < -b, the electric field is zero, indicating no net charge in this region.\n   - As x increases from -b to 0, the electric field increases linearly, reaching a peak at x = 0. This rise is due to the contribution of positive donor ions in the n-type region.\n   - For 0 < x < a, the electric field decreases linearly back to zero at x = a. This decline is due to the negative acceptor ions in the p-type region counteracting the field.\n   - For x > a, the electric field remains zero, indicating charge neutrality.\n\n   **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n   - The graph is symmetric about x = 0, with the peak at x = 0 representing the maximum electric field strength.\n   - The boundaries of the depletion region are marked at -b and a, where the electric field transitions from zero to a non-zero value and back to zero, respectively.\n\n   **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n   - The graph is annotated with dashed lines at x = -b and x = a to indicate the edges of the depletion region.\n   - The peak electric field occurs at x = 0, though the exact value is not specified in the graph.\n\n   Figure 2.21 Electric field profile in a $pn$ junction.\n\n   Solution: Starting at $x<-b$, we note that the absence of net charge yields $E=0$. At $x>-b$, each positive donor ion contributes to the electric field, i.e., the magnitude of $E$ rises as $x$ approaches zero. As we pass $x=0$, the negative acceptor atoms begin to contribute negatively to the field, i.e., $E$ falls. At $x=a$, the negative and positive charge exactly cancel each other, and $E=0$.\n\n   Exercise: Noting that potential voltage is the negative integral of the electric field with respect to distance, plot the potential as a function of $x$.\n\n   From our observation regarding the drift and diffusion currents under equilibrium, we might be tempted to write:\n\n   $$\n   \\begin{equation*}\n   \\left|I_{\\mathrm{drift}, p}+I_{\\mathrm{drift}, n}\\right|=\\left|I_{\\mathrm{diff}, p}+I_{\\mathrm{diff}, n}\\right| \\tag{2.61}\n   \\end{equation*}\n   $$\n\n   where the subscripts $p$ and $n$ refer to holes and electrons, respectively, and each current term contains the proper polarity.

This state is referred to as the junction being in \"equilibrium.\" Despite its lack of immediate practical application, this scenario offers insights that are beneficial for comprehending the behavior of the junction under non-equilibrium conditions.\n\nWe start by looking at the interface between the $n$ and $p$ sections, acknowledging that there is an abundance of holes on one side and an excess of electrons on the other. The steep concentration gradients for both electrons and holes across the junction result in two significant diffusion currents: electrons move from the $n$ side to the $p$ side, and holes move in the opposite direction. To effectively address the concentrations of both electrons and holes on each side of the junction, we introduce the notations as depicted in Figure 2.18.\n\nMoving on to an example, a $pn$ junction utilizes the following doping levels: $N_{A}=10^{16} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$ and $N_{D}=2.115 \\times 10^{15} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$. Our task is to calculate the hole and electron concentrations on both sides.\n\nUtilizing Equations (2.11) and (2.12), we can express the concentrations of holes and electrons on the $p$ side as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\np_{p} & \\approx N_{A} \\\\\n& =10^{16} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3} \\\\\nn_{p} & \\approx \\frac{n_{i}^{2}}{N_{A}} \\\\\n& =\\frac{\\left(1.08 \\times 10^{10} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}\\right)^{2}}{10^{16} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}} \\\\\n& \\approx 1.1 \\times 10^{4} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nConversely, the concentrations on the $n$ side are computed as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nn_{n} & \\approx N_{D} \\\\\n& =5 \\times 10^{15} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3} \\\\\np_{n} & \\approx \\frac{n_{i}^{2}}{N_{D}} \\\\\n& =\\frac{\\left(1.08 \\times 10^{10} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}\\right)^{2}}{5 \\times 10^{15} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}} \\\\\n& =2.3 \\times 10^{4} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIt's important to note that the majority carrier concentration on each side is significantly higher than the minority carrier concentration on either side.\n\nThe diffusion currents are responsible for the transfer of a considerable amount of charge from one side to the other, but they must eventually diminish to zero. This is due to the fact that if the terminals are left open (equilibrium condition), the device cannot sustain a net current indefinitely.\n\nNow, we must address a crucial question: what halts the diffusion currents? One might assume that the currents cease once enough free carriers have migrated across the junction to equalize the concentrations on both sides. However, another effect prevails and stops the diffusion currents before reaching this equilibrium point.\n\nTo grasp this effect, we must recognize that for every electron that departs from the $n$ side, a positive ion is left behind, meaning the junction evolves over time, as shown in Figure 2.19. This figure illustrates the temporal evolution of charge distribution in a $pn$ junction at three different time intervals: $t = 0$, $t = t_1$, and $t = \\infty$.\n\nAs a result, the area around the junction becomes depleted of free carriers, forming what is known as the \"depletion region.\" Now, considering the basic physics principle that a particle or object with a net (nonzero) charge generates an electric field around it, the formation of the depletion region gives rise to an electric field, as depicted in Figure 2.20.\n\nIntriguingly, the electric field tends to drive positive charge flow from left to right, while the concentration gradients necessitate the flow of holes from right to left (and electrons from left to right). Hence, we deduce that the junction reaches equilibrium when the electric field is strong enough to entirely halt the diffusion currents. At equilibrium, the drift currents generated by the electric field precisely counterbalance the diffusion currents caused by the concentration gradients.\n\nContinuing with our analysis, we consider the electric field profile in a $pn$ junction, as shown in Figure 2.21. This figure illustrates the electric field distribution across a $pn$ junction. It consists of two main parts: a diagram of the $pn$ junction and a graph displaying the electric field profile.\n\nThe electric field is zero outside the depletion region ($x < -b$ and $x > a$) and reaches its maximum at the junction center ($x = 0$). The electric field profile is triangular, increasing from zero at $x = -b$, peaking at $x = 0$, and then decreasing back to zero at $x = a$. This demonstrates that the electric field is strongest at the center of the depletion region and diminishes towards the edges.\n\nNow, considering the relationship between the electric field and potential voltage, we can plot the potential as a function of $x$. The built-in potential, denoted by $V_{0}$, represents the voltage difference developed across the depletion region. Using Einstein's relation, we can express the built-in potential in terms of junction parameters.\n\nFinally, let's consider an example where a silicon $pn$ junction employs $N_{A}=2 \\times 10^{16} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$ and $N_{D}=4 \\times 10^{16} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$. We need to determine the built-in potential at room temperature ($T=300 \\mathrm{~K}$). By applying the relevant equations and calculations, we find that the built-in potential is approximately 768 mV.\n\nAn interesting question to ponder is how the built-in potential can exist without a net current flowing through the junction. We observe that the built-in potential is developed to counteract the diffusion currents (and is sometimes referred to as the \"potential barrier\"). This contrasts with the behavior of a uniform conducting material, which does not exhibit diffusion and, consequently, does not require a built-in voltage."

We refer to this state as \"equilibrium.\" Despite its lack of immediate practical application, understanding this condition offers valuable insights into the device's behavior under nonequilibrium conditions.\n\nOur exploration starts at the boundary between the $n$ and $p$ sections. Here, one side is rich in holes, while the other is abundant in electrons. The steep concentration gradients for both electrons and holes across the junction result in two significant diffusion currents: electrons move from the $n$ side to the $p$ side, and holes move in the opposite direction. To address the varying concentrations of electrons and holes on either side of the junction, we introduce the notations depicted in Figure 2.18.\n\nFigure 2.18 provides a visual representation of a $p n$ junction, a cornerstone concept in semiconductor physics. The diagram is segmented into two primary sections: the $n$-type semiconductor on the left and the $p$-type semiconductor on the right.\n\n**Key Components:**\n\n1. **$n$-type Region (Left Side):**\n   - Characterized by a high concentration of electrons (majority carriers), denoted as \\( n_n \\).\n   - Features a low concentration of holes (minority carriers), denoted as \\( p_n \\).\n\n2. **$p$-type Region (Right Side):**\n   - Characterized by a high concentration of holes (majority carriers), denoted as \\( p_p \\).\n   - Features a low concentration of electrons (minority carriers), denoted as \\( n_p \\).\n\n**Flow of Information or Control:**\n   - The diagram depicts the concentration gradients of electrons and holes across the junction.\n   - Electrons flow from the $n$-type side to the $p$-type side, while holes flow from the $p$-type side to the $n$-type side, generating diffusion currents.\n\n**Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n   - The diagram includes labels indicating the majority and minority carriers on each side.\n   - The concentrations \\( n_n \\), \\( p_n \\), \\( p_p \\), and \\( n_p \\) are marked to illustrate the distribution of carriers across the junction.\n\n**Overall System Function:**\n   - The primary purpose of this system is to demonstrate the behavior of carriers in a $p n$ junction. The sharp concentration gradient across the junction leads to diffusion currents, which are essential for the operation of diodes and other semiconductor devices. The arrangement and flow of carriers contribute to the rectifying behavior of the $p n$ junction, enabling it to conduct current primarily in one direction.\n\n**Notations:**\n   - \\( n_n \\): Concentration of electrons on the $n$ side\n   - \\( p_n \\): Concentration of holes on the $n$ side\n   - \\( p_p \\): Concentration of holes on the $p$ side\n   - \\( n_p \\): Concentration of electrons on the $p$ side\n\n**Example Calculation:**\nGiven a $p n$ junction with doping levels $N_{A}=10^{16} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$ and $N_{D}=2.11 \\times 10^{15} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$, we can determine the hole and electron concentrations on both sides using equations (2.11) and (2.12).\n\n**Solution:**\nThe concentrations on the $p$ side are expressed as:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\np_{p} & \\approx N_{A} = 10^{16} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3} \\\\\nn_{p} & \\approx \\frac{n_{i}^{2}}{N_{A}} \\approx 1.1 \\times 10^{4} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, the concentrations on the $n$ side are given by:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nn_{n} & \\approx N_{D} = 5 \\times 10^{15} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3} \\\\\np_{n} & \\approx \\frac{n_{i}^{2}}{N_{D}} \\approx 2.3 \\times 10^{4} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIt is important to note that the majority carrier concentration on each side significantly surpasses the minority carrier concentration on the opposing side.\n\n**Diffusion Currents and Equilibrium:**\nThe diffusion currents facilitate a substantial transfer of charge across the junction; however, they must eventually diminish to zero. This is because, under equilibrium conditions with open terminals, the device cannot sustain a net current indefinitely.\n\n**Halting Diffusion Currents:**\nAn intriguing question arises: What terminates the diffusion currents? One might assume that the currents cease once enough free carriers have migrated across the junction, equalizing concentrations on both sides. However, another dominant effect interrupts the diffusion currents before reaching this equilibrium point.\n\n**Depletion Region Formation:**\nTo comprehend this effect, we must recognize that for every electron that departs from the $n$ side, a positive ion is left behind. This process is illustrated in Figure 2.19, which shows the temporal evolution of charge distribution in a $p n$ junction at three different time intervals: \\( t = 0 \\), \\( t = t_1 \\), and \\( t = \\infty \\).\n\n**Evolution of Charge Concentrations:**\nAt \\( t = 0 \\), the $n$ side is filled with free electrons, and the $p$ side is filled with free holes. As time progresses, the diffusion currents lead to the exposure of more ions, resulting in the formation of a \"depletion region\" devoid of free carriers.\n\n**Electric Field Formation:**\nWith the emergence of the depletion region, an electric field arises, as depicted in Figure 2.20. This field tends to drive positive charge flow from left to right, while the concentration gradients necessitate the flow of holes from right to left (and electrons from left to right). We deduce that the junction reaches equilibrium when the electric field is sufficiently strong to halt the diffusion currents.\n\n**Drift and Diffusion Currents:**\nAt equilibrium, the drift currents generated by the electric field precisely counterbalance the diffusion currents caused by the concentration gradients.\n\n**Built-in Potential:**\nThe presence of an electric field within the depletion region suggests the existence of a \"built-in potential.\" Utilizing equations (2.62) or (2.63), we can calculate this potential. Since the electric field $E=-d V / d x$, and equation (2.62) can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nq \\mu_{p} p E=q D_{p} \\frac{d p}{d x}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\nwe obtain:\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n-\\mu_{p} p \\frac{d V}{d x}=D_{p} \\frac{d p}{d x}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\nDividing both sides by $p$ and integrating, we get:\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n-\\mu_{p} \\int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}} d V=D_{p} \\int_{p_{n}}^{p_{p}} \\frac{d p}{p}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\nwhere $p_{n}$ and $p_{p}$ represent the hole concentrations at $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$, respectively (Figure 2.22). Thus:\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV\\left(x_{2}\\right)-V\\left(x_{1}\\right)=-\\frac{D_{p}}{\\mu_{p}} \\ln \\frac{p_{p}}{p_{n}}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\nThe right side of the equation represents the voltage difference developed across the depletion region, denoted as $V_{0}$. Additionally, using Einstein's relation (2.50), we can replace $D_{p} / \\mu_{p}$ with $k T / q$:\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left|V_{0}\\right|=\\frac{k T}{q} \\ln \\frac{p_{p}}{p_{n}}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\nFinally, using equations (2.11) and (2.10) for $p_{p}$ and $p_{n}$, we arrive at:\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{0}=\\frac{k T}{q} \\ln \\frac{N_{A} N_{D}}{n_{i}^{2}}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\nThis equation, which expresses the built-in potential in terms of junction parameters, plays a crucial role in various semiconductor devices.\n\n**Example Calculation:**\nFor a silicon $p n$ junction with $N_{A}=2 \\times 10^{16} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$ and $N_{D}=4 \\times 10^{16} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$, we can determine the built-in potential at room temperature ($T=300 \\mathrm{~K}$) using the provided equations.\n\n**Solution:**\nGiven $n_{i}(T=300 \\mathrm{~K})=1.08 \\times 10^{10} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$, the built-in potential is calculated as:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{0} & \\approx 768 \\mathrm{mV}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\n**Built-in Potential and Doping Levels:**\nEquation (2.69) reveals that $V_{0}$ is weakly dependent on the doping levels. A change in $V_{0}$ can be estimated if $N_{A}$ or $N_{D}$ is increased by one order of magnitude.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe change in $V_{0}$ is approximately 60 mV at $T=300 \\mathrm{~K}$.\n\n**Built-in Potential and Voltage\nThe built-in potential is a fascinating concept in semiconductor physics. It arises due to the difference in carrier concentrations across the $p n$ junction, leading to the formation of an electric field within the depletion region.

    "text": "After analyzing the pn junction in equilibrium, we can now explore its behavior under more engaging and practical conditions. Let's start by applying an external voltage across the device, as depicted in Fig. 2.23, where the voltage source makes the $n$ side more positive than the $p$ side. We refer to the junction being under \"reverse bias\" to highlight the connection of the positive voltage to the $n$ terminal. Whether used as a noun or a verb, \"bias\" signifies operation under certain \"desirable\" conditions. We will delve extensively into the concept of biasing in this and subsequent chapters.\n\nimage_name: Figure 2.23 pn junction under reverse bias\ndescription:\n[\nname: VR, type: VoltageSource, value: VR, ports: {Np: n, Nn: p}\n]\nextrainfo: The diagram illustrates a pn junction under reverse bias, with the voltage source VR making the n side more positive than the p side.

The reverse bias intensifies the built-in electric field from the n side to the p side.\nimage_name: (b)\ndescription:\n[\nname: VR2, type: VoltageSource, value: VR2, ports: {Np: n, Nn: p}\n]\nextrainfo: Figure 2.23 depicts a pn junction under reverse bias with voltage source VR2. This setup increases the depletion region width, lowering the junction capacitance. VR2 is more negative than VR1, further enhancing the electric field from the n to p side.\n\nFigure 2.24 Reduction of junction capacitance with reverse bias.\n\nWe aim to reevaluate the results obtained in equilibrium for the reverse bias scenario. First, let's determine if the external voltage enhances or opposes the built-in electric field. Since, in equilibrium, $\\vec{E}$ is directed from the $n$ side to the $p$ side, $V_{R}$ strengthens the field. However, a higher electric field can only be sustained if more fixed charge is available, necessitating the exposure of more acceptor and donor ions, thereby widening the depletion region.\n\nWhat effect does this have on the diffusion and drift currents? Given that the external voltage intensifies the field, the barrier increases even beyond the equilibrium level, effectively preventing current flow. In other words, the junction conducts a negligible current under reverse bias. ${ }^{9}$\n\nWith no current flow, a reverse-biased pn junction might seem impractical. However, a crucial observation reveals its utility. Notably, in Fig. 2.23, as $V_{B}$ rises, more positive charge accumulates on the $n$ side and more negative charge on the $p$ side. Thus, the device functions as a capacitor [Fig. 2.24(a)]. Essentially, the conductive $n$ and $p$ sections can be viewed as the capacitor's two plates. We also assume the charge in the depletion region is equivalently distributed on each plate.\n\nReaders might still find the device unremarkable. After all, any two parallel plates can form a capacitor, so using a pn junction for this purpose may seem unjustified. However, reverse-biased $p n$ junctions possess a unique property that proves valuable in circuit design. Referring back to Fig. 2.23, we observe that as $V_{R}$ increases, so does the width of the depletion region. Consequently, the conceptual diagram in Fig. 2.24(a) can be modified as in Fig. 2.24(b) for rising $V_{R}$ values, revealing that the capacitance decreases as the plates move apart. Thus, the junction exhibits a voltage-dependent capacitance.\n\nIt can be demonstrated that the capacitance per unit area of the junction is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{j}=\\frac{C_{j 0}}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{V_{R}}{V_{0}}}} \\tag{2.75}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n${ }^{9}$ As detailed in Section 2.2.3, the current is not entirely zero.\nwhere $C_{j 0}$ represents the capacitance at zero bias $\\left(V_{R}=0\\right)$ and $V_{0}$ is the built-in potential [Eq. (2.69)]. (This equation assumes $V_{R}$ is negative for reverse bias.) The value of $C_{j 0}$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{j 0}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon_{s i} q}{2} \\frac{N_{A} N_{D}}{N_{A}+N_{D}} \\frac{1}{V_{0}}} \\tag{2.76}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\epsilon_{s i}$ denotes the dielectric constant of silicon, equal to $11.7 \\times 8.85 \\times 10^{-14} \\mathrm{~F} / \\mathrm{cm} .{ }^{10}$ As plotted in Fig. 2.25, $C_{j}$ decreases with increasing $V_{R}$.\nimage_name: Figure 2.25 Junction capacitance under reverse bias\ndescription: The graph in Figure 2.25 depicts junction capacitance (C_j) versus reverse bias voltage (V_R) for a pn junction.

Note that we have implicitly developed a circuit model for the device under this condition: a simple capacitance whose value is given by Eq. (2.75).\n\nAnother intriguing application of reverse-biased diodes is in digital cameras (Chapter 1). When light of sufficient energy strikes a pn junction, it dislodges electrons from their covalent bonds, creating electron-hole pairs. With a reverse bias, electrons are drawn to the positive battery terminal and holes to the negative terminal, resulting in a current proportional to the light intensity. Thus, the pn junction functions as a \"photodiode.\""

    "text": "Having examined the pn junction in equilibrium, we can now explore its behavior under more intriguing and practical conditions. Let's start by applying an external voltage across the device, as depicted in Fig. 2.23, where the voltage source makes the $n$ side more positive than the $p$ side. This configuration is termed \"reverse bias,\" highlighting the connection of the positive voltage to the $n$ terminal. Whether used as a noun or a verb, \"bias\" signifies operation under certain \"desirable\" conditions. We will delve extensively into the concept of biasing in this and subsequent chapters.\n\nimage_name: Figure 2.23 pn junction under reverse bias\ndescription:\n[\nname: VR, type: VoltageSource, value: VR, ports: {Np: n, Nn: p}\n]\nextrainfo: The diagram illustrates a pn junction under reverse bias, with the voltage source VR making the n side more positive than the p side.

The reverse bias intensifies the built-in electric field from the n side to the p side.\nimage_name: (b)\ndescription:\n[\nname: VR2, type: VoltageSource, value: VR2, ports: {Np: n, Nn: p}\n]\nextrainfo: Figure 2.23 depicts a pn junction under reverse bias with voltage source VR2. This setup increases the depletion region width, lowering the junction capacitance. VR2 is more negative than VR1, further enhancing the electric field from the n to p side.\n\nFigure 2.24 Reduction of junction capacitance with reverse bias.\n\nWe aim to reevaluate the results obtained in equilibrium for the reverse bias scenario. First, let's determine whether the external voltage enhances or opposes the built-in electric field. Since, in equilibrium, $\\vec{E}$ is directed from the $n$ side to the $p$ side, $V_{R}$ strengthens the field. However, a higher electric field can only be sustained if more fixed charge is provided, necessitating the exposure of additional acceptor and donor ions, thereby widening the depletion region.\n\nWhat effect does this have on the diffusion and drift currents? Due to the external voltage reinforcing the field, the barrier height increases beyond that in equilibrium, effectively blocking current flow. In other words, the junction conducts a negligible current under reverse bias. ${ }^{9}$\n\nAlthough a reverse-biased pn junction does not seem particularly useful due to the lack of current conduction, a significant observation reveals its utility. Notably, in Fig. 2.23, as $V_{B}$ increases, more positive charge accumulates on the $n$ side and more negative charge on the $p$ side. Thus, the device functions as a capacitor [Fig. 2.24(a)]. Essentially, the conductive $n$ and $p$ sections can be viewed as the capacitor's two plates. We also assume that the charge in the depletion region is equivalently distributed on each plate.\n\nThe reader might still find the device unremarkable. After all, any two parallel plates can form a capacitor, so using a pn junction for this purpose may seem unjustified. However, reverse-biased $p n$ junctions possess a unique property that is beneficial in circuit design. Referring back to Fig. 2.23, we observe that as $V_{R}$ increases, so does the width of the depletion region. This means the conceptual diagram in Fig. 2.24(a) can be modified as in Fig. 2.24(b) for higher $V_{R}$ values, revealing that the capacitance decreases as the plates move apart. Thus, the junction exhibits a voltage-dependent capacitance.\n\nIt can be demonstrated that the capacitance per unit area of the junction is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{j}=\\frac{C_{j 0}}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{V_{R}}{V_{0}}}} \\tag{2.75}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n${ }^{9}$ As detailed in Section 2.2.3, the current is not entirely zero.\nwhere $C_{j 0}$ represents the capacitance at zero bias $\\left(V_{R}=0\\right)$ and $V_{0}$ is the built-in potential [Eq.

Let's start by applying an external voltage across the device, as depicted in Fig. 2.23, where the voltage source makes the $n$ side more positive than the $p$ side. We term this junction \"reverse biased\" to highlight the positive voltage connection to the $n$ terminal.

This setup broadens the depletion region, decreasing the junction capacitance. VR2 is more negative than VR1, further enhancing the electric field from the n to p side.\n\nFigure 2.24 Reduction of junction capacitance with reverse bias.\n\nWe aim to reassess the results obtained in equilibrium for the reverse bias scenario. First, let's determine if the external voltage reinforces or opposes the built-in electric field. Since, in equilibrium, $\\vec{E}$ is directed from the $n$ side to the $p$ side, $V_{R}$ strengthens this field. However, a higher electric field can only be sustained if more fixed charge is available, necessitating the exposure of additional acceptor and donor ions and thus widening the depletion region.\n\nWhat effect does this have on diffusion and drift currents? The external voltage, by intensifying the field, raises the barrier even higher than in equilibrium, effectively preventing current flow. In other words, the junction conducts a negligible current under reverse bias. ${ }^{9}$\n\nAt first glance, a reverse-biased pn junction might seem impractical due to the lack of current conduction. However, a crucial observation reveals its utility. Notably, in Fig. 2.23, as $V_{B}$ increases, more positive charge accumulates on the $n$ side and more negative charge on the $p$ side, enabling the device to function as a capacitor [Fig. 2.24(a)]. Essentially, the conductive $n$ and $p$ sections can be regarded as the capacitor's plates. We also assume the charge in the depletion region is equivalently distributed on each plate.\n\nReaders might still find this unremarkable, given that any two parallel plates can form a capacitor, making the use of a pn junction for this purpose seemingly unnecessary. However, reverse-biased $p n$ junctions possess a unique property that proves valuable in circuit design. Referring back to Fig. 2.23, we observe that as $V_{R}$ increases, so does the depletion region's width. Thus, the conceptual diagram in Fig. 2.24(a) can be modified as in Fig. 2.24(b) for rising $V_{R}$ values, demonstrating that the structure's capacitance decreases as the plates move apart. Consequently, the junction exhibits a voltage-dependent capacitance.\n\nIt can be demonstrated that the junction's capacitance per unit area is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{j}=\\frac{C_{j 0}}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{V_{R}}{V_{0}}}} \\tag{2.75}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n${ }^{9}$ As detailed in Section 2.2.3, the current is not entirely zero.\nwhere $C_{j 0}$ represents the capacitance at zero bias $\\left(V_{R}=0\\right)$ and $V_{0}$ is the built-in potential [Eq.

The value of $C_{j 0}$ is calculated by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{j 0}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon_{s i} q}{2} \\frac{N_{A} N_{D}}{N_{A}+N_{D}} \\frac{1}{V_{0}}} \\tag{2.76}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\epsilon_{s i}$ is the dielectric constant of silicon, equal to $11.7 \\times 8.85 \\times 10^{-14} \\mathrm{~F} / \\mathrm{cm} .{ }^{10}$ As plotted in Fig. 2.25, $C_{j}$ clearly decreases with increasing $V_{R}$.\nimage_name:Figure 2.25 Junction capacitance under reverse bias\ndescription:The graph in Figure 2.25 depicts the junction capacitance (C_j) versus reverse bias voltage (V_R) for a pn junction.

However, a significant observation reveals its utility. As $V_{B}$ increases in Fig. 2.23, more positive charge accumulates on the $n$ side and more negative charge on the $p$ side. Thus, the device functions as a capacitor [Fig. 2.24(a)]. Essentially, the conductive $n$ and $p$ sections can be viewed as the two plates of the capacitor. We also assume that the charge in the depletion region is equivalently distributed on each plate.\n\nReaders might still find this unremarkable, considering any two parallel plates can form a capacitor. However, reverse-biased $p n$ junctions possess a unique property that is highly beneficial in circuit design. Referring back to Fig. 2.23, we observe that as $V_{R}$ increases, so does the width of the depletion region. This means the conceptual diagram in Fig. 2.24(a) can be adapted as in Fig. 2.24(b) for increasing $V_{R}$ values, demonstrating that the capacitance decreases as the plates move apart. Thus, the junction exhibits a voltage-dependent capacitance.\n\nIt can be demonstrated that the capacitance per unit area of the junction is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{j}=\\frac{C_{j 0}}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{V_{R}}{V_{0}}}} \\tag{2.75}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n${ }^{9}$ As explained in Section 2.2.3, the current is not exactly zero.\nwhere $C_{j 0}$ represents the capacitance at zero bias $\\left(V_{R}=0\\right)$ and $V_{0}$ is the built-in potential [Eq. (2.69)]. (This equation assumes $V_{R}$ is negative for reverse bias.) The value of $C_{j 0}$ is determined by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{j 0}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon_{s i} q}{2} \\frac{N_{A} N_{D}}{N_{A}+N_{D}} \\frac{1}{V_{0}}} \\tag{2.76}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\epsilon_{s i}$ is the dielectric constant of silicon, equal to $11.7 \\times 8.85 \\times 10^{-14} \\mathrm{~F} / \\mathrm{cm}$.

When light of sufficient energy strikes a pn junction, it dislodges electrons from their covalent bonds, creating electron-hole pairs.

We refer to this operation as a \"photodiode.\""

    "text": "After analyzing the pn junction in equilibrium, we can now explore its behavior under more engaging and practical conditions. Let's start by applying an external voltage across the device, as depicted in Fig. 2.23, where the voltage source makes the $n$ side more positive than the $p$ side. This configuration is termed \"reverse bias,\" highlighting the connection of the positive voltage to the $n$ terminal. The term \"bias,\" whether used as a noun or verb, signifies operation under certain \"desirable\" conditions.

VR2 is more negative than VR1, further enhancing the electric field from the n to p side.\n\nFigure 2.24 Reduction of junction capacitance with reverse bias.\n\nWe aim to reevaluate the results obtained in equilibrium for the case of reverse bias. First, let's determine if the external voltage enhances or opposes the built-in electric field. Since, in equilibrium, $\\vec{E}$ is directed from the $n$ side to the $p$ side, $V_{R}$ strengthens the field. However, a higher electric field can only be sustained if more fixed charge is provided, necessitating the exposure of additional acceptor and donor ions, thereby widening the depletion region.\n\nWhat effect does this have on the diffusion and drift currents? Given that the external voltage intensifies the field, the barrier becomes even higher than in equilibrium, effectively preventing current flow. In other words, the junction conducts a negligible current under reverse bias. ${ }^{9}$\n\nWhile a reverse-biased pn junction may seem impractical due to the lack of current conduction, a crucial observation reveals its utility.

    "text": "Our goal in this section is to demonstrate that a $p n$ junction conducts current when the $p$ side is at a higher positive voltage than the $n$ side (Fig. 2.27). This state is referred to as \"forward bias.\" We also aim to calculate the resulting current based on the applied voltage and junction parameters, ultimately developing a circuit model.\n\nimage_name: Figure 2.27 pn junction under forward bias\ndescription:\n[\nname: VF, type: VoltageSource, value: VF, ports: {Np: VFP, Nn: VFN}\n]\nextrainfo: The diagram shows a pn junction in a forward bias condition, with the p-side connected to a positive voltage (VFP) and the n-side to a negative voltage (VFN) via a voltage source VF. This setup reduces the potential barrier, enabling current to flow through the junction.\n\nFigure $2.27 p n$ junction under forward bias.\n\nFrom our examination of the device in equilibrium and reverse bias, we observe that the potential barrier formed in the depletion region governs the device's conductivity. In forward bias, the external voltage, $V_{F}$, generates a field directed from the $p$ side to the $n$ side, opposing the built-in field that counteracts diffusion currents. Consequently, we infer that $V_{F}$ lowers the potential barrier by weakening this field, thereby allowing increased diffusion currents.\n\nTo derive the I/V characteristics in forward bias, we start with Eq. (2.68) for the built-in voltage and rephrase it as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np_{n, e}=\\frac{p_{p, e}}{\\exp \\frac{V_{0}}{V_{T}}} \\tag{2.91}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere the subscript $e$ denotes equilibrium conditions [Fig. 2.28(a)] and $V_{T}=k T / q$ is termed the \"thermal voltage\" (approximately 26 mV at T=300 K). In forward bias, the potential barrier is reduced by an amount equal to the applied voltage:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np_{n, f}=\\frac{p_{p, f}}{\\exp \\frac{V_{0}-V_{F}}{V_{T}}} \\tag{2.92}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere the subscript $f$ indicates forward bias. Since the exponential denominator decreases significantly, we expect $p_{n, f}$ to be substantially higher than $p_{n, e}$ (it can be shown that $p_{p, f} \\approx p_{p, e} \\approx N_{A}$). In other words, the minority carrier concentration on the $p$ side increases rapidly with the forward bias voltage, while the majority carrier concentration remains relatively stable. This also applies to the $n$ side.\n\nimage_name: (a)\ndescription: Figure 2.28(a) depicts the carrier profiles in a semiconductor junction at equilibrium. The graph is a schematic showing the distribution of carrier concentrations across the junction. The horizontal axis represents the spatial position across the junction, with the left side labeled as the 'n' region and the right side as the 'p' region. The vertical axis represents carrier concentration, though specific units are not provided.\n\nIn this equilibrium state, two main curves are illustrated:\n\n1. **Majority Carrier Concentrations:** The curve labeled \\( n_{n,e} \\) represents the electron concentration in the n-region, and \\( p_{p,e} \\) represents the hole concentration in the p-region. These curves gradually decrease as they approach the junction from their respective sides, indicating a drop in majority carrier concentration near the junction.\n\n2. **Minority Carrier Concentrations:** The curve labeled \\( p_{n,e} \\) represents the hole concentration in the n-region, and \\( n_{p,e} \\) represents the electron concentration in the p-region. These curves increase as they approach the junction, reflecting the diffusion of minority carriers.\n\nOverall, the graph shows a symmetrical profile with majority and minority carrier concentrations intersecting at the junction, illustrating the balance of carrier distributions in equilibrium.\n\nimage_name: (b)\ndescription: The graph labeled as Figure 2.28(b) illustrates the carrier concentration profiles in a semiconductor junction under forward bias conditions.

(2.69) indicates that $\\exp \\left(V_{0} / V_{T}\\right)=N_{A} N_{D} / n_{i}^{2}$.\nThe increase in minority carrier concentration suggests that the diffusion currents must rise proportionally above their equilibrium value, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{t o t} \\propto \\frac{N_{A}}{\\exp \\frac{V_{0}}{V_{T}}}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{F}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)+\\frac{N_{D}}{\\exp \\frac{V_{0}}{V_{T}}}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{F}}{V_{T}}-1\\right) . \\tag{2.97}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIndeed, it can be shown that [1]\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{\\text {tot }}=I_{S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{F}}{V_{T}}-1\\right), \\tag{2.98}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $I_{S}$ is termed the \"reverse saturation current\" and is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{S}=A q n_{i}^{2}\\left(\\frac{D_{n}}{N_{A} L_{n}}+\\frac{D_{p}}{N_{D} L_{p}}\\right) \\tag{2.99}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $A$ represents the cross-sectional area of the device, and $L_{n}$ and $L_{p}$ are the electron and hole \"diffusion lengths,\" respectively. Diffusion lengths typically range from tens of micrometers. Note that the first and second terms in the parentheses correspond to the flow of electrons and holes, respectively.\n\nDetermine $I_{S}$ for the junction of Example 2.13 at $T=300 \\mathrm{~K}$ if $A=100 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2}, L_{n}=20 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$, and $L_{p}=30 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nSolution: Using $q=1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}, n_{i}=1.08 \\times 10^{10}$ electrons $/ \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ [Eq.

As depicted in Fig. 2.29(a), such a scenario would imply that electrons continue to flow from the $n$ side to the $p$ side but exhibit no tendency to go beyond $x=x_{2}$ due to the lack of a gradient. A similar situation exists for holes, suggesting that charge carriers do not flow deep into the $p$ and $n$ sides, resulting in no net current. Therefore, the minority carrier concentrations must vary as shown in Fig. 2.29(b) to enable diffusion.\n\nThis observation recalls Example 2.10 and the associated question: if the minority carrier concentration decreases with $x$, what happens to the carriers, and how can the current remain constant along the $x$-axis? Interestingly, as electrons enter the $p$ side and move down the gradient, they gradually recombine with the abundant holes. Similarly, holes entering the $n$ side recombine with electrons.

As depicted in Fig. 2.29(a), such a scenario would imply that electrons continuously flow from the $n$ side to the $p$ side but do not extend beyond $x=x_{2}$ due to the lack of a gradient. A similar situation applies to holes, suggesting that charge carriers do not penetrate deeply into the $p$ and $n$ sides, resulting in no net current. Therefore, the minority carrier concentrations must vary as shown in Fig. 2.29(b) to enable diffusion.\n\nThis observation recalls Example 2.10 and the associated question: if the minority carrier concentration decreases with $x$, what happens to the carriers, and how can the current remain constant along the $x$-axis? Interestingly, as electrons enter the $p$ side and move down the gradient, they gradually recombine with the abundant holes. Similarly, holes entering the $n$ side recombine with electrons.

    "text": "Our goal in this section is to demonstrate that a $p n$ junction conducts current when the $p$ side is at a higher positive voltage than the $n$ side (Fig. 2.27). This scenario is referred to as \"forward bias.\" Additionally, we aim to calculate the resulting current based on the applied voltage and junction parameters, ultimately developing a circuit model.\n\nimage_name:Figure 2.27 pn junction under forward bias\ndescription:\n[\nname: VF, type: VoltageSource, value: VF, ports: {Np: VFP, Nn: VFN}\n]\nextrainfo:Figure 2.27 illustrates a pn junction under forward bias, where the p-side is connected to a positive voltage (VFP) and the n-side to a negative voltage (VFN) via a voltage source VF. This setup reduces the potential barrier, enabling current to flow through the junction.\n\nFigure $2.27 p n$ junction under forward bias.\n\nFrom our analysis of the device in equilibrium and reverse bias, we observe that the potential barrier formed in the depletion region governs the device's conductivity. In forward bias, the external voltage, $V_{F}$, generates a field directed from the $p$ side to the $n$ side, opposing the built-in field that counteracts diffusion currents. Consequently, we infer that $V_{F}$ effectively lowers the potential barrier by weakening this field, thereby allowing increased diffusion currents.\n\nTo derive the I/V characteristic in forward bias, we start with Eq. (2.68) for the built-in voltage and rephrase it as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np_{n, e}=\\frac{p_{p, e}}{\\exp \\frac{V_{0}}{V_{T}}} \\tag{2.91}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere the subscript $e$ denotes equilibrium conditions [Fig. 2.28(a)], and $V_{T}=k T / q$ is termed the \"thermal voltage\" (approximately 26 mV at T=300 K). In forward bias, the potential barrier is reduced by an amount equal to the applied voltage:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np_{n, f}=\\frac{p_{p, f}}{\\exp \\frac{V_{0}-V_{F}}{V_{T}}} \\tag{2.92}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere the subscript $f$ indicates forward bias. Given the significant drop in the exponential denominator, we expect $p_{n, f}$ to be substantially higher than $p_{n, e}$ (it can be shown that $p_{p, f} \\approx p_{p, e} \\approx N_{A}$). In other words, the minority carrier concentration on the $p$ side increases sharply with the forward bias voltage, while the majority carrier concentration remains relatively stable. This principle also applies to the $n$ side.\n\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:Figure 2.28(a) depicts the carrier profiles in a semiconductor junction at equilibrium.
