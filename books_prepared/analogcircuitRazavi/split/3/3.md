# Diode Models and Circuits

Having studied the physics of diodes in Chapter 2, we now rise to the next level of abstraction and deal with diodes as circuit elements, ultimately arriving at interesting and real-life applications. This chapter also prepares us for understanding transistors as circuit elements in subsequent chapters. We proceed as follows:

## 3.1 IDEAL DIODE

### 3.1.1 Initial Thoughts

In order to appreciate the need for diodes, let us briefly study the design of a cellphone charger. The charger converts the line ac voltage at $110 \mathrm{~V}^{1}$ and $60 \mathrm{~Hz}^{2}$ to a dc voltage of 3.5 V. As shown in Fig. 3.1(a), this is accomplished by first stepping down the ac voltage by means of a transformer to about 4 V and subsequently converting the ac voltage to a dc quantity. ${ }^{3}$ The same principle applies to adaptors that power other electronic devices.

How does the black box in Fig. 3.1(a) perform this conversion? As depicted in Fig. 3.1(b), the output of the transformer exhibits a zero dc content because the negative and positive half cycles enclose equal areas, leading to a zero average. Now suppose this waveform is applied to a mysterious device that passes the positive half cycles but blocks the negative ones. The result displays a positive average and some ac components, which can be removed by a low-pass filter (Section 3.5.1).

Did you know?

The rectification effect was discovered by Carl Braun around 1875. He observed that a metal wire pressed against a sulphide carried more current in one direction than the other. In subsequent decades, researchers tried other structures, arriving at "cat's whisker" rectifiers, which served as detectors for the reception of wireless signals in early radios and radars. These were eventually supplanted by pn junctions.

The waveform conversion in Fig. 3.1(b) points to the need for a device that discriminates between positive and negative voltages, passing only one and blocking the other. A simple resistor cannot serve in this role because it is linear. That is, Ohm's law, $V=I R$, implies that if the voltage across a resistor goes from positive to negative, so does the current through it. We must therefore seek a device that behaves as a short for positive voltages and as an open for negative voltages.

Figure 3.2 summarizes the result of our thought process thus far. The mysterious device generates an output equal to the input for positive half cycles and equal to zero for negative half cycles. Note that the device is nonlinear because it does not satisfy $y=\alpha x$; if $x \rightarrow-x, y \nrightarrow-y$.

### 3.1.2 Ideal Diode

The mysterious device mentioned above is called an "ideal diode." Shown in Fig. 3.3(a), the diode is a two-terminal device, with the triangular head denoting the allowable direction of current flow and the vertical bar representing the blocking behavior for currents in the opposite direction. The corresponding terminals are called the "anode" and the "cathode," respectively.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7a57796e08278ef4e6a5g-58.jpg?height=1251&width=2712&top_left_y=1258&top_left_x=973)

Figure 3.3 (a) Diode symbol, (b) equivalent circuit, (c) water pipe analogy.

Forward and Reverse Bias To serve as the mysterious device in the charger example of Fig. 3.3(a), the diode must turn "on" if $V_{\text {anode }}>V_{\text {cathode }}$ and "off" if $V_{\text {anode }}<V_{\text {cathode }}$ [Fig. 3.3(b)]. Defining $V_{\text {anode }}-V_{\text {cathode }}=V_{D}$, we say the diode is "forward-biased" if $V_{D}$ tends to exceed zero and "reverse-biased" if $V_{D}<0.4$

A water pipe analogy proves useful here. Consider the pipe shown in Fig. 3.3(c), where a valve (a plate) is hinged on the top and faces a stopper on the bottom. If water pressure is applied from the left, the valve rises, allowing a current. On the other hand, if water pressure is applied from the right, the stopper keeps the valve shut.

As with other two-terminal devices, diodes can be placed in series (or in parallel). Determine which one of the configurations in Fig. 3.4 can conduct current.

Figure 3.4 Series combinations of diodes.

[^13]Solution In Fig. 3.4(a), the anodes of $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$ point to the same direction, allowing the flow of current from $A$ to $B$ to $C$ but not in the reverse direction. In Fig. 3.4(b), $D_{1}$ stops current flow from $B$ to $A$, and $D_{2}$, from $B$ to $C$. Thus, no current can flow in either direction. By the same token, the topology of Fig. 3.4(c) behaves as an open for any voltage. Of course, none of these circuits appears particularly useful at this point, but they help us become comfortable with diodes.

Exercise Determine all possible series combinations of three diodes and study their conduction properties.

I/V Characteristics In studying electronic devices, it is often helpful to accompany equations with graphical visualizations. A common type of plot is that of the current/voltage (I/V) characteristic, i.e., the current that flows through the device as a function of the voltage across it.

Since an ideal diode behaves as a short or an open, we first construct the I/V characteristics for two special cases of Ohm's law:

$$
\begin{array}{r}
R=0 \Rightarrow I=\frac{V}{R}=\infty \\
R=\infty \Rightarrow I=\frac{V}{R}=0 \tag{3.2}
\end{array}
$$

The results are illustrated in Fig. 3.5(a). For an ideal diode, we combine the positive-voltage region of the first with the negative-voltage region of the second, arriving at the $\mathrm{I}_{D} / \mathrm{V}_{D}$ characteristic in Fig. 3.5(b). Here, $V_{D}=V_{\text {anode }}-V_{\text {cathode }}$, and $I_{D}$ is defined as the current flowing into the anode and out of the cathode.

Example
3.2

We said that an ideal diode turns on for positive anode-cathode voltages. But the characteristic in Fig. 3.5(b) does not appear to show any $I_{D}$ values for $V_{D}>0$. How do we interpret this plot?

Solution This characteristic indicates that as $V_{D}$ exceeds zero by a very small amount, then the diode turns on and conducts infinite current if the circuit surrounding the diode can provide such a current. Thus, in circuits containing only finite currents, a forward-biased ideal diode sustains a zero voltage-similar to a short circuit.

Exercise

How is the characteristic modified if we place a $1-\Omega$ resistor in series with the diode?
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7a57796e08278ef4e6a5g-60.jpg?height=743&width=1691&top_left_y=1084&top_left_x=1495)

Figure 3.6 (a) Antiparallel diodes, (b) resulting I/V characteristic.

Solution If $V_{A}>0, D_{1}$ is on and $D_{2}$ is off, yielding $I_{A}=\infty$. If $V_{A}<0, D_{1}$ is off, but $D_{2}$ is on, again leading to $I_{A}=\infty$. The result is illustrated in Fig. 3.6(b). The antiparallel combination therefore acts as a short for all voltages. Seemingly a useless circuit, this topology becomes much more interesting with actual diodes (Section 3.5.3).

Exercise Repeat the above example if a 1-V battery is placed in series with the parallel combination of the diodes.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7a57796e08278ef4e6a5g-60.jpg?height=1371&width=2821&top_left_y=3384&top_left_x=918)

Figure 3.7 (a) Diode-resistor series combination, (b) equivalent circuit under forward bias, (c) equivalent circuit under reverse bias, (d) I/V characteristic, (e) equivalent circuit if $D_{1}$ is on.

Solution We surmise that, if $V_{A}>0$, the diode is on [Fig. 3.7(b)] and $I_{A}=V_{A} / R_{1}$ because $V_{D 1}=0$ for an ideal diode. On the other hand, if $V_{A}<0, D_{1}$ is probably off [Fig. 3.7(c)] and $I_{D}=0$. Figure 3.7(d) plots the resulting I/V characteristic.

The above observations are based on guesswork. Let us study the circuit more rigorously. We begin with $V_{A}<0$, postulating that the diode is off. To confirm the validity of this guess, let us assume $D_{1}$ is on and see if we reach a conflicting result. If $D_{1}$ is on, the circuit is reduced to that in Fig. 3.7(e), and if $V_{A}$ is negative, so is $I_{A}$; i.e., the actual current flows from right to left. But this implies that $D_{1}$ carries a current from its cathode to its anode, violating the definition of the diode. Thus, for $V_{A}<0, D_{1}$ remains off and $I_{A}=0$.

As $V_{A}$ rises above zero, it tends to forward bias the diode. Does $D_{1}$ turn on for any $V_{A}>0$ or does $R_{1}$ shift the turn-on point? We again invoke proof by contradiction. Suppose for some $V_{A}>0, D_{1}$ is still off, behaving as an open circuit and yielding $I_{A}=0$. The voltage drop across $R_{1}$ is therefore equal to zero, suggesting that $V_{D 1}=V_{A}$ and hence $I_{D 1}=\infty$ and contradicting the original assumption. In other words, $D_{1}$ turns on for any $V_{A}>0$.

Exercise Repeat the above analysis if the terminals of the diode are swapped.

The above example leads to two important points. First, the series combination of $D_{1}$ and $R_{1}$ acts as an open for negative voltages and as a resistor of value $R_{1}$ for positive voltages. Second, in the analysis of circuits, we can assume an arbitrary state (on or off) for each diode and proceed with the computation of voltages and currents; if the assumptions are incorrect, the final result contradicts the original assumptions. Of course, it is helpful to first examine the circuit carefully and make an intuitive guess.

Example Why are we interested in I/V characteristics rather than V/I characteristics?

Solution In the analysis of circuits, we often prefer to consider the voltage to be the "cause" and the current, the "effect." This is because in typical circuits, voltage polarities can be predicted more readily and intuitively than current polarities. Also, devices such as transistors fundamentally produce current in response to voltage.

Exercise Plot the V/I characteristic of an ideal diode.

Solution If $V_{A}=+3 \mathrm{~V}$, and $V_{B}=0$, then we surmise that $D_{1}$ is forward-biased and $D_{2}$, reversebiased. Thus, $V_{\text {out }}=V_{A}=+3 \mathrm{~V}$. If uncertain, we can assume both $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$ are
forward-biased, immediately facing a conflict: $D_{1}$ enforces a voltage of +3 V at the output whereas $D_{2}$ shorts $V_{\text {out }}$ to $V_{B}=0$. This assumption is therefore incorrect.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7a57796e08278ef4e6a5g-62.jpg?height=578&width=783&top_left_y=807&top_left_x=1949)

Figure 3.8 OR gate realized by diodes.

The symmetry of the circuit with respect to $V_{A}$ and $V_{B}$ suggests that $V_{\text {out }}=V_{B}=+3 \mathrm{~V}$ if $V_{A}=0$ and $V_{B}=+3 \mathrm{~V}$. The circuit operates as a logical OR gate and was in fact used in early digital computers.

Exercise Construct a three-input OR gate.

Is an ideal diode on or off if $V_{D}=0$ ?

Solution An ideal diode experiencing a zero voltage must carry a zero current (why?). However, this does not mean it acts as an open circuit. After all, a piece of wire experiencing a zero voltage behaves similarly. Thus, the state of an ideal diode with $V_{D}=0$ is somewhat arbitrary and ambiguous. In practice, we consider slightly positive or negative voltages to determine the response of a diode circuit.

Exercise Repeat the above example if a $1-\Omega$ resistor is placed in series with the diode.

Input/Output Characteristics Electronic circuits process an input and generate a corresponding output. It is therefore instructive to construct the input/output characteristics of a circuit by varying the input across an allowable range and plotting the resulting output.

As an example, consider the circuit depicted in Fig. 3.9(a), where the output is defined as the voltage across $D_{1}$. If $V_{i n}<0, D_{1}$ is reverse biased, reducing the circuit to that in Fig. 3.9(b). Since no current flows through $R_{1}$, we have $V_{\text {out }}=V_{\text {in }}$. If $V_{\text {in }}>0$, then $D_{1}$ is forward biased, shorting the output and forcing $V_{\text {out }}=0$ [Fig. 3.9(c)]. Figure 3.9(d) illustrates the overall input/output characteristic.

### 3.1.3 Application Examples

Recall from Fig. 3.2 that we arrived at the concept of the ideal diode as a means of converting $x(t)$ to $y(t)$. Let us now design a circuit that performs this function. We may naturally construct the circuit as shown in Fig. 3.10(a). Unfortunately, however, the cathode of the diode is "floating," the output current is always equal to zero, and the state of the diode is ambiguous. We therefore modify the circuit as depicted in Fig. 3.10(b) and analyze
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7a57796e08278ef4e6a5g-63.jpg?height=1616&width=2700&top_left_y=762&top_left_x=899)

Figure 3.10 (a) A diode operating as a rectifier, (b) complete rectifier, (c) input and output waveforms, (d) input/output characteristic.
its response to a sinusoidal input [Fig. 3.10(c)]. Since $R_{1}$ has a tendency to maintain the cathode of $D_{1}$ near zero, as $V_{\text {in }}$ rises, $D_{1}$ is forward biased, shorting the output to the input. This state holds for the positive half cycle. When $V_{i n}$ falls below zero, $D_{1}$ turns off and $R_{1}$ ensures that $V_{\text {out }}=0$ because $I_{D} R_{1}=0 .{ }^{5}$ The circuit of Fig. 3.10(b) is called a "rectifier."

It is instructive to plot the input/output characteristic of the circuit as well. Noting that if $V_{\text {in }}<0, D_{1}$ is off and $V_{\text {out }}=0$, and if $V_{\text {in }}>0, D_{1}$ is on and $V_{\text {out }}=V_{\text {in }}$, we obtain the behavior shown in Fig. 3.10(d). The rectifier is a nonlinear circuit because if $V_{\text {in }} \rightarrow-V_{\text {in }}$ then $V_{\text {out }} \nrightarrow-V_{\text {out }}$.

Is it a coincidence that the characteristics in Figs. 3.7(d) and 3.10(d) look similar?

Solution No, we recognize that the output voltage in Fig. 3.10(b) is simply equal to $I_{A} R_{1}$ in Fig. 3.7(a). Thus, the two plots differ by only a scaling factor equal to $R_{1}$.

Exercise $\quad$ Construct the characteristic if the terminals of $D_{1}$ are swapped.

We now determine the time average (dc value) of the output waveform in Fig. 3.10(c) to arrive at another interesting application. Suppose $V_{i n}=V_{p} \sin \omega t$, where $\omega=2 \pi / T$ denotes the frequency in radians per second and $T$ the period. Then, in the first cycle after $t=0$, we have

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{\text {out }} & =V_{p} \sin \omega t \text { for } 0 \leq t \leq \frac{T}{2}  \tag{3.3}\\
& =0 \quad \text { for } \frac{T}{2} \leq t \leq T \tag{3.4}
\end{align*}
$$

To compute the average, we obtain the area under $V_{\text {out }}$ and normalize the result to the period:

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{\text {out }, \text { avg }} & =\frac{1}{T} \int_{0}^{T} V_{\text {out }}(t) d t  \tag{3.5}\\
& =\frac{1}{T} \int_{0}^{T / 2} V_{p} \sin \omega t d t  \tag{3.6}\\
& =\frac{1}{T} \cdot \frac{V_{p}}{\omega}[-\cos \omega t]_{0}^{T / 2}  \tag{3.7}\\
& =\frac{V_{p}}{\pi} \tag{3.8}
\end{align*}
$$

Thus, the average is proportional to $V_{p}$, an expected result because a larger input amplitude yields a greater area under the rectified half cycles.

The above observation reveals that the average value of a rectified output can serve as a measure of the "strength" (amplitude) of the input. That is, a rectifier can operate as a "signal strength indicator." For example, since cellphones receive varying levels of signal depending on the user's location and environment, they require an indicator to determine how much the signal must be amplified.

Example A cellphone receives a $1.8-\mathrm{GHz}$ signal with a peak amplitude ranging from $2 \mu \mathrm{~V}$ to <br> 3.9 10 mV . If the signal is applied to a rectifier, what is the corresponding range of the output average?

Solution The rectified output exhibits an average value ranging from $2 \mu \mathrm{~V} /(\pi)=0.637 \mu \mathrm{~V}$ to $10 \mathrm{mV} /(\pi)=3.18 \mathrm{mV}$.

Do the above results change if a $1-\Omega$ resistor is placed in series with the diode?

In our effort toward understanding the role of diodes, we examine another circuit that will eventually (in Section 3.5.3) lead to some important applications. First, consider the topology in Fig. 3.11(a), where a 1-V battery is placed in series with an ideal diode. How does this circuit behave? If $V_{1}<0$, the cathode voltage is higher than the anode voltage, placing $D_{1}$ in reverse bias. Even if $V_{1}$ is slightly greater than zero, e.g., equal to 0.9 V , the anode is not positive enough to forward bias $D_{1}$. Thus, $V_{1}$ must approach +1 V for $D_{1}$

to turn on. Shown in Fig. 3.11(a), the I/V characteristic of the diode-battery combination resembles that of a diode, but shifted to the right by 1 V .

Now, let us examine the circuit in Fig. 3.11(b). Here, for $V_{\text {in }}<0, D_{1}$ remains off, yielding $V_{\text {out }}=V_{\text {in }}$. For $V_{\text {in }}>0, D_{1}$ acts a short, and $V_{\text {out }}=0$. The circuit therefore does not allow the output to exceed zero, as illustrated in the output waveform and the input/output characteristic. But suppose we seek a circuit that must not allow the output to exceed +1 V (rather than zero). How should the circuit of Fig. 3.11(b) be modified? In this case, $D_{1}$ must turn on only when $V_{\text {out }}$ approaches +1 V , implying that a $1-\mathrm{V}$ battery must be inserted in series with the diode. Depicted in Fig.3.11(c), the modification indeed guarantees $V_{\text {out }} \leq+1 \mathrm{~V}$ for any input level. We say the circuit "clips" or "limits" at +1 V . "Limiters" prove useful in many applications and are described in Section 3.5.3.

Example 3.10

Solution

Sketch the time average of $V_{\text {out }}$ in Fig. 3.11(c) for a sinusoidal input as the battery voltage, $V_{B}$, varies from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$.

If $V_{B}$ is very negative, $D_{1}$ is always on because $V_{i n} \geq-V_{p}$. In this case, the output average is equal to $V_{B}$ [Fig. 3.12(a)]. For $-V_{p}<V_{B}<0, D_{1}$ turns off at some point in the negative half cycle and remains off in the positive half cycle, yielding an average greater than $-V_{p}$ but less than $V_{B}$. For $V_{B}=0$, the average reaches $-V_{p} /(\pi)$. Finally, for $V_{B} \geq V_{p}$, no limiting occurs and the average is equal to zero. Figure 3.12(b) sketches this behavior.

## 3.2 pn JUNCTION AS A DIODE

The operation of the ideal diode is somewhat reminiscent of the current conduction in pn junctions. In fact, the forward and reverse bias conditions depicted in Fig. 3.3(b) are quite similar to those studied for $p n$ junctions in Chapter 2. Figures 3.13(a) and (b) plot the I/V characteristics of the ideal diode and the $p n$ junction, respectively. The latter can serve as an approximation of the former by providing "unilateral" current conduction. Shown in Fig. 3.13 is the constant-voltage model developed in Chapter 2, providing a simple approximation of the exponential function and also resembling the characteristic plotted in Fig. 3.11(a).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7a57796e08278ef4e6a5g-67.jpg?height=1291&width=1879&top_left_y=2351&top_left_x=1298)

Figure 3.13 Diode characteristics: (a) ideal model, (b) exponential model, (c) constantvoltage model.

Did you know?

Diodes are among few human-made devices that have a very wide range of sizes. The diodes in integrated circuits may have a cross-section area of $0.5 \mu \mathrm{~m} \times 0.5 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ and carry a current of a few hundred microamperes. On the other hand, diodes used in industrial applications such as electroplating have a cross section of $10 \mathrm{~cm} \times 10 \mathrm{~cm}$ and carry a current of several thousand amperes! Can you think of any other device that comes in such a wide range of sizes?

Given a circuit topology, how do we choose one of the above models for the diodes? We may utilize the ideal model so as to develop a quick, rough understanding of the circuit's operation. Upon performing this exercise, we may discover that this idealization is inadequate and hence employ the constant-voltage model. This model suffices in most cases, but we may need to resort to the exponential model for some circuits. The following examples illustrate these points.

It is important to bear in mind two peinciples: (1) if a diode is at the edge of turning on or off, then $I_{D} \approx 0$
on $I_{D}$ must flow from anode to cathode.

Example
3.12

Plot the input/output characteristic of the circuit shown in Fig. 3.14(a) using (a) the ideal model and (b) the constant-voltage model.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7a57796e08278ef4e6a5g-68.jpg?height=1810&width=2222&top_left_y=876&top_left_x=1172)

Figure 3.14 (a) Diode circuit, (b) input/output characteristic with ideal diode model, (c) input/output characteristic with constant-voltage diode model.

Solution
(a) We begin with $V_{\text {in }}=-\infty$, recognizing that $D_{1}$ is reverse biased. In fact, for $V_{\text {in }}<0$, the diode remains off and no current flows through the circuit. Thus, the voltage drop across $R_{1}$ is zero and $V_{\text {out }}=V_{\text {in }}$.

As $V_{i n}$ exceeds zero, $D_{1}$ turns on, operating as a short and reducing the circuit to a voltage divider. That is,

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text {out }}=\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} V_{\text {in }} \text { for } V_{\text {in }}>0 \tag{3.9}
\end{equation*}
$$

Figure 3.14(b) plots the overall characteristic, revealing a slope equal to unity for $V_{\text {in }}<0$ and $R_{2} /\left(R_{2}+R_{1}\right)$ for $V_{i n}>0$. In other words, the circuit operates as a voltage divider once the diode turns on and loads the output node with $R_{2}$.
(b) In this case, $D_{1}$ is reverse biased for $V_{\text {in }}<V_{D, \text { on }}$, yielding $V_{\text {out }}=V_{\text {in }}$. As $V_{\text {in }}$ exceeds $V_{D, \text { on }}, D_{1}$ turns on, operating as a constant voltage source with a value $V_{D, \text { on }}$ [as illustrated in Fig. 3.13(c)]. Reducing the circuit to that in Fig. 3.14(c), we apply Kirchoff's current law to the output node:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{V_{\text {in }}-V_{\text {out }}}{R_{1}}=\frac{V_{\text {out }}-V_{D, \text { on }}}{R_{2}} \tag{3.10}
\end{equation*}
$$

It follows that

$$

As expected, $V_{\text {out }}=V_{D, \text { on }}$ if $V_{\text {in }}=V_{D, \text { on }}$. Figure 3.14(d) plots the resulting characteristic, displaying the same shape as that in Fig. 3.14(b) but with a shift in the break point.

Exercise In the above example, plot the current through $R_{1}$ as a function of $V_{i n}$.

It is important to remember that a diode about to turn on or off carries no current but sustains a voltage equal to $V_{D, o n}$.

## 3.3 ADDITIONAL EXAMPLES*

Example In the circuit of Fig. 3.15, $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$ have different cross section areas but are otherwise 3.13 identical. Determine the current flowing through each diode.

Solution In this case, we must resort to the exponential equation because the ideal and constantvoltage models do not include the device area. We have

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{i n}=I_{D 1}+I_{D 2} \tag{3.12}
\end{equation*}
$$

We also equate the voltages across $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{T} \ln \frac{I_{D 1}}{I_{S 1}}=V_{T} \ln \frac{I_{D 2}}{I_{S 2}} \tag{3.13}
\end{equation*}
$$

that is,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{I_{D 1}}{I_{S 1}}=\frac{I_{D 2}}{I_{S 2}} \tag{3.14}
\end{equation*}
$$

Solving (3.13) and (3.15) together yields

$$
\begin{align*}
& I_{D 1}=\frac{I_{i n}}{1+\frac{I_{S 2}}{I_{S 1}}}  \tag{3.15}\\
& I_{D 2}=\frac{I_{i n}}{1+\frac{I_{S 1}}{I_{S 2}}} \tag{3.16}
\end{align*}
$$

As expected, $I_{D 1}=I_{D 2}=I_{i n} / 2$ if $I_{S 1}=I_{S 2}$.

Figure 3.16 (a) Diode circuit, (b) equivalent circuit when $D_{1}$ is off, (c) input/output characteristic.

In this case, the voltage across the diode happens to be equal to the output voltage. We note that if $V_{\text {in }}=-\infty, D_{1}$ is reverse biased and the circuit reduces to that in Fig. 3.16(b). Consequently,

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{\text {out }}=\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} V_{i n} \tag{3.17}
\end{equation*}
$$

At what point does $D_{1}$ turn on? The diode voltage must reach $V_{D, o n}$, requiring an input voltage given by:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} V_{i n}=V_{D, o n} \tag{3.18}
\end{equation*}
$$

and hence

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{i n}=\left(1+\frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}}\right) V_{D, o n} \tag{3.19}
\end{equation*}
$$

The reader may question the validity of this result: if the diode is indeed on, it draws current and the diode voltage is no longer equal to $\left[R_{2} /\left(R_{1}+R_{2}\right)\right] V_{i n}$. So why did we express the diode voltage as such in Eq. (3.18)? To determine the break point, we assume $V_{\text {in }}$ gradually increases so that it places the diode at the edge of the turn-on, e.g., it creates
$V_{\text {out }} \approx 799 \mathrm{mV}$. The diode therefore still draws no current, but the voltage across it and hence the input voltage are almost sufficient to turn it on.

For $V_{\text {in }}>\left(1+R_{1} / R_{2}\right) V_{D, \text { on }}, D_{1}$ remains forward-biased, yielding $V_{\text {out }}=V_{D, \text { on }}$. Figure 3.16(c) plots the overall characteristic.

Exercise Repeat the above example but assume the terminals of $D_{1}$ are swapped, i.e., the anode is tied to ground and the cathode the output node.

Exercise For the above example, plot the current through $R_{1}$ as a function of $V_{\text {in }}$.

Figure 3.17 (a) Diode circuit, (b) illustration for very negative inputs, (c) equivalent circuit when $D_{1}$ is off, (d) input/output characteristic.

Solution We begin with $V_{\text {in }}=-\infty$, and redraw the circuit as depicted in Fig. 3.17(b), placing the more negative voltages on the bottom and the more positive voltages on the top. This diagram suggests that the diode operates in forward bias, establishing a voltage at node $X$ equal to $V_{i n}+V_{D, o n}$. Note that in this regime, $V_{X}$ is independent of $R_{2}$ because $D_{1}$ acts as a battery. Thus, so long as $D_{1}$ is on, we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text {out }}=V_{\text {in }}+V_{D, \text { on }} \tag{3.20}
\end{equation*}
$$

We also compute the current flowing through $R_{2}$ and $R_{1}$ :

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{R 2} & =\frac{V_{D, o n}}{R_{2}}  \tag{3.21}\\
I_{R 1} & =\frac{0-V_{X}}{R_{1}}  \tag{3.22}\\
& =\frac{-\left(V_{i n}+V_{D, o n}\right)}{R_{1}} \tag{3.23}
\end{align*}
$$

Thus, as $V_{i n}$ increases from $-\infty, I_{R 2}$ remains constant but $\left|I_{R 1}\right|$ decreases; i.e., at some point $I_{R 2}=I_{R 1}$.

At what point does $D_{1}$ turn off? Interestingly, in this case it is simpler to seek the condition that results in a zero current through the diode rather than insufficient voltage across it. The observation that at some point, $I_{R 2}=I_{R 1}$ proves useful here as this condition also implies that $D_{1}$ carries no current ( KCL at node $X$ ). In other words, $D_{1}$ turns off if $V_{i n}$ is chosen to yield $I_{R 2}=I_{R 1}$. From (3.21) and (3.23),

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{V_{D, \text { on }}}{R_{2}}=-\frac{V_{i n}+V_{D, o n}}{R_{1}} \tag{3.24}
\end{equation*}
$$

and hence

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{i n}=-\left(1+\frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}}\right) V_{D, o n} . \tag{3.25}
\end{equation*}
$$

As $V_{i n}$ exceeds this value, the circuit reduces to that shown in Fig. 3.17(c) and

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text {out }}=\frac{R_{1}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} V_{\text {in }} . \tag{3.26}
\end{equation*}
$$

The overall characteristic is shown in Fig. 3.17(d).
The reader may find it interesting to recognize that the circuits of Figs. 3.16(a) and 3.17(a) are identical: in the former, the output is sensed across the diode whereas in the latter it is sensed across the series resistor.

Exercise Repeat the above example if the terminals of the diode are swapped.

As mentioned in Example 3.4, in more complex circuits, it may be difficult to correctly predict the region of operation of each diode by inspection. In such cases, we may simply make a guess, proceed with the analysis, and eventually determine if the final result agrees or conflicts with the original guess. Of course, we still apply intuition to minimize the guesswork. The following example illustrates this approach.

Plot the input/output characteristic of the circuit shown in Fig. 3.18(a) using the constantvoltage diode model.

Solution We begin with $V_{i n}=-\infty$, predicting intuitively that $D_{1}$ is on. We also (blindly) assume that $D_{2}$ is on, thus reducing the circuit to that in Fig. 3.18(b). The path through $V_{D, \text { on }}$ and
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7a57796e08278ef4e6a5g-73.jpg?height=2387&width=2907&top_left_y=622&top_left_x=841)

(c) simplified circuit, (d) equivalent circuit, (e) equivalent circuit for $V_{i n}=-V_{D, o n}$,
(f) section of input/output characteristic, (g) equivalent circuit, (f) complete input/ output characteristic.
$V_{B}$ creates a difference of $V_{D, \text { on }}+V_{B}$ between $V_{\text {in }}$ and $V_{\text {out }}$, i.e., $V_{\text {out }}=V_{\text {in }}-\left(V_{D, \text { on }}+V_{B}\right)$. This voltage difference also appears across the branch consisting of $R_{1}$ and $V_{D, o n}$, yielding

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{1} I_{R 1}+V_{D, o n}=-\left(V_{B}+V_{D, o n}\right), \tag{3.27}
\end{equation*}
$$

and hence

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{R 1}=\frac{-V_{B}-2 V_{D, o n}}{R_{1}} \tag{3.28}
\end{equation*}
$$

That is, $I_{R 1}$ is independent of $V_{i n}$. We must now analyze these results to determine whether they agree with our assumptions regarding the state of $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$.

Consider the current flowing through $R_{2}$ :

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{R 2} & =-\frac{V_{\text {out }}}{R_{2}}  \tag{3.29}\\
& =-\frac{V_{\text {in }}-\left(V_{D, \text { on }}-V_{B}\right)}{R_{2}} \tag{3.30}
\end{align*}
$$

which approaches $+\infty$ for $V_{\text {in }}=-\infty$. The large value of $I_{R 2}$ and the constant value of $I_{R 1}$ indicate that the branch consisting of $V_{B}$ and $D_{2}$ carries a large current with the direction shown. That is, $D_{2}$ must conduct current from its cathode to its anode, which is not possible.

In summary, we have observed that the forward bias assumption for $D_{2}$ translates to a current in a prohibited direction. Thus, $D_{2}$ operates in reverse bias for $V_{i n}=-\infty$. Redrawing the circuit as in Fig. 3.18(c) and noting that $V_{X}=V_{i n}+V_{D, o n}$, we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text {out }}=\left(V_{\text {in }}+V_{D, \text { on }}\right) \frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} \tag{3.31}
\end{equation*}
$$

We now raise $V_{\text {in }}$ and determine the first break point, i.e., the point at which $D_{1}$ turns off or $D_{2}$ turns on. Which one occurs first? Let us assume $D_{1}$ turns off first and obtain the corresponding value of $V_{\text {in }}$. Since $D_{2}$ is assumed off, we draw the circuit as shown in Fig. 3.18(d). Assuming that $D_{1}$ is still slightly on, we recognize that at $V_{\text {in }} \approx-V_{D, o n}$, $V_{X}=V_{\text {in }}+V_{D, \text { on }}$ approaches zero, yielding a zero current through $R_{1}, R_{2}$, and hence $D_{1}$. The diode therefore turns off at $V_{i n}=-V_{D, o n}$.

We must now verify the assumption that $D_{2}$ remains off. Since at this break point, $V_{X}=V_{\text {out }}=0$, the voltage at node $Y$ is equal to $+V_{B}$ whereas the cathode of $D_{2}$ is at $-V_{D, \text { on }}$ [Fig. 3.18(e)]. In other words, $D_{2}$ is indeed off. Fig. 3.18(f) plots the input/output characteristic to the extent computed thus far, revealing that $V_{\text {out }}=0$ after the first break point because the current flowing through $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ is equal to zero.

At what point does $D_{2}$ turn on? The input voltage must exceed $V_{Y}$ by $V_{D, o n}$. Before $D_{2}$ turns on, $V_{\text {out }}=0$, and $V_{Y}=V_{B}$; i.e., $V_{\text {in }}$ must reach $V_{B}+V_{D, \text { on }}$, after which the circuit is configured as shown in Fig. 3.18(g). Consequently,

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text {out }}=V_{\text {in }}-V_{D, \text { on }}-V_{B} \tag{3.32}
\end{equation*}
$$

Figure 3.18(h) plots the overall result, summarizing the regions of operation.
Exercise In the above example, assume $D_{2}$ turns on before $D_{1}$ turns off and show that the results conflict with the assumption.

## 3.4 LARGE-SIGNAL AND SMALL-SIGNAL OPERATION

Our treatment of diodes thus far has allowed arbitrarily large voltage and current changes, thereby requiring a "general" model such as the exponential I/V characteristic. We call this regime "large-signal operation" and the exponential characteristic the "large-signal model" to emphasize that the model can accommodate arbitrary signal levels. However, as seen in previous examples, this model often complicates the analysis, making it difficult to develop an intuitive understanding of the circuit's operation. Furthermore, as the
number of nonlinear devices in the circuit increases, "manual" analysis eventually becomes impractical.

The ideal and constant-voltage diode models resolve the issues to some extent, but the sharp nonlinearity at the turn-on point still proves problematic. The following example illustrates the general difficulty.
3.17

Having lost his 2.4-V cellphone charger, an electrical engineering student tries several stores but does not find adaptors with outputs less than 3 V . He then decides to put his knowledge of electronics to work and constructs the circuit shown in Fig. 3.19, where three identical diodes in forward bias produce a total voltage of $V_{\text {out }}=3 V_{D} \approx 2.4 \mathrm{~V}$ and resistor $R_{1}$ sustains the remaining 600 mV . Neglect the current drawn by the cellphone. ${ }^{6}$ (a) Determine the reverse saturation current, $I_{S 1}$ so that $V_{\text {out }}=2.4 \mathrm{~V}$. (b) Compute $V_{\text {out }}$ if the adaptor voltage is in fact 3.1 V .
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7a57796e08278ef4e6a5g-75.jpg?height=908&width=1537&top_left_y=1738&top_left_x=1469)

Solution
(a) With $V_{\text {out }}=2.4 \mathrm{~V}$, the current flowing through $R_{1}$ is equal to

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{X} & =\frac{V_{\text {ad }}-V_{\text {out }}}{R_{1}}  \tag{3.33}\\
& =6 \mathrm{~mA} . \tag{3.34}
\end{align*}
$$

We note that each diode carries $I_{X}$ and hence

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{X}=I_{S} \exp \frac{V_{D}}{V_{T}} \tag{3.35}
\end{equation*}
$$

It follows that

$$
\begin{equation*}
6 \mathrm{~mA}=I_{S} \exp \frac{800 \mathrm{mV}}{26 \mathrm{mV}} \tag{3.36}
\end{equation*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{S}=2.602 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{~A} \tag{3.37}
\end{equation*}
$$

(b) If $V_{\text {ad }}$ increases to 3.1 V , we expect that $V_{\text {out }}$ increases only slightly. To understand why, first suppose $V_{\text {out }}$ remains constant and equal to 2.4 V . Then, the additional 0.1 V must drop across $R_{1}$, raising $I_{X}$ to 7 mA . Since the voltage across each diode has a

logarithmic dependence upon the current, the change from 6 mA to 7 mA indeed yields a small change in $V_{\text {out }}{ }^{7}$

To examine the circuit quantitatively, we begin with $I_{X}=7 \mathrm{~mA}$ and iterate:

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{\text {out }} & =3 V_{D}  \tag{3.38}\\
& =3 V_{T} \ln \frac{I_{X}}{I_{S}}  \tag{3.39}\\
& =2.412 \mathrm{~V} \tag{3.40}
\end{align*}
$$

This value of $V_{\text {out }}$ gives a new value for $I_{X}$ :

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{X} & =\frac{V_{\text {ad }}-V_{\text {out }}}{R_{1}}  \tag{3.41}\\
& =6.88 \mathrm{~mA} \tag{3.42}
\end{align*}
$$

which translates to a new $V_{\text {out }}$ :

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{\text {out }} & =3 V_{D}  \tag{3.43}\\
& =2.411 \mathrm{~V} . \tag{3.44}
\end{align*}
$$

Noting the very small difference between (3.40) and (3.44), we conclude that $V_{\text {out }}=2.411 \mathrm{~V}$ with good accuracy. The constant-voltage diode model would not be useful in this case.

Exercise Repeat the above example if an output voltage of 2.35 is desired.

The situation ${ }^{6}$ described above is an example of small "perturbations" in circuits. The change in $V_{a d}$ from 3 V to 3.1 V results in a small change in the circuit's voltages and currents, motivating us to seek a simpler analysis method that can replace the nonlinear equations and the inevitable iterative procedure. Of course, since the above example does not present an overwhelmingly difficult problem, the reader may wonder if a simpler approach is really necessary. But, as seen in subsequent chapters, circuits containing complex devices such as transistors may indeed become impossible to analyze if the nonlinear equations are retained.

These thoughts lead us to the extremely important concept of "small-signal operation," whereby the circuit experiences only small changes in voltages and currents and can therefore be simplified through the use of "small-signal models" for nonlinear devices. The simplicity arises because such models are linear, allowing standard circuit analysis and obviating the need for iteration. The definition of "small" will become clear later.

To develop our understanding of small-signal operation, let us consider diode $D_{1}$ in Fig. 3.20(a), which sustains a voltage $V_{D 1}$ and carries a current $I_{D 1}$ [point $A$ in Fig. 3.20(b)]. Now suppose a perturbation in the circuit changes the diode voltage by a small amount

[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_67d4cb928f727340196cg-02.jpg?height=777&width=2809&top_left_y=496&top_left_x=839)

Figure 3.20 (a) General circuit containing a diode, (b) operating point of $D_{1}$, (c) change in $I_{D}$ as a result of change in $V_{D}$.
$\Delta V_{D}$ [point $B$ in Fig. 3.20(c)]. How do we predict the change in the diode current, $\Delta I_{D}$ ? We can begin with the nonlinear characteristic:

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{D 2} & =I_{S} \exp \frac{V_{D 1}+\Delta V}{V_{T}}  \tag{3.45}\\
& =I_{S} \exp \frac{V_{D 1}}{V_{T}} \exp \frac{\Delta V}{V_{T}} \tag{3.46}
\end{align*}
$$

If $\Delta V \ll V_{T}$, then $\exp \left(\Delta V / V_{T}\right) \approx 1+\Delta V / V_{T}$ and

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{D 2} & =I_{S} \exp \frac{V_{D 1}}{V_{T}}+\frac{\Delta V}{V_{T}} I_{S} \exp \frac{V_{D 1}}{V_{T}}  \tag{3.47}\\
& =I_{D 1}+\frac{\Delta V}{V_{T}} I_{D 1} \tag{3.48}
\end{align*}
$$

That is,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta I_{D}=\frac{\Delta V}{V_{T}} I_{D 1} \tag{3.49}
\end{equation*}
$$

The key observation here is that $\Delta I_{D}$ is a linear function of $\Delta V$, with a proportionality factor equal to $I_{D 1} / V_{T}$. (Note that larger values of $I_{D 1}$ lead to a greater $\Delta I_{D}$ for a given $\Delta V_{D}$. The significance of this trend becomes clear later.)

The above result should not come as a surprise: if the change in $V_{D}$ is small, the section of the characteristic in Fig. 3.20(c) between points $A$ and $B$ can be approximated by a straight line (Fig. 3.21), with a slope equal to the local slope of the characteristic.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_67d4cb928f727340196cg-02.jpg?height=738&width=1622&top_left_y=4049&top_left_x=1432)

Figure 3.21 Approximation of characteristic by a straight line.

In other words,

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\Delta I_{D}}{\Delta V_{D}} & =\left.\frac{d I_{D}}{d V_{D}}\right|_{V D=V D 1}  \tag{3.50}\\
& =\frac{I_{S}}{V_{T}} \exp \frac{V_{D 1}}{V_{T}}  \tag{3.51}\\
& =\frac{I_{D 1}}{V_{T}} \tag{3.52}
\end{align*}
$$

which yields the same result as that in Eq. (3.49). ${ }^{8}$
Let us summarize our results thus far. If the voltage across a diode changes by a small amount (much less than $V_{T}$ ), then the change in the current is given by Eq. (3.49). Equivalently, for small-signal analysis, we can assume the operation is at a point such as $A$ in Fig. 3.21 and, due to a small perturbation, it moves on a straight line to point $B$ with a slope equal to the local slope of the characteristic (i.e., $d I_{D} / d V_{D}$ calculated at $V_{D}=V_{D 1}$ or $I_{D}=I_{D 1}$ ). Point $A$ is called the "bias" point, the "quiescent" point, or the "operating" point.

Example A diode is biased at a current of 1 mA . (a) Determine the current change if $V_{D}$ changes by 1 mV . (b) Determine the voltage change if $I_{D}$ changes by $10 \%$.

Solution (a) We have

$$
\begin{align*}
\Delta I_{D} & =\frac{I_{D}}{V_{T}} \Delta V_{D}  \tag{3.53}\\
& =38.4 \mu \mathrm{~A} . \tag{3.54}
\end{align*}
$$

(b) Using the same equation yields

$$
\begin{align*}
\Delta V_{D} & =\frac{V_{T}}{I_{D}} \Delta I_{D}  \tag{3.55}\\
& =\left(\frac{26 \mathrm{mV}}{1 \mathrm{~mA}}\right) \times(0.1 \mathrm{~mA})  \tag{3.56}\\
& =2.6 \mathrm{mV} \tag{3.57}
\end{align*}
$$

Exercise In response to a current change of 1 mA , a diode exhibits a voltage change of 3 mV . Calculate the bias current of the diode.

Equation (3.58) in the above example reveals an interesting aspect of small-signal operation: as far as (small) changes in the diode current and voltage are concerned, the device behaves as a linear resistor. In analogy with Ohm's Law, we define the "small-signal

[^1]resistance" of the diode as:
\$\$

$$
\begin{equation*}
r_{d}=\frac{V_{T}}{I_{D}} \tag{3.58}
\end{equation*}
$$

\$\$

This quantity is also called the "incremental" resistance to emphasize its validity for small changes. In the above example, $r_{d}=26 \Omega$.

Figure 3.22(a) summarizes the results of our derivations for a forward-biased diode. For bias calculations, the diode is replaced with an ideal voltage source of value $V_{D, o n}$, and for small changes, with a resistance equal to $r_{d}$. For example, the circuit of Fig. 3.22(b) is transformed to that in Fig. 3.22(c) if only small changes in $V_{1}$ and $V_{\text {out }}$ are of interest. Note that $v_{1}$ and $v_{\text {out }}$ in Fig. 3.22(c) represent changes in voltage and are called smallsignal quantities. In general, we denote small-signal voltages and currents by lower-case letters.

### Example

A sinusoidal signal having a peak amplitude of $V_{p}$ and a dc value of $V_{0}$ can be expressed
3.19 as $V(t)=V_{0}+V_{p} \cos \omega t$. If this signal is applied across a diode and $V_{p} \ll V_{T}$, determine the resulting diode current.

Solution The signal waveform is illustrated in Fig. 3.23(a). As shown in Fig. 3.23(b), we rotate this diagram by $90^{\circ}$ so that its vertical axis is aligned with the voltage axis of the diode characteristic. With a signal swing much less than $V_{T}$, we can view $V_{0}$ and the corresponding current, $I_{0}$, as the bias point of the diode and $V_{p}$ as a small perturbation. It follows that

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{0}=I_{S} \exp \frac{V_{0}}{V_{T}} \tag{3.59}
\end{equation*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{equation*}
r_{d}=\frac{V_{T}}{I_{0}} \tag{3.60}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus, the peak current is simply equal to

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{p} & =V_{p} / r_{d}  \tag{3.61}\\
& =\frac{I_{0}}{V_{T}} V_{p} \tag{3.62}
\end{align*}
$$

yielding

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{D}(t) & =I_{0}+I_{p} \cos \omega t  \tag{3.63}\\
& =I_{S} \exp \frac{V_{0}}{V_{T}}+\frac{I_{0}}{V_{T}} V_{p} \cos \omega t \tag{3.64}
\end{align*}
$$

Exercise The diode in the above example produces a peak current of 0.1 mA in response to $V_{0}=800 \mathrm{mV}$ and $V_{p}=1.5 \mathrm{mV}$. Calculate $I_{S}$.

The above example demonstrates the utility of small-signal analysis. If $V_{p}$ were large, we would need to solve the following equation:

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{D}(t)=I_{S} \exp \frac{V_{0}+V_{p} \cos \omega t}{V_{T}} \tag{3.65}
\end{equation*}
$$

a task much more difficult than the above linear calculations. ${ }^{9}$

In the derivation leading to Eq. (3.49), we assumed a small change in $V_{D}$ and obtained
3.20 the resulting change in $I_{D}$. Beginning with $V_{D}=V_{T} \ln \left(I_{D} / I_{S}\right)$, investigate the reverse case, i.e., $I_{D}$ changes by a small amount and we wish to compute the change in $V_{D}$.

[^2]Solution Denoting the change in $V_{D}$ by $\Delta V_{D}$, we have

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{D 1}+\Delta V_{D} & =V_{T} \ln \frac{I_{D 1}+\Delta I_{D}}{I_{S}}  \tag{3.66}\\
& =V_{T} \ln \left[\frac{I_{D 1}}{I_{S}}\left(1+\frac{\Delta I_{D}}{I_{D 1}}\right)\right]  \tag{3.67}\\
& =V_{T} \ln \frac{I_{D 1}}{I_{S}}+V_{T} \ln \left(1+\frac{\Delta I_{D}}{I_{D 1}}\right) \tag{3.68}
\end{align*}
$$

For small-signal operation, we assume $\Delta I_{D} \ll I_{D 1}$ and note that $\ln (1+\epsilon) \approx \epsilon$ if $\epsilon \ll 1$. Thus,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V_{D}=V_{T} \cdot \frac{\Delta I_{D}}{I_{D 1}} \tag{3.69}
\end{equation*}
$$

which is the same as Eq. (3.49). Figure 3.24 illustrates the two cases, distinguishing between the cause and the effect.

Figure 3.24 Change in diode current (voltage) due to a change in voltage (current).

Exercise Repeat the above example by taking the derivative of the diode voltage equation with respect to $I_{D}$.

With our understanding of small-signal operation, we now revisit Example 3.17.

Example Repeat part (b) of Example 3.17 with the aid of a small-signal model for the diodes.
3.21

Solution Since each diode carries $I_{D 1}=6 \mathrm{~mA}$ with an adaptor voltage of 3 V and $V_{D 1}=800 \mathrm{mV}$, we can construct the small-signal model shown in Fig. 3.25, where $v_{a d}=100 \mathrm{mV}$ and $r_{d}=(26 \mathrm{mV}) /(6 \mathrm{~mA})=4.33 \Omega$. (As mentioned earlier, the voltages shown in this model denote small changes.) We can thus write:

$$
\begin{align*}
v_{\text {out }} & =\frac{3 r_{d}}{R_{1}+3 r_{d}} v_{a d}  \tag{3.70}\\
& =11.5 \mathrm{mV} . \tag{3.71}
\end{align*}
$$

Figure 3.25 Small-signal model of adaptor.

That is, a 100-mV change in $V_{\text {ad }}$ yields an $11.5-\mathrm{mV}$ change in $V_{\text {out }}$. In Example 3.17, solution of nonlinear diode equations predicted an $11-\mathrm{mV}$ change in $V_{\text {out }}$. The small-signal analysis therefore offers reasonable accuracy while requiring much less computational effort.

Exercise Repeat Examples (3.17) and (3.21) if the value of $R_{1}$ in Fig. 3.19 is changed to $200 \Omega$.

Considering the power of today's computer software tools, the reader may wonder if the small-signal model is really necessary. Indeed, we utilize sophisticated simulation tools in the design of integrated circuits today, but the intuition gained by hand analysis of a circuit proves invaluable in understanding fundamental limitations and various trade-offs that eventually lead to a compromise in the design. A good circuit designer analyzes and understands the circuit before giving it to the computer for a more accurate analysis. A bad circuit designer, on the other hand, allows the computer to think for him/her.

In Examples 3.17 and 3.21, the current drawn by the cellphone is neglected. Now suppose, 3.22 as shown in Fig. 3.26, the load pulls a current of $0.5 \mathrm{~mA}^{10}$ and determine $V_{\text {out }}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_67d4cb928f727340196cg-07.jpg?height=894&width=2108&top_left_y=3634&top_left_x=904)

[^3]Solution Since the current flowing through the diodes decreases by 0.5 mA and since this change is much less than the bias current $(6 \mathrm{~mA})$, we write the change in the output voltage as:

$$
\begin{align*}
\Delta V_{\text {out }} & =\Delta I_{D} \cdot\left(3 r_{d}\right)  \tag{3.72}\\
& =0.5 \mathrm{~mA}(3 \times 4.33 \Omega)  \tag{3.73}\\
& =6.5 \mathrm{mV} \tag{3.74}
\end{align*}
$$

Exercise $\quad$ Repeat the above example if $R_{1}$ is reduced to $80 \Omega$.

### Did you know?

What would our life be like without diodes? Forget about cell phones, laptops, and digital cameras. We would not even have radios, TVs, GPS, radars, satellites, power plants, or long-distance telephone communication. And, of course, no Google or Facebook. In essence, we would return to the simple lifestyle of the early 1900s-which might not be that bad after all ...

In summary, the analysis of circuits containing diodes (and other nonlinear devices such as transistors) proceeds in three steps: (1) determine-perhaps with the aid of the constant-voltage model-the initial values of voltages and currents (before an input change is applied); (2) develop the small-signal model for each diode (i.e., calculate $r_{d}$ ); (3) replace each diode with its small-signal model and compute the effect of the input change.

### 3.5.1 Half-Wave and Full-Wave Rectifiers

Half-Wave Rectifier Let us return to the rectifier circuit of Fig. 3.10(b) and study it more closely. In particular, we no longer assume $D_{1}$ is ideal, but use a constant-voltage model. As illustrated in Fig. 3.28, $V_{\text {out }}$ remains equal to zero until $V_{\text {in }}$ exceeds $V_{D, \text { on }}$, at which point $D_{1}$ turns on and $V_{\text {out }}=V_{\text {in }}-V_{D, \text { on }}$. For $V_{\text {in }}<V_{D, \text { on }}, D_{1}$ is off ${ }^{11}$ and $V_{\text {out }}=0$. Thus, the circuit still operates as a rectifier but produces a slightly lower dc level.

Figure 3.28 Simple rectifier.
${ }^{11}$ If $V_{i n}<0, D_{1}$ carries a small leakage current, but the effect is negligible.

Prove that the circuit shown in Fig. 3.29(a) is also a rectifier.

(b)

Figure 3.29 Rectification of positive cycles.
Solution In this case, $D_{1}$ remains on for negative values of $V_{i n}$, specifically, for $V_{i n} \leq-V_{D, o n}$. As $V_{\text {in }}$ exceeds $-V_{D, \text { on }}, D_{1}$ turns off, allowing $R_{2}$ to maintain $V_{\text {out }}=0$. Depicted in Fig. 3.29, the resulting output reveals that this circuit is also a rectifier, but it blocks the positive cycles.

Exercise Plot the output if $D_{1}$ is an ideal diode.

Called a "half-wave rectifier," the circuit of Fig. 3.28 does not produce a useful output. Unlike a battery, the rectifier generates an output that varies considerably with time and cannot supply power to electronic devices. We must therefore attempt to create a constant output.

Fortunately, a simple modification solves the problem. As depicted in Fig. 3.30(a), the resistor is replaced with a capacitor. The operation of this circuit is quite different from that of the above rectifier. Assuming a constant-voltage model for $D_{1}$ in forward bias, we begin with a zero initial condition across $C_{1}$ and study the behavior of the circuit [Fig. 3.30(b)]. As $V_{\text {in }}$ rises from zero, $D_{1}$ is off until $V_{i n}>V_{D, o n}$, at which point $D_{1}$ begins to act as a battery and $V_{\text {out }}=V_{\text {in }}-V_{D, \text { on }}$. Thus, $V_{\text {out }}$ reaches a peak value of $V_{p}-V_{D, \text { on }}$. What happens as $V_{\text {in }}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_67d4cb928f727340196cg-09.jpg?height=1125&width=2832&top_left_y=3724&top_left_x=907)

Figure 3.30 (a) Diode-capacitor circuit, (b) input and output waveforms.
passes its peak value? At $t=t_{1}$, we have $V_{\text {in }}=V_{p}$ and $V_{\text {out }}=V_{p}-V_{D, o n}$. As $V_{\text {in }}$ begins to fall, $V_{\text {out }}$ must remain constant. This is because if $V_{\text {out }}$ were to fall, then $C_{1}$ would need to be discharged by a current flowing from its top plate through the cathode of $D_{1}$, which is impossible. ${ }^{12}$ The diode therefore turns off after $t_{1}$. At $t=t_{2}, V_{\text {in }}=V_{p}-V_{D, \text { on }}=V_{\text {out }}$, i.e., the diode sustains a zero voltage difference. At $t>t_{2}, V_{\text {in }}<V_{\text {out }}$ and the diode experiences a negative voltage.

Continuing our analysis, we note that at $t=t_{3}, V_{\text {in }}=-V_{p}$, applying a maximum reverse bias of $V_{\text {out }}-V_{\text {in }}=2 V_{p}-V_{D, \text { on }}$ across the diode. For this reason, diodes used in rectifiers must withstand a reverse voltage of approximately $2 V_{p}$ with no breakdown.

Does $V_{\text {out }}$ change after $t=t_{1}$ ? Let us consider $t=t_{4}$ as a potentially interesting point. Here, $V_{\text {in }}$ just exceeds $V_{\text {out }}$ but still cannot turn $D_{1}$ on. At $t=t_{5}$, $V_{\text {in }}=V_{p}=V_{\text {out }}+V_{D, \text { on }}$, and $D_{1}$ is on, but $V_{\text {out }}$ exhibits no tendency to change because the situation is identical to that at $t=t_{1}$. In other words, $V_{\text {out }}$ remains equal to $V_{p}-V_{D, \text { on }}$ indefinitely.

Example Assuming an ideal diode model, (a) Repeat the above analysis. (b) Plot the voltage across $D_{1}, V_{D 1}$, as a function of time.

Solution (a) With a zero initial condition across $C_{1}, D_{1}$ turns on as $V_{\text {in }}$ exceeds zero and $V_{\text {out }}=V_{\text {in }}$. After $t=t_{1}, V_{\text {in }}$ falls below $V_{\text {out }}$, turning $D_{1}$ off. Figure 3.31(a) shows the input and output waveforms.

(b)

Figure 3.31 (a) Input and output waveforms of the circuit in Fig. 3.30 with an ideal diode, (b) voltage across the diode.

[^4](b) The voltage across the diode is $V_{D 1}=V_{\text {in }}-V_{\text {out }}$. Using the plots in Fig. 3.31(a), we readily arrive at the waveform in Fig. 3.31(b). Interestingly, $V_{D 1}$ is similar to $V_{i n}$ but with the average value shifted from zero to $-V_{p}$. We will exploit this result in the design of voltage doublers (Section 3.5.4).

Exercise Repeat the above example if the terminals of the diode are swapped.

The circuit of Fig. 3.30(a) achieves the properties required of an "ac-dc converter," generating a constant output equal to the peak value of the input sinusoid. ${ }^{13}$ But how is the value of $C_{1}$ chosen? To answer this question, we consider a more realistic application where this circuit must provide a current to a load.

Example A laptop computer consumes an average power of 25 W with a supply voltage of 3.3 V .
3.25 Determine the average current drawn from the batteries or the adaptor.

Solution $\quad$ Since $P=V \cdot I$, we have $I \approx 7.58 \mathrm{~A}$. If the laptop is modeled by a resistor, $R_{L}$, then $R_{L}=V / I=0.436 \Omega$.

Exercise What power dissipation does a 1- $\Omega$ load represent for such a supply voltage?

As suggested by the above example, the load can be represented by a simple resistor in some cases [Fig. 3.32(a)]. We must therefore repeat our analysis with $R_{L}$ present. From the waveforms in Fig. 3.32(b), we recognize that $V_{\text {out }}$ behaves as before until $t=t_{1}$, still exhibiting a value of $V_{\text {in }}-V_{D, o n}=V_{p}-V_{D, o n}$ if the diode voltage is assumed relatively constant. However, as $V_{\text {in }}$ begins to fall after $t=t_{1}$, so does $V_{\text {out }}$ because $R_{L}$ provides a discharge path for $C_{1}$. Of course, since changes in $V_{\text {out }}$ are undesirable, $C_{1}$ must be so large that the current drawn by $R_{L}$ does not reduce $V_{\text {out }}$ significantly. With such a choice of $C_{1}$, $V_{\text {out }}$ falls slowly and $D_{1}$ remains reverse biased.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_67d4cb928f727340196cg-11.jpg?height=1068&width=2886&top_left_y=3222&top_left_x=886)

Figure 3.32 (a) Rectifier driving a resistive load, (b) input and output waveforms.

[^5]The output voltage continues to decrease while $V_{i n}$ goes through a negative excursion and returns to positive values. At some point, $t=t_{2}, V_{\text {in }}$ and $V_{\text {out }}$ become equal and slightly later, at $t=t_{3}, V_{\text {in }}$ exceeds $V_{\text {out }}$ by $V_{D, o n}$, thereby turning $D_{1}$ on and forcing $V_{\text {out }}=V_{\text {in }}-V_{D, \text { on }}$. Hereafter, the circuit behaves as in the first cycle. The resulting variation in $V_{\text {out }}$ is called the "ripple." Also, $C_{1}$ is called the "smoothing" or "filter" capacitor.

Sketch the output waveform of Fig. 3.32 as $C_{1}$ varies from very large values to very small values.

Solution If $C_{1}$ is very large, the current drawn by $R_{L}$ when $D_{1}$ is off creates only a small change in $V_{\text {out }}$. Conversely, if $C_{1}$ is very small, the circuit approaches that in Fig. 3.28, exhibiting large variations in $V_{\text {out }}$. Figure 3.33 illustrates several cases.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_67d4cb928f727340196cg-12.jpg?height=801&width=1585&top_left_y=1797&top_left_x=1456)

Figure 3.33 Output waveform of rectifier for different values of smoothing capacitor.

Exercise $\quad$ Repeat the above example for different values of $R_{L}$ with $C_{1}$ constant.

Ripple Amplitude* In typical applications, the (peak-to-peak) amplitude of the ripple, $V_{R}$, in Fig. 3.32(b) must remain below 5 to $10 \%$ of the input peak voltage. If the maximum current drawn by the load is known, the value of $C_{1}$ is chosen large enough to yield an acceptable ripple. To this end, we must compute $V_{R}$ analytically (Fig. 3.34). Since $V_{\text {out }}=V_{p}-V_{D, \text { on }}$ at $t=t_{1}$, the discharge of $C_{1}$ through $R_{L}$ can be expressed as:

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text {out }}(t)=\left(V_{p}-V_{D, \text { on }}\right) \exp \frac{-t}{R_{L} C_{1}} \quad 0 \leq t \leq t_{3} \tag{3.75}
\end{equation*}
$$

where we have chosen $t_{1}=0$ for simplicity. To ensure a small ripple, $R_{L} C_{1}$ must be much greater than $t_{3}-t_{1}$; thus, noting that $\exp (-\epsilon) \approx 1-\epsilon$ for $\epsilon \ll 1$,

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{\text {out }}(t) \approx & \left(V_{p}-V_{D, \text { on }}\right)\left(1-\frac{t}{R_{L} C_{1}}\right)  \tag{3.76}\\
& \approx\left(V_{p}-V_{D, \text { on }}\right)-\frac{V_{p}-V_{D, \text { on }}}{R_{L}} \cdot \frac{t}{C_{1}} \tag{3.77}
\end{align*}
$$

Figure 3.34 Ripple at output of a rectifier.

The first term on the right-hand side represents the initial condition across $C_{1}$ and the second term, a falling ramp-as if a constant current equal to $\left(V_{p}-V_{D, o n}\right) / R_{L}$ discharges $C_{1}{ }^{14}$ This result should not come as a surprise because the nearly constant voltage across $R_{L}$ results in a relatively constant current equal to $\left(V_{p}-V_{D, \text { on }}\right) / R_{L}$.

The peak-to-peak amplitude of the ripple is equal to the amount of discharge at $t=t_{3}$. Since $t_{4}-t_{3}$ is equal to the input period, $T_{i n}$, we write $t_{3}-t_{1}=T_{\text {in }}-\Delta T$, where $\Delta T\left(=t_{4}-t_{3}\right)$ denotes the time during which $D_{1}$ is on. Thus,

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{R}=\frac{V_{p}-V_{D . m}}{R_{L}} \frac{T_{n-n}-\Delta T}{C_{1}} \tag{3.78}
\end{equation*}
$$

Recognizing that if $C_{1}$ discharges by a small amount, then the diode turns on for only a brief period, we can assume $\Delta T \ll T_{i n}$ and hence

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{R} & \approx \frac{V_{p}-V_{D . m}}{R_{L}} \cdot \frac{T_{i}}{C_{1}}  \tag{3.79}\\
& \approx \frac{V_{p}-V_{D, \text { em }}}{R_{L} C_{1} f_{m}} \tag{3.80}
\end{align*}
$$

where $f_{\text {in }}=T_{\text {in }}^{-1}$.

Example 3.97

A transformer converts the $110-\mathrm{V}, 60-\mathrm{Hz}$ line voltage to a peak-to-peak swing of 9 V . A half-wave rectifier follows the transformer to supply the power to the laptop computer of Example 3.25. Determine the minimum value of the filter capacitor that maintains the ripple below 0.1 V . Assume $V_{D . . . m}=0.8 \mathrm{~V}$.

Solution We have $V_{p}=4.5 \mathrm{~V}, R_{L}=0.436 \Omega$, and $T_{\text {in }}=16.7 \mathrm{~ms}$. Thus,

$$
\begin{align*}
C_{1} & =\frac{V_{p}-V_{D, a n}}{V_{R}} \cdot \frac{T_{\text {k }}}{R_{L}}  \tag{3.81}\\
& =1.417 \mathrm{~F} . \tag{3.82}
\end{align*}
$$

[^7]This is a very large value. The designer must trade the ripple amplitude with the size, weight, and cost of the capacitor. In fact, limitations on size, weight, and cost of the adaptor may dictate a much greater ripple, e.g., 0.5 V , thereby demanding that the circuit following the rectifier tolerate such a large, periodic variation.

Exercise Repeat the above example for $220-\mathrm{V}, 50-\mathrm{Hz}$ line voltage, assuming the transformer still produces a peak-to-peak swing of 9 V . Which mains frequency gives a more desirable choice of $C_{1}$ ?

In many cases, the current drawn by the load is known. Repeating the above analysis with the load represented by a constant current source or simply viewing $\left(V_{p}-V_{D, o n}\right) / R_{L}$ in Eq. (3.80) as the load current, $I_{L}$, we can write

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{R}=\frac{I_{L}}{C_{1} f_{i n}} \tag{3.83}
\end{equation*}
$$

Diode Peak Current* We noted in Fig. 3.30(b) that the diode must exhibit a reverse breakdown voltage of at least $2 \mathrm{~V}_{p}$. Another important parameter of the diode is the maximum forward bias current that it must tolerate. For a given junction doping profile and geometry, if the current exceeds a certain limit, the power dissipated in the diode $\left(=V_{D} I_{D}\right)$ may raise the junction temperature so much as to damage the device.

Figure 3.35 Rectifier circuit for calculation of $I_{D}$.
We recognize from Fig. 3.35, that the diode current in forward bias consists of two components: (1) the transient current drawn by $C_{1}, C_{1} d V_{\text {out }} / d t$, and (2) the current supplied to $R_{L}$, approximately equal to $\left(V_{p}-V_{D, o n}\right) / R_{L}$. The peak diode current therefore occurs when the first component reaches a maximum, i.e., at the point $D_{1}$ turns on because the slope of the output waveform is maximum. Assuming $V_{D, o n} \ll V_{p}$ for simplicity, we note that the point at which $D_{1}$ turns on is given by $V_{i n}\left(t_{1}\right)=V_{p}-V_{R}$. Thus, for $V_{\text {in }}(t)=V_{p} \sin \omega_{\text {in }} t$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{p} \sin \omega_{i n} t_{1}=V_{p}-V_{R} \tag{3.84}
\end{equation*}
$$

and hence

$$
\begin{equation*}
\sin \omega_{i n} t_{1}=1-\frac{V_{R}}{V_{p}} \tag{3.85}
\end{equation*}
$$

*This section can be skipped in a first reading.

With $V_{D, \text { on }}$ neglected, we also have $V_{\text {out }}(t) \approx V_{\text {in }}(t)$, obtaining the diode current as

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{D 1}(t) & =C_{1} \frac{d V_{\text {out }}}{d t}+\frac{V_{p}}{R_{L}}  \tag{3.86}\\
& =C_{1} \omega_{\text {in }} V_{p} \cos \omega_{\text {in }} t+\frac{V_{p}}{R_{L}} \tag{3.87}
\end{align*}
$$

This current reaches a peak at $t=t_{1}$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{p}=C_{1} \omega_{i n} V_{p} \cos \omega_{i n} t_{1}+\frac{V_{p}}{R_{L}} \tag{3.88}
\end{equation*}
$$

which, from (3.85), reduces to

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{p} & =C_{1} \omega_{i n} V_{p} \sqrt{1-\left(1-\frac{V_{R}}{V_{p}}\right)^{2}}+\frac{V_{p}}{R_{L}}  \tag{3.89}\\
& =C_{1} \omega_{i n} V_{p} \sqrt{\frac{2 V_{R}}{V_{p}}-\frac{V_{R}^{2}}{V_{p}^{2}}}+\frac{V_{p}}{R_{L}} \tag{3.90}
\end{align*}
$$

Since $V_{R} \ll V_{p}$, we neglect the second term under the square root:

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{p} & \approx C_{1} \omega_{i n} V_{p} \sqrt{\frac{2 V_{R}}{V_{p}}}+\frac{V_{p}}{R_{L}}  \tag{3.91}\\
& \approx \frac{V_{p}}{R_{L}}\left(R_{L} C_{1} \omega_{i n} \sqrt{\frac{2 V_{R}}{V_{p}}}+1\right) \tag{3.92}
\end{align*}
$$

Example Determine the peak diode current in Example 3.27 assuming $V_{D, \text { on }} \approx 0$ and $C_{1}=1.417 \mathrm{~F}$.

Solution We have $V_{p}=4.5 \mathrm{~V}, R_{L}=0.436 \Omega, \omega_{i n}=2 \pi(60 \mathrm{~Hz})$, and $V_{R}=0.1 \mathrm{~V}$. Thus,

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{p}=517 \mathrm{~A} \tag{3.93}
\end{equation*}
$$

This value is extremely large. Note that the current drawn by $C_{1}$ is much greater than that flowing through $R_{L}$.

Exercise Repeat the above example if $C_{1}=1000 \mu \mathrm{~F}$.

Full-Wave Rectifier The half-wave rectifier studied above blocks the negative half cycles of the input, allowing the filter capacitor to be discharged by the load for almost the entire period. The circuit therefore suffers from a large ripple in the presence of a heavy load (a high current).

It is possible to reduce the ripple voltage by a factor of two through a simple modification. Illustrated in Fig. 3.36(a), the idea is to pass both positive and negative half cycles to the output, but with the negative half cycles inverted (i.e., multiplied by -1 ). We first implement a circuit that performs this function [called a "full-wave
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_67d4cb928f727340196cg-16.jpg?height=914&width=2752&top_left_y=593&top_left_x=856)

Figure 3.36 (a) Input and output waveforms and (b) input/output characteristic of a full-wave rectifier.
rectifier" (FWR)] and next prove that it indeed exhibits a smaller ripple. We begin with the assumption that the diodes are ideal to simplify the task of circuit synthesis. Figure 3.36(b) depicts the desired input/output characteristic of the full-wave rectifier.

Consider the two half-wave rectifiers shown in Fig. 3.37(a), where one blocks negative half cycles and the other, positive half cycles. Can we combine these circuits to realize a full-wave rectifier? We may attempt the circuit in Fig. 3.37(b), but, unfortunately, the output contains both positive and negative half cycles, i.e., no rectification is performed because the negative half cycles are not inverted. Thus, the problem is reduced to that illustrated in Fig. 3.37(c): we must first design a half-wave rectifier that inverts. Shown in Fig. 3.37(d) is such a topology, which can also be redrawn as in Fig. 3.37(e) for simplicity. Note the polarity of $V_{\text {out }}$ in the two diagrams. Here, if $V_{\text {in }}<0$, both $D_{2}$ and $D_{1}$ are on and $V_{\text {out }}=-V_{\text {in }}$. Conversely, if $V_{\text {in }}>0$, both diodes are off, yielding a zero current through $R_{L}$ and hence $V_{\text {out }}=0$. In analogy with this circuit, we also compose that in Fig. 3.37(f), which simply blocks the negative input half cycles; i.e., $V_{\text {out }}=0$ for $V_{\text {in }}<0$ and $V_{\text {out }}=V_{\text {in }}$ for $V_{i n}>0$.

Figure 3.38 (a) Full-wave rectifier, (b) simplified diagram, (c) current path for negative input, (d) current path for positive input.

With the foregoing developments, we can now combine the topologies of Figs. 3.37(d) and (f) to form a full-wave rectifier. Depicted in Fig. 3.38(a), the resulting circuit passes the negative half cycles through $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$ with a sign reversal [as in Fig. 3.37(d)] and the positive half cycles through $D_{3}$ and $D_{4}$ with no sign reversal [as in Fig. 3.37(f)]. This configuration is usually drawn as in Fig. 3.38(b)and called a "bridge rectifier."

Let us summarize our thoughts with the aid of the circuit shown in Fig. 3.38(b). If $V_{\text {in }}<0, D_{2}$ and $D_{1}$ are on and $D_{3}$ and $D_{4}$ are off, reducing the circuit to that shown in Fig. 3.38(c) and yielding $V_{\text {out }}=-V_{\text {in }}$. On the other hand, if $V_{\text {in }}>0$, the bridge is simplified as shown in Fig. 3.38(d), and $V_{\text {out }}=V_{\text {in }}$.

How do these results change if the diodes are not ideal? Figures 3.38(c) and (d) reveal that the circuit introduces two forward-biased diodes in series with $R_{L}$, yielding $V_{\text {out }}=-V_{\text {in }}-2 V_{D, \text { on }}$ for $V_{\text {in }}<0$. By contrast, the half-wave rectifier in Fig. 3.28produces $V_{\text {out }}=V_{\text {in }}-V_{D, \text { on }}$. The drop of $2 V_{D, \text { on }}$ may pose difficulty if $V_{p}$ is relatively small and the output voltage must be close to $V_{p}$.

Assuming a constant-voltage model for the diodes, plot the input/output characteristic of a full-wave rectifier.

Solution The output remains equal to zero for $\left|V_{i n}\right|<2 V_{D, \text { on }}$ and "tracks" the input for $\left|V_{i n}\right|>V_{D, \text { on }}$ with a slope of unity. Figure 3.39 plots the result.

Exercise What is the slope of the characteristic for $\left|V_{i n}\right|>2 V_{D, o n}$ ?

We now redraw the bridge once more and add the smoothing capacitor to arrive at the complete design [Fig. 3.40(a)]. Since the capacitor discharge occurs for about half of
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_67d4cb928f727340196cg-18.jpg?height=908&width=1245&top_left_y=722&top_left_x=1621)

Figure 3.39 Input/output characteristic of full-wave rectifier with nonideal diodes.
the input cycle, the ripple is approximately equal to half of that in Eq. (3.80):

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{R} \approx \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{V_{p}-2 V_{D, o n}}{R_{L} C_{1} f_{i n}} \tag{3.94}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the numerator reflects the drop of $2 V_{D, \text { on }}$ due to the bridge.
In addition to a lower ripple, the full-wave rectifier offers another important advantage: the maximum reverse bias voltage across each diode is approximately equal to $V_{p}$ rather than $2 V_{p}$. As illustrated in Fig. 3.40(b), when $V_{i n}$ is near $V_{p}$ and $D_{3}$ is on, the voltage across $D_{2}, V_{A B}$, is simply equal to $V_{D, \text { on }}+V_{\text {out }}=V_{p}-V_{D, \text { on }}$. A similar argument applies to the other diodes.

Figure 3.40 (a) Ripple in full-wave rectifier, (b) equivalent circuit.

Another point of contrast between half-wave and full-wave rectifiers is that the former has a common terminal between the input and output ports (node $G$ in Fig. 3.28), whereas the latter does not. In Problem 3.40, we study the effect of shorting the input and output grounds of a full-wave rectifier and conclude that it disrupts the operation of the circuit.

Example Plot the currents carried by each diode in a bridge rectifier as a function of
3.30 time for a sinusoidal input. Assume no smoothing capacitor is connected to the output.

Solution From Figs. 3.38(c) and (d), we have $V_{\text {out }}=-V_{\text {in }}+2 V_{D, \text { on }}$ for $V_{\text {in }}<-2 V_{D, \text { on }}$ and $V_{\text {out }}=V_{\text {in }}-2 V_{D, \text { on }}$ for $V_{\text {in }}>+2 V_{D, \text { on }}$. In each half cycle, two of the diodes carry a current equal to $V_{\text {out }} / R_{L}$ and the other two remain off. Thus, the diode currents appear as shown in Fig. 3.41.

The results of our study are summarized in Fig. 3.42. While using two more diodes, fullwave rectifiers exhibit a lower ripple and require only half the diode breakdown voltage, well justifying their use in adaptors and chargers. ${ }^{15}$

Figure 3.42 Summary of rectifier circuits.

Example
3.31

Design a full-wave rectifier to deliver an average power of 2 W to a cellphone with a voltage of 3.6 V and a ripple of 0.2 V .

Solution We begin with the required input swing. Since the output voltage is approximately equal to $V_{p}-2 V_{D, o n}$, we have

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{i n, p} & =3.6 \mathrm{~V}+2 V_{D, o n}  \tag{3.95}\\
& \approx 5.2 \mathrm{~V} . \tag{3.96}
\end{align*}
$$

Thus, the transformer preceding the rectifier must step the line voltage $\left(110 \mathrm{~V}_{r m s}\right.$ or $220 \mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{rms}}$ ) down to a peak value of 5.2 V .

Next, we determine the minimum value of the smoothing capacitor that ensures $V_{R} \leq 0.2 \mathrm{~V}$. Rewriting Eq. (3.83) for a full-wave rectifier gives

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{R} & =\frac{I_{L}}{2 C_{1} f_{\text {in }}}  \tag{3.97}\\
& =\frac{2 \mathrm{~W}}{3.6 \mathrm{~V}} \cdot \frac{1}{2 C_{1} f_{\text {in }}} . \tag{3.98}
\end{align*}
$$

For $V_{R}=0.2 \mathrm{~V}$ and $f_{\text {in }}=60 \mathrm{~Hz}$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
C_{1}=23,000 \mu \mathrm{~F} \tag{3.99}
\end{equation*}
$$

The diodes must withstand a reverse bias voltage of 5.2 V .

Exercise If cost and size limitations impose a maximum value of $1000 \mu \mathrm{~F}$ on the smoothing capacitor, what is the maximum allowable power drain in the above example?

A radio frequency signal received and amplified by a cellphone exhibits a peak swing of
3.32 10 mV . We wish to generate a dc voltage representing the signal amplitude [Eq. (3.8)]. Is it possible to use the half-wave or full-wave rectifiers studied above?

Solution No, it is not. Owing to its small amplitude, the signal cannot turn actual diodes on and off, resulting in a zero output. For such signal levels, "precision rectification" is necessary, a subject studied in Chapter 8.

Exercise What if a constant voltage of 0.8 V is added to the desired signal?

### 3.5.2 Voltage Regulation*

The adaptor circuit studied above generally proves inadequate. Due to the significant variation of the line voltage, the peak amplitude produced by the transformer and hence the dc output vary considerably, possibly exceeding the maximum level that can be tolerated by the load (e.g., a cellphone). Furthermore, the ripple may become seriously objectionable in many applications. For example, if the adaptor supplies power to a stereo, the $120-\mathrm{Hz}$ ripple can be heard from the speakers. Moreover, the finite output impedance of the transformer leads to changes in $V_{\text {out }}$ if the current drawn by the load varies. For these reasons, the circuit of Fig. 3.40(a) is often followed by a "voltage regulator" so as to provide a constant output.

We have already encountered a voltage regulator without calling it such: the circuit studied in Example 3.17 provides a voltage of 2.4 V , incurring only an $11-\mathrm{mV}$ change in the output for a $100-\mathrm{mV}$ variation in the input. We may therefore arrive at the circuit shown in Fig. 3.43 as a more versatile adaptor having a nominal output of $3 V_{D, \text { on }} \approx 2.4 \mathrm{~V}$. Unfortunately, as studied in Example 3.22, the output voltage varies with the load current.

Figure 3.44 (a) Regulator using a Zener diode, (b) small-signal equivalent of (a).

Did you know?

The diodes used in power supplies may not seem to have a large carbon footprint, but if we add up the power consumption of all of the diodes in the world, we see a frightening picture.

As an example, consider Google's server farms. It is estimated that Google has about half a million servers. If one server draws 200 W from a 12-V supply, then each rectifier diode carries an average current of $200 \mathrm{~W} / 12 \mathrm{~V} / 2 \approx 8.5 \mathrm{~A}$. (We assume two diodes alternately turn on, each carrying half of the server's average current.) With a forward bias of about 0.7 V , two diodes consume 12 W, suggesting that the rectifier diodes in Google's servers dissipate a total power of roughly 6 MW. This is equivalent to the power generated by about 10 nuclear power plants! Indeed, a great deal of effort is presently expended on "green electronics," trying to reduce the power consumption of every circuit, including the power supply itself. (Our example is actually quite pessimistic as computers use "switching" power supplies to improve the efficiency.)

Figure 3.44(a) shows another regulator circuit employing a Zener diode. Operating in the reverse breakdown region, $D_{1}$ exhibits a small-signal resistance, $r_{D}$, in the range of 1 to $10 \Omega$, thus providing a relatively constant output despite input variations if $r_{D} \ll R_{1}$. This can be seen from the small-signal model of Fig. 3.44(b):

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{\text {out }}=\frac{r_{D}}{r_{D}+R_{1}} v_{\text {in }} \tag{3.100}
\end{equation*}
$$

For example, if $r_{D}=5 \Omega$ and $R_{1}=1 \mathrm{k} \Omega$, then changes in $V_{\text {in }}$ are attenuated by approximately a factor of 200 as they appear in $V_{\text {out }}$. The Zener regulator nonetheless has the same drawback as the circuit of Fig. 3.43, namely, poor stability if the load current varies significantly.

Our brief study of regulators thus far reveals two important aspects of their design: the stability of the output with respect to input variations, and the stability of the output with respect to load current variations. The former is quantified by "line regulation," defined as $\Delta V_{\text {out }} / \Delta V_{\text {in }}$, and the latter by "load regulation," defined as $\Delta V_{\text {out }} / \Delta I_{L}$.

(c)

Figure 3.45 Circuit using two diodes, (b) small-signal equivalent, (c) load regulation.

Solution We first determine the bias current of $D_{1}$ and hence its small-signal resistance:

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{D 1} & =\frac{V_{i n}-V_{D, \text { on }}-V_{D 2}}{R_{1}}  \tag{3.101}\\
& =15 \mathrm{~mA} . \tag{3.102}
\end{align*}
$$

Thus,

$$
\begin{align*}
r_{D 1} & =\frac{V_{T}}{I_{D 1}}  \tag{3.103}\\
& =1.73 \Omega . \tag{3.104}
\end{align*}
$$

From the small-signal model of Fig. 3.44(b), we compute the line regulation as

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{v_{\text {out }}}{v_{\text {in }}} & =\frac{r_{D 1}+r_{D 2}}{r_{D 1}+r_{D 2}+R_{1}}  \tag{3.105}\\
& =0.063 \tag{3.106}
\end{align*}
$$

For load regulation, we assume the input is constant and study the effect of load current variations. Using the small-signal circuit shown in Fig. 3.45(c) (where $v_{i n}=0$ to represent a constant input), we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{\text {out }}}{\left(r_{D 1}+r_{D 2}\right) \| R_{1}}=-i_{L} \tag{3.107}
\end{equation*}
$$

That is,

$$
\begin{align*}
\left|\frac{v_{\text {out }}}{i_{L}}\right| & =\left(r_{D 1}+r_{D 2}\right) \| R_{1}  \tag{3.108}\\
& =6.31 \Omega . \tag{3.109}
\end{align*}
$$

This value indicates that a $1-\mathrm{mA}$ change in the load current results in a $6.31-\mathrm{mV}$ change in the output voltage.

Exercise Repeat the above example for $R_{1}=50 \Omega$ and compare the results.

### 3.5.3 Limiting Circuits

Consider the signal received by a cellphone as the user comes closer to a base station (Fig. 3.47). As the distance decreases from kilometers to hundreds of meters, the signal level may become large enough to "saturate" the circuits as it travels through the receiver chain. It is therefore desirable to "limit" the signal amplitude at a suitable point in the receiver.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_67d4cb928f727340196cg-24.jpg?height=629&width=2816&top_left_y=587&top_left_x=835)

Figure 3.47 Signals received (a) far from or (b) near a base station.

How should a limiting circuit behave? For small input levels, the circuit must simply pass the input to the output, e.g., $V_{\text {out }}=V_{\text {in }}$, and as the input level exceeds a "threshold" or "limit," the output must remain constant. This behavior must hold for both positive and negative inputs, translating to the input/output characteristic shown in Fig. 3.48(a). As illustrated in Fig. 3.48(b), a signal applied to the input emerges at the output with its peak values "clipped" at $\pm V_{L}$.

We now implement a circuit that exhibits the above behavior. The nonlinear input/ output characteristic suggests that one or more diodes must turn on or off as $V_{i n}$ approaches $\pm V_{L}$. In fact, we have already seen simple examples in Figs. 3.11(b)and (c), where the positive half cycles of the input are clipped at 0 V and +1 V , respectively. We reexamine the former assuming a more realistic diode, e.g., the constant-voltage model. As illustrated in Fig. 3.49(a), $V_{\text {out }}$ is equal to $V_{\text {in }}$ for $V_{\text {in }}<V_{D, \text { on }}$ and equal to $V_{D, \text { on }}$ thereafter.

To serve as a more general limiting circuit, the above topology must satisfy two other conditions. First, the limiting level, $V_{L}$, must be an arbitrary voltage and not necessarily equal to $V_{D, o n}$. Inspired by the circuit of Fig. 3.11 (c), we postulate that a constant voltage source in series with $D_{1}$ shifts the limiting point, accomplishing this objective. Depicted in Fig. 3.49(b), the resulting circuit limits at $V_{L}=V_{B 1}+V_{D, \text { on }}$. Note that $V_{B 1}$ can be positive or negative to shift $V_{L}$ to higher or lower values, respectively.

Second, the negative values of $V_{i n}$ must also experience limiting. Beginning with the circuit of Fig. 3.49(a), we recognize that if the anode and cathode of $D_{1}$ are swapped, then the circuit limits at $V_{i n}=-V_{D, \text { on }}$ [Fig. 3.50(a)]. Thus, as shown in Fig. 3.50(b), two "antiparallel" diodes can create a characteristic that limits at $\pm V_{D, o n}$. Finally, inserting constant voltage sources in series with the diodes shifts the limiting points to arbitrary levels (Fig. 3.51).

Example A signal must be limited at $\pm 100 \mathrm{mV}$. Assuming $V_{D, o n}=800 \mathrm{mV}$, design the required limiting circuit.

Solution
Figure 3.52(a) illustrates how the voltage sources must shift the break points. Since the positive limiting point must shift to the left, the voltage source in series with $D_{1}$ must be negative and equal to 700 mV . Similarly, the source in series with $D_{2}$ must be positive and equal to 700 mV . Figure 3.52(b) shows the result.

Exercise Repeat the above example if the positive values of the signal must be limited at +200 mV and the negative values at -1.1 V .

Before concluding this section, we make two observations. First, the circuits studied above actually display a nonzero slope in the limiting region (Fig. 3.53). This is because, as $V_{i n}$ increases, so does the current through the diode that is forward biased and hence the diode voltage. ${ }^{16}$ Nonetheless, the $60-\mathrm{mV} /$ decade rule expressed by Eq. (2.109) implies that this effect is typically negligible. Second, we have thus far assumed $V_{\text {out }}=V_{\text {in }}$ for $-V_{L}<V_{\text {in }}<+V_{L}$, but it is possible to realize a non-unity slope in the region: $V_{\text {out }}=\alpha V_{\text {in }}$.
${ }^{16}$ Recall that $V_{D}=V_{T} \ln \left(I_{D} / I_{S}\right)$.

### 3.5.4 Voltage Doublers*

Electronic systems typically employ a "global" supply voltage, e.g., 3 V , requiring that the discrete and integrated circuits operate with such a value. However, the design of some circuits in the system is greatly simplified if they run from a higher supply voltage, e.g., 6 V . "Voltage doublers" may serve this purpose. ${ }^{17}$

Before studying doublers, it is helpful to review some basic properties of capacitors. First, to charge one plate of a capacitor to $+Q$, the other plate must be charged to $-Q$. Thus, in the circuit of Fig. 3.54(a), the voltage across $C_{1}$ cannot change even if $V_{i n}$ changes because the right plate of $C_{1}$ cannot receive or release charge $(Q=C V)$. Since $V_{C 1}$ remains constant, an input change $\Delta V_{\text {in }}$ appears directly at the output. This is an important observation.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_67d4cb928f727340196cg-27.jpg?height=601&width=2467&top_left_y=2542&top_left_x=1147)

Figure 3.54 (a) Voltage change at one plate of a capacitor, (b) voltage division.

Second, a capacitive voltage divider such as that in Fig. 3.54(b) operates as follows. If $V_{i n}$ becomes more positive, the left plate of $C_{1}$ receives positive charge from $V_{i n}$, thus requiring that the right plate absorb negative charge of the same magnitude from the top plate of $C_{2}$. Having lost negative charge, the top plate of $C_{2}$ equivalently holds more positive charge, and hence the bottom plate absorbs negative charge from ground. Note that all four plates receive or release equal amounts of charge because $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ are in series. To determine the change in $V_{\text {out }}, \Delta V_{\text {out }}$, resulting from $\Delta V_{\text {in }}$, we write the change in the charge on $C_{2}$ as $\Delta Q_{2}=C_{2} \cdot \Delta V_{\text {out }}$, which also holds for $C_{1}: \Delta Q_{2}=\Delta Q_{1}$. Thus, the voltage change across $C_{1}$ is equal to $C_{2} \cdot \Delta V_{\text {out }} / C_{1}$. Adding these two voltage changes and equating the result to $\Delta V_{i n}$, we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V_{\text {in }}=\frac{C_{2}}{C_{1}} \Delta V_{\text {out }}+\Delta V_{\text {out }} \tag{3.110}
\end{equation*}
$$

[^9]That is,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V_{\text {out }}=\frac{C_{1}}{C_{1}+C_{2}} \Delta V_{\text {in }} \tag{3.111}
\end{equation*}
$$

This result is similar to the voltage division expression for resistive dividers, except that $C_{1}$ (rather than $C_{2}$ ) appears in the numerator. Interestingly, the circuit of Fig. 3.54(a) is a special case of the capacitive divider with $C_{2}=0$ and hence $\Delta V_{\text {out }}=\Delta V_{\text {in }}$.

As our first step toward realizing a voltage doubler, recall the result illustrated in Fig. 3.31: the voltage across the diode in the peak detector exhibits an average value of $-V_{p}$ and, more importantly, a peak value of $-2 V_{p}$ (with respect to zero). For further investigation, we redraw the circuit as shown in Fig. 3.55, where the diode and the capacitors are exchanged and the voltage across $D_{1}$ is labeled $V_{\text {out }}$. While $V_{\text {out }}$ in this circuit behaves exactly the same as $V_{D 1}$ in Fig. 3.30(a), we derive the output waveform from a different perspective so as to gain more insight.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_67d4cb928f727340196cg-28.jpg?height=1091&width=2827&top_left_y=2149&top_left_x=824)

Figure 3.55 (a) Capacitor-diode circuit and (b) its waveforms.

Assuming an ideal diode and a zero initial condition across $C_{1}$, we note that as $V_{\text {in }}$ exceeds zero, the input tends to place positive charge on the left plate of $C_{1}$ and hence draw negative charge from $D_{1}$. Consequently, $D_{1}$ turns on, forcing $V_{\text {out }}=0 .{ }^{18}$ As the input rises toward $V_{p}$, the voltage across $C_{1}$ remains equal to $V_{i n}$ because its right plate is "pinned" at zero by $D_{1}$. After $t=t_{1}, V_{\text {in }}$ begins to fall and tends to discharge $C_{1}$, i.e., draw positive charge from the left plate and hence from $D_{1}$. The diode therefore turns off, reducing the circuit to that in Fig. 3.54(a). From this time, the output simply tracks the changes in the input while $C_{1}$ sustains a constant voltage equal to $V_{p}$. In particular, as $V_{i n}$ varies from $+V_{p}$ to $-V_{p}$, the output goes from zero to $-2 V_{p}$, and the cycle repeats indefinitely. The output waveform is thus identical to that obtained in Fig. 3.31(b).

[^10]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_67d4cb928f727340196cg-29.jpg?height=1971&width=3123&top_left_y=510&top_left_x=573)

Figure 3.56 Capacitor-diode circuit and (b) its waveforms.

Solution As $V_{\text {in }}$ rises from zero, attempting to place positive charge on the left plate of $C_{1}$ and hence draw negative charge from $D_{1}$, the diode turns off. As a result, $C_{1}$ directly transfers the input change to the output for the entire positive half cycle. After $t=t_{1}$, the input tends to push negative charge into $C_{1}$, turning $D_{1}$ on and forcing $V_{\text {out }}=0$. Thus, the voltage across $C_{1}$ remains equal to $V_{\text {in }}$ until $t=t_{2}$, at which point the direction of the current through $C_{1}$ and $D_{1}$ must change, turning $D_{1}$ off. Now, $C_{1}$ carries a voltage equal to $V_{p}$ and transfers the input change to the output; i.e., the output tracks the input but with a level shift of $+V_{p}$, reaching a peak value of $+2 V_{p}$.

Exercise Repeat the above example if the right plate of $C_{1}$ is 1 V more positive than its left plate at $t=0$.

We have thus far developed circuits that generate a periodic output with a peak value of $-2 V_{p}$ or $+2 V_{p}$ for an input sinusoid varying between $-V_{p}$ and $+V_{p}$. We surmise that if these circuits are followed by a peak detector [e.g., Fig. 3.30(a)], then a constant output equal to $-2 V_{p}$ or $+2 V_{p}$ may be produced. Figure 3.57 exemplifies this concept, combining the circuit of Fig. 3.56 with the peak detector of Fig. 3.30(a). Of course, since the peak detector "loads" the first stage when $D_{2}$ turns on, we must still analyze this circuit carefully and determine whether it indeed operates as a voltage doubler.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_67d4cb928f727340196cg-30.jpg?height=1913&width=2815&top_left_y=653&top_left_x=830)

Figure 3.57 Voltage doubler circuit and its waveforms.

We assume ideal diodes, zero initial conditions across $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$, and $C_{1}=C_{2}$. In this case, the analysis is simplified if we begin with a negative cycle. As $V_{\text {in }}$ falls below zero, $D_{1}$ turns on, pinning node $X$ to zero. ${ }^{19}$ Thus, for $t<t_{1}, D_{2}$ remains off and $V_{\text {out }}=0$. At $t=t_{1}$, the voltage across $C_{1}$ reaches $-V_{p}$. For $t>t_{1}$, the input begins to rise and tends to deposit positive charge on the left plate of $C_{1}$, turning $D_{1}$ off and yielding the circuit shown in Fig. 3.57.

How does $D_{2}$ behave in this regime? Since $V_{i n}$ is now rising, we postulate that $V_{X}$ also tends to increase (from zero), turning $D_{2}$ on. (If $D_{2}$ remains off, then $C_{1}$ simply transfers the change in $V_{i n}$ to node $X$, raising $V_{X}$ and hence turning $D_{2}$ on.) As a result, the circuit reduces to a simple capacitive divider that follows Eq. (3.111):

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V_{\text {out }}=\frac{1}{2} \Delta V_{\text {in }} \tag{3.112}
\end{equation*}
$$

because $C_{1}=C_{2}$. In other words, $V_{X}$ and $V_{\text {out }}$ begin from zero, remain equal, and vary sinusoidally but with an amplitude equal to $V_{p} / 2$. Thus, from $t_{1}$ to $t_{2}$, a change of $2 V_{p}$ in $V_{\text {in }}$ appears as a change equal to $V_{p}$ in $V_{X}$ and $V_{\text {out }}$. Note at $t=t_{2}$, the voltage across $C_{1}$ is zero because both $V_{\text {in }}$ and $V_{\text {out }}$ are equal to $+V_{p}$.

What happens after $t=t_{2}$ ? Since $V_{i n}$ begins to fall and tends to draw charge from $C_{1}$, $D_{2}$ turns off, maintaining $V_{\text {out }}$ at $+V_{p}$. The reader may wonder if something is wrong here;

[^11]our objective was to generate an output equal to $2 V_{p}$ rather than $V_{p}$. But again, patience is a virtue and we must continue the transient analysis. For $t>t_{2}$, both $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$ are off, and each capacitor holds a constant voltage. Since the voltage across $C_{1}$ is zero, $V_{X}=V_{i n}$, falling to zero at $t=t_{3}$. At this point, $D_{1}$ turns on again, allowing $C_{1}$ to charge to $-V_{p}$ at $t=t_{4}$. As $V_{i n}$ begins to rise again, $D_{1}$ turns off and $D_{2}$ remains off because $V_{X}=0$ and $V_{\text {out }}=+V_{p}$. Now, with the right plate of $C_{1}$ floating, $V_{X}$ tracks the change at the input, reaching $+V_{p}$ as $V_{i n}$ goes from $-V_{p}$ to 0 . Thus, $D_{2}$ turns on at $t=t_{5}$, forming a capacitive divider again. After this time, the output change is equal to half of the input change, i.e., $V_{\text {out }}$ increases from $+V_{p}$ to $+V_{p}+V_{p} / 2$ as $V_{\text {in }}$ goes from 0 to $+V_{p}$. The output has now reached $3 V_{p} / 2$.

As is evident from the foregoing analysis, the output continues to rise by $V_{p}, V_{p} / 2$, $V_{p} / 4$, etc., in each input cycle, approaching a final value of

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{\text {out }} & =V_{p}\left(1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\cdots\right)  \tag{3.113}\\
& =\frac{V_{p}}{1-\frac{1}{2}}  \tag{3.114}\\
& =2 V_{p} \tag{3.115}
\end{align*}
$$

The reader is encouraged to continue the analysis for a few more cycles and verify this trend.

Solution Using the diagram in Fig. 3.58(a), noting that $D_{1}$ and $C_{1}$ carry equal currents when $D_{1}$ is forward biased, and writing the current as $I_{D 1}=-C_{1} d V_{i n} / d t$, we construct the plot shown in Fig. 3.58(b). ${ }^{20}$ For $0<t<t_{1}, D_{1}$ conducts and the peak current corresponds to the maximum slope of $V_{i n}$, i.e., immediately after $t=0$. From $t=t_{1}$ to $t=t_{3}$, the diode remains off, repeating the same behavior in subsequent cycles.

### 3.5.5 Diodes as Level Shifters and Switches*

In the design of electronic circuits, we may need to shift the average level of a signal up or down because the subsequent stage (e.g., an amplifier) may not operate properly with the present dc level.

Sustaining a relatively constant voltage in forward bias, a diode can be viewed as a battery and hence a device capable of shifting the signal level. In our first attempt, we consider the circuit shown in Fig. 3.59(a) as a candidate for shifting the level down by $V_{D, o n}$. However, the diode current remains unknown and dependent on the next stage. To alleviate this issue we modify the circuit as depicted in Fig. 3.59(b), where $I_{1}$ draws a constant current, establishing $V_{D, o n}$ across $D_{1}{ }^{21}$ If the current pulled by the next stage is negligible (or at least constant), $V_{\text {out }}$ is simply lower than $V_{\text {in }}$ by a constant amount, $V_{D, \text { on }}$.

[^13]Design a circuit that shifts up the dc level of a signal by $2 V_{D, o n}$.
3.37

Solution To shift the level $u p$, we apply the input to the cathode. Also, to obtain a shift of $2 V_{D, o n}$, we place two diodes in series. Figure 3.60 shows the result.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_67d4cb928f727340196cg-33.jpg?height=777&width=1776&top_left_y=1084&top_left_x=1444)

Figure 3.60 Positive voltage shift by two diodes.

What happens if $I_{1}$ is extremely small?

The level shift circuit of Fig. 3.59(b) can be transformed to an electronic switch. For example, many applications employ the topology shown in Fig. 3.61(a) to "sample" $V_{\text {in }}$ across $C_{1}$ and "freeze" the value when $S_{1}$ turns off. Let us replace $S_{1}$ with the level shift circuit and allow $I_{1}$ to be turned on and off [Fig. 3.61(b)]. If $I_{1}$ is on, $V_{\text {out }}$ tracks $V_{\text {in }}$ except for a level shift equal to $V_{D, o n}$. When $I_{1}$ turns off, so does $D_{1}$, evidently disconnecting $C_{1}$ from the input and freezing the voltage across $C_{1}$.

Figure 3.61 (a) Switched-capacitor circuit, (b) realization of (a) using a diode as a switch, (c) problem of diode conduction, (d) more complete circuit, (e) equivalent circuit when $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ are off.

We used the term "evidently" in the last sentence because the circuit's true behavior somewhat differs from the above description. The assumption that $D_{1}$ turns off holds only if $C_{1}$ draws no current from $D_{1}$, i.e., only if $V_{\text {in }}-V_{\text {out }}$ remains less than $V_{D, \text { on }}$. Now consider the case illustrated in Fig. 3.61(c), where $I_{1}$ turns off at $t=t_{1}$, allowing $C_{1}$ to store a value equal to $V_{i n 1}-V_{D, o n}$. As the input waveform completes a negative excursion and exceeds $V_{\text {in } 1}$ at $t=t_{2}$, the diode is forward-biased again, charging $C_{1}$ with the input (in a manner similar to a peak detector). That is, even though $I_{1}$ is off, $D_{1}$ turns on for part of the cycle.

To resolve this issue, the circuit is modified as shown in Fig. 3.61(d), where $D_{2}$ is inserted between $D_{1}$ and $C_{1}$, and $I_{2}$ provides a bias current for $D_{2}$. With both $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ on, the diodes operate in forward bias, $V_{X}=V_{\text {in }}-V_{D 1}$, and $V_{\text {out }}=V_{X}+V_{D 2}=V_{\text {in }}$ if $V_{D 1}=V_{D 2}$. Thus, $V_{\text {out }}$ tracks $V_{\text {in }}$ with no level shift. When $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ turn off, the circuit reduces to that in Fig. 3.61(e), where the back-to-back diodes fail to conduct for any value of $V_{\text {in }}-V_{\text {out }}$, thereby isolating $C_{1}$ from the input. In other words, the two diodes and the two current sources form an electronic switch.

Example Recall from Chapter 2 that diodes exhibit a junction capacitance in reverse bias. Study 3.38 the effect of this capacitance on the operation of the above circuit.

Solution Figure 3.62 shows the equivalent circuit for the case where the diodes are off, suggesting that the conduction of the input through the junction capacitances disturbs the output. Specifically, invoking the capacitive divider of Fig. 3.54(b) and assuming
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_67d4cb928f727340196cg-34.jpg?height=407&width=1126&top_left_y=2639&top_left_x=1686)

To ensure this "feedthrough" is small, $C_{1}$ must be sufficiently large.

Exercise Calculate the change in the voltage at the left plate of $C_{j 1}$ (with respect to ground) in terms of $\Delta V_{i n}$.

## 3.6 CHAPTER SUMMARY

- In addition to the exponential and constant-voltage models, an "ideal" model is sometimes used to analyze diode circuits. The ideal model assumes the diode turns on with a very small forward bias voltage.
- For many electronic circuits, the "input/output characteristics" are studied to understand the response to various input levels, e.g., as the input level goes from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$.
- "Large-signal operation" occurs when a circuit or device experiences arbitrarily large voltage or current excursions. The exponential, constant-voltage, or ideal diode models are used in this case.
- If the changes in voltages and currents are sufficiently small, then nonlinear devices and circuits can be approximated by linear couterparts, greatly simplifying the analysis. This is called "small-signal operation."
- The small-signal model of a diode consists of an "incremental resistance" given by $V_{\mathrm{T}} / \mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{D}}$.
- Diodes find application in many circuits, including rectifiers, limiting circuits, voltage doublers, and level shifters.
- Half-wave rectifiers pass the positive (negative) half cycles of the input wavefrom and block the negative (positive) half cycles. If followed by a capacitor, a rectifier can produce a dc level nearly equal to the peak of the input swing.
- A half-wave rectifier with a smoothing capacitor of value $C_{1}$ and load resistor $R_{\mathrm{L}}$ exhibits an output ripple equal to $\left(V_{\mathrm{P}}-V_{\mathrm{D}, \text { on }}\right) /\left(R_{\mathrm{L}} C_{1} f_{\text {in }}\right)$.
- Full-wave rectifiers convert both positive and negative input cycles to the same polarity at the output. If followed by a smoothing capacitor and a load resistor, these rectifiers exhibit an output ripple given by $0.5\left(V_{\mathrm{P}}-2 V_{\mathrm{D}, \text { on }}\right) /$ ( $R_{\mathrm{L}} C_{1} f_{\text {in }}$ ).
- Diodes can operate as limiting devices, i.e., limit the output swing even if the input swing continues to increase.
