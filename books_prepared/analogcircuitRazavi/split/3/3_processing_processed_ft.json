This is caused by the fact that the output voltage is not constant, but rather varies with time. In a half-wave rectifier, the output voltage is only active during the positive half-cycles of the input voltage, resulting in a large amount of ripple. In a full-wave rectifier, the output voltage is active during both halves of the input voltage, resulting in less ripple. However, some ripple still remains due to the charging and discharging of the smoothing capacitor. The amount of ripple can be reduced by increasing the value of the smoothing capacitor or decreasing the load current."
