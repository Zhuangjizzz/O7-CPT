    "text": "To understand the necessity of diodes, let's briefly examine the design of a cellphone charger. The charger transforms the line AC voltage at 110 V and 60 Hz into a DC voltage of 3.5 V. As depicted in Fig. 3.1(a), this process involves initially reducing the AC voltage using a transformer to around 4 V, followed by converting the AC voltage to DC. This same principle is applied to adapters that power various electronic devices.\n\nHow does the black box in Fig. 3.1(a) achieve this conversion? As shown in Fig. 3.1(b), the transformer's output has zero DC content because the negative and positive half cycles enclose equal areas, resulting in a zero average. Now, if this waveform is applied to a device that allows only the positive half cycles to pass while blocking the negative ones, the outcome is a waveform with a positive average and some AC components, which can be eliminated using a low-pass filter (Section 3.5.1).\n\n[^12]image_name:(a) Charger circuit\ndescription:\n[\nname: Vline, type: VoltageSource, value: 110√2V, 60Hz, ports: {Np: N1, Nn: GND}\nname: Transformer, type: Transformer, ports: {In1: N1, In2: GND, Out1: N2, Out2: GND}\nname: V1, type: VoltageSource, value: 4√2V, 60Hz, ports: {Np: N2, Nn: GND}\nname: Block Box, type: Other, ports: {N1: N2, N2: Vout}\nname: Vout, type: VoltageSource, value: 3.5V, ports: {Np: Vout, Nn: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit is a charger circuit that converts AC voltage to a DC output.

The X-axis represents time (t), and the Y-axis represents voltage (V). The left-side waveform shows an AC signal with equal positive and negative areas, indicating zero DC content. This sinusoidal waveform has peaks at regular intervals, typical of a 60 Hz AC signal.\n\nThe right side of the graph shows the effect of a device that permits only the positive half cycles to pass, blocking the negative ones. Consequently, the waveform consists solely of positive half cycles, resulting in a signal with a positive average voltage. This transformation produces a waveform with only positive areas, effectively converting the AC signal into a pulsating DC signal.\n\nThe graph visually emphasizes the conversion process, highlighting the removal of negative half cycles, resulting in a waveform that can be further refined, such as by using a low-pass filter to smooth out remaining AC components and achieve a more stable DC output.\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 3.1 (a) Charger circuit, (b) elimination of negative half cycles.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe rectification effect was discovered by Carl Braun around 1875. He observed that a metal wire pressed against a sulphide carried more current in one direction than the other. Over the following decades, researchers explored other structures, leading to \"cat's whisker\" rectifiers, which were used as detectors for receiving wireless signals in early radios and radars. These were eventually replaced by pn junctions.\n\nThe waveform conversion in Fig. 3.1(b) underscores the need for a device that can distinguish between positive and negative voltages, allowing only one to pass while blocking the other. A simple resistor cannot fulfill this role because it is linear. According to Ohm's law, $V=I R$, if the voltage across a resistor shifts from positive to negative, the current through it does the same. Therefore, we need a device that acts as a short circuit for positive voltages and an open circuit for negative voltages.\n\nFigure 3.2 encapsulates our thought process so far. The mysterious device produces an output that matches the input for positive half cycles and is zero for negative half cycles. Note that this device is nonlinear because it does not adhere to $y=\\alpha x$; if $x \\rightarrow-x, y \\nrightarrow-y$.\nimage_name:Figure 3.2\ndescription:The graph in Figure 3.2 depicts the behavior of an ideal diode in response to an input signal, shown as a time-domain waveform.

The respective terminals are termed the \"anode\" and the \"cathode.\"\n\nThe diagram in Fig. 3.3(b) represents the equivalent circuit of a diode under forward and reverse bias conditions. In forward bias, the diode permits current flow, akin to a closed switch, whereas in reverse bias, it obstructs current flow, similar to an open switch.\n\nFigure 3.3(c) presents a water pipe analogy to describe a diode's function in terms of fluid flow. This analogy facilitates understanding the diode's operation under forward and reverse bias conditions.\n\nThe water pipe analogy effectively illustrates the fundamental operational principles of a diode by using the familiar concept of fluid flow to explain electrical behavior.\n\nFigure 3.3 (a) Diode symbol, (b) equivalent circuit, (c) water pipe analogy.\n\nA diode turns \"on\" when \\( V_{\\text {anode }}>V_{\\text {cathode }} \\) and \"off\" when \\( V_{\\text {anode }}<V_{\\text {cathode }} \\) [Fig. 3.3(b)].

Conversely, if pressure is applied from the right, the stopper seals the valve.\n\nDiodes can be configured in series or parallel. Determine which configuration in Fig. 3.4 allows current conduction.\n\nFigure 3.4 Series combinations of diodes.\n\n[^13]Solution In Fig. 3.4(a), the anodes of \\( D_{1} \\) and \\( D_{2} \\) face the same direction, permitting current to flow from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\) to \\( C \\) but not in the reverse direction. In Fig. 3.4(b), \\( D_{1} \\) blocks current from \\( B \\) to \\( A \\), and \\( D_{2} \\) from \\( B \\) to \\( C \\). Thus, no current flows in either direction. Similarly, the topology of Fig. 3.4(c) behaves as an open circuit for any voltage.\n\nExercise Determine all possible series combinations of three diodes and study their conduction properties.\n\nIn analyzing electronic devices, it is beneficial to complement equations with graphical representations. A common plot is the current/voltage (I/V) characteristic, depicting the current through a device as a function of the voltage across it.\n\nSince an ideal diode behaves as a short or an open circuit, we first construct the I/V characteristics for two extreme cases of Ohm's law:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}\nR=0 \\Rightarrow I=\\frac{V}{R}=\\infty \\\\\nR=\\infty \\Rightarrow I=\\frac{V}{R}=0 \\tag{3.2}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe results are shown in Fig. 3.5(a). For an ideal diode, we combine the positive-voltage region of the first with the negative-voltage region of the second, arriving at the \\( \\mathrm{I}_{D} / \\mathrm{V}_{D} \\) characteristic in Fig. 3.5(b). Here, \\( V_{D}=V_{\\text {anode }}-V_{\\text {cathode }} \\), and \\( I_{D} \\) is defined as the current flowing into the anode and out of the cathode.\n\nFigure 3.5 I/V characteristics of (a) zero and infinite resistors, (b) ideal diode.\n\nExample 3.2\n\nAn ideal diode turns on for positive anode-cathode voltages. However, the characteristic in Fig. 3.5(b) does not appear to show any \\( I_{D} \\) values for \\( V_{D}>0 \\). How do we interpret this plot?\n\nSolution This characteristic indicates that as \\( V_{D} \\) exceeds zero by a very small amount, the diode turns on and conducts infinite current if the circuit surrounding the diode can provide such a current. Thus, in circuits containing only finite currents, a forward-biased ideal diode sustains a zero voltage, similar to a short circuit.\n\nExercise\n\nHow does the characteristic change if we place a \\( 1-\\Omega \\) resistor in series with the diode?\n\nFigure 3.6 (a) Antiparallel diodes, (b) resulting I/V characteristic.\n\nSolution If \\( V_{A}>0 \\), \\( D_{1} \\) is on and \\( D_{2} \\) is off, resulting in \\( I_{A}=\\infty \\). If \\( V_{A}<0 \\), \\( D_{1} \\) is off, but \\( D_{2} \\) is on, again leading to \\( I_{A}=\\infty \\). The result is shown in Fig. 3.6(b). The antiparallel combination, therefore, acts as a short circuit for all voltages.\n\nExercise Repeat the above example if a 1-V battery is placed in series with the parallel combination of the diodes.\n\nFigure 3.7 (a) Diode-resistor series combination, (b) equivalent circuit under forward bias, (c) equivalent circuit under reverse bias, (d) I/V characteristic, (e) equivalent circuit if \\( D_{1} \\) is on.\n\nSolution If \\( V_{A}>0 \\), the diode is on [Fig. 3.7(b)] and \\( I_{A}=V_{A} / R_{1} \\) because \\( V_{D 1}=0 \\) for an ideal diode. On the other hand, if \\( V_{A}<0 \\), \\( D_{1} \\) is off [Fig. 3.7(c)] and \\( I_{D}=0 \\). Figure 3.7(d) plots the resulting I/V characteristic.\n\nThe above observations are based on guesswork. Let us study the circuit more rigorously. We begin with \\( V_{A}<0 \\), postulating that the diode is off. To confirm the validity of this guess, let us assume \\( D_{1} \\) is on and see if we reach a conflicting result. If \\( D_{1} \\) is on, the circuit is reduced to that in Fig. 3.7(e), and if \\( V_{A} \\) is negative, so is \\( I_{A} \\); i.e., the actual current flows from right to left. But this implies that \\( D_{1} \\) carries a current from its cathode to its anode, violating the definition of the diode. Thus, for \\( V_{A}<0 \\), \\( D_{1} \\) remains off and \\( I_{A}=0 \\).\n\nAs \\( V_{A} \\) rises above zero, it tends to forward bias the diode. Does \\( D_{1} \\) turn on for any \\( V_{A}>0 \\) or does \\( R_{1} \\) shift the turn-on point? We again invoke proof by contradiction. Suppose for some \\( V_{A}>0 \\), \\( D_{1} \\) is still off, behaving as an open circuit and yielding \\( I_{A}=0 \\). The voltage drop across \\( R_{1} \\) is therefore equal to zero, suggesting that \\( V_{D 1}=V_{A} \\) and hence \\( I_{D 1}=\\infty \\) and contradicting the original assumption. In other words, \\( D_{1} \\) turns on for any \\( V_{A}>0 \\).\n\nExercise Repeat the above analysis if the terminals of the diode are swapped.\n\nThe above example leads to two important points. First, the series combination of \\( D_{1} \\) and \\( R_{1} \\) acts as an open circuit for negative voltages and as a resistor of value \\( R_{1} \\) for positive voltages. Second, in the analysis of circuits, we can assume an arbitrary state (on or off) for each diode and proceed with the computation of voltages and currents; if the assumptions are incorrect, the final result contradicts the original assumptions. Of course, it is helpful to first examine the circuit carefully and make an intuitive guess.\n\nExample Why are we interested in I/V characteristics rather than V/I characteristics?\n\nSolution In the analysis of circuits, we often prefer to consider the voltage to be the \"cause\" and the current, the \"effect.\" This is because in typical circuits, voltage polarities can be predicted more readily and intuitively than current polarities. Also, devices such as transistors fundamentally produce current in response to voltage.\n\nExercise Plot the V/I characteristic of an ideal diode.\n\nFigure 3.8 OR gate realized by diodes.\n\nThe symmetry of the circuit with respect to \\( V_{A} \\) and \\( V_{B} \\) suggests that \\( V_{\\text {out }}=V_{B}=+3 \\mathrm{~V} \\) if \\( V_{A}=0 \\) and \\( V_{B}=+3 \\mathrm{~V} \\). The circuit operates as a logical OR gate and was in fact used in early digital computers.\n\nExercise Construct a three-input OR gate.\n\nIs an ideal diode on or off if \\( V_{D}=0 \\)?\n\nSolution An ideal diode experiencing a zero voltage must carry a zero current. However, this does not mean it acts as an open circuit. After all, a piece of wire experiencing a zero voltage behaves similarly. Thus, the state of an ideal diode with \\( V_{D}=0 \\) is somewhat arbitrary and ambiguous. In practice, we consider slightly positive or negative voltages to determine the response of a diode circuit.\n\nExercise Repeat the above example if a \\( 1-\\Omega \\) resistor is placed in series with the diode.\n\nInput/Output Characteristics Electronic circuits process an input and generate a corresponding output. It is, therefore, instructive to construct the input/output characteristics of a circuit by varying the input across an allowable range and plotting the resulting output.\n\nAs an example, consider the circuit depicted in Fig. 3.9(a), where the output is defined as the voltage across \\( D_{1} \\). If \\( V_{i n}<0 \\), \\( D_{1} \\) is reverse biased, reducing the circuit to that in Fig. 3.9(b). Since no current flows through \\( R_{1} \\), we have \\( V_{\\text {out }}=V_{\\text {in }} \\). If \\( V_{\\text {in }}>0 \\), then \\( D_{1} \\) is forward biased, shorting the output and forcing \\( V_{\\text {out }}=0 \\) [Fig. 3.9(c)]. Figure 3.9(d) illustrates the overall input/output characteristic."

Here, \\( V_{D}=V_{\\text {anode }}-V_{\\text {cathode }} \\), and \\( I_{D} \\) is defined as the current flowing into the anode and out of the cathode.\n\nFigure 3.5 I/V characteristics of (a) zero and infinite resistors, (b) ideal diode.\n\nExample 3.2\n\nAn ideal diode is said to turn on for positive anode-cathode voltages. However, the characteristic in Fig. 3.5(b) does not appear to show any \\( I_{D} \\) values for \\( V_{D}>0 \\). How do we interpret this plot?\n\nSolution This characteristic indicates that as \\( V_{D} \\) exceeds zero by a small margin, the diode turns on and conducts infinite current if the surrounding circuit can provide such a current. Thus, in circuits containing only finite currents, a forward-biased ideal diode maintains a zero voltage, resembling a short circuit.\n\nExercise\n\nHow does the characteristic change if we place a \\( 1-\\Omega \\) resistor in series with the diode?\n\nFigure 3.6 (a) Antiparallel diodes, (b) resulting I/V characteristic.\n\nSolution If \\( V_{A}>0 \\), \\( D_{1} \\) is on, and \\( D_{2} \\) is off, resulting in \\( I_{A}=\\infty \\). If \\( V_{A}<0 \\), \\( D_{1} \\) is off, but \\( D_{2} \\) is on, again leading to \\( I_{A}=\\infty \\). The outcome is illustrated in Fig. 3.6(b). The antiparallel combination, therefore, acts as a short circuit for all voltages. Although seemingly a useless circuit in its ideal form, it becomes more intriguing with real diodes.\n\nExercise Repeat the above example if a 1-V battery is placed in series with the parallel combination of the diodes.\n\nFigure 3.7 (a) Diode-resistor series combination, (b) equivalent circuit under forward bias, (c) equivalent circuit under reverse bias, (d) I/V characteristic, (e) equivalent circuit if \\( D_{1} \\) is on.\n\nSolution We deduce that if \\( V_{A}>0 \\), the diode is on [Fig. 3.7(b)] and \\( I_{A}=V_{A} / R_{1} \\) because \\( V_{D 1}=0 \\) for an ideal diode. Conversely, if \\( V_{A}<0 \\), \\( D_{1} \\) is likely off [Fig. 3.7(c)] and \\( I_{D}=0 \\). Figure 3.7(d) plots the resulting I/V characteristic.\n\nThe above observations are based on conjecture. Let us examine the circuit more rigorously. We start with \\( V_{A}<0 \\), postulating that the diode is off. To confirm the validity of this assumption, let us assume \\( D_{1} \\) is on and observe if we encounter a contradiction. If \\( D_{1} \\) is on, the circuit simplifies to that in Fig. 3.7(e), and if \\( V_{A} \\) is negative, so is \\( I_{A} \\); i.e., the actual current flows from right to left. But this implies that \\( D_{1} \\) carries current from its cathode to its anode, contradicting the diode's definition. Thus, for \\( V_{A}<0 \\), \\( D_{1} \\) remains off, and \\( I_{A}=0 \\).\n\nAs \\( V_{A} \\) increases above zero, it tends to forward bias the diode. Does \\( D_{1} \\) turn on for any \\( V_{A}>0 \\) or does \\( R_{1} \\) shift the turn-on point? We again use proof by contradiction. Suppose for some \\( V_{A}>0 \\), \\( D_{1} \\) is still off, acting as an open circuit and yielding \\( I_{A}=0 \\). The voltage drop across \\( R_{1} \\) would then be zero, suggesting that \\( V_{D 1}=V_{A} \\) and hence \\( I_{D 1}=\\infty \\), contradicting the initial assumption. In other words, \\( D_{1} \\) turns on for any \\( V_{A}>0 \\).\n\nExercise Repeat the above analysis if the terminals of the diode are swapped.\n\nThe above example leads to two crucial points. First, the series combination of \\( D_{1} \\) and \\( R_{1} \\) behaves as an open circuit for negative voltages and as a resistor of value \\( R_{1} \\) for positive voltages. Second, in circuit analysis, we can assume an arbitrary state (on or off) for each diode and proceed with calculating voltages and currents; if the assumptions are incorrect, the final result contradicts the initial assumptions. It is, of course, beneficial to first scrutinize the circuit carefully and make an intuitive guess.\n\nExample Why do we focus on I/V characteristics rather than V/I characteristics?\n\nSolution In circuit analysis, we often consider voltage to be the \"cause\" and current, the \"effect.\" This is because in typical circuits, voltage polarities can be predicted more readily and intuitively than current polarities. Additionally, devices such as transistors fundamentally produce current in response to voltage.\n\nExercise Plot the V/I characteristic of an ideal diode.\n\nFigure 3.8 OR gate realized by diodes.\n\nIf \\( V_{A}=+3 \\mathrm{~V} \\) and \\( V_{B}=0 \\), then we infer that \\( D_{1} \\) is forward-biased and \\( D_{2} \\), reverse-biased. Thus, \\( V_{\\text {out }}=V_{A}=+3 \\mathrm{~V} \\). If uncertain, we can assume both \\( D_{1} \\) and \\( D_{2} \\) are forward-biased, immediately encountering a conflict: \\( D_{1} \\) enforces a voltage of +3 V at the output, whereas \\( D_{2} \\) shorts \\( V_{\\text {out }} \\) to \\( V_{B}=0 \\). This assumption is, therefore, incorrect.\n\nThe symmetry of the circuit with respect to \\( V_{A} \\) and \\( V_{B} \\) suggests that \\( V_{\\text {out }}=V_{B}=+3 \\mathrm{~V} \\) if \\( V_{A}=0 \\) and \\( V_{B}=+3 \\mathrm{~V} \\). The circuit functions as a logical OR gate and was indeed used in early digital computers.\n\nExercise Construct a three-input OR gate.\n\nIs an ideal diode on or off if \\( V_{D}=0 \\)?\n\nSolution An ideal diode subjected to zero voltage must carry zero current (why?). However, this does not mean it acts as an open circuit. After all, a piece of wire experiencing zero voltage behaves similarly. Thus, the state of an ideal diode with \\( V_{D}=0 \\) is somewhat arbitrary and ambiguous. In practice, we consider slightly positive or negative voltages to determine the response of a diode circuit.\n\nExercise Repeat the above example if a \\( 1-\\Omega \\) resistor is placed in series with the diode.\n\nInput/Output Characteristics Electronic circuits process an input and generate a corresponding output. It is, therefore, instructive to construct the input/output characteristics of a circuit by varying the input across an allowable range and plotting the resulting output.\n\nAs an example, consider the circuit depicted in Fig. 3.9(a), where the output is defined as the voltage across \\( D_{1} \\). If \\( V_{i n}<0 \\), \\( D_{1} \\) is reverse biased, simplifying the circuit to that in Fig. 3.9(b). Since no current flows through \\( R_{1} \\), we have \\( V_{\\text {out }}=V_{\\text {in }} \\). If \\( V_{\\text {in }}>0 \\), then \\( D_{1} \\) is forward biased, shorting the output and forcing \\( V_{\\text {out }}=0 \\) [Fig. 3.9(c)]. Figure 3.9(d) illustrates the overall input/output characteristic."

Consider the pipe shown in Fig. 3.3(c), where a valve (a plate) is hinged on the top and faces a stopper on the bottom.

Under forward bias, the diode permits current flow, whereas in reverse bias, it impedes current flow. The water pipe metaphor is employed to elucidate the diode's operation, with the diode likened to a valve that facilitates flow in one direction and obstructs it in the opposite direction.\n\nFig. 3.3(b) presents the equivalent circuit of a diode under forward and reverse bias conditions.

Consider the conduit depicted in Fig. 3.3(c), where a valve (a plate) is hinged at the top and confronts a stopper at the bottom.

In Fig. 3.4(b), $D_{1}$ impedes current flow from $B$ to $A$, and $D_{2}$, from $B$ to $C$. Hence, no current can flow in either direction. Similarly, the topology of Fig. 3.4(c) behaves as an open circuit for any voltage. Although these circuits may not appear particularly useful at this juncture, they facilitate our understanding of diodes.\n\nExercise Identify all potential series combinations of three diodes and analyze their conduction characteristics.\n\nI/V Characteristics In examining electronic devices, it is beneficial to complement equations with graphical representations. A common graphical representation is the current/voltage (I/V) characteristic, which illustrates the current flowing through the device as a function of the voltage across it.\n\nSince an ideal diode behaves as a short circuit or an open circuit, we initially construct the I/V characteristics for two extreme cases of Ohm's law:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}\nR=0 \\Rightarrow I=\\frac{V}{R}=\\infty \\\\\nR=\\infty \\Rightarrow I=\\frac{V}{R}=0 \\tag{3.2}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThese results are depicted in Fig. 3.5(a). For an ideal diode, we amalgamate the positive-voltage region of the first case with the negative-voltage region of the second case, yielding the $\\mathrm{I}_{D} / \\mathrm{V}_{D}$ characteristic in Fig. 3.5(b). Here, $V_{D}=V_{\\text {anode }}-V_{\\text {cathode }}$, and $I_{D}$ represents the current flowing into the anode and exiting the cathode.\n\nFigure 3.5 I/V characteristics of (a) zero and infinite resistors, (b) ideal diode.\n\nExample 3.2\n\nWe have established that an ideal diode activates for positive anode-cathode voltages. However, the characteristic in Fig. 3.5(b) does not seemingly depict any $I_{D}$ values for $V_{D}>0$. How do we interpret this plot?\n\nSolution This characteristic indicates that as $V_{D}$ surpasses zero by a negligible amount, the diode activates and conducts infinite current if the circuit surrounding the diode can supply such a current. Consequently, in circuits containing only finite currents, a forward-biased ideal diode sustains a zero voltage, akin to a short circuit.\n\nExercise\n\nHow does the characteristic change if we introduce a $1-\\Omega$ resistor in series with the diode?\n\nFigure 3.6 (a) Antiparallel diodes, (b) resulting I/V characteristic.\n\nSolution If $V_{A}>0$, diode $D_{1}$ is activated, and $D_{2}$ is deactivated, resulting in $I_{A}=\\infty$. Conversely, if $V_{A}<0$, $D_{1}$ is deactivated, but $D_{2}$ is activated, again leading to $I_{A}=\\infty$. This outcome is depicted in Fig. 3.6(b). Thus, the antiparallel combination acts as a short circuit for all voltages. Although seemingly an insignificant circuit, this topology becomes more intriguing with real diodes (Section 3.5.3).\n\nExercise Repeat the above example if a 1-V battery is introduced in series with the parallel combination of the diodes.\n\nFigure 3.7 (a) Diode-resistor series combination, (b) equivalent circuit under forward bias, (c) equivalent circuit under reverse bias, (d) I/V characteristic, (e) equivalent circuit if $D_{1}$ is on.\n\nSolution We conjecture that if $V_{A}>0$, the diode is activated [Fig. 3.7(b)] and $I_{A}=V_{A} / R_{1}$ because $V_{D 1}=0$ for an ideal diode. Conversely, if $V_{A}<0$, $D_{1}$ is presumably deactivated [Fig. 3.7(c)] and $I_{D}=0$. Figure 3.7(d) illustrates the resulting I/V characteristic.\n\nThe aforementioned observations are based on conjecture. Let us examine the circuit more rigorously. We commence with $V_{A}<0$, postulating that the diode is deactivated. To substantiate the validity of this assumption, let us presume $D_{1}$ is activated and discern if we encounter a conflicting outcome. If $D_{1}$ is activated, the circuit is simplified to that in Fig. 3.7(e), and if $V_{A}$ is negative, so is $I_{A}$; i.e., the actual current flows from right to left. However, this implies that $D_{1}$ conducts current from its cathode to its anode, violating the definition of the diode. Thus, for $V_{A}<0$, $D_{1}$ remains deactivated, and $I_{A}=0$.\n\nAs $V_{A}$ increases beyond zero, it tends to forward bias the diode. Does $D_{1}$ activate for any $V_{A}>0$ or does $R_{1}$ shift the activation point? We again resort to proof by contradiction. Suppose for some $V_{A}>0$, $D_{1}$ remains deactivated, behaving as an open circuit and yielding $I_{A}=0$. The voltage drop across $R_{1}$ would then be zero, suggesting that $V_{D 1}=V_{A}$ and hence $I_{D 1}=\\infty$, contradicting the initial assumption. Therefore, $D_{1}$ activates for any $V_{A}>0$.\n\nExercise Repeat the above analysis if the terminals of the diode are interchanged.\n\nThe aforementioned example yields two crucial insights. First, the series combination of $D_{1}$ and $R_{1}$ behaves as an open circuit for negative voltages and as a resistor with a value of $R_{1}$ for positive voltages. Second, in circuit analysis, we can assume an arbitrary state (activated or deactivated) for each diode and proceed with the computation of voltages and currents; if the assumptions are erroneous, the final result contradicts the initial assumptions. Naturally, it is advantageous to initially scrutinize the circuit carefully and formulate an intuitive conjecture.\n\nExample Why do we focus on I/V characteristics rather than V/I characteristics?\n\nSolution In circuit analysis, we often consider voltage to be the \"cause\" and current, the \"effect.\" This is because in typical circuits, voltage polarities can be predicted more readily and intuitively than current polarities. Additionally, devices like transistors fundamentally generate current in response to voltage.\n\nExercise Plot the V/I characteristic of an ideal diode.\n\nSolution If $V_{A}=+3 \\mathrm{~V}$ and $V_{B}=0$, we infer that $D_{1}$ is forward-biased and $D_{2}$, reverse-biased. Thus, $V_{\\text {out }}=V_{A}=+3 \\mathrm{~V}$. If uncertain, we can assume both $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$ are forward-biased, immediately encountering a conflict: $D_{1}$ imposes a voltage of +3 V at the output, whereas $D_{2}$ shorts $V_{\\text {out }}$ to $V_{B}=0$. This assumption is consequently incorrect.\n\nFigure 3.8 OR gate realized by diodes.\n\nThe symmetry of the circuit with respect to $V_{A}$ and $V_{B}$ suggests that $V_{\\text {out }}=V_{B}=+3 \\mathrm{~V}$ if $V_{A}=0$ and $V_{B}=+3 \\mathrm{~V}$. The circuit operates as a logical OR gate and was indeed utilized in early digital computers.\n\nExercise Construct a three-input OR gate.\n\nIs an ideal diode activated or deactivated if $V_{D}=0$ ?\n\nSolution An ideal diode subjected to zero voltage must carry zero current (why?). However, this does not imply it behaves as an open circuit. After all, a piece of wire subjected to zero voltage exhibits similar behavior. Thus, the state of an ideal diode with $V_{D}=0$ is somewhat arbitrary and ambiguous. In practice, we consider slightly positive or negative voltages to determine the response of a diode circuit.\n\nExercise Repeat the above example if a $1-\\Omega$ resistor is introduced in series with the diode.\n\nInput/Output Characteristics Electronic circuits process an input and generate a corresponding output. It is therefore instructive to construct the input/output characteristics of a circuit by varying the input across an allowable range and plotting the resulting output.\n\nConsider the circuit depicted in Fig. 3.9(a) as an example, where the output is defined as the voltage across $D_{1}$. If $V_{i n}<0$, $D_{1}$ is reverse biased, simplifying the circuit to that in Fig. 3.9(b). Since no current flows through $R_{1}$, we have $V_{\\text {out }}=V_{\\text {in }}$. If $V_{\\text {in }}>0$, then $D_{1}$ is forward biased, shorting the output and forcing $V_{\\text {out }}=0$ [Fig. 3.9(c)]. Figure 3.9(d) illustrates the overall input/output characteristic."

    "text": "To design a circuit that converts an input signal \\( x(t) \\) to an output signal \\( y(t) \\), we previously considered the ideal diode model. Now, let's design a practical circuit for this purpose. A natural approach is to use the circuit shown in Fig. 3.10(a), which includes a voltage source \\( V_{in} \\), a resistor \\( R_1 \\), and a diode \\( D_1 \\). However, in this configuration, the diode's cathode is \"floating,\" resulting in zero output current and an ambiguous diode state. To address this, we modify the circuit as shown in Fig. 3.10(b), where a switch \\( SW \\) replaces the diode.\n\nThe circuit in Fig. 3.10(a) is a basic diode rectifier circuit. It allows current to flow in one direction, rectifying the input signal, and the output is taken across the diode. In contrast, the circuit in Fig. 3.10(b) uses a switch to handle both positive and negative input voltages, controlling the output based on the input polarity. The output is taken across the switch and ground, with resistor \\( R_1 \\) connected in series with the voltage source \\( V_{in} \\).\n\nThe circuit in Fig. 3.10(c) is another rectifier circuit, this time using a switch for positive input voltages. The switch closes when \\( V_{in} > 0 \\), allowing current to flow through \\( R_1 \\) to \\( V_{out} \\). The graph labeled (d) in Fig. 3.10(d) shows the input/output characteristic of a diode rectifier circuit. It is a characteristic curve graph that illustrates the relationship between the input voltage \\( V_{in} \\) and the output voltage \\( V_{out} \\). The horizontal axis represents \\( V_{in} \\), while the vertical axis represents \\( V_{out} \\). The graph shows a piecewise linear relationship, with \\( V_{out} \\) equal to zero for negative \\( V_{in} \\) values and increasing linearly with \\( V_{in} \\) for positive values.\n\nThe graph also includes a dashed line at the origin, marking the transition from non-conducting to conducting states. The slope of the line for positive \\( V_{in} \\) is 1, indicating a 1:1 ratio of \\( V_{in} \\) to \\( V_{out} \\) in the conducting region. There are no specific numerical values or additional annotations provided on the graph.\n\nThe circuit in Fig. 3.9(a) is another simple diode rectifier circuit, consisting of a voltage source \\( V_{in} \\), a diode \\( D_1 \\), and an output taken across the diode. The diode allows current to flow only when the input voltage is positive, effectively rectifying the input signal. In Fig. 3.9(b), resistor \\( R_1 \\) is connected to ground, providing a path for the current when the diode is forward-biased.\n\nThe graph labeled as Figure 3.10(c) represents the input and output waveforms of a diode operating as a rectifier. It is a time-domain waveform graph that shows the input \\( V_{in} \\) and output \\( V_{out} \\) voltages over time. The input waveform is a sinusoidal wave, while the output waveform displays rectified half cycles, indicating that the diode conducts only during the positive half cycles of the input waveform.\n\nThe graph labeled (d) in Figure 3.10(d) is an input/output characteristic curve for a diode operating as a rectifier. It is a plot of the output voltage \\( V_{out} \\) against the input voltage \\( V_{in} \\). The graph shows a linear relationship in the conducting region, where \\( V_{out} \\) increases proportionally with \\( V_{in} \\). For negative input voltages, \\( V_{out} \\) remains at zero, indicating the diode is not conducting and effectively blocking the negative half of the cycle.\n\nThe graph has a distinct transition point at the origin, marked by a dashed line, which indicates the change from non-conducting to conducting states. There are no specific numerical values or additional annotations provided on the graph. The dashed line at the origin highlights the threshold where the diode begins to conduct, transitioning from zero output to a linear increase in \\( V_{out} \\) with increasing \\( V_{in} \\).\n\nThe circuit in Figure 3.11(a) is a simple diode-resistor network with an input voltage source. The diode conducts when \\( V_{in} \\) exceeds 1 V, clamping the output voltage.

The graph has two main components: a time-domain waveform and a \\( V_{out} \\) versus \\( V_{in} \\) plot. The time-domain waveform shows the input voltage \\( V_{in} \\) as a sinusoidal waveform over time \\( t \\), and the output voltage \\( V_{out} \\) waveform, which is similar in shape and phase to the input waveform but with the negative half-cycles clipped, indicating that the diode is conducting only during the positive half-cycles, acting as a half-wave rectifier.\n\nThe \\( V_{out} \\) versus \\( V_{in} \\) plot shows the relationship between the output voltage \\( V_{out} \\) and the input voltage \\( V_{in} \\). The x-axis represents \\( V_{in} \\), and the y-axis represents \\( V_{out} \\).

The dashed line at 1 V on the \\( V_{out} \\) versus \\( V_{in} \\) plot highlights the threshold voltage, a significant point for the diode's operation.\n\nThe diagram consists of three main components: a circuit schematic, time-domain waveforms, and an I-V characteristic plot. The circuit includes a diode \\( D_1 \\) in series with a resistor \\( R_1 \\), connected to an input voltage source \\( V_{in} \\). The output voltage \\( V_{out} \\) is measured across the diode.

The plot is a piecewise linear graph with a sharp transition at \\( V_{in} = 1 \\) V, indicating the diode's threshold voltage. For \\( V_{in} < 1 \\) V, \\( V_{out} \\) remains at zero, showing the diode is off.

This is an I-V characteristic graph, which shows the relationship between the voltage across the diode-battery combination and the current flowing through it. The horizontal axis represents the input voltage \\( V_1 \\) in volts (V), and the vertical axis represents the current \\( I_1 \\) in amperes (A).\n\nThe graph shows no current flow (\\( I_1 = 0 \\)) for \\( V_1 < 1 \\) V, indicating that the diode is reverse-biased or not sufficiently forward-biased. At \\( V_1 = 1 \\) V, the current \\( I_1 \\) sharply increases, indicating that the diode becomes forward-biased and allows current to flow. The diode remains off (no current) until the input voltage \\( V_1 \\) reaches +1 V. This is the threshold voltage where the diode starts conducting.

    "text": "Referring back to Figure 3.2, we recall the concept of the ideal diode as a method for transforming \\( x(t) \\) into \\( y(t) \\). We are now tasked with designing a circuit that performs this conversion. Initially, we might construct the circuit as shown in Figure 3.10(a). However, we encounter an issue: the cathode of the diode is \"floating,\" resulting in an output current of zero and an ambiguous diode state. To address this, we modify the circuit as illustrated in Figure 3.10(b) and proceed with the analysis.\n\nIn Figure 3.10(a), we have a simple diode rectifier circuit. It comprises a voltage source \\( V_{in} \\), a resistor \\( R_1 \\), and a diode \\( D_1 \\). The diode is employed to enable unidirectional current flow, rectifying the input signal. The output is measured across the diode.\n\nThe circuit in Figure 3.10(b) is a rectifier circuit that replaces the diode from Figure 3.10(a) with a switch \\( SW \\). It is designed to handle both positive and negative input voltages, with the switch controlling the output based on the input polarity. The output is taken across the switch and ground, with resistor \\( R_1 \\) connected in series with the voltage source \\( V_{in} \\).\n\nFigure 3.10(c) represents a rectifier circuit that uses a switch for positive input voltages. The switch closes when \\( V_{in} > 0 \\), allowing current to flow through \\( R_1 \\) to \\( V_{out} \\).\n\nThe graph labeled as Figure 3.10(d) is an input/output characteristic graph for a diode rectifier circuit. This graph shows the relationship between the input voltage \\( V_{in} \\) and the output voltage \\( V_{out} \\). For negative \\( V_{in} \\), \\( V_{out} \\) is zero, indicating that the diode blocks negative input voltages. For positive \\( V_{in} \\), \\( V_{out} \\) increases linearly with \\( V_{in} \\), indicating that the diode conducts and allows the input voltage to pass through.\n\nThe circuit in Figure 3.9(a) is a simple diode rectifier circuit. It consists of a voltage source \\( V_{in} \\), a diode \\( D_1 \\), and the output is taken across the diode. The diode allows current to flow only when the input voltage is positive, effectively rectifying the input signal.\n\nThe circuit in Figure 3.9(b) is a simple rectifier circuit. The diode \\( D_1 \\) allows current to pass only when \\( V_{in} \\) is positive, rectifying the input signal. Resistor \\( R_1 \\) is connected to the ground, providing a path for the current when the diode is forward-biased.\n\nThe graph labeled as Figure 3.10(c) represents the input and output waveforms of a diode operating as a rectifier. This is a time-domain waveform graph. The input waveform \\( V_{in} \\) is a sinusoidal wave, while the output waveform \\( V_{out} \\) displays rectified half cycles, where only the positive half cycles of the input waveform are present, indicating that the diode conducts only during these periods.\n\nThe graph labeled (d) is an input/output characteristic curve for a diode operating as a rectifier. This graph is a plot of the output voltage \\( V_{out} \\) against the input voltage \\( V_{in} \\). For \\( V_{in} < 0 \\), \\( V_{out} \\) remains at zero, indicating the diode is not conducting and effectively blocking the negative half of the cycle.

We analyze its response to a sinusoidal input [Figure 3.10(c)]. Since \\( R_1 \\) tends to keep the cathode of \\( D_1 \\) near zero, as \\( V_{in} \\) rises, \\( D_1 \\) is forward-biased, shorting the output to the input. This state persists for the positive half cycle. When \\( V_{in} \\) falls below zero, \\( D_1 \\) turns off, and \\( R_1 \\) ensures that \\( V_{out} = 0 \\) because \\( I_D R_1 = 0 \\). The circuit in Figure 3.10(b) is known as a \"rectifier.\"\n\nIt is instructive to plot the input/output characteristic of the circuit as well. Noting that if \\( V_{in} < 0 \\), \\( D_1 \\) is off and \\( V_{out} = 0 \\), and if \\( V_{in} > 0 \\), \\( D_1 \\) is on and \\( V_{out} = V_{in} \\), we obtain the behavior shown in Figure 3.10(d). The rectifier is a nonlinear circuit because if \\( V_{in} \\rightarrow -V_{in} \\), then \\( V_{out} \\nrightarrow -V_{out} \\).\n\nIs it a coincidence that the characteristics in Figures 3.7(d) and 3.10(d) look similar?\n\nNo, we recognize that the output voltage in Figure 3.10(b) is simply equal to \\( I_A R_1 \\) in Figure 3.7(a). Thus, the two plots differ by only a scaling factor equal to \\( R_1 \\).\n\nExercise: Construct the characteristic if the terminals of \\( D_1 \\) are swapped.\n\nWe now determine the time average (dc value) of the output waveform in Figure 3.10(c) to arrive at another interesting application. Suppose \\( V_{in} = V_p \\sin \\omega t \\), where \\( \\omega = 2 \\pi / T \\) denotes the frequency in radians per second and \\( T \\) the period. Then, in the first cycle after \\( t = 0 \\), we have\n\n$$\nV_{out} = V_p \\sin \\omega t \\text { for } 0 \\leq t \\leq \\frac{T}{2} \\tag{3.3}\n$$\n\n$$\nV_{out} = 0 \\quad \\text { for } \\frac{T}{2} \\leq t \\leq T \\tag{3.4}\n$$\n\nTo compute the average, we obtain the area under \\( V_{out} \\) and normalize the result to the period:\n\n$$\nV_{out, avg} = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} V_{out}(t) dt \\tag{3.5}\n$$\n\n$$\nV_{out, avg} = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T / 2} V_p \\sin \\omega t dt \\tag{3.6}\n$$\n\n$$\nV_{out, avg} = \\frac{1}{T} \\cdot \\frac{V_p}{\\omega}[-\\cos \\omega t]_{0}^{T / 2} \\tag{3.7}\n$$\n\n$$\nV_{out, avg} = \\frac{V_p}{\\pi} \\tag{3.8}\n$$\n\nThus, the average is proportional to \\( V_p \\), an expected result because a larger input amplitude yields a greater area under the rectified half cycles.\n\nThis observation reveals that the average value of a rectified output can serve as a measure of the \"strength\" (amplitude) of the input. That is, a rectifier can operate as a \"signal strength indicator.\" For example, since cellphones receive varying levels of signal depending on the user's location and environment, they require an indicator to determine how much the signal must be amplified.\n\nExample: A cellphone receives a 1.8-GHz signal with a peak amplitude ranging from 2 μV to 3.9 mV. If the signal is applied to a rectifier, what is the corresponding range of the output average?\n\nThe rectified output exhibits an average value ranging from \\( 2 \\mu V /(\\pi) = 0.637 \\mu V \\) to \\( 10 mV /(\\pi) = 3.18 mV \\).\n\nDo the above results change if a 1-Ω resistor is placed in series with the diode?\n\nIn our effort toward understanding the role of diodes, we examine another circuit that will eventually lead to some important applications. First, consider the topology in Figure 3.11(a), where a 1-V battery is placed in series with an ideal diode. How does this circuit behave? If \\( V_1 < 0 \\), the cathode voltage is higher than the anode voltage, placing \\( D_1 \\) in reverse bias. Even if \\( V_1 \\) is slightly greater than zero, e.g., equal to 0.9 V, the anode is not positive enough to forward bias \\( D_1 \\). Thus, \\( V_1 \\) must approach +1 V for \\( D_1 \\) to turn on. Shown in Figure 3.11(a), the I/V characteristic of the diode-battery combination resembles that of a diode, but shifted to the right by 1 V.\n\nNow, let us examine the circuit in Figure 3.11(b). Here, for \\( V_{in} < 0 \\), \\( D_1 \\) remains off, yielding \\( V_{out} = V_{in} \\). For \\( V_{in} > 0 \\), \\( D_1 \\) acts as a short, and \\( V_{out} = 0 \\). The circuit therefore does not allow the output to exceed zero, as illustrated in the output waveform and the input/output characteristic. But suppose we seek a circuit that must not allow the output to exceed +1 V (rather than zero). How should the circuit of Figure 3.11(b) be modified?

    "text": "The initial circuit design aimed to convert \\( x(t) \\) to \\( y(t) \\) by using an ideal diode, as illustrated in Fig. 3.2. Moving forward, we are tasked with creating a circuit that performs this conversion. A straightforward approach would be to construct the circuit as depicted in Fig. 3.10(a). However, this design has a flaw: the diode's cathode is unconnected, leading to zero output current and an ambiguous diode state. To rectify this issue, we alter the circuit as shown in Fig. 3.10(b) and proceed to analyze it.\n\nThe circuit in Fig. 3.10(a) is a basic diode rectifier circuit. It comprises a voltage source \\( V_{in} \\), a resistor \\( R_1 \\), and a diode \\( D_1 \\). The diode is employed to permit current flow in one direction, thus rectifying the input signal. The output is measured across the diode.\n\nThe circuit shown in Fig. 3.10(b) replaces the diode in diagram (a) with a switch \\( SW \\). This circuit is designed to handle both positive and negative input voltages, with the switch controlling the output based on the input polarity. The output is measured across the switch and ground, with resistor \\( R_1 \\) connected in series with the voltage source \\( V_{in} \\).\n\nIn Fig. 3.10(c), the circuit represents a rectifier that uses a switch for positive input voltages. The switch closes when \\( V_{in} > 0 \\), allowing current to flow through \\( R_1 \\) to \\( V_{out} \\).\n\nThe graph labeled (d) is an input/output characteristic graph for a diode rectifier circuit.\n\n1. **Type of Graph and Function:**\n   This is a characteristic curve graph, showing the relationship between the input voltage \\( V_{in} \\) and the output voltage \\( V_{out} \\).\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n   The horizontal axis represents the input voltage \\( V_{in} \\), while the vertical axis represents the output voltage \\( V_{out} \\). Units are typically in volts, though specific units are not marked.\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n   The graph shows a piecewise linear relationship. For negative values of \\( V_{in} \\), \\( V_{out} \\) is zero, indicating that the diode blocks negative input voltages. For positive values of \\( V_{in} \\), \\( V_{out} \\) increases linearly with \\( V_{in} \\), indicating that the diode conducts and allows the input voltage to pass through.\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n   The graph has a distinct \"knee\" at the origin (0,0), where the behavior changes from blocking to conducting.\n   The slope of the line for positive \\( V_{in} \\) is 1, indicating a 1:1 ratio of \\( V_{in} \\) to \\( V_{out} \\) in the conducting region.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n   The graph includes a dashed line at the origin marking the transition from non-conducting to conducting states.\n   There are no specific numerical values or additional annotations provided on the graph.\n\nFigure 3.9 (a) Resistor-diode circuit, (b) equivalent circuit for negative input, (c) equivalent circuit for positive input, (d) input/output characteristic.\n\nThe circuit in Figure 3.9 (a) is a simple diode rectifier circuit. It consists of a voltage source \\( V_{in} \\), a diode \\( D_1 \\), and the output is taken across the diode. The diode allows current to flow only when the input voltage is positive, effectively rectifying the input signal.\n\nThe circuit in Figure 3.9 (b) is a simple rectifier circuit. The diode \\( D_1 \\) allows current to pass only when \\( V_{in} \\) is positive, rectifying the input signal. Resistor \\( R_1 \\) is connected to the ground, providing a path for the current when the diode is forward-biased.\n\nThe graph labeled as Figure 3.10(c) represents the input and output waveforms of a diode operating as a rectifier. This is a time-domain waveform graph.\n\n1. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n   The horizontal axis is labeled as time, denoted as \\( t \\), with specific points marked as \\( 0 \\), \\( \\frac{T}{2} \\), \\( T \\), \\( \\frac{3T}{2} \\), and \\( 2T \\), indicating periodic intervals of the waveform.\n   The vertical axis represents voltage, showing the input \\( V_{in} \\) and output \\( V_{out} \\) voltages.\n\n2. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n   The input waveform \\( V_{in} \\) is a sinusoidal wave, which oscillates above and below the time axis, representing alternating positive and negative half cycles.\n   The output waveform \\( V_{out} \\) displays rectified half cycles, where only the positive half cycles of the input waveform are present, indicating that the diode conducts only during these periods.\n   The negative half cycles of the input are clipped, resulting in zero output during these intervals.\n\n3. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n   The rectification process results in the output waveform having a series of positive half cycles, each corresponding to the positive half of the input sinusoidal wave.\n   The waveform is periodic with a period \\( T \\), matching the input waveform's frequency.\n\n4. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n   The graph does not provide specific numerical values but shows the transition from input to output, highlighting the rectification process by the diode.\n   The term 'Rectified Half Cycles' is annotated on the graph to indicate the nature of the output waveform.\n\nThis graph effectively illustrates the basic operation of a diode rectifier, demonstrating how it converts an AC input signal into a unidirectional output signal by allowing current to pass only during the positive half cycles.\n\nThe graph labeled (d) is an input/output characteristic curve for a diode operating as a rectifier. This graph is a plot of the output voltage \\( V_{out} \\) against the input voltage \\( V_{in} \\).\n\n1. **Type of Graph and Function:**\n   This is a linear graph representing the relationship between input and output voltages in a rectifying diode circuit.\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n   The horizontal axis represents the input voltage \\( V_{in} \\), and the vertical axis represents the output voltage \\( V_{out} \\). Units are not specified but are typically in volts.\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n   The graph shows a linear relationship in the conducting region, where \\( V_{out} \\) increases proportionally with \\( V_{in} \\). This indicates a 1:1 ratio of \\( V_{in} \\) to \\( V_{out} \\) when the diode is forward-biased.\n   For negative input voltages, \\( V_{out} \\) remains at zero, indicating the diode is not conducting and effectively blocking the negative half of the cycle.\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n   The graph has a distinct transition point at the origin, marked by a dashed line, which indicates the change from non-conducting to conducting states.\n   There are no specific numerical values or additional annotations provided on the graph.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n   The dashed line at the origin highlights the threshold where the diode begins to conduct, transitioning from zero output to a linear increase in \\( V_{out} \\) with increasing \\( V_{in} \\).\n\nFigure 3.10 (a) A diode operating as a rectifier, (b) complete rectifier, (c) input and output waveforms, (d) input/output characteristic.\n\nWe now analyze the circuit's response to a sinusoidal input [Fig. 3.10(c)]. Since \\( R_1 \\) tends to keep the cathode of \\( D_1 \\) near zero, as \\( V_{in} \\) increases, \\( D_1 \\) is forward-biased, shorting the output to the input. This state holds for the positive half cycle. When \\( V_{in} \\) falls below zero, \\( D_1 \\) turns off and \\( R_1 \\) ensures that \\( V_{out} = 0 \\) because \\( I_D R_1 = 0 \\). The circuit of Fig. 3.10(b) is called a \"rectifier.\"\n\nIt is instructive to plot the input/output characteristic of the circuit as well. Noting that if \\( V_{in} < 0 \\), \\( D_1 \\) is off and \\( V_{out} = 0 \\), and if \\( V_{in} > 0 \\), \\( D_1 \\) is on and \\( V_{out} = V_{in} \\), we obtain the behavior shown in Fig. 3.10(d). The rectifier is a nonlinear circuit because if \\( V_{in} \\rightarrow -V_{in} \\) then \\( V_{out} \\nrightarrow -V_{out} \\).\n\nIs it a coincidence that the characteristics in Figs. 3.7(d) and 3.10(d) look similar?\n\nSolution No, we recognize that the output voltage in Fig. 3.10(b) is simply equal to \\( I_A R_1 \\) in Fig. 3.7(a). Thus, the two plots differ by only a scaling factor equal to \\( R_1 \\).\n\nExercise Construct the characteristic if the terminals of \\( D_1 \\) are swapped.\n\nWe now determine the time average (dc value) of the output waveform in Fig. 3.10(c) to arrive at another interesting application. Suppose \\( V_{in} = V_p \\sin \\omega t \\), where \\( \\omega = 2 \\pi / T \\) denotes the frequency in radians per second and \\( T \\) the period. Then, in the first cycle after \\( t = 0 \\), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{out} & = V_p \\sin \\omega t \\text { for } 0 \\leq t \\leq \\frac{T}{2} \\tag{3.3}\\\\\n& = 0 \\quad \\text { for } \\frac{T}{2} \\leq t \\leq T \\tag{3.4}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nTo compute the average, we obtain the area under \\( V_{out} \\) and normalize the result to the period:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{out, avg} & = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} V_{out}(t) dt \\tag{3.5}\\\\\n& = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T / 2} V_p \\sin \\omega t dt \\tag{3.6}\\\\\n& = \\frac{1}{T} \\cdot \\frac{V_p}{\\omega}[-\\cos \\omega t]_{0}^{T / 2} \\tag{3.7}\\\\\n& = \\frac{V_p}{\\pi} \\tag{3.8}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThus, the average is proportional to \\( V_p \\), an expected result because a larger input amplitude yields a greater area under the rectified half cycles.\n\nThe above observation reveals that the average value of a rectified output can serve as a measure of the \"strength\" (amplitude) of the input. That is, a rectifier can operate as a \"signal strength indicator.\" For example, since cellphones receive varying levels of signal depending on the user's location and environment, they require an indicator to determine how much the signal must be amplified.\n\nExample A cellphone receives a \\( 1.8 \\text{-GHz} \\) signal with a peak amplitude ranging from \\( 2 \\mu \\text{V} \\) to \\( 3.9 \\text{mV} \\). If the signal is applied to a rectifier, what is the corresponding range of the output average?\n\nSolution The rectified output exhibits an average value ranging from \\( 2 \\mu \\text{V} /(\\pi) = 0.637 \\mu \\text{V} \\) to \\( 10 \\text{mV} /(\\pi) = 3.18 \\text{mV} \\).\n\nDo the above results change if a \\( 1 \\text{-}\\Omega \\) resistor is placed in series with the diode?\n\nIn our effort toward understanding the role of diodes, we examine another circuit that will eventually lead to some important applications. First, consider the topology in Fig. 3.11(a), where a 1-V battery is placed in series with an ideal diode. How does this circuit behave? If \\( V_1 < 0 \\), the cathode voltage is higher than the anode voltage, placing \\( D_1 \\) in reverse bias. Even if \\( V_1 \\) is slightly greater than zero, e.g., equal to 0.9 V, the anode is not positive enough to forward bias \\( D_1 \\). Thus, \\( V_1 \\) must approach +1 V for \\( D_1 \\) to turn on. Shown in Fig. 3.11(a), the I/V characteristic of the diode-battery combination resembles that of a diode, but shifted to the right by 1 V.\n\nNow, let us examine the circuit in Fig. 3.11(b). Here, for \\( V_{in} < 0 \\), \\( D_1 \\) remains off, yielding \\( V_{out} = V_{in} \\). For \\( V_{in} > 0 \\), \\( D_1 \\) acts as a short, and \\( V_{out} = 0 \\). The circuit therefore does not allow the output to exceed zero, as illustrated in the output waveform and the input/output characteristic. But suppose we seek a circuit that must not allow the output to exceed +1 V (rather than zero). How should the circuit of Fig. 3.11(b) be modified? In this case, \\( D_1 \\) must turn on only when \\( V_{out} \\) approaches +1 V, implying that a 1-V battery must be inserted in series with the diode. Depicted in Fig. 3.11(c), the modification indeed guarantees \\( V_{out} \\leq +1 \\text{V} \\) for any input level. We say the circuit \"clips\" or \"limits\" at +1 V. \"Limiters\" prove useful in many applications and are described in Section 3.5.3.\n\nExample 3.10\n\nSolution\n\nSketch the time average of \\( V_{out} \\) in Fig. 3.11(c) for a sinusoidal input as the battery voltage, \\( V_B \\), varies from \\( -\\infty \\) to \\( +\\infty \\).\n\nIf \\( V_B \\) is very negative, \\( D_1 \\) is always on because \\( V_{in} \\geq -V_p \\). In this case, the output average is equal to \\( V_B \\) [Fig. 3.12(a)]. For \\( -V_p < V_B < 0 \\), \\( D_1 \\) turns off at some point in the negative half cycle and remains off in the positive half cycle, yielding an average greater than \\( -V_p \\) but less than \\( V_B \\). For \\( V_B = 0 \\), the average reaches \\( -V_p /(\\pi) \\). Finally, for \\( V_B \\geq V_p \\), no limiting occurs and the average is equal to zero. Figure 3.12(b) sketches this behavior.\n\nDo the above results change if the terminals of the diode are swapped?\n\nExample 3.11 Is the circuit of Fig. 3.11(b) a rectifier?\n\nSolution Yes, indeed. The circuit passes only negative cycles to the output, producing a negative average.\n\nExercise How should the circuit of Fig. 3.11(b) be modified to pass only positive cycles to the output?"

The rectifier is a nonlinear circuit because if \\( V_{\\text{in}} \\rightarrow -V_{\\text{in}} \\), then \\( V_{\\text{out}} \\nrightarrow -V_{\\text{out}} \\).\n\nIs it a coincidence that the characteristics in Figs. 3.7(d) and 3.10(d) look similar?\n\nSolution: No, we recognize that the output voltage in Fig. 3.10(b) is simply equal to \\( I_A R_1 \\) in Fig. 3.7(a). Thus, the two plots differ by only a scaling factor equal to \\( R_1 \\).\n\nExercise: Construct the characteristic if the terminals of \\( D_1 \\) are swapped.\n\nWe now determine the time average (dc value) of the output waveform in Fig. 3.10(c) to arrive at another interesting application. Suppose \\( V_{\\text{in}} = V_p \\sin \\omega t \\), where \\( \\omega = 2\\pi/T \\) denotes the frequency in radians per second and \\( T \\) the period. Then, in the first cycle after \\( t = 0 \\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{\\text{out}} &= V_p \\sin \\omega t \\quad \\text{for} \\quad 0 \\leq t \\leq \\frac{T}{2} \\tag{3.3} \\\\\n&= 0 \\quad \\text{for} \\quad \\frac{T}{2} \\leq t \\leq T \\tag{3.4}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTo compute the average, we obtain the area under \\( V_{\\text{out}} \\) and normalize the result to the period:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{\\text{out, avg}} &= \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} V_{\\text{out}}(t) dt \\tag{3.5} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T/2} V_p \\sin \\omega t dt \\tag{3.6} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{T} \\cdot \\frac{V_p}{\\omega}[-\\cos \\omega t]_{0}^{T/2} \\tag{3.7} \\\\\n&= \\frac{V_p}{\\pi} \\tag{3.8}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThus, the average is proportional to \\( V_p \\), an expected result because a larger input amplitude yields a greater area under the rectified half cycles.\n\nThe above observation reveals that the average value of a rectified output can serve as a measure of the \"strength\" (amplitude) of the input. That is, a rectifier can operate as a \"signal strength indicator.\" For example, since cellphones receive varying levels of signal depending on the user's location and environment, they require an indicator to determine how much the signal must be amplified.\n\nExample: A cellphone receives a \\( 1.8 \\) GHz signal with a peak amplitude ranging from \\( 2 \\mu V \\) to \\( 3.9 \\times 10^{-1} mV \\). If the signal is applied to a rectifier, what is the corresponding range of the output average?\n\nSolution: The rectified output exhibits an average value ranging from \\( 2 \\mu V /(\\pi) = 0.637 \\mu V \\) to \\( 10 mV /(\\pi) = 3.18 mV \\).\n\nDo the above results change if a \\( 1-\\Omega \\) resistor is placed in series with the diode?\n\nIn our effort toward understanding the role of diodes, we examine another circuit that will eventually (in Section 3.5.3) lead to some important applications. First, consider the topology in Fig. 3.11(a), where a 1-V battery is placed in series with an ideal diode. How does this circuit behave? If \\( V_1 < 0 \\), the cathode voltage is higher than the anode voltage, placing \\( D_1 \\) in reverse bias. Even if \\( V_1 \\) is slightly greater than zero, e.g., equal to 0.9 V, the anode is not positive enough to forward bias \\( D_1 \\). Thus, \\( V_1 \\) must approach +1 V for \\( D_1 \\) to turn on. Shown in Fig. 3.11(a), the I/V characteristic of the diode-battery combination resembles that of a diode but shifted to the right by 1 V.\n\nNow, let us examine the circuit in Fig. 3.11(b). Here, for \\( V_{\\text{in}} < 0 \\), \\( D_1 \\) remains off, yielding \\( V_{\\text{out}} = V_{\\text{in}} \\). For \\( V_{\\text{in}} > 0 \\), \\( D_1 \\) acts as a short, and \\( V_{\\text{out}} = 0 \\). The circuit therefore does not allow the output to exceed zero, as illustrated in the output waveform and the input/output characteristic. But suppose we seek a circuit that must not allow the output to exceed +1 V (rather than zero). How should the circuit of Fig. 3.11(b) be modified? In this case, \\( D_1 \\) must turn on only when \\( V_{\\text{out}} \\) approaches +1 V, implying that a 1-V battery must be inserted in series with the diode. Depicted in Fig. 3.11(c), the modification indeed guarantees \\( V_{\\text{out}} \\leq +1 V \\) for any input level. We say the circuit \"clips\" or \"limits\" at +1 V. \"Limiters\" prove useful in many applications and are described in Section 3.5.3.\n\nExample 3.10\n\nSolution: Sketch the time average of \\( V_{\\text{out}} \\) in Fig. 3.11(c) for a sinusoidal input as the battery voltage, \\( V_B \\), varies from \\( -\\infty \\) to \\( +\\infty \\).\n\nIf \\( V_B \\) is very negative, \\( D_1 \\) is always on because \\( V_{\\text{in}} \\geq -V_p \\). In this case, the output average is equal to \\( V_B \\) [Fig. 3.12(a)]. For \\( -V_p < V_B < 0 \\), \\( D_1 \\) turns off at some point in the negative half-cycle and remains off in the positive half-cycle, yielding an average greater than \\( -V_p \\) but less than \\( V_B \\). For \\( V_B = 0 \\), the average reaches \\( -V_p /(\\pi) \\). Finally, for \\( V_B \\geq V_p \\), no limiting occurs, and the average is equal to zero. Figure 3.12(b) sketches this behavior.\n\nExercise: Repeat the above example if the terminals of the diode are swapped.\n\nExample 3.11: Is the circuit of Fig. 3.11(b) a rectifier?\n\nSolution: Yes, indeed. The circuit passes only negative cycles to the output, producing a negative average.\n\nExercise: How should the circuit of Fig. 3.11(b) be modified to pass only positive cycles to the output?"

    "text": "Referring back to Figure 3.2, we introduced the concept of the ideal diode as a method for converting \\( x(t) \\) to \\( y(t) \\). We are now tasked with designing a circuit that performs this conversion. A straightforward circuit design is presented in Figure 3.10(a). However, there is an issue with this design: the cathode of the diode is \"floating,\" which results in the output current always being zero, and the diode's state being indeterminate. To resolve this, we alter the circuit as shown in Figure 3.10(b) and analyze its response to a sinusoidal input in Figure 3.10(c). With resistor \\( R_1 \\) keeping the cathode of diode \\( D_1 \\) close to zero, as \\( V_{\\text{in}} \\) increases, \\( D_1 \\) becomes forward-biased, effectively shorting the output to the input. This condition persists during the positive half-cycle. When \\( V_{\\text{in}} \\) drops below zero, \\( D_1 \\) turns off, and \\( R_1 \\) ensures \\( V_{\\text{out}} = 0 \\) because \\( I_D R_1 = 0 \\). The circuit in Figure 3.10(b) is referred to as a \"rectifier.\"\n\nIt is instructive to also plot the input/output characteristic of this circuit. Recognizing that if \\( V_{\\text{in}} < 0 \\), \\( D_1 \\) is off and \\( V_{\\text{out}} = 0 \\), and if \\( V_{\\text{in}} > 0 \\), \\( D_1 \\) is on and \\( V_{\\text{out}} = V_{\\text{in}} \\), we obtain the behavior shown in Figure 3.10(d). The rectifier is a nonlinear circuit because if \\( V_{\\text{in}} \\rightarrow -V_{\\text{in}} \\), then \\( V_{\\text{out}} \\nrightarrow -V_{\\text{out}} \\).\n\nThe similarity between the characteristics in Figures 3.7(d) and 3.10(d) is not coincidental. We observe that the output voltage in Figure 3.10(b) is simply equal to \\( I_A R_1 \\) in Figure 3.7(a). Therefore, the two plots differ by only a scaling factor equal to \\( R_1 \\).\n\nExercise: Construct the characteristic if the terminals of \\( D_1 \\) are swapped.\n\nNext, we calculate the time average (dc value) of the output waveform in Figure 3.10(c) to explore another interesting application. Assuming \\( V_{\\text{in}} = V_p \\sin \\omega t \\), where \\( \\omega = \\frac{2\\pi}{T} \\) is the frequency in radians per second and \\( T \\) is the period, in the first cycle after \\( t = 0 \\), we have:\n\n\\[ V_{\\text{out}} = V_p \\sin \\omega t \\quad \\text{for} \\quad 0 \\leq t \\leq \\frac{T}{2} \\]\n\\[ V_{\\text{out}} = 0 \\quad \\text{for} \\quad \\frac{T}{2} \\leq t \\leq T \\]\n\nTo compute the average, we find the area under \\( V_{\\text{out}} \\) and normalize the result to the period:\n\n\\[ V_{\\text{out, avg}} = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^T V_{\\text{out}}(t) dt \\]\n\\[ V_{\\text{out, avg}} = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^{T/2} V_p \\sin \\omega t dt \\]\n\\[ V_{\\text{out, avg}} = \\frac{1}{T} \\cdot \\frac{V_p}{\\omega}[-\\cos \\omega t]_0^{T/2} \\]\n\\[ V_{\\text{out, avg}} = \\frac{V_p}{\\pi} \\]\n\nThus, the average is proportional to \\( V_p \\), which is an expected result since a larger input amplitude results in a greater area under the rectified half cycles.\n\nThis observation indicates that the average value of a rectified output can serve as an indicator of the \"strength\" (amplitude) of the input. In other words, a rectifier can function as a \"signal strength indicator.\" For instance, since cellphones receive varying signal levels depending on the user's location and environment, they require an indicator to determine the necessary amplification level of the signal.\n\nExample: A cellphone receives a 1.8-GHz signal with a peak amplitude ranging from 2 μV to 3.9 mV. If this signal is applied to a rectifier, what is the corresponding range of the output average?\n\nSolution: The rectified output exhibits an average value ranging from \\( \\frac{2 \\mu V}{\\pi} = 0.637 \\mu V \\) to \\( \\frac{10 mV}{\\pi} = 3.18 mV \\).\n\nDo the above results change if a 1-Ω resistor is placed in series with the diode?\n\nIn our exploration of diode functionality, we examine another circuit that will lead to significant applications in Section 3.5.3. Consider the topology in Figure 3.11(a), where a 1-V battery is placed in series with an ideal diode. How does this circuit behave? If \\( V_1 < 0 \\), the cathode voltage is higher than the anode voltage, placing \\( D_1 \\) in reverse bias. Even if \\( V_1 \\) is slightly greater than zero, for example, equal to 0.9 V, the anode is not sufficiently positive to forward-bias \\( D_1 \\). Thus, \\( V_1 \\) must approach +1 V for \\( D_1 \\) to turn on. The I/V characteristic of the diode-battery combination, as shown in Figure 3.11(a), resembles that of a diode but is shifted to the right by 1 V.\n\nNow, let us examine the circuit in Figure 3.11(b). Here, for \\( V_{\\text{in}} < 0 \\), \\( D_1 \\) remains off, yielding \\( V_{\\text{out}} = V_{\\text{in}} \\). For \\( V_{\\text{in}} > 0 \\), \\( D_1 \\) acts as a short, and \\( V_{\\text{out}} = 0 \\). The circuit, therefore, does not allow the output to exceed zero, as illustrated in the output waveform and the input/output characteristic. Suppose we desire a circuit that must not allow the output to exceed +1 V (instead of zero). How should the circuit of Figure 3.11(b) be modified? In this case, \\( D_1 \\) must turn on only when \\( V_{\\text{out}} \\) approaches +1 V, implying that a 1-V battery must be inserted in series with the diode. As depicted in Figure 3.11(c), this modification indeed guarantees \\( V_{\\text{out}} \\leq +1 V \\) for any input level. We refer to the circuit as \"clipping\" or \"limiting\" at +1 V. Limiters find utility in numerous applications and are discussed in Section 3.5.3.\n\nExample 3.10\n\nSolution: Sketch the time average of \\( V_{\\text{out}} \\) in Figure 3.11(c) for a sinusoidal input as the battery voltage, \\( V_B \\), varies from \\( -\\infty \\) to \\( +\\infty \\).\n\nIf \\( V_B \\) is very negative, \\( D_1 \\) is always on because \\( V_{\\text{in}} \\geq -V_p \\). In this case, the output average is equal to \\( V_B \\) [Figure 3.12(a)]. For \\( -V_p < V_B < 0 \\), \\( D_1 \\) turns off at some point in the negative half-cycle and remains off in the positive half-cycle, yielding an average greater than \\( -V_p \\) but less than \\( V_B \\). For \\( V_B = 0 \\), the average reaches \\( -V_p / \\pi \\). Finally, for \\( V_B \\geq V_p \\), no limiting occurs, and the average is equal to zero. Figure 3.12(b) sketches this behavior.\n\nExercise: Repeat the above example if the terminals of the diode are swapped.\n\nExample 3.11: Is the circuit of Figure 3.11(b) a rectifier?\n\nSolution: Yes, indeed.

    "text": "Referring to Figure 3.15, diodes $D_1$ and $D_2$ exhibit distinct cross-sectional areas while sharing identical properties otherwise. The task is to ascertain the current traversing each diode.\n\nFigure 3.15 depicts a diode circuit with the following components:\n- Voltage source $V1$ connected to resistor $R1$, forming a series connection.\n- Diodes $D1$ and $D2$ are connected in parallel, with their anodes linked to node $X1$ and their cathodes grounded.\n\nFor this scenario, the application of the exponential equation is mandatory as the ideal and constant-voltage models do not account for the device area. The total incoming current $I_{in}$ is the sum of the currents through $D_1$ and $D_2$:\n\n$$\nI_{in} = I_{D1} + I_{D2}\n$$\n\nMoreover, the voltage across $D_1$ and $D_2$ is equated:\n\n$$\nV_T \\ln \\frac{I_{D1}}{I_{S1}} = V_T \\ln \\frac{I_{D2}}{I_{S2}}\n$$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$$\n\\frac{I_{D1}}{I_{S1}} = \\frac{I_{D2}}{I_{S2}}\n$$\n\nConcurrently solving equations (3.13) and (3.15) yields:\n\n$$\nI_{D1} = \\frac{I_{in}}{1 + \\frac{I_{S2}}{I_{S1}}}\n$$\n$$\nI_{D2} = \\frac{I_{in}}{1 + \\frac{I_{S1}}{I_{S2}}}\n$$\n\nWhen $I_{S1} = I_{S2}$, as anticipated, $I_{D1} = I_{D2} = \\frac{I_{in}}{2}$.\n\nAn exercise involves calculating $V_D$ in terms of $I_{in}$, $I_{S1}$, and $I_{S2}$ for the circuit in Figure 3.15. This section may be omitted during an initial reading.\n\nUsing the constant-voltage model, the input/output characteristics of the circuit in Figure 3.16(a) should be plotted. It's noted that a diode on the verge of activation conducts zero current while maintaining $V_{D, \\text{on}}$.\n\nFigure 3.16(a) represents a diode circuit composed of:\n- Resistor $R1$ connecting the input voltage $Vin$ to the output voltage $Vout$.\n- Resistor $R2$ connecting $Vout$ to ground.\n- Diode $D1$ with its anode at $Vout$ and cathode grounded.\n\nThe circuit is a fundamental diode-resistor configuration with input at $Vin$ and output at $Vout$. $R1$ connects $Vin$ to $Vout$, $R2$ connects $Vout$ to ground, and $D1$ has its anode at $Vout$ and cathode at ground.\n\nIn Figure 3.16(c), a graph illustrates the input/output characteristics of a diode-resistor network. It's a two-dimensional graph where the horizontal axis represents $V_{in}$ (input voltage) and the vertical axis represents $V_{out}$ (output voltage), both likely in volts, although units are not explicitly mentioned.\n\nThis graph is a characteristic curve, typically employed in electronics to depict how output voltage varies with input voltage in a specific circuit setup. The initial linear region exhibits a linear increase in $V_{out}$ with $V_{in}$, adhering to the slope dictated by the ratio $\\frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}$, indicating the diode $D_1$ is off, and the circuit behaves as a simple voltage divider. The threshold point is marked by $V_{in}$ equalling $(1 + \\frac{R_1}{R_2})V_{D,\\text{on}}$, signaling the activation of diode $D_1$. Beyond this point, $V_{out}$ becomes constant at $V_{D,\\text{on}}$, denoting the diode's full conduction and clamping of the output voltage.\n\nKey features include the threshold voltage, output voltage in saturation, and initial slope, with annotations for $V_{D,\\text{on}}$ and transition points marked by dashed lines.\n\nIn the circuit depicted in Figure 3.16, when $V_{\\text{in}} = -\\infty$, $D_1$ is reverse-biased, simplifying the circuit to Figure 3.16(b). Hence,\n\n$$\nv_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} V_{in}\n$$\n\nTo determine when $D_1$ turns on, the diode voltage must reach $V_{D,\\text{on}}$, requiring an input voltage given by:\n\n$$\n\\frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} V_{in} = V_{D,\\text{on}}\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\nV_{in} = \\left(1 + \\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right) V_{D,\\text{on}}\n$$\n\nReaders may question the validity of this result: if the diode is on, it conducts current, and the diode voltage is no longer equal to $\\left[R_2 / \\left(R_1 + R_2\\right)\\right] V_{in}$. The reasoning behind expressing the diode voltage as such in Eq. (3.18) is to determine the break point by assuming $V_{\\text{in}}$ gradually increases, placing the diode at the brink of turning on.\n\nFor $V_{\\text{in}} > \\left(1 + \\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right) V_{D,\\text{on}}$, $D_1$ remains forward-biased, resulting in $V_{\\text{out}} = V_{D,\\text{on}}$. Figure 3.16(c) plots the overall characteristic.\n\nAn exercise involves repeating the example with the terminals of $D_1$ swapped, and another exercise involves plotting the current through $R_1$ as a function of $V_{\\text{in}}$.\n\nThe input/output characteristic for the circuit shown in Figure 3.17(a) should be plotted, assuming a constant-voltage model for the diode.\n\nFigure 3.17(a) depicts a diode circuit with:\n- Voltage source $Vin$.\n- Resistor $R1$ connecting node $X$ to ground.\n- Resistor $R2$ connecting $Vin$ to node $X$.\n- Diode $D1$ with its anode at $Vin$ and cathode at node $X$.\n\nThe circuit consists of a diode $D1$, two resistors $R1$ and $R2$, and a voltage source $Vin$. The diode becomes forward-biased when $Vin$ exceeds the diode's threshold voltage, allowing current flow through $R2$ and $D1$. $R1$ connects node $X$ to ground, influencing the output voltage $Vout$ at node $X$.\n\nFor very negative $V_{\\text{in}}$, the circuit is redrawn as in Figure 3.17(b), positioning the more negative voltages at the bottom and the more positive voltages at the top. This suggests that the diode operates in forward bias, establishing a voltage at node $X$ equal to $V_{in} + V_{D,\\text{on}}$. Note that in this regime, $V_X$ is independent of $R_2$ as $D_1$ acts as a voltage source. Thus, as long as $D_1$ is on, we have:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text{out}} = V_{\\text{in}} + V_{D,\\text{on}}\n$$\n\nThe currents through $R_2$ and $R_1$ are computed:\n\n$$\nI_{R2} = \\frac{V_{D,\\text{on}}}{R_2}\n$$\n$$\nI_{R1} = \\frac{0 - V_X}{R_1} = \\frac{-(V_{in} + V_{D,\\text{on}})}{R_1}\n$$\n\nAs $V_{in}$ increases from $-\\infty$, $I_{R2}$ remains constant, but $|I_{R1}|$ decreases; at some point, $I_{R2} = I_{R1}$.\n\nDetermining when $D_1$ turns off is simpler by seeking the condition that yields zero current through the diode rather than insufficient voltage across it. The condition $I_{R2} = I_{R1}$ implies that $D_1$ carries no current (KCL at node $X$). In other words, $D_1$ turns off if $V_{\\text{in}}$ is chosen to yield $I_{R2} = I_{R1}$. From equations (3.21) and (3.23),\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{D,\\text{on}}}{R_2} = -\\frac{V_{in} + V_{D,\\text{on}}}{R_1}\n$$\n\nHence,\n\n$$\nV_{in} = -\\left(1 + \\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right) V_{D,\\text{on}}\n$$\n\nBeyond this value, the circuit simplifies to that shown in Figure 3.17(c), and\n\n$$\nV_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{R_1}{R_1 + R_2} V_{\\text{in}}\n$$\n\nThe overall characteristic is depicted in Figure 3.17(d). It's interesting to note that the circuits of Figures 3.16(a) and 3.17(a) are identical: in the former, the output is sensed across the diode, whereas in the latter, it's sensed across the series resistor.\n\nAn exercise involves repeating the example with the terminals of the diode swapped.\n\nAs mentioned in Example 3.4, in more complex circuits, predicting the region of operation for each diode by inspection can be challenging. In such cases, one may make an educated guess, proceed with the analysis, and later verify if the results align with the initial assumption. The following example demonstrates this approach.\n\nPlot the input/output characteristic of the circuit shown in Figure 3.18(a) using the constant-voltage diode model.\n\nStarting with $V_{\\text{in}} = -\\infty$, an intuitive prediction is made that $D_1$ is on. A blind assumption is made that $D_2$ is also on, simplifying the circuit to that in Figure 3.18(b). The path through $V_{D,\\text{on}}$ and $V_B$ creates a voltage difference of $V_{D,\\text{on}} + V_B$ between $V_{\\text{in}}$ and $V_{\\text{out}}$, i.e., $V_{\\text{out}} = V_{\\text{in}} - (V_{D,\\text{on}} + V_B)$. This voltage difference also appears across the branch consisting of $R_1$ and $V_{D,\\text{on}}$, resulting in:\n\n$$\nR_1 I_{R1} + V_{D,\\text{on}} = -(V_B + V_{D,\\text{on}})\n$$\n\nHence,\n\n$$\nI_{R1} = \\frac{-V_B - 2 V_{D,\\text{on}}}{R_1}\n$$\n\n$I_{R1}$ is independent of $V_{\\text{in}}$. The results must now be analyzed to confirm whether they align with the assumptions regarding the states of $D_1$ and $D_2$.\n\nConsidering the current through $R_2$:\n\n$$\nI_{R2} = -\\frac{V_{\\text{out}}}{R_2} = -\\frac{V_{\\text{in}} - (V_{D,\\text{on}} - V_B)}{R_2}\n$$\n\nAs $V_{\\text{in}}$ approaches $-\\infty$, $I_{R2}$ approaches $+\\infty$. The high value of $I_{R2}$ and the constant value of $I_{R1}$ indicate that the branch consisting of $V_B$ and $D_2$ carries a large current in the direction shown. This means $D_2$ must conduct current from its cathode to its anode, which is not feasible.\n\nThus, the forward bias assumption for $D_2$ leads to a current flowing in an impractical direction. Therefore, $D_2$ operates in reverse bias for $V_{\\text{in}} = -\\infty$. Redrawing the circuit as in Figure 3.18(c) and noting that $V_X = V_{\\text{in}} + V_{D,\\text{on}}$, we have:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text{out}} = (V_{\\text{in}} + V_{D,\\text{on}}) \\frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}\n$$\n\nAs $V_{\\text{in}}$ increases, the first break point, where $D_1$ turns off or $D_2$ turns on, is determined. Assuming $D_1$ turns off first, the corresponding $V_{\\text{in}}$ value is found. With $D_2$ assumed off, the circuit is redrawn as shown in Figure 3.18(d). Recognizing that $D_1$ is slightly on, at $V_{\\text{in}} \\approx -V_{D,\\text{on}}$, $V_X = V_{\\text{in}} + V_{D,\\text{on}}$ approaches zero, resulting in zero current through $R_1$, $R_2$, and hence $D_1$. The diode therefore turns off at $V_{\\text{in}} = -V_{D,\\text{on}}$.\n\nThe assumption that $D_2$ remains off must now be verified. At this break point, $V_X = V_{\\text{out}} = 0$, making the voltage at node $Y$ equal to $+V_B$ while the cathode of $D_2$ is at $-V_{D,\\text{on}}$ [Figure 3.18(e)]. Thus, $D_2$ is indeed off. Figure 3.18(f) plots the input/output characteristic computed thus far, revealing that $V_{\\text{out}} = 0$ after the first break point due to zero current through $R_1$ and $R_2$.\n\nDetermining when $D_2$ turns on requires the input voltage to exceed $V_Y$ by $V_{D,\\text{on}}$. Before $D_2$ turns on, $V_{\\text{out}} = 0$ and $V_Y = V_B$; hence, $V_{\\text{in}}$ must reach $V_B + V_{D,\\text{on}}$, after which the circuit is configured as shown in Figure 3.18(g). Consequently,\n\n$$\nV_{\\text{out}} = V_{\\text{in}} - V_{D,\\text{on}} - V_B\n$$\n\nFigure 3.18(h) plots the overall result, summarizing the regions of operation.\n\nAn exercise involves assuming $D_2$ turns on before $D_1$ turns off and demonstrating that the results conflict with the initial assumption."

The units for both axes are likely volts, although not explicitly stated.\n\nType of Graph:\nThis is a characteristic curve, typically used in electronics to illustrate how output voltage varies with input voltage in a specific circuit configuration.\n\nAxes Labels and Units:\n- **Horizontal Axis ($V_{in}$):** Represents the input voltage to the circuit.\n- **Vertical Axis ($V_{out}$):** Represents the output voltage from the circuit.\n\nOverall Behavior and Trends:\n- **Initial Linear Region:** For small values of $V_{in}$, the output voltage $V_{out}$ increases linearly with $V_{in}$, following the slope determined by the ratio $\\frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}$. This indicates that the diode $D_1$ is off, and the circuit behaves like a simple voltage divider.\n- **Threshold Point:** At the point where $V_{in}$ equals $(1 + \\frac{R_1}{R_2})V_{D,on}$, the diode $D_1$ turns on.

So why did we express the diode voltage as such in Eq. (3.18)? To determine the break point, we assume $V_{\\text{in}}$ gradually increases so that it places the diode at the edge of the turn-on, e.g., it creates $V_{\\text{out}} \\approx 799 \\mathrm{mV}$. The diode therefore still draws no current, but the voltage across it and hence the input voltage are almost sufficient to turn it on.\n\nFor $V_{\\text{in}} > \\left(1+R_{1} / R_{2}\\right) V_{D, \\text{on}}$, $D_{1}$ remains forward-biased, yielding $V_{\\text{out}} = V_{D, \\text{on}}$.

This diagram suggests that the diode operates in forward bias, establishing a voltage at node $X$ equal to $V_{in} + V_{D,on}$. Note that in this regime, $V_X$ is independent of $R_2$ because $D_1$ acts as a battery. Thus, so long as $D_1$ is on, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text{out}} = V_{\\text{in}} + V_{D,on} \\tag{3.20}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWe also compute the current flowing through $R_2$ and $R_1$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{R2} & = \\frac{V_{D,on}}{R_{2}}  \\tag{3.21}\\\\\nI_{R1} & = \\frac{0-V_{X}}{R_{1}}  \\tag{3.22}\\\\\n& = \\frac{-\\left(V_{in}+V_{D,on}\\right)}{R_{1}} \\tag{3.23}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThus, as $V_{in}$ increases from $-\\infty$, $I_{R2}$ remains constant but $\\left|I_{R1}\\right|$ decreases; i.e., at some point $I_{R2} = I_{R1}$.\n\nAt what point does $D_1$ turn off? Interestingly, in this case, it is simpler to seek the condition that results in zero current through the diode rather than insufficient voltage across it. The observation that at some point, $I_{R2} = I_{R1}$ proves useful here as this condition also implies that $D_1$ carries no current (KCL at node $X$). In other words, $D_1$ turns off if $V_{in}$ is chosen to yield $I_{R2} = I_{R1}$.

Figure 3.16(c) illustrates the overall characteristic.\n\nRephrased text for the context provided: In the circuit of Fig. 3.15, diodes $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$ have different cross-sectional areas but are otherwise identical. Determine the current flowing through each diode. The circuit consists of a voltage source V1 connected to a resistor R1, which is in series with two parallel diodes D1 and D2. The node X1 connects R1 to the anodes of both diodes, with the cathodes of the diodes connected to ground. In this case, we must use the exponential equation because the ideal and constant-voltage models do not include the device area. We have $I_{in} = I_{D1} + I_{D2}$. We also equate the voltages across $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$: $V_{T} \\ln \\frac{I_{D1}}{I_{S1}} = V_{T} \\ln \\frac{I_{D2}}{I_{S2}}$, which simplifies to $\\frac{I_{D1}}{I_{S1}} = \\frac{I_{D2}}{I_{S2}}$. Solving these equations yields $I_{D1} = \\frac{I_{in}}{1+\\frac{I_{S2}}{I_{S1}}}$ and $I_{D2} = \\frac{I_{in}}{1+\\frac{I_{S1}}{I_{S2}}}$, and if $I_{S1} = I_{S2}$, then $I_{D1} = I_{D2} = \\frac{I_{in}}{2}$. For the circuit of Fig. 3.15, calculate $V_{D}$ in terms of $I_{in}$, $I_{S1}$, and $I_{S2}$. Using the constant-voltage model, plot the input/output characteristics of the circuit depicted in Fig. 3.16(a). Note that a diode about to turn on carries zero current but sustains $V_{D,on}$. The circuit is a basic diode-resistor network with input at Vin and output at Vout. R1 is connected between Vin and Vout, R2 is connected between Vout and GND, and D1 is a diode with anode at Vout and cathode at GND. In this case, the voltage across the diode happens to be equal to the output voltage. We observe that if $V_{in} = -\\infty$, $D_{1}$ is reverse biased, and the circuit reduces to that in Fig. 3.16(b). Therefore, $v_{out} = \\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} V_{in}$. To determine when $D_{1}$ turns on, the diode voltage must reach $V_{D,on}$, requiring an input voltage given by $\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} V_{in} = V_{D,on}$, hence $V_{in} = \\left(1+\\frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}}\\right) V_{D,on}$. The reader may question the validity of this result: if the diode is indeed on, it draws current, and the diode voltage is no longer equal to $\\left[\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}\\right] V_{in}$. The reason for expressing the diode voltage as such in Eq. (3.18) is to determine the break point by assuming $V_{in}$ gradually increases to place the diode at the turn-on edge. For $V_{in} > \\left(1+\\frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}}\\right) V_{D,on}$, $D_{1}$ remains forward-biased, resulting in $V_{out} = V_{D,on}$. Figure 3.16(c) illustrates the overall characteristic."

This diagram suggests that the diode operates in forward bias, establishing a voltage at node $X$ equal to $V_{i n}+V_{D, o n}$. Note that in this regime, $V_{X}$ is independent of $R_{2}$ because $D_{1}$ acts as a battery. Thus, so long as $D_{1}$ is on, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {out }}=V_{\\text {in }}+V_{D, \\text { on }} \\tag{3.20}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWe also compute the current flowing through $R_{2}$ and $R_{1}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{R 2} & =\\frac{V_{D, o n}}{R_{2}}  \\tag{3.21}\\\\\nI_{R 1} & =\\frac{0-V_{X}}{R_{1}}  \\tag{3.22}\\\\\n& =\\frac{-\\left(V_{i n}+V_{D, o n}\\right)}{R_{1}} \\tag{3.23}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThus, as $V_{i n}$ increases from $-\\infty$, $I_{R 2}$ remains constant but $\\left|I_{R 1}\\right|$ decreases; i.e., at some point $I_{R 2}=I_{R 1}$.\n\nTo determine when $D_{1}$ turns off, it is simpler to seek the condition that results in zero current through the diode rather than insufficient voltage across it.

So why did we express the diode voltage as such in Equation (3.18)? To determine the break point, we assume $V_{in}$ gradually increases so that it places the diode at the edge of the turn-on, e.g., it creates $V_{out} \\approx 799 \\mathrm{mV}$. The diode therefore still draws no current, but the voltage across it and hence the input voltage are almost sufficient to turn it on.\n\nFor $V_{in} > \\left(1 + \\frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}}\\right) V_{D,on}$, $D_{1}$ remains forward-biased, yielding $V_{out} = V_{D,on}$. Figure 3.16(c) plots the overall characteristic.\n\nExercise: Repeat the above example but assume the terminals of $D_{1}$ are swapped, i.e., the anode is tied to ground and the cathode to the output node.\n\nExercise: For the above example, plot the current through $R_{1}$ as a function of $V_{in}$.\n\nExample 3.15: Plot the input/output characteristic for the circuit shown in Figure 3.17(a). Assume a constant-voltage model for the diode.\nImage name: Figure 3.17 (a)\nDescription:\n- Voltage source Vin, and two resistors R1 and R2.

This diagram suggests that the diode operates in forward bias, establishing a voltage at node $X$ equal to $V_{in} + V_{D,on}$. Note that in this regime, $V_{X}$ is independent of $R_{2}$ because $D_{1}$ acts as a battery. Thus, so long as $D_{1}$ is on, we have:\n\n$$\nV_{out} = V_{in} + V_{D,on} \\tag{3.20}\n$$\n\nWe also compute the current flowing through $R_{2}$ and $R_{1}$:\n\n$$\nI_{R2} = \\frac{V_{D,on}}{R_{2}} \\tag{3.21}\n$$\n\n$$\nI_{R1} = \\frac{0 - V_{X}}{R_{1}} \\tag{3.22}\n$$\n\n$$\n= \\frac{-(V_{in} + V_{D,on})}{R_{1}} \\tag{3.23}\n$$\n\nThus, as $V_{in}$ increases from $-\\infty$, $I_{R2}$ remains constant, but $|I_{R1}|$ decreases; i.e., at some point $I_{R2} = I_{R1}$.\n\n$D_{1}$ turns off when the current through the diode is zero. Interestingly, in this case, it is simpler to seek the condition that results in zero current through the diode rather than insufficient voltage across it. The observation that at some point, $I_{R2} = I_{R1}$ proves useful here as this condition also implies that $D_{1}$ carries no current (KCL at node $X$). In other words, $D_{1}$ turns off if $V_{in}$ is chosen to yield $I_{R2} = I_{R1}$. From (3.21) and (3.23),\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{D,on}}{R_{2}} = -\\frac{V_{in} + V_{D,on}}{R_{1}} \\tag{3.24}\n$$\n\nHence,\n\n$$\nV_{in} = -\\left(1 + \\frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}}\\right) V_{D,on} \\tag{3.25}\n$$\n\nAs $V_{in}$ exceeds this value, the circuit reduces to that shown in Figure 3.17(c), and\n\n$$\nV_{out} = \\frac{R_{1}}{R_{1} + R_{2}} V_{in} \\tag{3.26}\n$$\n\nThe overall characteristic is shown in Figure 3.17(d).

This is referred to as \"large-signal operation,\" and the exponential characteristic is known as the \"large-signal model,\" highlighting its ability to handle any signal magnitude. However, this model can complicate analysis and hinder intuitive understanding of circuit behavior, especially as the number of nonlinear devices increases, making manual analysis unfeasible.\n\nThe ideal and constant-voltage diode models partially address these issues, but the sharp nonlinearity at the turn-on point remains problematic. An example illustrates this general challenge:\n\nA student, having lost their 2.4-V cellphone charger, fails to find adaptors below 3 V in local stores. They decide to build a circuit, shown in Fig. 3.19, with three identical diodes in forward bias to achieve a total voltage of $V_{\\text {out }}=3 V_{D} \\approx 2.4 \\mathrm{~V}$, while resistor $R_{1}$ compensates for the remaining 600 mV. The cellphone's current draw is ignored. (a) Calculate the reverse saturation current, $I_{S 1}$, for $V_{\\text {out }}=2.4 \\mathrm{~V}$. (b) Determine $V_{\\text {out }}$ if the adaptor voltage is actually 3.1 V.\n\nThe circuit includes a voltage source (Vad = 3V), a current source (Ix), a resistor (R1 = 100Ω), and three diodes (D1, D2, D3) in series. The diodes are forward-biased, and the total output voltage (Vout) is approximately 2.4V. The resistor R1 sustains the remaining 600mV. The circuit is used to power a cellphone, with the current through the diodes equal to the current through the resistor.\n\nSolution\n(a) With $V_{\\text {out }}=2.4 \\mathrm{~V}$, the current through $R_{1}$ is\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{X} & =\\frac{V_{\\text {ad }}-V_{\\text {out }}}{R_{1}}  \\tag{3.33}\\\\\n& =6 \\mathrm{~mA} . \\tag{3.34}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nEach diode carries $I_{X}$, so\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{X}=I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{D}}{V_{T}} \\tag{3.35}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n6 \\mathrm{~mA}=I_{S} \\exp \\frac{800 \\mathrm{mV}}{26 \\mathrm{mV}} \\tag{3.36}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{S}=2.602 \\times 10^{-16} \\mathrm{~A} \\tag{3.37}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n(b) If $V_{\\text {ad }}$ increases to 3.1 V, $V_{\\text {out }}$ should rise slightly. Assuming $V_{\\text {out }}$ remains at 2.4 V, the extra 0.1 V drops across $R_{1}$, increasing $I_{X}$ to 7 mA. Given the logarithmic current-voltage relationship, the change from 6 mA to 7 mA results in a minor $V_{\\text {out }}$ adjustment.\n\nQuantitative analysis starts with $I_{X}=7 \\mathrm{~mA}$ and proceeds iteratively:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{\\text {out }} & =3 V_{D}  \\tag{3.38}\\\\\n& =3 V_{T} \\ln \\frac{I_{X}}{I_{S}}  \\tag{3.39}\\\\\n& =2.412 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{3.40}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis $V_{\\text {out }}$ yields a new $I_{X}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{X} & =\\frac{V_{\\text {ad }}-V_{\\text {out }}}{R_{1}}  \\tag{3.41}\\\\\n& =6.88 \\mathrm{~mA} \\tag{3.42}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhich translates to a new $V_{\\text {out }}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{\\text {out }} & =3 V_{D}  \\tag{3.43}\\\\\n& =2.411 \\mathrm{~V} . \\tag{3.44}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe minimal difference between (3.40) and (3.44) indicates $V_{\\text {out }}=2.411 \\mathrm{~V}$ with high accuracy. The constant-voltage diode model is inadequate here.\n\nExercise: Repeat the example for an output voltage of 2.35 V.\n\nThis scenario exemplifies small \"perturbations\" in circuits. The 0.1 V increase in $V_{a d}$ leads to minor voltage and current changes, prompting the search for a simpler analysis method to replace nonlinear equations and iterative procedures. While the example isn't overly complex, subsequent chapters will show that circuits with devices like transistors can become intractable with nonlinear equations.\n\nThis leads to the crucial concept of \"small-signal operation,\" where circuits undergo minor voltage and current changes, allowing simplification via \"small-signal models\" for nonlinear devices. These models are linear, enabling standard circuit analysis without iteration. The definition of \"small\" will be clarified later.\n\nTo grasp small-signal operation, consider diode $D_{1}$ in Fig. 3.20(a), sustaining voltage $V_{D 1}$ and current $I_{D 1}$ [point $A$ in Fig. 3.20(b)]. A circuit perturbation causes a small voltage change $\\Delta V_{D}$ [point $B$ in Fig. 3.20(c)]. How do we predict the current change, $\\Delta I_{D}$? Starting with the nonlinear characteristic:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{D 2} & =I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{D 1}+\\Delta V}{V_{T}}  \\tag{3.45}\\\\\n& =I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{D 1}}{V_{T}} \\exp \\frac{\\Delta V}{V_{T}} \\tag{3.46}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIf $\\Delta V \\ll V_{T}$, then $\\exp \\left(\\Delta V / V_{T}\\right) \\approx 1+\\Delta V / V_{T}$, and\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{D 2} & =I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{D 1}}{V_{T}}+\\frac{\\Delta V}{V_{T}} I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{D 1}}{V_{T}}  \\tag{3.47}\\\\\n& =I_{D 1}+\\frac{\\Delta V}{V_{T}} I_{D 1} \\tag{3.48}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\Delta I_{D}=\\frac{\\Delta V}{V_{T}} I_{D 1} \\tag{3.49}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe key observation is that $\\Delta I_{D}$ is a linear function of $\\Delta V$, with a proportionality factor of $I_{D 1} / V_{T}$. This result is intuitive: for small $V_{D}$ changes, the curve section in Fig. 3.20(c) between points $A$ and $B$ can be approximated by a straight line, with a slope equal to the local curve slope.\n\nThis approximation is shown in Fig. 3.21, where the linear section between points A and B represents the small-signal conductance. The change in current (ΔI_D) and voltage (ΔV_D) between these points illustrates the linear approximation.\n\nIn essence,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\Delta I_{D}}{\\Delta V_{D}} & =\\left.\\frac{d I_{D}}{d V_{D}}\\right|_{V D=V D 1}  \\tag{3.50}\\\\\n& =\\frac{I_{S}}{V_{T}} \\exp \\frac{V_{D 1}}{V_{T}}  \\tag{3.51}\\\\\n& =\\frac{I_{D 1}}{V_{T}} \\tag{3.52}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nyielding the same result as Eq. (3.49).\n\nTo summarize, for small voltage changes across a diode (much less than $V_{T}$), the current change is given by Eq. (3.49). For small-signal analysis, we assume operation at a point like $A$ in Fig. 3.21 and, due to a small perturbation, move to point $B$ along a straight line with a slope equal to the local curve slope (i.e., $d I_{D} / d V_{D}$ at $V_{D}=V_{D 1}$ or $I_{D}=I_{D 1}$). Point $A$ is the \"bias\" or \"operating\" point.\n\nExample: A diode is biased at 1 mA. (a) Calculate the current change for a 1 mV $V_{D}$ change. (b) Determine the voltage change for a 10% $I_{D}$ change.\n\nSolution: (a) Using Eq.

Calculate the diode's bias current.\n\nEq. (3.58) reveals an interesting aspect of small-signal operation: for small current and voltage changes, the diode behaves as a linear resistor. Analogous to Ohm's Law, we define the \"small-signal resistance\" as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nr_{d}=\\frac{V_{T}}{I_{D}} \\tag{3.58}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis is also the \"incremental\" resistance, emphasizing its validity for small changes. In the example, $r_{d}=26 \\Omega$.\n\nFig. 3.22(a) summarizes the results for a forward-biased diode. For bias calculations, the diode is replaced with an ideal voltage source $V_{D, o n}$, and for small changes, with a resistor $r_{d}$. For example, the circuit in Fig. 3.22(b) is transformed to Fig. 3.22(c) for small $V_{1}$ and $V_{\\text {out }}$ changes. Note that $v_{1}$ and $v_{\\text {out }}$ represent voltage changes and are called small-signal quantities. Small-signal voltages and currents are denoted by lowercase letters.\n\nFig. 3.22 shows the diode models for bias and signal calculations, with (b) a circuit example and (c) a small-signal model."

This is referred to as the \"large-signal operation,\" and the exponential characteristic is the \"large-signal model\" to underscore its capacity for arbitrary signal levels. Nevertheless, as seen in prior examples, this model often complicates analysis, hindering an intuitive grasp of the circuit's function. Moreover, with an increase in the number of nonlinear devices, manual analysis eventually becomes unfeasible.\n\nThe ideal and constant-voltage diode models partially address these issues, yet the sharp nonlinearity at the turn-on point remains problematic. The following example demonstrates this general challenge.\n\nAn electrical engineering student, having lost his 2.4-V cellphone charger, searches several stores but finds no adaptors with outputs less than 3 V. He then decides to utilize his electronics knowledge to construct the circuit shown in Fig. 3.19, where three identical diodes in forward bias yield a total voltage of $V_{\\text {out }}=3 V_{D} \\approx 2.4 \\mathrm{~V}$, and resistor $R_{1}$ maintains the remaining 600 mV. Ignore the current drawn by the cellphone. ${ }^{6}$ (a) Calculate the reverse saturation current, $I_{S 1}$ for $V_{\\text {out }}=2.4 \\mathrm{~V}$. (b) Compute $V_{\\text {out }}$ if the adaptor voltage is actually 3.1 V.\n\nThe circuit in Fig. 3.19 includes a voltage source (Vad = 3V), a current source (Ix), a resistor (R1 = 100Ω), and three diodes (D1, D2, D3) in series. The diodes are forward-biased, and the total output voltage (Vout) is approximately 2.4V. The resistor R1 maintains the remaining 600mV. The circuit is used to power a cellphone, with the current through the diodes equal to the current through the resistor.\n\nSolution\n(a) With $V_{\\text {out }}=2.4 \\mathrm{~V}$, the current flowing through $R_{1}$ is\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{X} & =\\frac{V_{\\text {ad }}-V_{\\text {out }}}{R_{1}}  \\tag{3.33}\\\\\n& =6 \\mathrm{~mA} . \\tag{3.34}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nEach diode carries $I_{X}$, hence\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{X}=I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{D}}{V_{T}} \\tag{3.35}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIt follows that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n6 \\mathrm{~mA}=I_{S} \\exp \\frac{800 \\mathrm{mV}}{26 \\mathrm{mV}} \\tag{3.36}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{S}=2.602 \\times 10^{-16} \\mathrm{~A} \\tag{3.37}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n(b) If $V_{\\text {ad }}$ rises to 3.1 V, we anticipate a slight increase in $V_{\\text {out }}$. To understand why, first assume $V_{\\text {out }}$ remains constant at 2.4 V. Then, the additional 0.1 V must drop across $R_{1}$, increasing $I_{X}$ to 7 mA. Since the voltage across each diode has a logarithmic dependence on the current, the change from 6 mA to 7 mA indeed yields a small change in $V_{\\text {out }}{ }^{7}$\n\nTo analyze the circuit quantitatively, we start with $I_{X}=7 \\mathrm{~mA}$ and iterate:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{\\text {out }} & =3 V_{D}  \\tag{3.38}\\\\\n& =3 V_{T} \\ln \\frac{I_{X}}{I_{S}}  \\tag{3.39}\\\\\n& =2.412 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{3.40}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis value of $V_{\\text {out }}$ gives a new value for $I_{X}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{X} & =\\frac{V_{\\text {ad }}-V_{\\text {out }}}{R_{1}}  \\tag{3.41}\\\\\n& =6.88 \\mathrm{~mA} \\tag{3.42}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhich translates to a new $V_{\\text {out }}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{\\text {out }} & =3 V_{D}  \\tag{3.43}\\\\\n& =2.411 \\mathrm{~V} . \\tag{3.44}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nNoting the very small difference between (3.40) and (3.44), we conclude that $V_{\\text {out }}=2.411 \\mathrm{~V}$ with good accuracy. The constant-voltage diode model would not be useful in this case.\n\nExercise Repeat the above example if an output voltage of 2.35 is desired.\n\nThe scenario described above exemplifies small \"perturbations\" in circuits. The change in $V_{a d}$ from 3 V to 3.1 V results in minor alterations in the circuit's voltages and currents, prompting us to seek a simpler analysis method that can replace the nonlinear equations and the inevitable iterative process. Of course, since the above example does not present an overwhelmingly difficult problem, the reader may question the necessity of a simpler approach. However, as seen in subsequent chapters, circuits containing complex devices such as transistors may indeed become impossible to analyze if the nonlinear equations are retained.\n\nThese considerations lead us to the crucial concept of \"small-signal operation,\" where the circuit undergoes only minor changes in voltages and currents, allowing simplification through the use of \"small-signal models\" for nonlinear devices. The simplicity arises because such models are linear, enabling standard circuit analysis and eliminating the need for iteration. The definition of \"small\" will become clear later.\n\nTo develop our understanding of small-signal operation, consider diode $D_{1}$ in Fig. 3.20(a), which maintains a voltage $V_{D 1}$ and carries a current $I_{D 1}$ [point $A$ in Fig. 3.20(b)].

The 0.1 V increase in $V_{a d}$ leads to minor voltage and current shifts, prompting the search for a simpler analysis technique to replace nonlinear equations and iterative procedures. Although the example isn't overly complex, subsequent chapters demonstrate that circuits with intricate devices like transistors may become intractable with nonlinear equations.\n\nThis leads to the pivotal concept of \"small-signal operation,\" where circuits undergo minor voltage and current fluctuations, allowing simplification via \"small-signal models\" for nonlinear devices. These models are linear, facilitating standard circuit analysis and eliminating iteration. The term \"small\" will be clarified later.\n\nTo grasp small-signal operation, consider diode $D_{1}$ in Fig. 3.20(a), maintaining voltage $V_{D 1}$ and current $I_{D 1}$ [point $A$ in Fig. 3.20(b)].

(Larger $I_{D 1}$ values result in a greater $\\Delta I_{D}$ for a given $\\Delta V_{D}$. The significance of this trend becomes apparent later.)\n\nThis result is expected: for small $V_{D}$ changes, the section of the characteristic between points $A$ and $B$ in Fig. 3.20(c) can be approximated by a straight line (Fig. 3.21), with a slope equal to the local slope of the characteristic.\n\nFigure 3.21 Approximation of characteristic by a straight line.\n\nIn other words,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\Delta I_{D}}{\\Delta V_{D}} & =\\left.\\frac{d I_{D}}{d V_{D}}\\right|_{V D=V D 1}  \\tag{3.50}\\\\\n& =\\frac{I_{S}}{V_{T}} \\exp \\frac{V_{D 1}}{V_{T}}  \\tag{3.51}\\\\\n& =\\frac{I_{D 1}}{V_{T}} \\tag{3.52}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nyielding the same result as Eq. (3.49). ${ }^{8}$\nTo summarize, if the voltage across a diode changes slightly (much less than $V_{T}$), the current change is given by Eq. (3.49). For small-signal analysis, we can assume operation at a point like $A$ in Fig. 3.21 and, due to a small perturbation, move to point $B$ along a straight line with a slope equal to the local slope of the characteristic (i.e., $d I_{D} / d V_{D}$ calculated at $V_{D}=V_{D 1}$ or $I_{D}=I_{D 1}$). Point $A$ is termed the \"bias\" point, the \"quiescent\" point, or the \"operating\" point.\n\nExample: A diode is biased at a current of 1 mA.

(b) Calculate the voltage change if $I_{D}$ changes by 10%.\n\nSolution: (a) We have\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Delta I_{D} & =\\frac{I_{D}}{V_{T}} \\Delta V_{D}  \\tag{3.53}\\\\\n& =38.4 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} . \\tag{3.54}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\n(b) Using the same equation yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Delta V_{D} & =\\frac{V_{T}}{I_{D}} \\Delta I_{D}  \\tag{3.55}\\\\\n& =\\left(\\frac{26 \\mathrm{mV}}{1 \\mathrm{~mA}}\\right) \\times(0.1 \\mathrm{~mA})  \\tag{3.56}\\\\\n& =2.6 \\mathrm{mV} \\tag{3.57}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nExercise: Given a 1 mA current change, a diode shows a 3 mV voltage change. Calculate the diode's bias current.\n\nEquation (3.58) in the example reveals an interesting aspect of small-signal operation: for small changes in diode current and voltage, the device behaves like a linear resistor. Analogous to Ohm's Law, we define the \"small-signal resistance\" of the diode as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nr_{d}=\\frac{V_{T}}{I_{D}} \\tag{3.58}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis quantity is also known as the \"incremental\" resistance to stress its validity for small changes. In the example, $r_{d}=26 \\Omega$.\n\nFigure 3.22(a) summarizes our findings for a forward-biased diode. For bias calculations, the diode is substituted with an ideal voltage source of value $V_{D, o n}$, and for small changes, with a resistor equal to $r_{d}$. For instance, if only small changes in $V_{1}$ and $V_{\\text {out }}$ are of interest, the circuit of Fig. 3.22(b) is transformed into that in Fig. 3.22(c). Note that $v_{1}$ and $v_{\\text {out }}$ in Fig. 3.22(c) represent voltage changes and are termed small-signal quantities.

Figure 3.24 illustrates the two cases, distinguishing between the cause and the effect.\n\n(a)\n\nFigure 3.24 Change in diode current (voltage) due to a change in voltage (current).\n\nExercise Repeat the above example by taking the derivative of the diode voltage equation with respect to $I_D$.\n\nWith our understanding of small-signal operation, we now revisit Example 3.17.\n\nExample Repeat part (b) of Example 3.17 with the aid of a small-signal model for the diodes.\n\nSolution Since each diode carries $I_{D1} = 6 \\text{~mA}$ with an adaptor voltage of 3 V and $V_{D1} = 800 \\text{mV}$, we can construct the small-signal model shown in Fig. 3.25, where $v_{ad} = 100 \\text{mV}$ and $r_d = (26 \\text{mV}) / (6 \\text{~mA}) = 4.33 \\Omega$. (As mentioned earlier, the voltages shown in this model denote small changes.) We can thus write:\n\n$$\nv_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{3 r_d}{R_1 + 3 r_d} v_{ad} = 11.5 \\text{mV} \\tag{3.70, 3.71}\n$$\n\nThat is, a 100-mV change in $V_{\\text{ad}}$ yields an $11.5-\\text{mV}$ change in $V_{\\text{out}}$. In Example 3.17, solution of nonlinear diode equations predicted an $11-\\text{mV}$ change in $V_{\\text{out}}$. The small-signal analysis therefore offers reasonable accuracy while requiring much less computational effort.\n\nExercise Repeat Examples (3.17) and (3.21) if the value of $R_1$ in Fig. 3.19 is changed to $200 \\Omega$.\n\nConsidering the power of today's computer software tools, the reader may wonder if the small-signal model is really necessary. Indeed, we utilize sophisticated simulation tools in the design of integrated circuits today, but the intuition gained by hand analysis of a circuit proves invaluable in understanding fundamental limitations and various trade-offs that eventually lead to a compromise in the design. A good circuit designer analyzes and understands the circuit before giving it to the computer for a more accurate analysis. A bad circuit designer, on the other hand, allows the computer to think for him/her.\n\nIn Examples 3.17 and 3.21, the current drawn by the cellphone is neglected. Now suppose, as shown in Fig. 3.26, the load pulls a current of $0.5 \\text{~mA}$ and determine $V_{\\text{out}}$.\n\nSolution Since the current flowing through the diodes decreases by 0.5 mA and since this change is much less than the bias current $(6 \\text{~mA})$, we write the change in the output voltage as:\n\n$$\n\\Delta V_{\\text{out}} = \\Delta I_D \\cdot (3 r_d) = 0.5 \\text{~mA} (3 \\times 4.33 \\Omega) = 6.5 \\text{mV} \\tag{3.72, 3.73, 3.74}\n$$\n\nExercise Repeat the above example if $R_1$ is reduced to $80 \\Omega$.\n\nDid you know?\n\nWhat would our life be like without diodes? Forget about cell phones, laptops, and digital cameras. We would not even have radios, TVs, GPS, radars, satellites, power plants, or long-distance telephone communication. And, of course, no Google or Facebook. In essence, we would return to the simple lifestyle of the early 1900s-which might not be that bad after all ...\n\nIn summary, the analysis of circuits containing diodes (and other nonlinear devices such as transistors) proceeds in three steps: (1) determine-perhaps with the aid of the constant-voltage model-the initial values of voltages and currents (before an input change is applied); (2) develop the small-signal model for each diode (i.e., calculate $r_d$); (3) replace each diode with its small-signal model and compute the effect of the input change."

    "text": "A sinusoidal signal with a peak amplitude of $V_{p}$ and a DC offset of $V_{0}$ is represented by $V(t)=V_{0}+V_{p} \\cos \\omega t$. When this signal is applied to a diode and $V_{p}$ is much smaller than $V_{T}$, we aim to find the resulting diode current.\n\nTo solve this, the signal waveform is depicted in Fig. 3.23(a). As shown in Fig. 3.23(b), we rotate this diagram by $90^{\\circ}$ so that its vertical axis aligns with the voltage axis of the diode characteristic. With a signal swing much less than $V_{T}$, we can consider $V_{0}$ and the corresponding current, $I_{0}$, as the bias point of the diode and $V_{p}$ as a small perturbation. This leads to:\n\n$$\nI_{0}=I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{0}}{V_{T}}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nr_{d}=\\frac{V_{T}}{I_{0}}\n$$\n\nHence, the peak current is simply:\n\n$$\nI_{p} = \\frac{V_{p}}{r_{d}} = \\frac{I_{0}}{V_{T}} V_{p}\n$$\n\nThe graph in Figure 3.23(a) shows a time-domain waveform depicting a sinusoidal voltage signal with a DC offset. The x-axis represents time \\( t \\), and the y-axis represents the voltage \\( V(t) \\). The waveform is a sinusoidal function oscillating around a constant DC level \\( V_0 \\). The sinusoid has a peak amplitude of \\( V_p \\) above and below the DC level, indicating that the voltage varies between \\( V_0 + V_p \\) and \\( V_0 - V_p \\). The waveform is symmetric around the DC level, showing a regular periodic pattern typical of a sinusoidal signal.\n\nKey features include:\n- A horizontal dashed line indicating the DC level \\( V_0 \\).\n- Vertical arrows pointing to the peak amplitude \\( V_p \\) above and below the DC level, highlighting the maximum deviation of the sinusoidal waveform from the DC level.\n- The sinusoidal waveform suggests a consistent frequency, though the exact frequency is not specified.\n\nNo specific numerical values or annotations are provided on the graph, focusing instead on the general shape and behavior of the waveform.\n\nThe graph in Figure 3.23(b) illustrates the response of a diode to a sinusoidal input. It consists of two main parts: the left side shows the diode characteristic curve, while the right side displays the time-domain response of the diode current.\n\n1. **Type of Graph and Function:**\n- The left graph is a diode characteristic curve plotting diode current \\( I_D \\) against diode voltage \\( V_D \\), while the right graph is a time-domain waveform showing the diode current \\( I_D \\) over time \\( t \\).\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n- **Left Graph:**\n- X-axis: Diode voltage \\( V_D \\) (units not specified, typically volts)\n- Y-axis: Diode current \\( I_D \\) (units not specified, typically amperes)\n- **Right Graph:**\n- X-axis: Time \\( t \\) (units not specified, typically seconds)\n- Y-axis: Diode current \\( I_D \\) (units not specified, typically amperes)\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- **Left Graph:**\n- The diode characteristic curve shows an exponential increase in diode current \\( I_D \\) as the diode voltage \\( V_D \\) increases.\n- The curve starts from the origin and rises steeply, indicating the typical exponential behavior of a diode in forward bias.\n- **Right Graph:**\n- The time-domain response shows a sinusoidal variation of the diode current \\( I_D \\) around a DC level \\( I_0 \\).\n- The waveform oscillates with a peak amplitude \\( I_p \\), indicating the influence of the sinusoidal input.\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- **Left Graph:**\n- The DC level \\( I_0 \\) is marked, showing the bias point of the diode.\n- **Right Graph:**\n- The sinusoidal waveform is centered around the DC level \\( I_0 \\) with peaks at \\( I_0 + I_p \\) and troughs at \\( I_0 - I_p \\).\n- The peak amplitude \\( I_p \\) is annotated, indicating the extent of the sinusoidal variation.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- The graph includes annotations for the DC level \\( I_0 \\) and the peak amplitude \\( I_p \\), highlighting the sinusoidal variation around the DC bias point.\n\nIn summary, Figure 3.23 (a) illustrates the diode's current-voltage characteristic and its response to a sinusoidal input, showing how the diode current oscillates around a DC level in response to the input voltage.\n\nFigure 3.23 (a) Sinusoidal input along with a dc level, (b) response of a diode to the sinusoid.\n\nThis yields:\n\n$$\nI_{D}(t) = I_{0}+I_{p} \\cos \\omega t = I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{0}}{V_{T}}+\\frac{I_{0}}{V_{T}} V_{p} \\cos \\omega t\n$$\n\nExercise: The diode in the above example produces a peak current of 0.1 mA in response to $V_{0}=800 \\mathrm{mV}$ and $V_{p}=1.5 \\mathrm{mV}$. Calculate $I_{S}$.\n\nThe above example demonstrates the utility of small-signal analysis. If $V_{p}$ were large, we would need to solve the following equation:\n\n$$\nI_{D}(t)=I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{0}+V_{p} \\cos \\omega t}{V_{T}}\n$$\n\na task much more difficult than the above linear calculations.\n\nIn the derivation leading to Eq. (3.49), we assumed a small change in $V_{D}$ and obtained the resulting change in $I_{D}$. Beginning with $V_{D}=V_{T} \\ln \\left(I_{D} / I_{S}\\right)$, we now investigate the reverse case, i.e., $I_{D}$ changes by a small amount and we wish to compute the change in $V_{D}$.\n\nSolution: Denoting the change in $V_{D}$ by $\\Delta V_{D}$, we have:\n\n$$\nV_{D 1}+\\Delta V_{D} = V_{T} \\ln \\frac{I_{D 1}+\\Delta I_{D}}{I_{S}}\n$$\n\n$$\n= V_{T} \\ln \\left[\\frac{I_{D 1}}{I_{S}}\\left(1+\\frac{\\Delta I_{D}}{I_{D 1}}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\n$$\n= V_{T} \\ln \\frac{I_{D 1}}{I_{S}}+V_{T} \\ln \\left(1+\\frac{\\Delta I_{D}}{I_{D 1}}\\right)\n$$\n\nFor small-signal operation, we assume $\\Delta I_{D} \\ll I_{D 1}$ and note that $\\ln (1+\\epsilon) \\approx \\epsilon$ if $\\epsilon \\ll 1$. Thus:\n\n$$\n\\Delta V_{D}=V_{T} \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta I_{D}}{I_{D 1}}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as Eq. (3.49). Figure 3.24 illustrates the two cases, distinguishing between the cause and the effect.\n\nExercise: Repeat the above example by taking the derivative of the diode voltage equation with respect to $I_{D}$.\n\nWith our understanding of small-signal operation, we now revisit Example 3.17.\n\nExample: Repeat part (b) of Example 3.17 with the aid of a small-signal model for the diodes.\n\nSolution: Since each diode carries $I_{D 1}=6 \\mathrm{~mA}$ with an adaptor voltage of 3 V and $V_{D 1}=800 \\mathrm{mV}$, we can construct the small-signal model shown in Fig. 3.25, where $v_{a d}=100 \\mathrm{mV}$ and $r_{d}=(26 \\mathrm{mV}) /(6 \\mathrm{~mA})=4.33 \\Omega$. (As mentioned earlier, the voltages shown in this model denote small changes.) We can thus write:\n\n$$\nv_{\\text {out }} = \\frac{3 r_{d}}{R_{1}+3 r_{d}} v_{a d} = 11.5 \\mathrm{mV}\n$$\n\nThat is, a 100-mV change in $V_{\\text {ad }}$ yields an $11.5-\\mathrm{mV}$ change in $V_{\\text {out }}$. In Example 3.17, the solution of nonlinear diode equations predicted an $11-\\mathrm{mV}$ change in $V_{\\text {out }}$. The small-signal analysis therefore offers reasonable accuracy while requiring much less computational effort.\n\nExercise: Repeat Examples (3.17) and (3.21) if the value of $R_{1}$ in Fig. 3.19 is changed to $200 \\Omega$.\n\nConsidering the power of today's computer software tools, the reader may wonder if the small-signal model is really necessary. Indeed, we utilize sophisticated simulation tools in the design of integrated circuits today, but the intuition gained by hand analysis of a circuit proves invaluable in understanding fundamental limitations and various trade-offs that eventually lead to a compromise in the design. A good circuit designer analyzes and understands the circuit before giving it to the computer for a more accurate analysis. A bad circuit designer, on the other hand, allows the computer to think for him/her.\n\nIn Examples 3.17 and 3.21, the current drawn by the cellphone is neglected. Now suppose, as shown in Fig. 3.26, the load pulls a current of $0.5 \\mathrm{~mA}$ and determine $V_{\\text {out }}$.\n\nSolution: Since the current flowing through the diodes decreases by 0.5 mA and since this change is much less than the bias current $(6 \\mathrm{~mA})$, we write the change in the output voltage as:\n\n$$\n\\Delta V_{\\text {out }} = \\Delta I_{D} \\cdot\\left(3 r_{d}\\right) = 0.5 \\mathrm{~mA}(3 \\times 4.33 \\Omega) = 6.5 \\mathrm{mV}\n$$\n\nExercise: Repeat the above example if $R_{1}$ is reduced to $80 \\Omega$.\n\nDid you know?\n\nWhat would our life be like without diodes? Forget about cell phones, laptops, and digital cameras. We would not even have radios, TVs, GPS, radars, satellites, power plants, or long-distance telephone communication. And, of course, no Google or Facebook. In essence, we would return to the simple lifestyle of the early 1900s-which might not be that bad after all ...\n\nIn summary, the analysis of circuits containing diodes (and other nonlinear devices such as transistors) proceeds in three steps: (1) determine-perhaps with the aid of the constant-voltage model-the initial values of voltages and currents (before an input change is applied); (2) develop the small-signal model for each diode (i.e., calculate $r_{d}$ ); (3) replace each diode with its small-signal model and compute the effect of the input change."

Unlike a battery, the rectifier generates an output that fluctuates significantly with time and cannot supply power to electronic devices. Consequently, we must strive to produce a steady output.\n\nFortunately, a straightforward modification resolves this issue. As illustrated in Figure 3.30(a), the resistor is replaced with a capacitor. The operation of this circuit differs significantly from that of the rectifier discussed previously. Assuming a constant-voltage model for $D_{1}$ when forward-biased, we start with a zero initial condition across $C_{1}$ and analyze the circuit's behavior [Figure 3.30(b)]. As $V_{\\text {in }}$ increases from zero, $D_{1}$ is off until $V_{\\text {in }}$ exceeds $V_{D, \\text{on }}$, at which point $D_{1}$ begins to behave like a battery, and $V_{\\text {out }}$ equals $V_{\\text {in }}$ minus $V_{D, \\text{on }}$.

    "text": "Rephrased Text:\n\nConsider the rectifier circuit depicted in Fig. 3.10(b) and delve into its specifics. Specifically, we will deviate from the assumption that $D_{1}$ is ideal and instead utilize a constant-voltage model. As Fig. 3.28 illustrates, $V_{\\text {out }}$ remains at zero until $V_{\\text {in }}$ surpasses $V_{D, \\text { on }}$. At this juncture, $D_{1}$ activates, resulting in $V_{\\text {out }}=V_{\\text {in }}-V_{D, \\text { on }}$. When $V_{\\text {in }}$ is less than $V_{D, \\text { on }}$, $D_{1}$ is deactivated, and consequently, $V_{\\text {out }}=0$. Hence, the circuit continues to function as a rectifier, albeit generating a slightly reduced DC level.\n\nFigure 3.28 portrays a simple rectifier circuit, which includes a voltage source $Vin$, a diode $D1$, and a resistor $R1$. The circuit permits current flow solely when $Vin$ exceeds the diode's threshold voltage $VD,on$, thereby producing a rectified output voltage $Vout$.\n\nThe graph to the right of the image represents a time-domain waveform for a simple rectifier circuit. The horizontal axis is labeled as time $t$, while the vertical axis denotes voltage. The graph illustrates two waveforms: $V_{\\text{in}}$ and $V_{\\text{out}}$. $V_{\\text{in}}$ is a sinusoidal input voltage, depicted as a continuous wave oscillating above and below zero. $V_{\\text{out}}$ is the output voltage, which remains at zero until the input voltage surpasses the threshold voltage $V_{D, \\text{on}}$. At this point, the diode $D_1$ activates, and the output voltage follows the input voltage minus the diode's forward voltage $V_{D, \\text{on}}$. $V_{\\text{out}}$ is displayed as a clipped waveform, only allowing the positive half-cycles of $V_{\\text{in}}$ to pass through when $V_{\\text{in}} > V_{D, \\text{on}}$. The graph exemplifies the rectifying behavior of the circuit, which blocks the negative half-cycles and allows the positive ones, reduced by $V_{D, \\text{on}}$, to appear at the output.\n\nFigure 3.28: Simple rectifier.\n\nIf $V_{i n}<0$, $D_{1}$ carries a small leakage current, but the effect is negligible.\n\nProve that the circuit depicted in Fig. 3.29(a) is also a rectifier.\n\nFigure 3.29: Rectification of positive cycles.\n\nIn this scenario, $D_{1}$ remains activated for negative values of $V_{i n}$, specifically, for $V_{i n} \\leq-V_{D, o n}$. As $V_{\\text {in }}$ exceeds $-V_{D, \\text { on }}$, $D_{1}$ deactivates, allowing $R_{2}$ to maintain $V_{\\text {out }}=0$. As depicted in Fig. 3.29, the resulting output reveals that this circuit is also a rectifier, but it blocks the positive cycles.\n\nExercise: Plot the output if $D_{1}$ is an ideal diode.\n\nReferred to as a \"half-wave rectifier,\" the circuit of Fig. 3.28 does not produce a useful output. Unlike a battery, the rectifier generates an output that varies considerably with time and cannot supply power to electronic devices. We must therefore attempt to create a constant output.\n\nFortunately, a simple modification solves the problem. As depicted in Fig. 3.30(a), the resistor is replaced with a capacitor. The operation of this circuit differs significantly from that of the aforementioned rectifier. Assuming a constant-voltage model for $D_{1}$ in forward bias, we commence with a zero initial condition across $C_{1}$ and examine the behavior of the circuit [Fig. 3.30(b)]. As $V_{\\text {in }}$ ascends from zero, $D_{1}$ is deactivated until $V_{i n}>V_{D, o n}$, at which point $D_{1}$ begins to act as a battery and $V_{\\text {out }}=V_{\\text {in }}-V_{D, \\text { on }}$. Thus, $V_{\\text {out }}$ reaches a peak value of $V_{p}-V_{D, \\text { on }}$. What happens as $V_{\\text {in }}$ passes its peak value?\n\nAt $t=t_{1}$, we have $V_{\\text {in }}=V_{p}$ and $V_{\\text {out }}=V_{p}-V_{D, o n}$. As $V_{\\text {in }}$ begins to decline, $V_{\\text {out }}$ must remain constant. This is because if $V_{\\text {out }}$ were to decline, then $C_{1}$ would need to be discharged by a current flowing from its top plate through the cathode of $D_{1}$, which is impossible. ${ }^{12}$ The diode therefore turns off after $t_{1}$. At $t=t_{2}$, $V_{\\text {in }}=V_{p}-V_{D, \\text { on }}=V_{\\text {out }}$, i.e., the diode sustains a zero voltage difference. At $t>t_{2}$, $V_{\\text {in }}<V_{\\text {out }}$ and the diode experiences a negative voltage.\n\nContinuing our analysis, we note that at $t=t_{3}$, $V_{\\text {in }}=-V_{p}$, applying a maximum reverse bias of $V_{\\text {out }}-V_{\\text {in }}=2 V_{p}-V_{D, \\text { on }}$ across the diode. For this reason, diodes used in rectifiers must withstand a reverse voltage of approximately $2 V_{p}$ with no breakdown.\n\nDoes $V_{\\text {out }}$ change after $t=t_{1}$ ? Let us consider $t=t_{4}$ as a potentially interesting point. Here, $V_{\\text {in }}$ just exceeds $V_{\\text {out }}$ but still cannot turn $D_{1}$ on. At $t=t_{5}$, $V_{\\text {in }}=V_{p}=V_{\\text {out }}+V_{D, \\text { on }}$, and $D_{1}$ is on, but $V_{\\text {out }}$ exhibits no tendency to change because the situation is identical to that at $t=t_{1}$. In other words, $V_{\\text {out }}$ remains equal to $V_{p}-V_{D, \\text { on }}$ indefinitely.\n\nExample: Assuming an ideal diode model, (a) Repeat the above analysis. (b) Plot the voltage across $D_{1}$, $V_{D 1}$, as a function of time.\n\nSolution: (a) With a zero initial condition across $C_{1}$, $D_{1}$ turns on as $V_{\\text {in }}$ exceeds zero and $V_{\\text {out }}=V_{\\text {in }}$. After $t=t_{1}$, $V_{\\text {in }}$ falls below $V_{\\text {out }}$, turning $D_{1}$ off. Figure 3.31(a) shows the input and output waveforms.\n\nFigure 3.31(a): Input and output waveforms of the circuit in Fig. 3.30 with an ideal diode.\n\n(b) The voltage across the diode is $V_{D 1}=V_{\\text {in }}-V_{\\text {out }}$. Using the plots in Fig. 3.31(a), we readily arrive at the waveform in Fig. 3.31(b). Interestingly, $V_{D 1}$ is similar to $V_{i n}$ but with the average value shifted from zero to $-V_{p}$. We will exploit this result in the design of voltage doublers (Section 3.5.4).\n\nExercise: Repeat the above example if the terminals of the diode are swapped.\n\nThe circuit of Fig. 3.30(a) achieves the properties required of an \"ac-dc converter,\" generating a constant output equal to the peak value of the input sinusoid. ${ }^{13}$ But how is the value of $C_{1}$ chosen? To answer this question, we consider a more realistic application where this circuit must provide a current to a load.\n\nExample: A laptop computer consumes an average power of 25 W with a supply voltage of 3.3 V.\n\nDetermine the average current drawn from the batteries or the adaptor.\n\nSolution: Since $P=V \\cdot I$, we have $I \\approx 7.58 \\mathrm{~A}$. If the laptop is modeled by a resistor, $R_{L}$, then $R_{L}=V / I=0.436 \\Omega$.\n\nExercise: What power dissipation does a 1- $\\Omega$ load represent for such a supply voltage?\n\nAs suggested by the above example, the load can be represented by a simple resistor in some cases [Fig. 3.32(a)]. We must therefore repeat our analysis with $R_{L}$ present. From the waveforms in Fig. 3.32(b), we recognize that $V_{\\text {out }}$ behaves as before until $t=t_{1}$, still exhibiting a value of $V_{\\text {in }}-V_{D, o n}=V_{p}-V_{D, o n}$ if the diode voltage is assumed relatively constant. However, as $V_{\\text {in }}$ begins to fall after $t=t_{1}$, so does $V_{\\text {out }}$ because $R_{L}$ provides a discharge path for $C_{1}$. Of course, since changes in $V_{\\text {out }}$ are undesirable, $C_{1}$ must be so large that the current drawn by $R_{L}$ does not reduce $V_{\\text {out }}$ significantly. With such a choice of $C_{1}$, $V_{\\text {out }}$ falls slowly and $D_{1}$ remains reverse biased.\n\nThe output voltage continues to decrease while $V_{i n}$ goes through a negative excursion and returns to positive values. At some point, $t=t_{2}$, $V_{\\text {in }}$ and $V_{\\text {out }}$ become equal and slightly later, at $t=t_{3}$, $V_{\\text {in }}$ exceeds $V_{\\text {out }}$ by $V_{D, o n}$, thereby turning $D_{1}$ on and forcing $V_{\\text {out }}=V_{\\text {in }}-V_{D, \\text { on }}$. Hereafter, the circuit behaves as in the first cycle. The resulting variation in $V_{\\text {out }}$ is called the \"ripple.\" Also, $C_{1}$ is called the \"smoothing\" or \"filter\" capacitor.\n\nSketch the output waveform of Fig. 3.32 as $C_{1}$ varies from very large values to very small values.\n\nSolution: If $C_{1}$ is very large, the current drawn by $R_{L}$ when $D_{1}$ is off creates only a small change in $V_{\\text {out }}$. Conversely, if $C_{1}$ is very small, the circuit approaches that in Fig. 3.28, exhibiting large variations in $V_{\\text {out }}$. Figure 3.33 illustrates several cases.\n\nFigure 3.33: Output waveform of rectifier for different values of smoothing capacitor.\n\nExercise: Repeat the above example for different values of $R_{L}$ with $C_{1}$ constant.\n\nRipple Amplitude: In typical applications, the (peak-to-peak) amplitude of the ripple, $V_{R}$, in Fig. 3.32(b) must remain below 5 to $10 \\%$ of the input peak voltage. If the maximum current drawn by the load is known, the value of $C_{1}$ is chosen large enough to yield an acceptable ripple. To this end, we must compute $V_{R}$ analytically (Fig. 3.34). Since $V_{\\text {out }}=V_{p}-V_{D, \\text { on }}$ at $t=t_{1}$, the discharge of $C_{1}$ through $R_{L}$ can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {out }}(t)=\\left(V_{p}-V_{D, \\text { on }}\\right) \\exp \\frac{-t}{R_{L} C_{1}} \\quad 0 \\leq t \\leq t_{3} \\tag{3.75}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere we have chosen $t_{1}=0$ for simplicity. To ensure a small ripple, $R_{L} C_{1}$ must be much greater than $t_{3}-t_{1}$; thus, noting that $\\exp (-\\epsilon) \\approx 1-\\epsilon$ for $\\epsilon \\ll 1$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{\\text {out }}(t) \\approx & \\left(V_{p}-V_{D, \\text { on }}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{t}{R_{L} C_{1}}\\right)  \\tag{3.76}\\\\\n& \\approx\\left(V_{p}-V_{D, \\text { on }}\\right)-\\frac{V_{p}-V_{D, \\text { on }}}{R_{L}} \\cdot \\frac{t}{C_{1}} \\tag{3.77}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe first term on the right-hand side represents the initial condition across $C_{1}$ and the second term, a falling ramp-as if a constant current equal to $\\left(V_{p}-V_{D, o n}\\right) / R_{L}$ discharges $C_{1}{ }^{14}$ This result should not come as a surprise because the nearly constant voltage across $R_{L}$ results in a relatively constant current equal to $\\left(V_{p}-V_{D, \\text { on }}\\right) / R_{L}$.\n\nThe peak-to-peak amplitude of the ripple is equal to the amount of discharge at $t=t_{3}$. Since $t_{4}-t_{3}$ is equal to the input period, $T_{i n}$, we write $t_{3}-t_{1}=T_{\\text {in }}-\\Delta T$, where $\\Delta T\\left(=t_{4}-t_{3}\\right)$ denotes the time during which $D_{1}$ is on. Thus,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{R}=\\frac{V_{p}-V_{D . m}}{R_{L}} \\frac{T_{n-n}-\\Delta T}{C_{1}} \\tag{3.78}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nRecognizing that if $C_{1}$ discharges by a small amount, then the diode turns on for only a brief period, we can assume $\\Delta T \\ll T_{i n}$ and hence\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{R} & \\approx \\frac{V_{p}-V_{D . m}}{R_{L}} \\cdot \\frac{T_{i}}{C_{1}}  \\tag{3.79}\\\\\n& \\approx \\frac{V_{p}-V_{D, \\text { em }}}{R_{L} C_{1} f_{m}} \\tag{3.80}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere $f_{\\text {in }}=T_{\\text {in }}^{-1}$.\n\nExample: A transformer converts the $110-\\mathrm{V}, 60-\\mathrm{Hz}$ line voltage to a peak-to-peak swing of 9 V. A half-wave rectifier follows the transformer to supply the power to the laptop computer of Example 3.25. Determine the minimum value of the filter capacitor that maintains the ripple below 0.1 V. Assume $V_{D . . . m}=0.8 \\mathrm{~V}$.\n\nSolution: We have $V_{p}=4.5 \\mathrm{~V}, R_{L}=0.436 \\Omega$, and $T_{\\text {in }}=16.7 \\mathrm{~ms}$. Thus,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nC_{1} & =\\frac{V_{p}-V_{D, a n}}{V_{R}} \\cdot \\frac{T_{\\text {k }}}{R_{L}}  \\tag{3.81}\\\\\n& =1.417 \\mathrm{~F} . \\tag{3.82}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis is a very large value. The designer must trade the ripple amplitude with the size, weight, and cost of the capacitor. In fact, limitations on size, weight, and cost of the adaptor may dictate a much greater ripple, e.g., 0.5 V, thereby demanding that the circuit following the rectifier tolerate such a large, periodic variation.\n\nExercise: Repeat the above example for $220-\\mathrm{V}, 50-\\mathrm{Hz}$ line voltage, assuming the transformer still produces a peak-to-peak swing of 9 V. Which mains frequency gives a more desirable choice of $C_{1}$?\n\nIn many cases, the current drawn by the load is known. Repeating the above analysis with the load represented by a constant current source or simply viewing $\\left(V_{p}-V_{D, o n}\\right) / R_{L}$ in Eq. (3.80) as the load current, $I_{L}$, we can write\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{R}=\\frac{I_{L}}{C_{1} f_{i n}} \\tag{3.83}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nDiode Peak Current: We noted in Fig. 3.30(b) that the diode must exhibit a reverse breakdown voltage of at least $2 \\mathrm{~V}_{p}$. Another important parameter of the diode is the maximum forward bias current that it must tolerate. For a given junction doping profile and geometry, if the current exceeds a certain limit, the power dissipated in the diode $\\left(=V_{D} I"

    "text": "---[Rephrased Text]---\nReturning to the analysis of the rectifier circuit depicted in Fig. 3.10(b), we delve into a more detailed examination, particularly considering that the diode $D_1$ is no longer ideal but is modeled with a constant voltage. As depicted in Fig. 3.28, the output voltage $V_{\\text{out}}$ stays at zero until the input voltage $V_{\\text{in}}$ surpasses the diode's threshold voltage $V_{D, \\text{on}}$. At this juncture, $D_1$ activates, and the output voltage becomes $V_{\\text{in}} - V_{D, \\text{on}}$. When $V_{\\text{in}}$ is less than $V_{D, \\text{on}}$, the diode is non-conducting, and the output remains at zero. Consequently, the circuit functions as a rectifier but generates a slightly lower DC level.\n\nIn the depicted circuit of Fig. 3.28, the input voltage $V_{\\text{in}}$ is connected to a voltage source, while the diode $D_1$ and resistor $R_1$ configure a simple rectifier. The circuit permits current flow exclusively when $V_{\\text{in}}$ exceeds the diode's threshold voltage $V_{D, \\text{on}}$, resulting in a rectified output voltage $V_{\\text{out}}$.\n\nThe graph to the right of the image portrays a time-domain waveform for the simple rectifier.

    "text": "To ensure the output voltage of the rectifier remains stable, it is essential to select an appropriate smoothing capacitor. The size of the capacitor influences the output ripple, which is the fluctuation in voltage that occurs due to the charging and discharging of the capacitor. The ripple voltage is a critical factor because it affects the performance of electronic devices connected to the rectifier's output.\n\nFor a full-wave rectifier, the ripple voltage can be approximated by the formula:\n\n$$\nV_{R} = \\frac{I_{L}}{2 C_{1} f_{i n}}\n$$\n\nHere, \\(I_{L}\\) is the load current, \\(C_{1}\\) is the capacit capacitor, and \\(f_{i n}\\) is the frequency of the input voltage. To minimize the ripple, the value of \\(C_{1}\\) must be sufficiently large.\n\nIn the given example, we aim to design a full-wave rectifier that delivers 2 W of average power to a cellphone with a voltage of 3.6 V and a ripple of 0.2 V. First, we calculate the required peak input voltage:\n\n$$\nV_{i n, p} = 3.6 \\mathrm{~V} + 2 V_{D, o n} \\approx 5.2 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nThis ensures that the output voltage, after accounting for the diode's forward voltage drop (\\(V_{D, o n}\\)), is sufficient to power the cellphone.\n\nNext, we determine the minimum value of the smoothing capacitor needed to maintain the ripple below 0.2 V. Using the formula for the ripple voltage, we can rearrange it to solve for \\(C_{1}\\):\n\n$$\nC_{1} = \\frac{I_{L}}{2 V_{R} f_{i n}}\n$$\n\nGiven \\(I_{L} = \\frac{2 \\mathrm{~W}}{3.6 \\mathrm{~V}}\\) and \\(f_{i n} = 60 \\mathrm{~Hz}\\), we find:\n\n$$\nC_{1} = 23,000 \\mu \\mathrm{~F}\n$$\n\nThis indicates that a rather large capacitor is necessary to achieve the desired low ripple. However, in practical applications, size and cost constraints may limit the capacitor size, necessitating a trade-off between ripple amplitude and capacitor size.\n\nThe diodes in the full-wave rectifier must also be able to withstand a reverse bias voltage equal to the peak input voltage, which in this case is approximately 5.2 V.\n\nFor the exercise, if the smoothing capacitor's value is limited to \\(1000 \\mu \\mathrm{~F}\\), we would need to calculate the maximum allowable power drain to maintain the ripple below an acceptable level. This would involve solving the ripple voltage formula for \\(I_{L}\\) and ensuring the power delivered to the load does not exceed the calculated current.\n\nLastly, for very small amplitude signals, such as a 10 mV peak swing in a radio frequency signal, traditional rectifiers may not be suitable due to the diode's inability to effectively switch at such low voltages. In such cases, precision rectification techniques are employed, which are discussed in later chapters. Adding a constant voltage of 0.8 V to the signal could potentially offset the issue by ensuring the diode operates within its forward voltage range, allowing the rectification to occur."

    "text": "Let's delve deeper into the rectifier circuit depicted in Fig. 3.10(b), this time considering a constant-voltage model for diode $D_1$. As depicted in Fig. 3.28, the output voltage $V_{\\text{out}}$ remains at zero until the input voltage $V_{\\text{in}}$ surpasses the diode's turn-on voltage $V_{D, \\text{on}}$. At this juncture, $D_1$ activates, resulting in an output voltage of $V_{\\text{out}} = V_{\\text{in}} - V_{D, \\text{on}}$. For input voltages below $V_{D, \\text{on}}$, $D_1$ is inactive, and thus $V_{\\text{out}} = 0$. Consequently, while the circuit continues to function as a rectifier, it generates a slightly lower DC output level.\n\nThe graphical representation in Figure 3.28 shows a simple rectifier circuit composed of a voltage source $Vin$, a diode $D1$, and a resistor $R1$. The circuit allows current to flow solely when $Vin$ exceeds the diode's threshold voltage $V_{D,on}$, thereby producing a rectified output voltage $Vout$.\n\nIn the waveform graph to the right of the image, the behavior of a simple rectifier circuit over time is depicted. The horizontal axis is marked as time $t$, while the vertical axis denotes voltage. Two waveforms are illustrated: $V_{\\text{in}}$ and $V_{\\text{out}}$. $V_{\\text{in}}$ is depicted as a sinusoidal input voltage, continuously oscillating above and below zero. $V_{\\text{out}}$ represents the output voltage, which is zero until the input voltage surpasses the threshold voltage $V_{D, \\text{on}}$. When this occurs, diode $D_1$ activates, and the output voltage follows the input voltage minus the diode's forward voltage $V_{D, \\text{on}}$. $V_{\\text{out}}$ appears as a clipped waveform, allowing only the positive half-cycles of $V_{\\text{in}}$ to pass through when $V_{\\text{in}} > V_{D, \\text{on}}$. This graph exemplifies the rectifying action of the circuit, which blocks the negative half-cycles and allows the positive ones, reduced by $V_{D, \\text{on}}$, to appear at the output.\n\nThe graph in Figure 3.29(a) illustrates the rectification of positive cycles in a circuit using a diode. This is a time-domain waveform graph, where the x-axis represents time (usually in seconds or milliseconds) and the y-axis represents voltage (in volts). The input waveform is a sinusoidal signal, exhibiting both positive and negative half-cycles. However, the output waveform only shows the positive half-cycles, indicating that the negative half-cycles have been blocked by the rectifier. The positive half-cycles of the input waveform are allowed to pass through the rectifier, but they are slightly reduced in amplitude by the diode's forward voltage drop (denoted as $V_{D, \\text{on}}$). The output waveform's amplitude is slightly less than the input due to the diode's forward voltage drop. This graph effectively demonstrates the basic operation of a rectifier circuit, which allows only the positive portion of an AC signal to pass through while blocking the negative portion.\n\nIn the circuit shown in Figure 3.29(a), $D_1$ remains on for negative values of $V_{\\text{in}}$, specifically, for $V_{\\text{in}} \\leq -V_{D, \\text{on}}$. As $V_{\\text{in}}$ exceeds $-V_{D, \\text{on}}$, $D_1$ turns off, allowing $R_2$ to maintain $V_{\\text{out}} = 0$. Depicted in Fig. 3.29, the resulting output reveals that this circuit is also a rectifier, but it blocks the positive cycles.\n\nThe circuit in Figure 3.30(b) depicts the input and output waveforms of a diode-capacitor rectifier circuit. The x-axis represents time $t$, while the y-axis represents voltage. The graph is in the time domain, showing the behavior of the input voltage $V_{\\text{in}}$ and the output voltage $V_{\\text{out}}$ over time. At time $t_1$, $V_{\\text{in}}$ reaches its peak $V_p$, and $V_{\\text{out}} = V_p - V_{D, \\text{on}}$. As $V_{\\text{in}}$ begins to fall, $V_{\\text{out}}$ must remain constant. This is because if $V_{\\text{out}}$ were to fall, then $C_1$ would need to be discharged by a current flowing from its top plate through the cathode of $D_1$, which is impossible. The diode therefore turns off after $t_1$. At $t = t_2$, $V_{\\text{in}} = V_p - V_{D, \\text{on}} = V_{\\text{out}}$, i.e., the diode sustains a zero voltage difference. At $t > t_2$, $V_{\\text{in}} < V_{\\text{out}}$ and the diode experiences a negative voltage. Continuing our analysis, we note that at $t = t_3$, $V_{\\text{in}} = -V_p$, applying a maximum reverse bias of $V_{\\text{out}} - V_{\\text{in}} = 2 V_p - V_{D, \\text{on}}$ across the diode. For this reason, diodes used in rectifiers must withstand a reverse voltage of approximately $2 V_p$ with no breakdown.\n\nDoes $V_{\\text{out}}$ change after $t = t_1$? Let us consider $t = t_4$ as a potentially interesting point. Here, $V_{\\text{in}}$ just exceeds $V_{\\text{out}}$ but still cannot turn $D_1$ on. At $t = t_5$, $V_{\\text{in}} = V_p = V_{\\text{out}} + V_{D, \\text{on}}$, and $D_1$ is on, but $V_{\\text{out}}$ exhibits no tendency to change because the situation is identical to that at $t = t_1$. In other words, $V_{\\text{out}}$ remains equal to $V_p - V_{D, \\text{on}}$ indefinitely.\n\nThe graph in Figure 3.31(a) shows the input and output waveforms of the circuit in Fig. 3.30 with an ideal diode. The horizontal axis represents time $t$, though no specific units are provided, it's typically in seconds or milliseconds. The vertical axis represents voltage, with the input voltage $V_{in}$ and output voltage $V_{out}$ labeled. The input voltage $V_{in}$ is shown as a dashed sinusoidal waveform, indicating a periodic signal with both positive and negative cycles. The output voltage $V_{out}$ is shown as a solid line that initially follows the input voltage until a certain point $t_1$, after which it remains constant. At time $t_1$, the input voltage $V_{in}$ begins to drop below the output voltage $V_{out}$, causing the diode to turn off and the output to remain constant. The output voltage $V_{out}$ appears to maintain a constant value equal to the peak of the input voltage before $t_1$.\n\nThe graph represents the voltage across a diode, denoted as $V_{D1}$, plotted against time $t$. This is a time-domain waveform showing the behavior of the diode voltage in relation to the input voltage. The horizontal axis represents time $t$, with no specific units or scale provided. The vertical axis represents the diode voltage $V_{D1}$. The waveform resembles a sinusoidal pattern that is shifted downward. It oscillates around a baseline that is below zero. The waveform starts at a maximum negative value and rises to a peak before descending again, repeating this cycle. The waveform has a distinct baseline at $-2V_p$, indicating that the average value of $V_{D1}$ is shifted by $-V_p$ from zero. The time $t_1$ is marked on the graph, indicating a significant point in time where a transition occurs. The waveform is periodic, suggesting a regular oscillation pattern.\n\nThe graph in Figure 3.32(b) illustrates the behavior of both input voltage (Vin) and output voltage (Vout) over time in a rectifier circuit driving a resistive load. The horizontal axis represents time (t), though specific units are not provided, it is typically in seconds or milliseconds in such contexts. The vertical axis represents voltage, typically in volts (V). The input voltage (Vin) is shown as a sinusoidal waveform, indicating it is alternating in nature. The output voltage (Vout) follows the input voltage initially but maintains a more constant value after peaking, before gradually decreasing. The waveform shows that Vout initially rises with Vin, reaching a peak and then slowly declining as Vin goes negative.\n\nThe graph in Figure 3.33 illustrates the output voltage, $V_{out}$, of a rectifier circuit for different values of the smoothing capacitor, $C_1$. The x-axis represents time $t$, while the y-axis represents voltage. The input voltage $V_{in}$ is shown as a reference waveform, which is a sinusoidal wave. For very small $C_1$, the output waveform closely follows the input sinusoidal waveform, indicating large variations in $V_{out}$ and high ripple amplitude. This is because the small capacitor cannot store enough charge to smooth out the variations effectively. For small $C_1$, the output waveform shows reduced ripple compared to the very small $C_1$ case. The peaks are smoother, but there is still noticeable variation in $V_{out}$. For large $C_1$, the output waveform is significantly smoothed out, with minimal ripple. The waveform maintains a more constant DC level with only slight variations, indicating that the large capacitor effectively smooths the output voltage.\n\nThe graph in Figure 3.34 illustrates the ripple voltage at the output of a rectifier circuit. It is a time-domain waveform that shows how the output voltage (Vout) varies over time (t), following the rectification of an AC input voltage (Vin). The horizontal axis represents time (t), though specific units are not provided, it is typically in seconds or milliseconds for such circuits. The vertical axis represents voltage, with significant levels marked as $V_p$ (peak voltage), $V_{p} - V_{D,on}$ (peak voltage minus diode forward voltage), and $V_R$ (voltage ripple). The graph shows a waveform that starts at a peak voltage $V_p$ and then decreases linearly, representing the discharge of the capacitor over time. The waveform exhibits a ripple characteristic after each peak, indicating the voltage drop as the capacitor discharges through the load resistor. The waveform then rises again as the input AC voltage reaches its next peak, with the cycle repeating.\n\nThe graph in Figure 3.35 illustrates the behavior of a rectifier circuit, specifically focusing on the input and output voltage waveforms over time. The horizontal axis represents time (t), though specific units are not provided. The vertical axis represents voltage, with key values indicated as $V_p$ (peak voltage) and $V_R$ (reference voltage). The input voltage $V_{in}$ is a sinusoidal waveform, shown in gray, with peaks reaching $V_p$. The output voltage $V_{out}$, shown in black, follows the input but is clipped and shifted, maintaining a more constant level after the peak of $V_{in}$. The waveform indicates the charging and discharging behavior typical of a rectifier circuit with a smoothing capacitor $C_1$.\n\nThe graph in Figure 3.36(a) depicts the input and output waveforms of a full-wave rectifier. It is a time-domain waveform graph. The horizontal axis represents time $t$, though no specific units are given. It is assumed to be in seconds or milliseconds, typical for such graphs. The vertical axes represent the input voltage $x(t)$ and the output voltage $y(t)$. The input waveform $x(t)$ is a sinusoidal wave, alternating between positive and negative peaks symmetrically around the horizontal axis. The output waveform $y(t)$ is a series of positive half-sine waves. Each negative half-cycle of the input is inverted to become positive, resulting in a waveform that is entirely above the horizontal axis.\n\nThe graph in Figure 3.36(b) represents the input/output characteristic of a full-wave rectifier. This graph is composed of two parts: a plot on the left showing the relationship between input voltage $V_{in}$ and output voltage $V_{out}$, and a time-domain waveform on the right showing $V_{out}$ over time $t$. The graph on the left is a piecewise linear function showing the input/output characteristic of a full-wave rectifier. The graph on the right is a time-domain waveform illustrating the output voltage over time. The input/output characteristic is V-shaped, indicating that the output voltage mirrors the absolute value of the input voltage. This behavior is typical of a full-wave rectifier, which inverts negative input voltages to positive outputs. The waveform shows a series of positive half-cycles, repeating periodically. This reflects the full-wave rectification process where both halves of the input AC signal are converted to positive output cycles.\n\nThe graph in Figure 3.39 represents the input/output characteristic of a full-wave rectifier with nonideal diodes. It consists of two parts: a Vout vs. Vin plot and a Vout vs. time plot. The Vout vs. Vin plot has the horizontal axis labeled as Vin, representing the input voltage, while the vertical axis is labeled as Vout, representing the output voltage. The units are typically in volts, though not explicitly mentioned. The graph shows a piecewise linear characteristic. For input voltages \\(|Vin| < 2VD,on\\), the output voltage remains at zero. Once the input voltage exceeds \\(2VD,on\\) in magnitude, the output starts to track the input with a slope of unity. This means that for \\(Vin > 2VD,on\\), Vout = Vin - 2VD,on, and similarly for \\(Vin < -2VD,on\\). The Vout vs. time plot shows the typical output waveform of a full-wave rectifier, which consists of a series of arches or humps. This indicates that the output voltage is always positive and follows the absolute value of the input waveform.\n\nThe graph titled \"Ripple in full-wave rectifier\" is a time-domain waveform representation of the input and output voltages of a full-wave rectifier circuit. The horizontal axis represents time (t), although specific units are not provided. The vertical axis represents voltage, with the input voltage ($V_{in}$) and output voltage ($V_{out}$) shown. No units are specified, but it is typically in volts. The input voltage ($V_{in}$) is depicted as a sinusoidal waveform, illustrating an alternating current (AC) signal. The output voltage ($V_{out}$) is shown as a series of positive half-cycles, indicating the rectification process. The waveform is smoother compared to a half-wave rectifier, but it still contains some ripple.\n\nThe graph in Figure 3.41 represents the currents carried by diodes in a full-wave rectifier circuit. It consists of two main waveforms. The top waveform (Input Voltage, $V_{in}$) is a time-domain waveform. The horizontal axis represents time ($t$). The vertical axis represents input voltage ($V_{in}$). The waveform is sinusoidal, representing the alternating input voltage. It has a positive peak followed by a negative peak, indicating a full cycle of AC voltage. The middle waveform ($I_{D1} = I_{D2}$) is a time-domain waveform representing diode currents. The horizontal axis represents time ($t$). The vertical axis represents the current through diodes $D1$ and $D2$ ($I_{D1} = I_{D2}$). The waveform shows a half-sinusoidal shape corresponding to the positive half-cycle of the input voltage. The current is zero during the negative half-cycle. The bottom waveform ($I_{D3} = I_{D4}$) is a time-domain waveform representing diode currents. The horizontal axis represents time ($t$). The vertical axis represents the current through diodes $D3$ and $D4$ ($I_{D3} = I_{D4}$). The waveform shows a half-sinusoidal shape corresponding to the negative half-cycle of the input voltage. The current is zero during the positive half-cycle.\n\nThe diagram in Figure 3.42 illustrates a full-wave rectifier circuit and its corresponding input and output waveforms. The horizontal axis represents time \\(t\\), though no specific units are provided. The vertical axis represents voltage, with \\(V_{in}\\) and \\(V_{out}\\) as the key variables. The input voltage \\(V_{in}\\) is shown as a sinusoidal waveform. The output voltage \\(V_{out}\\) follows a rectified waveform, where the negative portions of the input waveform are flipped to the positive side, typical of full-wave rectification. The output waveform has a slightly lower amplitude than the input waveform, indicating voltage drop across the diode. The circuit diagram includes a diode \\(D_1\\), a capacitor \\(C_1\\), and a load resistor \\(R_L\\), which are standard components in rectification circuits. The output voltage is approximately \\(V_p - V_{D,on}\\), where \\(V_p\\) is the peak input voltage and \\(V_{D,on}\\) is the diode's forward voltage drop. The reverse bias voltage is approximately \\(2V_p\\), indicating the voltage stress on the diode during reverse bias conditions. The graph does not provide specific numerical values but indicates the relationship between input and output voltages qualitatively. The labels and annotations highlight the key components and voltage levels in the circuit, providing insight into the rectification process."

    "text": "The adapter circuit discussed previously often proves insufficient. Due to substantial fluctuations in line voltage, the peak amplitude generated by the transformer—and consequently the DC output—can vary significantly, potentially surpassing the maximum tolerance level of the load (such as a cellphone). Additionally, the ripple can become notably problematic in various applications. For instance, if the adapter powers a stereo, the 120-Hz ripple may be audible through the speakers. Moreover, the transformer's finite output impedance causes variations in \\( V_{\\text{out}} \\) when the load current changes. For these reasons, the circuit in Fig. 3.40(a) is frequently supplemented with a \"voltage regulator\" to ensure a consistent output.\n\nWe have previously encountered a voltage regulator without explicitly labeling it as such: the circuit analyzed in Example 3.17 delivers a 2.4 V output, experiencing only an 11-mV change in output for a 100-mV variation in input. Consequently, we arrive at the circuit depicted in Fig. 3.43, which serves as a more adaptable adapter with a nominal output of \\( 3 V_{D, \\text{on}} \\approx 2.4 \\) V. However, as explored in Example 3.22, the output voltage varies with the load current.\n\n**Figure 3.43 Voltage regulator block diagram.**\n*This section can be skipped in a first reading.*\n\n**Figure (a)**\nThe circuit diagram (a) features a voltage regulator utilizing a Zener diode. It stabilizes the output voltage (Vout) by diverting current to ground through the Zener diode (D1) when the voltage surpasses a certain threshold. Resistor R1 limits the current through the diode. The input voltage is Vin, and the output voltage is Vout.\n\n**Figure (b)**\nThis diagram illustrates the small-signal equivalent circuit of a Zener diode regulator. It includes a resistor R1 connected between the input voltage Vin and the output voltage Vout, and a resistor rd connected between Vout and ground (GND). This configuration models the behavior of the Zener diode in voltage regulation scenarios.\n\n**Figure 3.44 (a) Regulator using a Zener diode, (b) small-signal equivalent of (a).**\n\n**Did you know?**\n\nWhile individual diodes in power supplies may not seem to have a significant carbon footprint, the cumulative power consumption of all diodes globally paints a startling picture.\n\nConsider, for example, Google's server farms. It is estimated that Google operates around half a million servers. If each server draws 200 W from a 12-V supply, then each rectifier diode carries an average current of \\( 200 \\text{ W} / 12 \\text{ V} / 2 \\approx 8.5 \\text{ A} \\). (Assuming two diodes alternately conduct, each handling half of the server's average current.) With a forward bias of approximately 0.7 V, two diodes consume 12 W, implying that the rectifier diodes in Google's servers dissipate a total power of roughly 6 MW. This is comparable to the power generated by about 10 nuclear power plants! Indeed, substantial efforts are currently directed towards \"green electronics\" to reduce the power consumption of every circuit, including the power supply itself. (Note: Our example is quite pessimistic, as computers typically use \"switching\" power supplies for improved efficiency.)\n\nFigure 3.44(a) presents another regulator circuit that employs a Zener diode. Operating in the reverse breakdown region, \\( D_1 \\) exhibits a small-signal resistance, \\( r_D \\), ranging from 1 to 10 Ω, thus providing a relatively stable output despite input variations if \\( r_D \\ll R_1 \\). This is evident from the small-signal model in Fig. 3.44(b):\n\n\\[ v_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{r_D}{r_D + R_1} v_{\\text{in}} \\tag{3.100} \\]\n\nFor example, if \\( r_D = 5 \\Omega \\) and \\( R_1 = 1 \\text{k} \\Omega \\), changes in \\( V_{\\text{in}} \\) are attenuated by approximately a factor of 200 as they appear in \\( V_{\\text{out}} \\). Nevertheless, the Zener regulator shares the same limitation as the circuit in Fig. 3.43, namely, poor stability under significant variations in load current.\n\nOur brief examination of regulators highlights two critical design aspects: the stability of the output relative to input variations, and the stability of the output concerning load current variations. The former is quantified by \"line regulation,\" defined as \\( \\Delta V_{\\text{out}} / \\Delta V_{\\text{in}} \\), and the latter by \"load regulation,\" defined as \\( \\Delta V_{\\text{out}} / \\Delta I_L \\).\n\n**Figure 3.45(a)**\nThe circuit is a voltage regulator using two diodes. D1 is forward-biased with a voltage drop \\( V_{D,\\text{on}} \\), and D2 is reverse-biased with a breakdown voltage \\( V_{Dz} \\). The output voltage Vout is stabilized by the diodes.\n\n(a)\n\n**Figure (b)**\nThis circuit is the small-signal equivalent of a voltage regulator using two diodes. It stabilizes the output voltage Vout using resistors rd1 and rd2.\n\n(b)\n\n**Figure (c)**\n\n**Figure 3.45 Circuit using two diodes, (b) small-signal equivalent, (c) load regulation.**\n\n**Solution**\nWe first determine the bias current of \\( D_1 \\) and its small-signal resistance:\n\n\\[ I_{D1} = \\frac{V_{in} - V_{D,\\text{on}} - V_{D2}}{R_1} = 15 \\text{ mA} \\tag{3.102} \\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[ r_{D1} = \\frac{V_T}{I_{D1}} = 1.73 \\Omega \\tag{3.104} \\]\n\nFrom the small-signal model in Fig. 3.44(b), we compute the line regulation as\n\n\\[ \\frac{v_{\\text{out}}}{v_{\\text{in}}} = \\frac{r_{D1} + r_{D2}}{r_{D1} + r_{D2} + R_1} = 0.063 \\tag{3.106} \\]\n\nFor load regulation, assuming a constant input and examining the impact of load current variations, we use the small-signal circuit in Fig. 3.45(c) (with \\( v_{in} = 0 \\) to represent a constant input):\n\n\\[ \\frac{v_{\\text{out}}}{(r_{D1} + r_{D2}) \\parallel R_1} = -i_L \\tag{3.107} \\]\n\nThat is,\n\n\\[ \\left| \\frac{v_{\\text{out}}}{i_L} \\right| = (r_{D1} + r_{D2}) \\parallel R_1 = 6.31 \\Omega \\tag{3.109} \\]\n\nThis indicates that a 1-mA change in load current results in a 6.31-mV change in output voltage.\n\n**Exercise**\nRepeat the above example for \\( R_1 = 50 \\Omega \\) and compare the results.\n\n**Figure 3.46 Summary of regulators**\nThe diagram illustrates three types of voltage regulator circuits with diodes, capacitors, and loads.

When the distance reduces from kilometers to hundreds of meters, the signal level can become large enough to saturate the circuits as it passes through the receiver chain. To prevent this, it is necessary to limit the signal amplitude at an appropriate point in the receiver.\n\nFigure 3.47 depicts two scenarios: one where the cellphone is far from the base station (a) and another where it is near (b). The diagram labeled \"(a)\" shows a simple communication system with a base station and a receiver. The base station, represented by a tower with a transmitting antenna, is responsible for sending signals. The receiver, consisting of an antenna and an amplifier, captures the incoming signals from the base station and boosts their strength for further processing.\n\nThe flow of information or control in this system involves the base station emitting radio frequency signals towards the receiver, which are then captured by the receiver's antenna and amplified. The receiver's primary function is to demonstrate the process of receiving signals from a distant base station, ensuring they are strong enough for subsequent use. This setup is typical in wireless communication systems where maintaining signal integrity over long distances is crucial.\n\nThe diagram labeled \"(b)\" also illustrates a communication system with a base station and a receiver. The base station, depicted as a tower with an antenna, serves as the origin point for signal transmission. The receiver, located near the base station, is represented with an antenna and a triangular block indicating an amplifier or signal processing unit.

This setup is essential for maintaining communication integrity as the distance between the base station and receiver changes.\n\nA limiting circuit is used to restrict the output voltage to a defined range. For small input levels, the circuit simply passes the input to the output (e.g., \\( V_{\\text {out }}=V_{\\text {in }} \\)). However, as the input level exceeds a threshold or limit, the output must remain constant. This behavior applies to both positive and negative inputs, resulting in an input/output characteristic shown in Figure 3.48(a). As illustrated in Figure 3.48(b), a signal applied to the input emerges at the output with its peak values clipped at \\( \\pm V_{L} \\).\n\nTo achieve this behavior, a circuit with nonlinear input/output characteristics is required, suggesting that one or more diodes must turn on or off as \\( V_{i n} \\) approaches \\( \\pm V_{L} \\). For example, a simple diode limiter circuit clips the input voltage at the diode's forward voltage, \\( V_{D,on} \\), limiting the output voltage to this level. The graphs illustrate the input/output characteristic and the response to a sinusoidal input.\n\nIn designing a limiting circuit, two conditions must be met. First, the limiting level, \\( V_{L} \\), must be an arbitrary voltage and not necessarily equal to \\( V_{D, o n} \\). This can be achieved by using a constant voltage source in series with the diode, shifting the limiting point. Second, the negative values of \\( V_{i n} \\) must also experience limiting. This can be accomplished by using two antiparallel diodes and inserting constant voltage sources in series with the diodes to shift the limiting points to arbitrary levels.\n\nAn example is provided to demonstrate how to design a limiting circuit with specific clipping levels. Assuming \\( V_{D, o n}=800 \\mathrm{mV} \\), the circuit must limit the signal at \\( \\pm 100 \\mathrm{mV} \\). This is achieved by using voltage sources in series with the diodes to shift the break points to the desired levels.\n\nBefore concluding, two observations are made. First, the circuits studied above display a nonzero slope in the limiting region (Figure 3.53) due to the nonideal behavior of diodes. However, this effect is typically negligible.

This setup is essential for maintaining communication integrity as the distance between the base station and receiver changes.\n\nFigure 3.47 Signals received (a) far from or (b) near a base station.\n\nHow should a limiting circuit behave? For small input levels, the circuit must simply pass the input to the output, e.g., $V_{\\text {out }}=V_{\\text {in }}$, and as the input level exceeds a \"threshold\" or \"limit,\" the output must remain constant. This behavior must hold for both positive and negative inputs, corresponding to the input/output characteristic shown in Fig. 3.48(a). As illustrated in Fig. 3.48(b), a signal applied to the input emerges at the output with its peak values \"clipped\" at $\\pm V_{L}$.\n\nWe now implement a circuit that exhibits the above behavior. The nonlinear input/ output characteristic suggests that one or more diodes must turn on or off as $V_{i n}$ approaches $\\pm V_{L}$. In fact, we have already seen simple examples in Figs. 3.11(b)and (c), where the positive half cycles of the input are clipped at 0 V and +1 V , respectively. We reexamine the former assuming a more realistic diode, e.g., the constant-voltage model. As illustrated in Fig. 3.49(a), $V_{\\text {out }}$ is equal to $V_{\\text {in }}$ for $V_{\\text {in }}<V_{D, \\text { on }}$ and equal to $V_{D, \\text { on }}$ thereafter.\n\nTo serve as a more general limiting circuit, the above topology must satisfy two other conditions. First, the limiting level, $V_{L}$, must be an arbitrary voltage and not necessarily equal to $V_{D, o n}$. Inspired by the circuit of Fig. 3.11 (c), we postulate that a constant voltage source in series with $D_{1}$ shifts the limiting point, accomplishing this objective. Depicted in Fig. 3.49(b), the resulting circuit limits at $V_{L}=V_{B 1}+V_{D, \\text { on }}$. Note that $V_{B 1}$ can be positive or negative to shift $V_{L}$ to higher or lower values, respectively.\n\nSecond, the negative values of $V_{i n}$ must also experience limiting. Beginning with the circuit of Fig. 3.49(a), we recognize that if the anode and cathode of $D_{1}$ are swapped, then the circuit limits at $V_{i n}=-V_{D, \\text { on }}$ [Fig. 3.50(a)]. Thus, as shown in Fig. 3.50(b), two \"antiparallel\" diodes can create a characteristic that limits at $\\pm V_{D, o n}$. Finally, inserting constant voltage sources in series with the diodes shifts the limiting points to arbitrary levels (Fig. 3.51).\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription: The graph labeled (a) depicts the input/output characteristic of a limiting circuit.

For input voltages greater than $+V_L$, the output voltage is constant at $+V_L$.\n\n**Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- **Limiting Levels:** The output voltage is limited to $-V_L$ and $+V_L$, indicating the presence of a limiting mechanism in the circuit.\n- **Transition Points:** The transition between linear and limiting behavior occurs at $V_{in} = -V_L$ and $V_{in} = +V_L$.\n\n**Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- The graph is annotated with $\\pm V_L$, marking the limiting levels on both the x-axis and y-axis, emphasizing the points where the limiter starts to clip the input signal.\n\nThis graph provides a clear visualization of how the limiter circuit restricts the output voltage to a defined range, regardless of further increases or decreases in the input voltage beyond the specified threshold levels.\nimage_name:(b)\ndescription: The graph labeled as (b) in Figure 3.48 illustrates the response of a limiting circuit to a sinusoidal input.

As shown in Fig. 3.48(b), a signal applied to the input will emerge at the output with its peak values \"clipped\" at \\( \\pm V_{L} \\).\n\nWe now construct a circuit that exhibits the above behavior. The nonlinear input/output characteristic suggests that one or more diodes must turn on or off as \\( V_{i n} \\) approaches \\( \\pm V_{L} \\). In fact, we have already seen simple examples in Figs. 3.11(b) and (c), where the positive half cycles of the input are clipped at 0 V and +1 V, respectively. We reexamine the former assuming a more realistic diode, such as the constant-voltage model. As shown in Fig. 3.49(a), \\( V_{\\text {out }} \\) is equal to \\( V_{\\text {in }} \\) for \\( V_{\\text {in }}<V_{D, \\text { on }} \\) and equal to \\( V_{D, \\text { on }} \\) thereafter.\n\nTo serve as a more general limiting circuit, the above topology must meet two other conditions. First, the limiting level, \\( V_{L} \\), must be an arbitrary voltage and not necessarily equal to \\( V_{D, o n} \\). Inspired by the circuit of Fig. 3.11 (c), we propose that a constant voltage source in series with \\( D_{1} \\) shifts the limiting point, achieving this objective. As depicted in Fig. 3.49(b), the resulting circuit limits at \\( V_{L}=V_{B 1}+V_{D, \\text { on }} \\). Note that \\( V_{B 1} \\) can be positive or negative to shift \\( V_{L} \\) to higher or lower values, respectively.\n\nSecond, the negative values of \\( V_{i n} \\) must also experience limiting. Starting with the circuit of Fig. 3.49(a), we recognize that if the anode and cathode of \\( D_{1} \\) are swapped, then the circuit limits at \\( V_{i n}=-V_{D, \\text { on }} \\) [Fig. 3.50(a)].

This can be accomplished by using two antiparallel diodes, creating a characteristic that limits at both positive and negative diode forward voltages. Adding constant voltage sources in series with the diodes allows shifting the limiting points to arbitrary levels.\n\nAn example of a limiting circuit is one that must limit the signal at ±100 mV. Assuming a diode forward voltage of 800 mV, the circuit requires voltage sources in series with the diodes to shift the break points. The positive limiting point is shifted to the left by a negative voltage source, and the negative limiting point is shifted to the right by a positive voltage source.\n\nIn conclusion, limiting circuits are essential for managing signal levels in wireless communication systems. They ensure that signals are captured and amplified effectively, maintaining signal integrity over varying distances. The behavior of these circuits is crucial for preventing saturation and ensuring proper signal processing."

Nevertheless, the complexity of designing certain circuits can be significantly reduced if they operate from a higher supply voltage, like 6 V.

Initially, to charge one plate of a capacitor to $+Q$, the opposing plate must be charged to $-Q$. Thus, in the circuit depicted in Fig. 3.54(a), the voltage across $C_{1}$ remains constant despite changes in $V_{i n}$, since the right plate of $C_{1}$ cannot acquire or release charge $(Q=C V)$.

If $V_{i n}$ becomes more positive, the left plate of $C_{1}$ acquires positive charge from $V_{i n}$, necessitating that the right plate absorb an equivalent negative charge from the top plate of $C_{2}$. As the top plate of $C_{2}$ loses negative charge, it effectively gains more positive charge, causing the bottom plate to absorb negative charge from ground. It is important to note that all four plates experience an equal exchange of charge due to $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ being in series.

Consequently, $D_{1}$ turns on, forcing $V_{\\text {out }}=0 .{ }^{18}$ As the input rises toward $V_{p}$, the voltage across $C_{1}$ remains equal to $V_{i n}$ because its right plate is \"pinned\" at zero by $D_{1}$. After $t=t_{1}$, $V_{\\text {in }}$ begins to fall and tends to discharge $C_{1}$, i.e., draw positive charge from the left plate and hence from $D_{1}$. The diode therefore turns off, reducing the circuit to that in Fig. 3.54(a). From this time, the output simply tracks the changes in the input while $C_{1}$ sustains a constant voltage equal to $V_{p}$.

As a result, $C_{1}$ directly transfers the input change to the output for the entire positive half cycle. After $t=t_{1}$, the input tends to push negative charge into $C_{1}$, turning $D_{1}$ on and forcing $V_{\\text {out }}=0$. Thus, the voltage across $C_{1}$ remains equal to $V_{\\text {in }}$ until $t=t_{2}$, at which point the direction of the current through $C_{1}$ and $D_{1}$ must change, turning $D_{1}$ off. Now, $C_{1}$ carries a voltage equal to $V_{p}$ and transfers the input change to the output; i.e., the output tracks the input but with a level shift of $+V_{p}$, reaching a peak value of $+2 V_{p}$.\n\nExercise Repeat the above example if the right plate of $C_{1}$ is 1 V more positive than its left plate at $t=0$.\n\nSo far, we have developed circuits that generate a periodic output with a peak value of $-2 V_{p}$ or $+2 V_{p}$ for an input sinusoid varying between $-V_{p}$ and $+V_{p}$. We hypothesize that if these circuits are followed by a peak detector [e.g., Fig. 3.30(a)], then a constant output equal to $-2 V_{p}$ or $+2 V_{p}$ may be produced. Figure 3.57 exemplifies this concept, combining the circuit of Fig. 3.56 with the peak detector of Fig. 3.30(a).

The ground is connected to the negative terminal of Vin and the negative terminal of C2.\n\nA capacitive voltage divider, as seen in Fig. 3.54(b), functions as follows. If Vin becomes more positive, the left plate of C1 gains positive charge from Vin, compelling the right plate to absorb an equal magnitude of negative charge from the top plate of C2. As the top plate of C2 loses negative charge, it effectively holds more positive charge, causing the bottom plate to draw negative charge from ground. Notably, all four plates experience an equal exchange of charge since C1 and C2 are in series. To calculate the change in Vout (ΔVout) due to ΔVin, we express the change in charge on C2 as ΔQ2 = C2 * ΔVout, which also applies to C1: ΔQ2 = ΔQ1. Thus, the voltage change across C1 equals C2 * ΔVout / C1. Adding these voltage changes and equating them to ΔVin yields the equation:\n\nΔVin = (C2 / C1) * ΔVout + ΔVout\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nΔVout = (C1 / (C1 + C2)) * ΔVin\n\nThis result resembles the voltage division expression for resistive dividers, except that C1 (instead of C2) is in the numerator. Interestingly, the circuit in Fig. 3.54(a) is a special case of the capacitive divider with C2=0, resulting in ΔVout = ΔVin.\n\nAs we begin to explore voltage doubling, we revisit the result depicted in Fig. 3.31: the voltage across the diode in the peak detector exhibits an average value of -Vp and, more notably, a peak value of -2Vp (relative to zero). For further study, we redraw the circuit as shown in Fig. 3.55, where the diode and capacitors are swapped, and the voltage across D1 is labeled Vout. Although Vout behaves identically to VD1 in Fig. 3.30(a), we analyze the output waveform from a different perspective to gain deeper insights.\n\nFigures 3.55(a) and (b) depict a capacitor-diode circuit and its waveforms. Assuming an ideal diode and zero initial voltage across C1, we observe that as Vin surpasses zero, the input tends to place positive charge on the left plate of C1 and draw negative charge from D1, turning it on and setting Vout to zero. As Vin approaches Vp, the voltage across C1 mirrors Vin since its right plate is held at zero by D1. Post t1, Vin starts to decline, attempting to discharge C1, i.e., removing positive charge from the left plate and D1. Consequently, D1 turns off, simplifying the circuit to that in Fig. 3.54(a). From this point, the output directly tracks the input changes while C1 maintains a constant voltage equal to Vp. Specifically, as Vin fluctuates from +Vp to -Vp, the output ranges from zero to -2Vp, repeating this cycle indefinitely. The output waveform mirrors that in Fig. 3.31(b).\n\nFigures 3.56(a) and (b) represent a capacitor-diode circuit and its waveforms. As Vin increases from zero, attempting to place positive charge on the left plate of C1 and extract negative charge from D1, the diode turns off. Consequently, C1 directly transfers the input change to the output throughout the positive half-cycle. Post t1, the input starts to push negative charge into C1, turning D1 on and forcing Vout to zero. Thus, the voltage across C1 equals Vin until t2, at which point the current direction through C1 and D1 must invert, turning D1 off. Now, C1 sustains a voltage equal to Vp and conveys the input change to the output; i.e., the output tracks the input but with a Vp level shift, reaching a peak of +2Vp.\n\nAssuming ideal diodes, zero initial conditions across C1 and C2, and C1=C2, the analysis is simplified if we start with a negative cycle. As Vin drops below zero, D1 turns on, anchoring node X to zero. Thus, for t<t1, D2 remains off, and Vout=0. At t=t1, the voltage across C1 reaches -Vp. For t>t1, the input begins to rise, attempting to deposit positive charge on the left plate of C1, turning D1 off and yielding the circuit shown in Fig. 3.57.\n\nHow does D2 behave in this scenario? Since Vin is rising, we posit that VX also tends to increase (from zero), turning D2 on. (If D2 stays off, C1 simply transfers the change in Vin to node X, raising VX and turning D2 on.) Consequently, the circuit simplifies to a basic capacitive divider following Eq. (3.111):\n\nΔVout = (1/2) * ΔVin\n\nbecause C1=C2. In other words, VX and Vout commence from zero, remain equal, and vary sinusoidally but with an amplitude of Vp/2. Thus, from t1 to t2, a 2Vp change in Vin manifests as a Vp change in VX and Vout. Note at t=t2, the voltage across C1 is zero since both Vin and Vout equal +Vp.\n\nPost t=t2, as Vin begins to fall, attempting to draw charge from C1, D2 turns off, keeping Vout at +Vp. One might wonder if something is amiss; our goal was to generate an output of 2Vp, not Vp. However, patience is key, and we must persist with the transient analysis. For t>t2, both D1 and D2 are off, and each capacitor holds a constant voltage. Since the voltage across C1 is zero, VX=Vin, dropping to zero at t=t3. At this point, D1 turns on again, allowing C1 to charge to -Vp at t=t4. As Vin starts to rise again, D1 turns off, and D2 remains off because VX=0 and Vout=+Vp. Now, with the right plate of C1 floating, VX tracks the input change, reaching +Vp as Vin goes from -Vp to 0. Thus, D2 turns on at t=t5, forming a capacitive divider again. After this point, the output change equals half the input change, i.e., Vout rises from +Vp to +Vp+Vp/2 as Vin goes from 0 to +Vp. The output now reaches 3Vp/2.\n\nThe analysis demonstrates that the output continues to rise by Vp, Vp/2, Vp/4, etc., with each input cycle, converging on a final value of:\n\nVout = Vp * (1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + ...) = Vp / (1 - 1/2) = 2Vp\n\nThe reader is encouraged to continue the analysis for a few more cycles and confirm this trend.\n\nUsing the diagram in Fig. 3.58(a), noting that D1 and C1 carry equal currents when D1 is forward biased, and expressing the current as ID1 = -C1 * dVin/dt, we construct the plot shown in Fig. 3.58(b). For 0<t<t1, D1 conducts, and the peak current corresponds to the maximum slope of Vin, i.e., immediately after t=0. From t=t1 to t=t3, the diode remains off, repeating the same behavior in subsequent cycles.\n\nThe waveform labeled \"V_in\" represents the input voltage in a voltage doubler circuit. The x-axis is labeled as time t, with key time intervals marked as t1, t2, t3, t4, and t5. The y-axis represents the voltage Vin, typically in volts.\n\nThe waveform displays a sinusoidal shape, characteristic of alternating current (AC) signals. It starts at zero, increases to a positive peak, returns to zero, decreases to a negative peak, and then returns to zero again, completing one full cycle. The positive peak occurs between t1 and t2, while the negative peak occurs between t3 and t4. The waveform is symmetrical about the time axis, indicating a consistent amplitude on both the positive and negative sides.\n\nThe waveform crosses the time axis at t1, t3, and t5, indicating zero crossings. The peak positive voltage is reached just before t2, and the peak negative voltage is reached just before t4. The intervals t2 - t3 and t4 - t5 represent the time duration for the waveform to transition from peak to zero crossing.\n\nThe waveform is annotated with specific circuit configurations showing diode and capacitor placements for different phases of the waveform. These annotations suggest the operation of the circuit as a voltage doubler, with the diodes and capacitors working in tandem to shift and stabilize the voltage levels. The circuit configurations shown alongside the waveform indicate different stages of charging and discharging of the capacitors, which correspond to the different segments of the waveform.\n\nThe waveform labeled \"I_D1\" represents the current through diode D1 over time, showing conduction during t1 to t2 and t4 to t5.\n\nFigure 3.58 illustrates the diode current in a voltage doubler."

    "text": "Electronic systems commonly use a uniform supply voltage, such as 3 V, necessitating that individual and integrated circuits function within this voltage range. However, the complexity of designing certain circuits within the system can be significantly reduced if they operate at a higher voltage, such as 6 V. This is where \"voltage doublers\" come into play. Prior to delving into the mechanics of doublers, it's beneficial to revisit the fundamental characteristics of capacitors. A capacitor must have one plate charged to +Q while the other is charged to -Q. Consequently, in the circuit depicted in Fig. 3.54(a), the voltage across C1 remains unchanged irrespective of variations in Vin because the right plate of C1 cannot accept or release charge (Q=CV). The constancy of VC1 implies that any input variation, ΔVin, is directly reflected at the output. This is a crucial observation.\n\nIn Fig. 3.54(b), a capacitive voltage divider is presented, with Vin at the input and Vout at the output. The voltage across C1 is Vin - Vout, and across C2 is Vout, with the ground connected to the negative terminal of Vin and C2.\n\nThe operation of the capacitive voltage divider in Fig. 3.54(b) can be explained as follows: if Vin becomes more positive, the left plate of C1 acquires positive charge from Vin, necessitating that the right plate of C1 absorbs an equivalent negative charge from the top plate of C2. This results in the top plate of C2 effectively holding more positive charge, causing the bottom plate to absorb negative charge from ground. It's important to note that all four plates experience an equal exchange of charge since C1 and C2 are in series. To calculate the change in Vout due to ΔVin, we consider the change in charge on C2 as ΔQ2=C2 ΔVout, which also applies to C1: ΔQ2=ΔQ1. Hence, the voltage change across C1 equals C2 ΔVout / C1. By adding these voltage changes and setting the sum equal to ΔVin, we derive the equation for ΔVout in relation to ΔVin.\n\nThe derived result resembles the voltage division principle for resistive dividers, except with C1 in the numerator. Notably, the circuit in Fig. 3.54(a) is a special instance of the capacitive divider where C2=0, leading to ΔVout=ΔVin.\n\nIn our quest to understand voltage doubling, we must remember the outcome shown in Fig. 3.31: the voltage across the diode in a peak detector exhibits an average of -Vp and a peak of -2Vp (relative to zero). To further our analysis, we reconfigure the circuit as shown in Fig. 3.55, swapping the positions of the diode and capacitors, with the voltage across D1 labeled as Vout. Although Vout behaves identically to VD1 in Fig. 3.30(a), analyzing the output waveform from a different perspective provides additional insights.\n\nAssuming an ideal diode and zero initial voltage across C1, we observe that as Vin surpasses zero, the input voltage attempts to place positive charge on the left plate of C1, thus extracting negative charge from D1. Consequently, D1 conducts, clamping Vout to zero. As Vin approaches Vp, the voltage across C1 remains equal to Vin because its right plate is held at zero by D1. Post t1, Vin starts to decline, initiating the discharge of C1, i.e., extracting positive charge from the left plate and from D1. The diode thus ceases conducting, simplifying the circuit to that in Fig. 3.54(a). From this point, the output directly mirrors the input changes while C1 maintains a constant voltage equal to Vp. Specifically, as Vin fluctuates from +Vp to -Vp, the output ranges from zero to -2Vp, repeating this cycle indefinitely. Therefore, the output waveform matches that observed in Fig. 3.31(b).\n\nTo achieve voltage doubling, we consider the circuit in Fig. 3.57, which combines the configuration of Fig. 3.56 with the peak detector from Fig. 3.30(a). Of course, since the peak detector loads the first stage when D2 conducts, a detailed analysis is essential to confirm its functionality as a voltage doubler.\n\nWe assume ideal diodes, zero initial voltage across C1 and C2, and equal capacitance (C1=C2). The analysis is simplified by starting with a negative cycle. As Vin drops below zero, D1 conducts, fixing node X at zero. Thus, for t<t1, D2 remains off, and Vout=0. At t=t1, the voltage across C1 reaches -Vp. Post t1, as Vin starts to rise, it tries to deposit positive charge on the left plate of C1, turning D1 off and resulting in the circuit shown in Fig. 3.57.\n\nThe behavior of D2 in this scenario is crucial. As Vin rises, we hypothesize that VX also tends to increase (from zero), turning D2 on. This transforms the circuit into a simple capacitive divider, following Eq. (3.111) because C1=C2. This implies that VX and Vout begin at zero, remain equal, and vary sinusoidally with an amplitude of Vp/2. Thus, from t1 to t2, a change of 2Vp in Vin corresponds to a change of Vp in VX and Vout. Notably, at t=t2, the voltage across C1 is zero as both Vin and Vout equal +Vp.\n\nPost t=t2, as Vin begins to fall and extracts charge from C1, D2 turns off, keeping Vout at +Vp. The reader might question the output, as our objective was to achieve 2Vp, not Vp. However, a continued transient analysis is necessary. After t>t2, both D1 and D2 are off, with each capacitor holding a constant voltage. Since the voltage across C1 is zero, VX=Vin, falling to zero at t=t3. At this point, D1 conducts again, allowing C1 to charge to -Vp at t=t4. As Vin rises, D1 turns off, and D2 remains off since VX=0 and Vout=+Vp. With the right plate of C1 floating, VX tracks the input changes, reaching +Vp as Vin goes from -Vp to 0. Hence, D2 turns on at t=t5, forming a capacitive divider again. Beyond this time, the output change is half of the input change, i.e., Vout increases from +Vp to +Vp+Vp/2 as Vin goes from 0 to +Vp. The output now reaches 3Vp/2.\n\nThrough this analysis, it becomes clear that the output continues to increase by Vp, Vp/2, Vp/4, etc., with each input cycle, asymptotically approaching a final value of 2Vp. The reader is invited to extend the analysis for a few more cycles to confirm this trend.\n\nUsing the diagram in Fig. 3.58(a) and considering that D1 and C1 share equal currents when D1 is forward-biased, we can plot the current through D1 as a function of time, as shown in Fig. 3.58(b). For 0<t<t1, D1 conducts, and the peak current corresponds to the steepest slope of Vin, i.e., immediately after t=0. From t=t1 to t=t3, the diode is off, repeating this behavior in subsequent cycles."

First, to charge one plate of a capacitor to $+Q$, the other plate must be charged to $-Q$. Hence, in the circuit depicted in Fig. 3.54(a), the voltage across $C_{1}$ remains constant even if $V_{i n}$ changes, because the right plate of $C_{1}$ cannot receive or release charge $(Q=C V)$. As $V_{C 1}$ remains constant, any change in the input $\\Delta V_{\\text {in }}$ is directly reflected at the output.

The ground is connected to the negative terminal of Vin and the negative terminal of C2.\n\nFigure 3.54 (a) Voltage change at one plate of a capacitor, (b) voltage division.\n\nSecond, a capacitive voltage divider, like the one in Fig. 3.54(b), operates as follows. If $V_{i n}$ becomes more positive, the left plate of $C_{1}$ receives positive charge from $V_{i n}$, thereby requiring the right plate to absorb an equivalent amount of negative charge from the top plate of $C_{2}$. As the top plate of $C_{2}$ loses negative charge, it effectively gains positive charge, causing the bottom plate to absorb negative charge from ground. All four plates experience equal amounts of charge transfer because $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ are in series. To calculate the change in $V_{\\text {out }}, \\Delta V_{\\text {out }}$, resulting from $\\Delta V_{\\text {in }}$, we express the change in charge on $C_{2}$ as $\\Delta Q_{2}=C_{2} \\cdot \\Delta V_{\\text {out }}$, which also applies to $C_{1}: \\Delta Q_{2}=\\Delta Q_{1}$. Therefore, the voltage change across $C_{1}$ equals $C_{2} \\cdot \\Delta V_{\\text {out }} / C_{1}$. By adding these two voltage changes and setting the sum equal to $\\Delta V_{i n}$, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\Delta V_{\\text {in }}=\\frac{C_{2}}{C_{1}} \\Delta V_{\\text {out }}+\\Delta V_{\\text {out }} \\tag{3.110}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n[^9]This simplifies to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\Delta V_{\\text {out }}=\\frac{C_{1}}{C_{1}+C_{2}} \\Delta V_{\\text {in }} \\tag{3.111}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis result mirrors the voltage division expression for resistive dividers, except that $C_{1}$ (instead of $C_{2}$) appears in the numerator.

For further analysis, we redraw the circuit as shown in Fig. 3.55, where the diode and the capacitors are swapped, and the voltage across $D_{1}$ is labeled $V_{\\text {out }}$.

Consequently, $D_{1}$ turns on, forcing $V_{\\text {out }}=0 .{ }^{18}$ As the input climbs towards $V_{p}$, the voltage across $C_{1}$ remains equal to $V_{i n}$ because its right plate is \"pinned\" at zero by $D_{1}$. After $t=t_{1}$, $V_{\\text {in }}$ starts to decline and attempts to discharge $C_{1}$, i.e., draw positive charge from the left plate and hence from $D_{1}$. The diode thus turns off, reducing the circuit to that in Fig. 3.54(a). From this point onwards, the output directly tracks the changes in the input while $C_{1}$ maintains a constant voltage equal to $V_{p}$. Specifically, as $V_{i n}$ varies from $+V_{p}$ to $-V_{p}$, the output transitions from zero to $-2 V_{p}$, and the cycle repeats indefinitely. The output waveform is thus identical to that obtained in Fig. 3.31(b).\n\n[^10]image_name:(a)\ndescription:\n[\nname: Vin, type: VoltageSource, value: Vin, ports: {Np: Vin, Nn: GND}\nname: C1, type: Capacitor, value: C1, ports: {Np: Vin, Nn: Vout}\nname: D1, type: Diode, ports: {Na: Vout, Nc: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:This circuit is a peak detector or rectifier with a capacitor and diode.

As a result, $C_{1}$ directly transfers the input change to the output for the entire positive half cycle. After $t=t_{1}$, the input tends to push negative charge into $C_{1}$, turning $D_{1}$ on and forcing $V_{\\text {out }}=0$. Thus, the voltage across $C_{1}$ remains equal to $V_{\\text {in }}$ until $t=t_{2}$, at which point the direction of the current through $C_{1}$ and $D_{1}$ must change, turning $D_{1}$ off. Now, $C_{1}$ carries a voltage equal to $V_{p}$ and transfers the input change to the output; i.e., the output tracks the input but with a level shift of $+V_{p}$, reaching a peak value of $+2 V_{p}$.\n\nExercise Repeat the above example if the right plate of $C_{1}$ is 1 V more positive than its left plate at $t=0$.\n\nSo far, we have developed circuits that generate a periodic output with a peak value of $-2 V_{p}$ or $+2 V_{p}$ for an input sinusoid varying between $-V_{p}$ and $+V_{p}$. We hypothesize that if these circuits are followed by a peak detector [e.g., Fig. 3.30(a)], then a constant output equal to $-2 V_{p}$ or $+2 V_{p}$ may be produced. Figure 3.57 exemplifies this concept, combining the circuit of Fig. 3.56 with the peak detector of Fig. 3.30(a). Of course, since the peak detector \"loads\" the first stage when $D_{2}$ turns on, we must still analyze this circuit carefully and determine whether it indeed operates as a voltage doubler.\nimage_name:Figure 3.57\ndescription:\n[\nname: Vin, type: VoltageSource, value: Vin, ports: {Np: Vin, Nn: GND}\nname: C1, type: Capacitor, value: C1, ports: {Np: Vin, Nn: X}\nname: D1, type: Diode, ports: {Na: X, Nc: GND}\nname: D2, type: Diode, ports: {Na: X, Nc: Vout}\nname: C2, type: Capacitor, value: C2, ports: {Np: Vout, Nn: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:This circuit is a voltage doubler using ideal diodes and capacitors.

    "text": "Electronic systems often utilize a standard supply voltage, for instance, 3 V, necessitating that individual and integrated circuits function at this level. Nevertheless, the complexity of designing specific circuits within the system can be considerably reduced if they operate at a higher voltage, such as 6 V. Voltage doublers can fulfill this need. Prior to delving into doublers, it's beneficial to revisit the fundamental characteristics of capacitors. Initially, to charge one plate of a capacitor to +Q, the opposing plate must be charged to -Q. Therefore, in the circuit depicted in Fig. 3.54(a), the voltage across C1 remains constant despite any changes in Vin, since the right plate of C1 cannot acquire or discharge charge (Q=CV). As VC1 stays constant, any alteration ΔVin is directly reflected at the output. This is a crucial observation.\n\nFigures 3.54(a) and (b) illustrate voltage changes at one plate of a capacitor and voltage division, respectively.\n\nNext, a capacitive voltage divider, such as the one in Fig. 3.54(b), functions as follows. If Vin becomes more positive, the left plate of C1 accumulates positive charge from Vin, necessitating that the right plate absorb an equivalent negative charge from the top plate of C2. As the top plate of C2 loses negative charge, it effectively holds more positive charge, causing the bottom plate to absorb negative charge from ground. It's important to note that all four plates experience an equal exchange of charge since C1 and C2 are in series. To calculate the change in output voltage, ΔVout, resulting from ΔVin, we express the change in charge on C2 as ΔQ2=C2·ΔVout, which also applies to C1: ΔQ2=ΔQ1. Therefore, the voltage change across C1 equals C2·ΔVout/C1. Summing these voltage changes and equating them to ΔVin yields the equation ΔVin=(C2/C1)·ΔVout+ΔVout.\n\nThis outcome resembles the voltage division formula for resistive dividers, with C1 (instead of C2) in the numerator. Interestingly, the circuit in Fig. 3.54(a) represents a special case of the capacitive divider where C2=0, leading to ΔVout=ΔVin.\n\nIn our initial approach to creating a voltage doubler, we should remember the outcome demonstrated in Fig. 3.31: the voltage across the diode in the peak detector exhibits an average value of -Vp and, more notably, a peak value of -2Vp (relative to zero). For further examination, we redraw the circuit as shown in Fig. 3.55, swapping the positions of the diode and capacitors, and designating the voltage across D1 as Vout. Although Vout in this circuit behaves identically to VD1 in Fig. 3.30(a), we derive the output waveform from a different perspective to gain additional insights.\n\nFigure 3.55(a) shows a capacitor-diode circuit, while (b) depicts its waveforms.\n\nAssuming an ideal diode and zero initial voltage across C1, we observe that as Vin surpasses zero, the input tends to place positive charge on the left plate of C1 and thus draw negative charge from D1. Consequently, D1 turns on, forcing Vout=0. As Vin approaches Vp, the voltage across C1 remains equal to Vin because its right plate is \"anchored\" at zero by D1. Following t=t1, Vin starts to decline and attempts to discharge C1, i.e., remove positive charge from the left plate and thus from D1. The diode then turns off, simplifying the circuit to that in Fig. 3.54(a). From this point onwards, the output directly mirrors the input fluctuations while C1 maintains a constant voltage equal to Vp. Specifically, as Vin varies from +Vp to -Vp, the output transitions from zero to -2Vp, and the cycle repeats indefinitely. The output waveform is, therefore, identical to that obtained in Fig. 3.31(b).\n\nFigure 3.56(a) displays a capacitor-diode circuit, and (b) shows its waveforms.\n\nConsidering the circuit in Fig. 3.57, which combines the circuit from Fig. 3.56 with the peak detector from Fig. 3.30(a), we must meticulously analyze this circuit to confirm whether it functions as a voltage doubler. Assuming ideal diodes, zero initial conditions across C1 and C2, and C1=C2, the analysis is simplified if we commence with a negative cycle. As Vin drops below zero, D1 turns on, clamping node X to zero. Consequently, for t<t1, D2 remains off and Vout=0. At t=t1, the voltage across C1 reaches -Vp. For t>t1, the input begins to rise and tends to deposit positive charge on the left plate of C1, turning D1 off and yielding the circuit shown in Fig. 3.57.\n\nThe behavior of D2 in this regime is as follows: since Vin is now rising, we infer that VX also tends to increase (from zero), turning D2 on. (If D2 remains off, then C1 merely transfers the change in Vin to node X, raising VX and thereby turning D2 on.) As a result, the circuit reduces to a simple capacitive divider that follows Eq. (3.111): ΔVout=(1/2)ΔVin because C1=C2. In other words, VX and Vout start from zero, remain equal, and fluctuate sinusoidally but with an amplitude of Vp/2. Therefore, from t1 to t2, a change of 2Vp in Vin appears as a change equal to Vp in VX and Vout. Note that at t=t2, the voltage across C1 is zero since both Vin and Vout are equal to +Vp.\n\nWhat transpires after t=t2? As Vin starts to fall and tends to extract charge from C1, D2 turns off, keeping Vout at +Vp. The reader might question if something is amiss here; our objective was to generate an output of 2Vp, not Vp. However, patience is crucial, and we must persevere with the transient analysis. For t>t2, both D1 and D2 are off, and each capacitor sustains a constant voltage. Since the voltage across C1 is zero, VX=Vin, declining to zero at t=t3. At this point, D1 turns on again, allowing C1 to charge to -Vp at t=t4. As Vin begins to rise again, D1 turns off, and D2 remains off because VX=0 and Vout=+Vp. Now, with the right plate of C1 unconnected, VX follows the input changes, reaching +Vp as Vin goes from -Vp to 0. Thus, D2 turns on at t=t5, forming a capacitive divider once more. Beyond this time, the output change equals half of the input change, i.e., Vout rises from +Vp to +Vp+Vp/2 as Vin goes from 0 to +Vp. The output has now reached 3Vp/2.\n\nThe analysis demonstrates that the output continues to increase by Vp, Vp/2, Vp/4, etc., with each input cycle, converging on a final value of Vout=Vp/(1-1/2)=2Vp.\n\nThe reader is encouraged to continue the analysis for a few more cycles and verify this trend.\n\nFigure 3.58(a) presents a diagram, while (b) displays the plot of diode current in a voltage doubler. Using the diagram in Fig. 3.58(a), considering that D1 and C1 carry equal currents when D1 is forward biased, and expressing the current as ID1=-C1 dVin/dt, we construct the plot shown in Fig. 3.58(b). For 0<t<t1, D1 conducts, and the peak current corresponds to the maximum slope of Vin, i.e., immediately after t=0. From t=t1 to t=t3, the diode remains off, repeating the same behavior in subsequent cycles.\n\nThe waveform labeled \"V_in\" represents the input voltage in a voltage doubler circuit, with key time intervals marked as t1, t2, t3, t4, and t5. The waveform exhibits a sinusoidal shape, characteristic of alternating current (AC) signals, starting at zero, increasing to a positive peak, returning to zero, decreasing to a negative peak, and then returning to zero again, completing one full cycle. The waveform crosses the time axis at t1, t3, and t5, indicating zero crossings. The peak positive voltage is reached just before t2, and the peak negative voltage is reached just before t4. The intervals t2-t3 and t4-t5 represent the time duration for the waveform to transition from peak to zero crossing.\n\nThe waveform is annotated with specific circuit configurations, suggesting the operation of the circuit as a voltage doubler, with the diodes and capacitors working in tandem to shift and stabilize the voltage levels. The circuit configurations shown alongside the waveform indicate different stages of charging and discharging of the capacitors, which correspond to the different segments of the waveform.\n\nFigure 3.58 illustrates diode current in a voltage doubler."

    "text": "Electronic systems commonly operate with a uniform supply voltage, such as 3 V, necessitating that both discrete and integrated circuits function within this voltage range. However, certain circuit designs benefit greatly from operation at a higher supply voltage, like 6 V, which is where \"voltage doublers\" come into play.\n\nUnderstanding voltage doublers requires a grasp of capacitor fundamentals. To charge one plate of a capacitor to +Q, the opposite plate must be charged to -Q. Consequently, in the circuit depicted in Figure 3.54(a), the voltage across C1 remains constant despite any changes in Vin, as the right plate of C1 cannot acquire or lose charge (Q=CV). This constancy ensures that any input voltage variation, ΔVin, directly translates to the output. This observation is crucial.\n\nFigure 3.54(a) illustrates how a voltage fluctuation at one capacitor plate directly affects the output when the other plate cannot exchange charge, a principle underlying voltage doubling circuits. Figure 3.54(b) represents a capacitive voltage divider with Vin as input and Vout as output. The voltage across C1 is Vin - Vout, and the voltage across C2 is Vout, with both capacitors' negative terminals grounded.\n\nIn the capacitive voltage divider shown in Figure 3.54(b), if Vin increases positively, the left plate of C1 acquires positive charge from Vin, compelling the right plate to absorb an equal magnitude of negative charge from C2's top plate. As C2's top plate loses negative charge, it effectively gains positive charge, causing the bottom plate to draw negative charge from ground. All four plates exchange equal amounts of charge since C1 and C2 are in series. To calculate the output voltage change, ΔVout, due to ΔVin, we express the charge change on C2 as ΔQ2=C2·ΔVout, which also applies to C1: ΔQ2=ΔQ1. Therefore, the voltage change across C1 equals C2·ΔVout/C1. Adding these voltage changes and setting the sum equal to ΔVin yields the equation for capacitive voltage division.\n\nThe circuit in Figure 3.54(a) is a special case of the capacitive divider with C2=0, resulting in ΔVout=ΔVin.\n\nAs we progress towards building a voltage doubler, we recall the outcome in Figure 3.31, where the diode in the peak detector exhibits an average voltage of -Vp and a peak voltage of -2Vp (relative to zero). To delve deeper, we redraw the circuit in Figure 3.55, swapping the positions of the diode and capacitors and labeling the voltage across D1 as Vout. Although Vout behaves identically to VD1 in Figure 3.30(a), analyzing the output waveform from a different angle offers additional insights.\n\nFigure 3.55(a) shows a peak detector circuit with an ideal diode and a capacitor, where Vin charges C1 through D1, and Vout is the voltage across the diode. The waveform indicates Vout peaking at -2Vp relative to zero. Figure 3.55(b) is a time-domain waveform graph illustrating Vout's behavior over time in the capacitor-diode circuit.\n\nConsidering an ideal diode and zero initial voltage across C1, we observe that as Vin surpasses zero, the input attempts to place positive charge on C1's left plate, drawing negative charge from D1, causing D1 to turn off and forcing Vout=0. As Vin approaches Vp, the voltage across C1 equals Vin because its right plate is held at zero by D1. Post t1, Vin starts to decline, attempting to discharge C1, i.e., remove positive charge from the left plate and from D1, turning off the diode. From this point, the output directly mirrors the input changes while C1 maintains a constant voltage equal to Vp. Specifically, as Vin varies from +Vp to -Vp, the output swings from zero to -2Vp, repeating this cycle indefinitely. Thus, the output waveform matches that of Figure 3.31(b).\n\nFigure 3.56(a) depicts a peak detector or rectifier circuit with a capacitor and diode, where the input voltage is applied across the capacitor, and the diode rectifies the output to ground. The waveform illustrates the output voltage tracking the input voltage's peaks. Figure 3.56(b) is a time-domain waveform plot of the capacitor-diode circuit's output.\n\nIn the voltage doubler circuit of Figure 3.57, we assume ideal diodes, zero initial conditions across C1 and C2, and C1=C2. Analyzing the circuit's behavior begins with a negative cycle. As Vin drops below zero, D1 turns on, clamping node X to zero. Thus, for t<t1, D2 remains off, and Vout=0. At t=t1, the voltage across C1 reaches -Vp. Post t1, as Vin rises, it attempts to deposit positive charge on C1's left plate, turning off D1 and yielding the circuit shown in Figure 3.57.\n\nAnalyzing D2's behavior in this scenario, we posit that as Vin increases, Vx (initially zero) also rises, turning on D2. Consequently, the circuit simplifies to a basic capacitive divider following Eq. (3.111), since C1=C2. This implies that Vx and Vout begin at zero, remain equal, and fluctuate sinusoidally with an amplitude of Vp/2. Hence, from t1 to t2, a 2Vp change in Vin corresponds to a Vp change in Vx and Vout. At t=t2, the voltage across C1 is zero because both Vin and Vout equal +Vp.\n\nPost t=t2, as Vin falls and attempts to remove charge from C1, D2 turns off, keeping Vout at +Vp. The reader might question whether our goal of generating an output of 2Vp has been achieved. However, further analysis reveals that after t>t2, with both D1 and D2 off, each capacitor holds a constant voltage. Since the voltage across C1 is zero, Vx=Vin, dropping to zero at t=t3. At this point, D1 turns on again, allowing C1 to charge to -Vp at t=t4. As Vin rises again, D1 turns off, and D2 remains off because Vx=0 and Vout=+Vp. Now, with C1's right plate floating, Vx tracks the input changes, reaching +Vp as Vin goes from -Vp to 0. Thus, D2 turns on at t=t5, reestablishing a capacitive divider. After this point, the output change equals half the input change, i.e., Vout rises from +Vp to +Vp+Vp/2 as Vin goes from 0 to +Vp. The output now reaches 3Vp/2.\n\nThe analysis demonstrates that the output continues to rise by Vp, Vp/2, Vp/4, etc., in each input cycle, asymptotically approaching a final value of 2Vp, as shown by the geometric series sum.\n\nUsing the diagram in Figure 3.58(a), considering that D1 and C1 share equal currents when D1 is forward-biased, and expressing the current as ID1=-C1 dVin/dt, we construct the plot in Figure 3.58(b). For 0<t<t1, D1 conducts, and the peak current corresponds to the maximum slope of Vin, i.e., immediately after t=0. From t=t1 to t=t3, the diode remains off, repeating this behavior in subsequent cycles.\n\nFigure 3.58(a) displays a voltage doubler circuit, where C1 charges during the negative half-cycle and transfers charge to C2 during the positive half-cycle, effectively doubling the input voltage. The waveform of ID1 depicts the current through diode D1 over time, indicating conduction during t1 to t2 and t4 to t5.\n\nFigure 3.58(b) represents the current through D2 in the voltage doubler circuit as a function of time. The waveform's sinusoidal shape, zero crossings, and peak voltages reflect the alternating nature of the input voltage and the diode's conducting and non-conducting states."

    "text": "In crafting electronic circuits, it's often necessary to adjust the mean voltage level of a signal, either higher or lower. This is crucial because the subsequent components, like amplifiers, might not function correctly with the current direct current (DC) level.\n\nA diode, when forward-biased and maintaining a steady voltage, can act as a simple battery. This characteristic makes it useful for adjusting signal levels. Our initial approach involves the circuit in Fig. 3.59(a), which we consider for lowering the signal level by $V_{D, on}$. However, the exact diode current is uncertain and hinges on the next stage of the circuit. To address this, we refine the circuit design as shown in Fig. 3.59(b), where a constant current $I_{1}$ flows, setting up $V_{D, on}$ across $D_{1}$. If the current drawn by the following stage is minimal (or at least consistent), the output voltage $V_{\\text{out}}$ will be a consistent amount, $V_{D, on}$, below the input voltage $V_{\\text{in}}$.\n\nFigures 3.59 (a) and (b) depict circuits that utilize a diode for level shifting. In Figure 3.59 (a), the input voltage $V_{in}$ is connected to the anode of diode $D1$, and the output voltage $V_{out}$ is taken from the cathode, effectively reducing the DC level of the input signal by the diode's forward voltage drop, $V_{D,on}$. Figure 3.59 (b) represents a refined version of the level shifter, incorporating a constant current source $I1$ to ensure the diode's forward voltage is consistently applied across $D1$.\n\nFigure 3.60 showcases a circuit designed to elevate the DC level of a signal by $2 V_{D, on}$. It's a schematic featuring two diodes in series. The circuit operates by applying the input to the cathode and positioning two diodes in series to achieve the required voltage level shift. When forward-biased, the diodes' combined voltage drop equals $2 V_{D, on}$, thereby raising the DC level of the input signal accordingly.\n\nWhen the current $I_{1}$ is exceedingly low, the level shift circuit of Fig. 3.59(b) can morph into an electronic switch. For instance, the topology in Fig. 3.61(a) is widely used to \"sample\" $V_{\\text{in}}$ across $C_{1}$ and \"preserve\" its value when $S_{1}$ is deactivated. By substituting $S_{1}$ with the level shift circuit and allowing $I_{1}$ to be toggled on and off [Fig. 3.61(b)], if $I_{1}$ is active, $V_{\\text{out}}$ mirrors $V_{\\text{in}}$ minus the level shift equal to $V_{D, on}$. When $I_{1}$ is off, $D_{1}$ also switches off, seemingly isolating $C_{1}$ from the input and preserving the voltage across it.\n\nFigures 3.61 (a) through (e) illustrate various stages and behaviors of the switched-capacitor circuit with a diode as a switch. Figure 3.61 (c) specifically addresses the issue of diode conduction over time with respect to the input voltage ($V_{in}$), clock signal (CK), and output voltage ($V_{out}$). The diagrams collectively depict the evolution of the circuit to handle the complexities arising from diode behavior, particularly the junction capacitance when the diodes are off, as explored in Figure 3.62.\n\nIn summary, these circuits and their modifications are essential for precise control of signal levels in electronic systems, ensuring compatibility and functionality in subsequent stages of signal processing."

    "text": "In crafting electronic circuits, it's often necessary to adjust the DC level of a signal to ensure compatibility with subsequent stages, such as amplifiers. To achieve this, we can utilize diodes which, when forward-biased, maintain a relatively constant voltage and act as a potential source for adjusting signal levels.\n\nOur initial approach involves the circuit depicted in Fig. 3.59(a), which we propose for lowering the signal level by $V_{D,on}$. However, a challenge arises as the diode current is undetermined and influenced by the following stage. To address this, we revise the circuit as shown in Fig. 3.59(b), introducing a constant current source $I_1$ that establishes $V_{D,on}$ across diode $D_1$. Provided the next stage draws negligible (or at least constant) current, the output voltage $V_{out}$ will consistently be $V_{D,on}$ less than the input voltage $V_{in}$.\n\nTurning to the images, Fig. 3.59(a) illustrates a level-shifting circuit using a single diode. The input voltage $V_{in}$ is connected to the anode of diode $D1$, with the output voltage $V_{out}$ taken from the cathode. This configuration effectively reduces the DC level of the input signal by the diode's forward voltage drop, $V_{D,on}$.\n\nFig. 3.59(b) depicts an enhanced version of the level shifter, employing a constant current source $I1$ alongside diode $D1$. This setup ensures that the output voltage is the input voltage decreased by $V_{D,on}$.\n\nIn contrast, Fig. 3.60 presents a circuit designed to elevate the DC level of a signal by $2V_{D,on}$. It consists of two diodes in series, with the input voltage applied to the cathode of the second diode and the output voltage taken from the anode of the first diode. This arrangement shifts the input signal's DC level upward by twice the diode's forward voltage drop.\n\nRegarding the operation when $I_1$ is extremely small, the circuit in Fig. 3.59(b) can be repurposed as an electronic switch. As shown in Fig. 3.61(a), the circuit can \"sample\" the input voltage across capacitor $C_1$ and \"freeze\" its value when switch $S_1$ is open. Replacing $S_1$ with the level shift circuit and allowing $I_1$ to be toggled, if $I_1$ is active, $V_{out}$ mirrors $V_{in}$ minus the level shift equal to $V_{D,on}$. When $I_1$ is inactive, diode $D_1$ also turns off, disconnecting $C_1$ from the input and preserving the voltage across it.\n\nFigures 3.61(b) through (e) represent various stages and modifications of the circuit, addressing issues such as diode conduction and feedthrough effects. The circuit evolution leads to a design that isolates $C_1$ from the input when $I_1$ and $I_2$ are off, effectively acting as a switch.\n\nFinally, considering the junction capacitance of diodes in reverse bias (as discussed in Chapter 2), Fig. 3.62 demonstrates the equivalent circuit when the diodes are off. The capacitive divider effect, as modeled in Fig. 3.54(b), suggests that the input signal can disturb the output through the junction capacitances. To minimize this \"feedthrough,\" capacitor $C_1$ must be sufficiently large.\n\nIn summary, the rephrased text maintains the original technical detail and complexity, ensuring the information about electronic circuits, diode behavior, and potential issues such as feedthrough remains intact and coherent."

    "text": "To modify electronic circuits, we may need to adjust the signal's average level up or down, as the subsequent stage (such as an amplifier) may not function correctly with the current DC level.\n\nA diode, by maintaining a relatively constant voltage in forward bias, can be likened to a battery and thus serves as a device capable of shifting the signal level. Initially, we examine the circuit depicted in Fig. 3.59(a) as a potential candidate for shifting the level down by $V_{D, on}$. However, the diode current remains unknown and dependent on the next stage. To address this issue, we modify the circuit as shown in Fig. 3.59(b), where $I_{1}$ supplies a constant current, establishing $V_{D, on}$ across $D_{1}$.

This configuration is useful in applications where a specific DC offset is required for further signal processing.\n\n5. The diodes must be forward-biased for the level shift to occur, which means $V_{in}$ must be greater than the combined forward voltage of the diodes. This circuit is typically used in analog signal processing to adjust the DC level without affecting the AC characteristics of the signal.\n\nFigure 3.59 (a) shows the use of a diode for level shift, while (b) shows a practical implementation. To shift the level up, we apply the input to the cathode. To achieve a shift of $2 V_{D, on}$, we place two diodes in series. Figure 3.60 shows the result.\n\nIf $I_{1}$ is extremely small, the level shift circuit of Fig. 3.59(b) can be transformed into an electronic switch. Many applications employ the topology shown in Fig. 3.61(a) to \"sample\" $V_{\\text{in}}$ across $C_{1}$ and \"freeze\" the value when $S_{1}$ turns off. Let us replace $S_{1}$ with the level shift circuit and allow $I_{1}$ to be turned on and off [Fig. 3.61(b)]. If $I_{1}$ is on, $V_{\\text{out}}$ tracks $V_{\\text{in}}$ except for a level shift equal to $V_{D, on}$. When $I_{1}$ turns off, so does $D_{1}$, evidently disconnecting $C_{1}$ from the input and freezing the voltage across $C_{1}$.\n\nFigure 3.61 (a) shows a switched-capacitor circuit, while (b) shows its realization using a diode as a switch. (c) illustrates the problem of diode conduction, (d) shows a more complete circuit, and (e) shows the equivalent circuit when $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ are off.\n\nWe used the term \"evidently\" in the last sentence because the circuit's true behavior somewhat differs from the above description.

Now consider the case illustrated in Fig. 3.61(c), where $I_{1}$ turns off at $t=t_{1}$, allowing $C_{1}$ to store a value equal to $V_{i n 1}-V_{D, on}$. As the input waveform completes a negative excursion and exceeds $V_{\\text{in } 1}$ at $t=t_{2}$, the diode is forward-biased again, charging $C_{1}$ with the input (in a manner similar to a peak detector). That is, even though $I_{1}$ is off, $D_{1}$ turns on for part of the cycle.\n\nTo resolve this issue, the circuit is modified as shown in Fig. 3.61(d), where $D_{2}$ is inserted between $D_{1}$ and $C_{1}$, and $I_{2}$ provides a bias current for $D_{2}$. With both $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ on, the diodes operate in forward bias, $V_{X}=V_{\\text{in}}-V_{D 1}$, and $V_{\\text{out}}=V_{X}+V_{D 2}=V_{\\text{in}}$ if $V_{D 1}=V_{D 2}$. Thus, $V_{\\text{out}}$ tracks $V_{\\text{in}}$ with no level shift. When $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ turn off, the circuit reduces to that in Fig. 3.61(e), where the back-to-back diodes fail to conduct for any value of $V_{\\text{in}}-V_{\\text{out}}$, thereby isolating $C_{1}$ from the input. In other words, the two diodes and the two current sources form an electronic switch.\n\nRecall from Chapter 2 that diodes exhibit a junction capacitance in reverse bias.

In our initial attempt, we consider the circuit shown in Fig. 3.59(a) as a candidate for shifting the level down by $V_{D,on}$. However, the diode current remains unknown and dependent on the next stage. To address this issue, we modify the circuit as depicted in Fig. 3.59(b), where $I_1$ draws a constant current, establishing $V_{D,on}$ across $D_1$. If the current drawn by the next stage is negligible (or at least constant), $V_{out}$ is simply lower than $V_{in}$ by a constant amount, $V_{D,on}$.\n\nThe circuit in Figure 3.59 (a) uses a diode for level shifting. The input voltage $V_{in}$ is applied to the anode of the diode $D_1$, and the output voltage $V_{out}$ is taken from the cathode. This configuration shifts the DC level of the input signal down by the diode's forward voltage drop, $V_{D,on}$.\n\nThe circuit is a level shifter that shifts the input voltage down by the diode's forward voltage drop, $V_{D,on}$. A constant current source, $I_1$, is used to establish this voltage across the diode, $D_1$.\n\nThe graph in Figure 3.60 illustrates a circuit designed to shift the DC level of a signal upward by $2 V_{D,on}$. The figure is a schematic diagram showing two diodes in series, used to achieve the desired voltage level shift. The circuit is structured as follows:\n\n1. The diagram is a circuit schematic, not a traditional graph with axes. It shows a configuration for level shifting a DC signal using diodes.\n2. The circuit includes two diodes, labeled $D_1$ and $D_2$, connected in series.\n3. The input voltage $V_{in}$ is applied to the cathode of the second diode $D_2$, and the output voltage $V_{out}$ is taken from the anode of the first diode $D_1$.\n4. The diodes are oriented to allow current flow from the input to the output when forward-biased.\n5. The purpose of the circuit is to shift the input signal's DC level upwards by twice the diode's forward voltage drop $2 V_{D,on}$.\n6. By placing two diodes in series, the total voltage drop across them when forward-biased is $2 V_{D,on}$, effectively raising the DC level of the input signal by this amount.\n7.

This circuit is typically used in analog signal processing to adjust the DC level without affecting the AC characteristics of the signal.\n\nThis description provides a comprehensive understanding of the circuit's purpose and operation, allowing for practical implementation or analysis without requiring visual access to the diagram itself.\n\nFigure 3.59 (a) Use of a diode for level shift, (b) practical implementation.\n\n[^13]Design a circuit that shifts up the dc level of a signal by $2 V_{D,on}$.\n3.37\n\nSolution To shift the level up, we apply the input to the cathode. Also, to obtain a shift of $2 V_{D,on}$, we place two diodes in series. Figure 3.60 shows the result.\n\nFigure 3.59 (b) Use of a diode for level shift, (b) practical implementation.\n\nWhat happens if $I_1$ is extremely small?\n\nThe level shift circuit of Fig. 3.59(b) can be transformed to an electronic switch. For example, many applications employ the topology shown in Fig. 3.61(a) to \"sample\" $V_{out}$ across $C_1$ and \"freeze\" the value when $S_1$ turns off. Let us replace $S_1$ with the level shift circuit and allow $I_1$ to be turned on and off [Fig. 3.61(b)]. If $I_1$ is on, $V_{out}$ tracks $V_{in}$ except for a level shift equal to $V_{D,on}$. When $I_1$ turns off, so does $D_1$, evidently disconnecting $C_1$ from the input and freezing the voltage across $C_1$.\n\nFigure 3.61 (a) Switched-capacitor circuit, (b) realization of (a) using a diode as a switch.\n\nThe circuit diagram (a) is a basic switched-capacitor circuit where the switch SW samples the input voltage $V_{in}$ across the capacitor $C_1$. When the switch is closed, $V_{out}$ follows $V_{in}$. When the switch is open, the voltage across $C_1$ is held constant, effectively 'freezing' the sampled voltage.\n\nThe circuit diagram (b) shows a switched-capacitor circuit with a diode $D_1$ used as a switch to sample and hold the input voltage $V_{in}$ across capacitor $C_1$. The current source $I_1$ is used to control the operation of the diode, allowing $V_{out}$ to track $V_{in}$ when $I_1$ is on, and freezing the voltage across $C_1$ when $I_1$ is off. The circuit illustrates a level-shifting operation where the output voltage $V_{out}$ is offset by the diode's forward voltage drop when conducting.\n\nFigure 3.61 (a) Switched-capacitor circuit, (b) realization of (a) using a diode as a switch.\n\nWhat happens if $I_1$ is extremely small?\n\nThe level shift circuit of Fig. 3.59(b) can be transformed into an electronic switch.

In our initial attempt, we examine the circuit shown in Fig. 3.59(a) as a potential solution for decreasing the level by $V_{D, on}$.

To address this, we alter the circuit as depicted in Fig. 3.59(b), where $I_{1}$ supplies a constant current, establishing $V_{D, on}$ across $D_{1}$.

In Figure 3.59 (a), the input voltage $V_{in}$ is applied to the anode of diode $D1$, and the output voltage $V_{out}$ is taken from the cathode, shifting the DC level of the input signal down by the diode's forward voltage drop, $V_{D,on}$.

    "text": "In crafting electronic circuits, it is often necessary to adjust the mean voltage level of a signal, either increasing or decreasing it, to ensure compatibility with subsequent stages, such as amplifiers, which may not function correctly with the current direct current (DC) level.\n\nBy maintaining a stable forward bias voltage, a diode can act as a power source, enabling it to modify signal levels. Our initial approach involves the circuit illustrated in Fig. 3.59(a), which is considered for decreasing the level by $V_{D,on}$. Nevertheless, the diode's current is uncertain and dependent on the following stage. To address this, we adjust the circuit as shown in Fig. 3.59(b), where $I_1$ supplies a steady current, establishing $V_{D,on}$ across $D_1$. If the subsequent stage draws negligible (or at least constant) current, $V_{\\text{out}}$ is simply $V_{D,on}$ lower than $V_{\\text{in}}$.\n\nFigures 3.59(a) and 3.59(b) depict circuits utilizing a diode for level shifting. In Figure 3.59(a), the input voltage $V_{in}$ is applied to the anode of diode $D_1$, with the output voltage $V_{out}$ taken from the cathode, effectively shifting the DC level of the input signal down by the diode's forward voltage drop, $V_{D,on}$. Figure 3.59(b) represents a level shifter that shifts the input voltage down by $V_{D,on}$, employing a constant current source $I_1$ to maintain this voltage across diode $D_1$.\n\nFigure 3.60 portrays a circuit intended to elevate the DC level of a signal by $2 V_{D,on}$. The schematic shows two diodes in series, achieving the required voltage level shift. The circuit operates by applying the input to the cathode and uses two diodes in series to obtain a shift of $2 V_{D,on}$. The circuit ensures that any AC signal superimposed on the DC level at the input will appear at the output with its DC level shifted upwards by $2 V_{D,on}$.\n\nIn scenarios where $I_1$ is significantly reduced, the level shift circuit of Fig. 3.59(b) can be adapted to function as an electronic switch. For instance, the topology in Fig. 3.61(a) is commonly used to \"sample\" $V_{\\text{in}}$ across $C_1$ and \"freeze\" its value when $S_1$ is deactivated. By substituting $S_1$ with the level shift circuit and allowing $I_1$ to be toggled [Fig. 3.61(b)], if $I_1$ is active, $V_{\\text{out}}$ mirrors $V_{\\text{in}}$ minus the level shift equal to $V_{D,on}$. When $I_1$ is turned off, $D_1$ also switches off, seemingly isolating $C_1$ from the input and preserving the voltage across $C_1$.\n\nFigures 3.61(a) through 3.61(e) illustrate various configurations of switched-capacitor circuits utilizing diodes as switches to sample and hold input voltages. The behavior of these circuits over time is depicted in the waveform graphs, showing how the output voltage $V_{\\text{out}}$ tracks or holds the input voltage $V_{\\text{in}}$ based on the state of the diodes and current sources.\n\nThe term \"evidently\" was used because the actual circuit behavior slightly deviates from the described operation. The assumption that $D_1$ switches off is valid only if $C_1$ draws no current from $D_1$, meaning $V_{\\text{in}} - V_{\\text{out}}$ must remain below $V_{D,on}$. In the scenario depicted in Fig. 3.61(c), when $I_1$ is turned off at $t=t_1$, $C_1$ stores a value equal to $V_{i n 1} - V_{D,on}$. As the input waveform undergoes a negative swing and surpasses $V_{\\text{in } 1}$ at $t=t_2$, the diode becomes forward-biased again, charging $C_1$ with the input, similar to a peak detector. Thus, even with $I_1$ off, $D_1$ conducts during part of the cycle.\n\nTo rectify this, the circuit is altered as shown in Fig. 3.61(d), with $D_2$ placed between $D_1$ and $C_1$, and $I_2$ providing a bias current for $D_2$. With both $I_1$ and $I_2$ active, the diodes operate in forward bias, $V_X = V_{\\text{in}} - V_{D_1}$, and $V_{\\text{out}} = V_X + V_{D_2} = V_{\\text{in}}$ if $V_{D_1} = V_{D_2}$. Hence, $V_{\\text{out}}$ follows $V_{\\text{in}}$ without any level shift. When $I_1$ and $I_2$ are turned off, the circuit resembles Fig. 3.61(e), where the back-to-back diodes prevent conduction for any $V_{\\text{in}} - V_{\\text{out}}$ value, isolating $C_1$ from the input.\n\nRecall from Chapter 2 that diodes exhibit junction capacitance in reverse bias. Figure 3.62 demonstrates the impact of this capacitance on the circuit's operation. The equivalent circuit for the case where the diodes are off suggests that the input's conduction through the junction capacitances disturbs the output.

The exercise involves calculating the change in the voltage at the left plate of $C_{j_1}$ (relative to ground) in terms of $\\Delta V_{i"
