# Physics of Bipolar Transistors

The bipolar transistor was invented in 1945 by Shockley, Brattain, and Bardeen at Bell Laboratories, subsequently replacing vacuum tubes in electronic systems and paving the way for integrated circuits.

In this chapter, we analyze the structure and operation of bipolar transistors, preparing ourselves for the study of circuits employing such devices. Following the same thought process as in Chapter 2 for $p n$ junctions, we aim to understand the physics of the transistor, derive equations that represent its I/V characteristics, and develop an equivalent model that can be used in circuit analysis and design. The outline below illustrates the sequence of concepts introduced in this chapter.

## 4.1 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

In its simplest form, the bipolar transistor can be viewed as a voltage-dependent current source. We first show how such a current source can form an amplifier and hence why bipolar devices are useful and interesting.

Consider the voltage-dependent current source depicted in Fig. 4.1(a), where $I_{1}$ is proportional to $V_{1}: I_{1}=K V_{1}$. Note that $K$ has a dimension of resistance ${ }^{-1}$. For example, with $K=0.001 \Omega^{-1}$, an input voltage of 1 V yields an output current of 1 mA . Let us now construct the circuit shown in Fig. 4.1(b), where a voltage source $V_{\text {in }}$ controls $I_{1}$ and the output current flows through a load resistor $R_{L}$, producing $V_{\text {out }}$. Our objective is to demonstrate that this circuit can operate as an amplifier, i.e., $V_{\text {out }}$ is an amplified replica of $V_{\text {in }}$. Since $V_{1}=V_{\text {in }}$ and $V_{\text {out }}=-R_{L} I_{1}$, we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text {out }}=-K R_{L} V_{\text {in }} \tag{4.1}
\end{equation*}
$$

Figure 4.1 (a) Voltage-dependent current source, (b) simple amplifier.

Interestingly, if $K R_{L}>1$, then the circuit amplifies the input. The negative sign indicates that the output is an "inverted" replica of the input circuit [Fig. 4.1(b)]. The amplification factor or "voltage gain" of the circuit, $A_{V}$, is defined as

$$
\begin{align*}
A_{V} & =\frac{V_{\text {out }}}{V_{\text {in }}}  \tag{4.2}\\
& =-K R_{L} \tag{4.3}
\end{align*}
$$

and depends on both the characteristics of the controlled current source and the load resistor. Note that $K$ signifies how strongly $V_{1}$ controls $I_{1}$, thus directly affecting the gain.

Figure 4.2 Voltage-dependent current source with an internal resistance $r_{\text {in }}$.

Solution Since $V_{1}$ is equal to $V_{i n}$ regardless of the value of $r_{i n}$, the voltage gain remains unchanged. This point proves useful in our analyses later.

Exercise Repeat the above example if $r_{i n}=\infty$.

The foregoing study reveals that a voltage-controlled current source can indeed provide signal amplification. Bipolar transistors are an example of such current sources and can ideally be modeled as shown in Fig. 4.3.Note that the device contains three terminals and its output current is an exponential function of $V_{1}$. We will see in Section 4.4.4 that under certain conditions, this model can be approximated by that in Fig. 4.1(a).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_67d4cb928f727340196cg-38.jpg?height=572&width=1074&top_left_y=816&top_left_x=1723)

Figure 4.3 Exponential voltage-dependent current source.

As three-terminal devices, bipolar transistors make the analysis of circuits more difficult. Having dealt with two-terminal components such as resistors, capacitors, inductors, and diodes in elementary circuit analysis and the previous chapters of this book, we are accustomed to a one-to-one correspondence between the current through and the voltage across each device. With three-terminal elements, on the other hand, one may consider the current and voltage between every two terminals, arriving at a complex set of equations. Fortunately, as we develop our understanding of the transistor's operation, we discard some of these current and voltage combinations as irrelevant, thus obtaining a relatively simple model.

## 4.2 STRUCTURE OF BIPOLAR TRANSISTOR

The bipolar transistor consists of three doped regions forming a sandwich. Shown in Fig. 4.4(a) is an example comprising of a $p$ layer sandwiched between two $n$ regions and called an "npn" transistor. The three terminals are called the "base," the "emitter," and the "collector." As explained later, the emitter "emits" charge carriers and the collector "collects" them while the base controls the number of carriers that make this journey. The circuit symbol for the $n p n$ transistor is shown in Fig. 4.4(b). We denote the terminal voltages by $V_{E}, V_{B}$, and $V_{C}$, and the voltage differences by $V_{B E}, V_{C B}$, and $V_{C E}$. The transistor is labeled $Q_{1}$ here.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_67d4cb928f727340196cg-38.jpg?height=971&width=1599&top_left_y=3670&top_left_x=1484)

Figure 4.4 (a) Structure and (b) circuit symbol of bipolar transistor.
We readily note from Fig. 4.4(a) that the device contains two $p n$ junction diodes: one between the base and the emitter and another between the base and the collector. For example, if the base is more positive than the emitter, $V_{B E}>0$, then this junction is forward-biased. While this simple diagram may suggest that the device is symmetric with
respect to the emitter and the collector, in reality, the dimensions and doping levels of these two regions are quite different. In other words, $E$ and $C$ cannot be interchanged. We will also see that proper operation requires a thin base region, e.g., about $100 \AA$ in modern integrated bipolar transistors.

As mentioned in the previous section, the possible combinations of voltages and currents for a three-terminal device can prove overwhelming. For the device in Fig. 4.4(a), $V_{B E}, V_{B C}$, and $V_{C E}$ can assume positive or negative values, leading to $2^{3}$ possibilities for the terminal voltages of the transistor. Fortunately, only one of these eight combinations finds practical value and comes into our focus here.

Before continuing with the bipolar transistor, it is instructive to study an interesting effect in pn junctions. Consider the reverse-biased junction depicted in Fig. 4.5(a) and recall from Chapter 2 that the depletion region sustains a strong electric field. Now suppose an electron is somehow "injected" from outside into the right side of the depletion region. What happens to this electron? Serving as a minority carrier on the $p$ side, the electron experiences the electric field and is rapidly swept away into the $n$ side. The ability of a reverse-biased $p n$ junction to efficiently "collect" externally-injected electrons proves essential to the operation of the bipolar transistor.

Figure 4.5 Injection of electrons into depletion region.

## 4.3 OPERATION OF BIPOLAR TRANSISTOR IN ACTIVE MODE

In this section, we analyze the operation of the transistor, aiming to prove that, under certain conditions, it indeed acts as a voltage-controlled current source. More specifically, we intend to show that (a) the current flow from the emitter to the collector can be viewed as a current source tied between these two terminals, and (b) this current is controlled by the voltage difference between the base and the emitter, $V_{B E}$.

We begin our study with the assumption that the base-emitter junction is forwardbiased $\left(V_{B E}>0\right)$ and the base-collector junction is reverse-biased $\left(V_{B C}<0\right)$. Under these conditions, we say the device is biased in the "forward active region" or simply in the "active mode." For example, with the emitter connected to ground, the base voltage is set to about 0.8 V and the collector voltage to a higher value, e.g., 1 V [Fig. 4.6(a)]. The base-collector junction therefore experiences a reverse bias of 0.2 V .

Let us now consider the operation of the transistor in the active mode. We may be tempted to simplify the example of Fig. 4.6(a) to the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 4.6(b). After all, it appears that the bipolar transistor simply consists of two diodes sharing their
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_67d4cb928f727340196cg-40.jpg?height=697&width=2855&top_left_y=559&top_left_x=833)

Figure 4.6 (a) Bipolar transistor with base and collector bias voltages, (b) simplistic view of bipolar transistor.
anodes at the base terminal. This view implies that $D_{1}$ carries a current and $D_{2}$ does not; i.e., we should anticipate current flow from the base to the emitter but no current through the collector terminal. Were this true, the transistor would not operate as a voltage-controlled current source and would prove of little value.

To understand why the transistor cannot be modeled as merely two back-to-back diodes, we must examine the flow of charge inside the device, bearing in mind that the base region is very thin. Since the base-emitter junction is forward-biased, electrons flow from the emitter to the base and holes from the base to the emitter. For proper transistor operation, the former current component must be much greater than the latter, requiring that the emitter doping level be much greater than that of the base (Chapter 2). Thus, we denote the emitter region with $n^{+}$, where the superscript emphasizes the high doping level. Figure 4.7(a) summarizes our observations thus far, indicating that the emitter
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_67d4cb928f727340196cg-40.jpg?height=1702&width=2855&top_left_y=3116&top_left_x=850)

Figure 4.7 (a) Flow of electrons and holes through base-emitter junction, (b) electrons approaching collector junction, (c) electrons passing through collector junction.
injects a large number of electrons into the base while receiving a small number of holes from it.

What happens to electrons as they enter the base? Since the base region is thin, most of the electrons reach the edge of the collector-base depletion region, beginning to experience the built-in electric field. Consequently, as illustrated in Fig. 4.5, the electrons are swept into the collector region (as in Fig. 4.5) and absorbed by the positive battery terminal. Figures 4.7(b) and (c) illustrate this effect in "slow motion." We therefore observe that the reverse-biased collector-base junction carries a current because minority carriers are "injected" into its depletion region.

Let us summarize our thoughts. In the active mode, an npn bipolar transistor carries a large number of electrons from the emitter, through the base, to the collector while drawing a small current of holes through the base terminal. We must now answer several questions. First, how do electrons travel through the base: by drift or diffusion? Second, how does the resulting current depend on the terminal voltages? Third, how large is the base current?

Operating as a moderate conductor, the base region sustains but a small electric field, i.e., it allows most of the field to drop across the base-emitter depletion layer. Thus, as explained for $p n$ junctions in Chapter 2, the drift current in the base is negligible, ${ }^{1}$ leaving diffusion as the principal mechanism for the flow of electrons injected by the emitter. In fact, two observations directly lead to the necessity of diffusion: (1) redrawing the diagram of Fig. 2.29 for the emitter-base junction [Fig. 4.8(a)], we recognize that the density of electrons at $x=x_{1}$ is very high; (2) since any electron arriving at $x=x_{2}$ in Fig. 4.8(b) is swept away, the density of electrons falls to zero at this point. As a result,
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_67d4cb928f727340196cg-41.jpg?height=1624&width=2843&top_left_y=3001&top_left_x=936)

Figure 4.8 (a) Hole and electron profiles at base-emitter junction, (b) zero electron density near collector, (c) electron profile in base.

[^14]the electron density in the base assumes the profile depicted in Fig. 4.8(c), providing a gradient for the diffusion of electrons.

### 4.3.1 Collector Current

We now address the second question raised previously and compute the current flowing from the collector to the emitter. ${ }^{2}$ As a forward-biased diode, the base-emitter junction exhibits a high concentration of electrons at $x=x_{1}$ in Fig. 4.8(c) given by Eq. (2.96):

$$
\begin{align*}
\Delta n\left(x_{1}\right) & =\frac{N_{E}}{\exp \frac{V_{0}}{V_{T}}}\left(\exp \frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}-1\right)  \tag{4.4}\\
& =\frac{N_{B}}{n_{i}^{2}}\left(\exp \frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}-1\right) \tag{4.5}
\end{align*}
$$

Here, $N_{E}$ and $N_{B}$ denote the doping levels in the emitter and the base, respectively, and we have utilized the relationship $\exp \left(V_{0} / V_{T}\right)=N_{E} N_{B} / n_{i}^{2}$. In this chapter, we assume $V_{T}=26 \mathrm{mV}$. Applying the law of diffusion [Eq. (2.42)], we determine the flow of electrons into the collector as

$$
\begin{align*}
J_{n} & =q D_{n} \frac{d n}{d x}  \tag{4.6}\\
& =q D_{n} \cdot \frac{0-\Delta n\left(x_{1}\right)}{W_{B}} \tag{4.7}
\end{align*}
$$

where $W_{B}$ is the width of the base region. Multipling this quantity by the emitter cross section area, $A_{E}$, substituting for $\Delta n\left(x_{1}\right)$ from Eq. (4.5), and changing the sign to obtain the conventional current, we obtain

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{C}=\frac{A_{E} q D_{n} n_{i}^{2}}{N_{B} W_{B}}\left(\exp \frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}-1\right) \tag{4.8}
\end{equation*}
$$

In analogy with the diode current equation and assuming $\exp \left(V_{B E} / V_{T}\right) \gg 1$, we write

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{C}=I_{S} \exp \frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}} \tag{4.9}
\end{equation*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{S}=\frac{A_{E} q D_{n} n_{i}^{2}}{N_{B} W_{B}} \tag{4.10}
\end{equation*}
$$

Equation (4.9) implies that the bipolar transistor indeed operates as a voltagecontrolled current source, proving a good candidate for amplification. We may alternatively say the transistor performs "voltage-to-current conversion."

[^15]Example 4.2

Determine the current $I_{X}$ in Fig. 4.9(a) if $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ are identical and operate in the active mode and $V_{1}=V_{2}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_67d4cb928f727340196cg-43.jpg?height=589&width=1360&top_left_y=1201&top_left_x=1820)

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_67d4cb928f727340196cg-43.jpg?height=1299&width=2351&top_left_y=1796&top_left_x=1176)
(b)

Figure 4.9 (a) Two identical transistors drawing current from $V_{C}$, (b) equivalence to a single transistor having twice the area.

Solution $\quad$ Since $I_{X}=I_{C 1}+I_{C 2}$, we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{X} \approx 2 \frac{A_{E} q D_{n} n_{i}^{2}}{N_{B} W_{B}} \exp \frac{V_{1}}{V_{T}} \tag{4.11}
\end{equation*}
$$

This result can also be viewed as the collector current of a single transistor having an emitter area of $2 A_{E}$. In fact, redrawing the circuit as shown in Fig. 4.9(b) and noting that $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ experience identical voltages at their respective terminals, we say the two transistors are "in parallel," operating as a single transistor with twice the emitter area of each.

Exercise Repeat the above example if $Q_{1}$ has an emitter area of $A_{E}$ and $Q_{2}$ an emitter area of $8 A_{E}$.

Example In the circuit of Fig. 4.9 (a), $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ are identical and operate in the active mode.
4.3 Determine $V_{1}-V_{2}$ such that $I_{C 1}=10 I_{C 2}$.

Solution From Eq. (4.9), we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{I_{C 1}}{I_{C 2}}=\frac{I_{S} \exp \frac{V_{1}}{V_{T}}}{I_{S} \exp \frac{V_{2}}{V_{T}}} \tag{4.12}
\end{equation*}
$$

and hence

$$
\begin{equation*}
\exp \frac{V_{1}-V_{2}}{V_{T}}=10 \tag{4.13}
\end{equation*}
$$

That is,

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{1}-V_{2} & =V_{T} \ln 10  \tag{4.14}\\
& \approx 60 \mathrm{mV} \text { at } T=300 \mathrm{~K} \tag{4.15}
\end{align*}
$$

Identical to Eq. (2.109), this result is, of course, expected because the exponential dependence of $I_{C}$ upon $V_{B E}$ indicates a behavior similar to that of diodes. We therefore consider the base-emitter voltage of the transistor relatively constant and approximately equal to 0.8 V for typical collector current levels.

Exercise $\quad$ Repeat the above example if $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ have different emitter areas, i.e., $A_{E 1}=n A_{E 2}$.

Example Typical discrete bipolar transistors have a large area, e.g., $500 \mu \mathrm{~m} \times 500 \mu \mathrm{~m}$, whereas
4.4 modern integrated devices may have an area as small as $0.5 \mu \mathrm{~m} \times 0.2 \mu \mathrm{~m}$. Assuming other device parameters are identical, determine the difference between the base-emitter voltage of two such transistors for equal collector currents.

Solution From Eq. (4.9), we have $V_{B E}=V_{T} \ln \left(I_{C} / I_{S}\right)$ and hence

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{B E i n t}-V_{B E d i s}=V_{T} \ln \frac{I_{S 1}}{I_{S 2}} \tag{4.16}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $V_{B E i n t}=V_{T} \ln \left(I_{C 2} / I_{S 2}\right)$ and $V_{B E d i s}=V_{T} \ln \left(I_{C 1} / I_{S 1}\right)$ denote the base-emitter voltages of the integrated and discrete devices, respectively. Since $I_{S} \propto A_{E}$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{B E i n t}-V_{B E d i s}=V_{T} \ln \frac{A_{E 2}}{A_{E 1}} \tag{4.17}
\end{equation*}
$$

For this example, $A_{E 2} / A_{E 1}=2.5 \times 10^{6}$, yielding

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text {BEint }}-V_{\text {BEdis }}=383 \mathrm{mV} \tag{4.18}
\end{equation*}
$$

In practice, however, $V_{\text {BEint }}-V_{\text {BEdis }}$ falls in the range of 100 to 150 mV because of differences in the base width and other parameters. The key point here is that $V_{B E}=800 \mathrm{mV}$ is a reasonable approximation for integrated transistors and should be lowered to about 700 mV for discrete devices.

Exercise Repeat the above comparison for a very small integrated device with an emitter area of $0.15 \mu \mathrm{~m} \times 0.15 \mu$.

Since many applications deal with voltage quantities, the collector current generated by a bipolar transistor typically flows through a resistor to produce a voltage.

Exercise What happens if the load resistor is halved?

Equation (4.9) reveals an interesting property of the bipolar transistor: the collector current does not depend on the collector voltage (so long as the device remains in the active mode). Thus, for a fixed base-emitter voltage, the device draws a constant current, acting as a current source [Fig. 4.11(a)]. Plotted in Fig. 4.11(b) is the current as a function of the collector-emitter voltage, exhibiting a constant value for $V_{C E}>V_{1}{ }^{3}$ Constant current sources find application in many electronic circuits and we will see numerous examples of their usage in this book. In Section 4.5, we study the behavior of the transistor for $V_{C E}<V_{B E}$.

### 4.3.2 Base and Emitter Currents

Having determined the collector current, we now turn our attention to the base and emitter currents and their dependence on the terminal voltages. Since the bipolar transistor must satisfy Kirchoff's current law, calculation of the base current readily yields the emitter current as well.

[^16]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_67d4cb928f727340196cg-46.jpg?height=1028&width=2495&top_left_y=673&top_left_x=1024)

Figure 4.12 Base current resulting from holes (a) crossing to emitter and (b) recombining with electrons.

In the npn transistor of Fig. 4.12 (a), the base current, $I_{B}$, results from the flow of holes. Recall from Eq. (2.99) that the hole and electron currents in a forward-biased pn junction bear a constant ratio given by the doping levels and other parameters. Thus, the number of holes entering from the base to the emitter is a constant fraction of the number of electrons traveling from the emitter to the base. As an example, for every 200 electrons injected by the emitter, one hole must be supplied by the base.

In practice, the base current contains an additional component of holes. As the electrons injected by the emitter travel through the base, some may "recombine" with the holes [Fig. 4.12 (b)]; inessence, some electrons and holes are "wasted" as a result of recombination. For example, on the average, out of every 200 electrons injected by the emitter, one recombines with a hole.

In summary, the base current must supply holes for both reverse injection into the emitter and recombination with the electrons traveling toward the collector. We can therefore view $I_{B}$ as a constant fraction of $I_{E}$ or a constant fraction of $I_{C}$. It is common to write

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{C}=\beta I_{B}, \tag{4.20}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\beta$ is called the "current gain" of the transistor because it shows how much the base current is "amplified." Depending on the device structure, the $\beta$ of $n p n$ transistors typically ranges from 50 to 200.

In order to determine the emitter current, we apply the KCL to the transistor with the current directions depicted in Fig. 4.12 (a):

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{E} & =I_{C}+I_{B}  \tag{4.21}\\
& =I_{C}\left(1+\frac{1}{\beta}\right) . \tag{4.22}
\end{align*}
$$

We can summarize our findings as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{C} & =I_{S} \exp \frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}  \tag{4.23}\\
I_{B} & =\frac{1}{\beta} I_{S} \exp \frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}  \tag{4.24}\\
I_{E} & =\frac{\beta+1}{\beta} I_{S} \exp \frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}} . \tag{4.25}
\end{align*}
$$

It is sometimes useful to write $I_{C}=[\beta /(\beta+1)] I_{E}$ and denote $\beta /(\beta+1)$ by $\alpha$. For $\beta=100$, $\alpha=0.99$, suggesting that $\alpha \approx 1$ and $I_{C} \approx I_{E}$ are reasonable approximations. In this book, we assume that the collector and emitter currents are approximately equal.

Example
4.6

A bipolar transistor having $I_{S}=5 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{~A}$ is biased in the forward active region with $V_{B E}=750 \mathrm{mV}$. If the current gain varies from 50 to 200 due to manufacturing variations, calculate the minimum and maximum terminal currents of the device.

Solution For a given $V_{B E}$, the collector current remains independent of $\beta$ :

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{C} & =I_{S} \exp \frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}  \tag{4.26}\\
& =1.685 \mathrm{~mA} \tag{4.27}
\end{align*}
$$

The base current varies from $I_{C} / 200$ to $I_{C} / 50$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
8.43 \mu \mathrm{~A}<I_{B}<33.7 \mu \mathrm{~A} \tag{4.28}
\end{equation*}
$$

On the other hand, the emitter current experiences only a small variation because $(\beta+1) / \beta$ is near unity for large $\beta$ :

$$
\begin{align*}
1.005 I_{C} & <I_{E}<1.02 I_{C}  \tag{4.29}\\
1.693 \mathrm{~mA} & <I_{E}<1.719 \mathrm{~mA} \tag{4.30}
\end{align*}
$$

Exercise Repeat the above example if the area of the transistor is doubled.

## 4.4 BIPOLAR TRANSISTOR MODELS AND CHARACTERISTICS

### 4.4.1 Large-Signal Model

With our understanding of the transistor operation in the forward active region and the derivation of Eqs. (4.23)-(4.25), we can now construct a model that proves useful in the analysis and design of circuits-in a manner similar to the developments in Chapter 2 for the $p n$ junction.

Since the base-emitter junction is forward-biased in the active mode, we can place a diode between the base and emit-

Did you know?

The first bipolar transistor introduced by Bell Labs in 1948 was implemented in germanium rather than silicon, had a base thickness of about $30 \mu \mathrm{~m}$, and provided a maximum operation frequency (called the "transit frequency") of 10 MHz . By contrast, bipolar transistors realized in today's silicon integrated circuits have a base thickness less than $0.01 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ and a transit frequency of several hundred gigahertz.
ter terminals. Moreover, since the current drawn from the collector and flowing into the emitter depends on only the base-emitter voltage, we add a voltage-controlled current source between the collector and the emitter, arriving at the model shown in Fig. 4.13. As illustrated in Fig. 4.11, this current remains independent of the collector-emitter voltage.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_67d4cb928f727340196cg-47.jpg?height=595&width=1148&top_left_y=4155&top_left_x=1778)

Figure 4.13 Large-signal model of bipolar transistor in active region.

But how do we ensure that the current flowing through the diode is equal to $1 / \beta$ times the collector current? Equation (4.24) suggests that the base current is equal to that of a diode having a reverse saturation current of $I_{S} / \beta$. Thus, the base-emitter junction is modeled by a diode whose cross section area is $1 / \beta$ times that of the actual emitter area.

With the interdependencies of currents and voltages in a bipolar transistor, the reader may wonder about the cause and effect relationships. We view the chain of dependencies as $V_{B E} \rightarrow I_{C} \rightarrow I_{B} \rightarrow I_{E}$; i.e., the base-emitter voltage generates a collector current, which requires a proportional base current, and the sum of the two flows through the emitter.

Example
4.7

Consider the circuit shown in Fig. 4.14 (a), where $I_{S, Q 1}=5 \times 10^{-17} \mathrm{~A}$ and $V_{B E}=$ 800 mV . Assume $\beta=100$. (a) Determine the transistor terminal currents and voltages and verify that the device indeed operates in the active mode. (b) Determine the maximum value of $R_{C}$ that permits operation in the active mode.

(b)

Figure 4.14 (a) Simple stage with biasing, (b) variation of collector voltage as a function of collector resistance.

Solution (a) Using Eq. (4.23)-(4.25), we have

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{C} & =1.153 \mathrm{~mA}  \tag{4.31}\\
I_{B} & =11.53 \mu \mathrm{~A}  \tag{4.32}\\
I_{E} & =1.165 \mathrm{~mA} . \tag{4.33}
\end{align*}
$$

The base and emitter voltages are equal to +800 mV and zero, respectively. We must now calculate the collector voltage, $V_{X}$. Writing a KVL from the 2-V power supply and $\operatorname{across} R_{C}$ and $Q_{1}$, we obtain

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{C C}=R_{C} I_{C}+V_{X} \tag{4.34}
\end{equation*}
$$

That is,

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{X}=1.424 \mathrm{~V} \tag{4.35}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since the collector voltage is more positive than the base voltage, this junction is reversebiased and the transistor operates in the active mode.
(b) What happens to the circuit as $R_{C}$ increases? Since the voltage drop across the resistor, $R_{C} I_{C}$, increases while $V_{C C}$ is constant, the voltage at node $X$ drops.

The device approaches the "edge" of the forward active region if the base-collector voltage falls to zero, i.e., as $V_{X} \rightarrow+800 \mathrm{mV}$. Rewriting Eq. (4.33) yields:

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{C}=\frac{V_{C C}-V_{X}}{I_{C}}, \tag{4.36}
\end{equation*}
$$

which, for $V_{X}=+800 \mathrm{mV}$, reduces to

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{C}=1041 \Omega \tag{4.37}
\end{equation*}
$$

Figure 4.14(b) plots $V_{X}$ as a function of $R_{C}$.
This example implies that there exists a maximum allowable value of the collector resistance, $R_{C}$, in the circuit of Fig. 4.14(a). As we will see in Chapter 5, this limits the voltage gain that the circuit can provide.

Exercise In the above example, what is the minimum allowable value of $V_{C C}$ for transistor operation in the active mode? Assume $R_{C}=500 \Omega$.

The reader may wonder why the equivalent circuit of Fig. 4.13 is called the "large-signal model." After all, the above example apparently contains no signals! This terminology emphasizes that the model can be used for arbitrarily large voltage and current changes in the transistor (so long as the device operates in the active mode). For example, if the base-emitter voltage varies from 800 mV to 300 mV , and hence the collector current by many orders of magnitude, ${ }^{4}$ the model still applies. This is in contrast to the small-signal model, studied in Section 4.4.4.

### 4.4.2 I/V Characteristics

The large-signal model naturally leads to the I/V characteristics of the transistor. With three terminal currents and voltages, we may envision plotting different currents as a function of the potential difference between every two terminals-an elaborate task. However, as explained below, only a few of such characteristics prove useful.

The first characteristic to study is, of course, the exponential relationship inherent in the device. Figure 4.15 (a) plots $I_{C}$ versus $V_{B E}$ with the assumption that the collector voltage is constant and no lower than the base voltage. As shown in Fig. 4.11, $I_{C}$ is independent of $V_{C E}$; thus, different values of $V_{C E}$ do not alter the characteristic.

Next, we examine $I_{C}$ for a given $V_{B E}$ but with $V_{C E}$ varying. Illustrated in Fig. 4.15(b), the characteristic is a horizontal line because $I_{C}$ is constant if the device remains in the active mode $\left(V_{C E}>V_{B E}\right)$. On the other hand, if different values are chosen for $V_{B E}$, the characteristic moves up or down.

The two plots of Fig. 4.15 constitute the principal characteristics of interest in most analysis and design tasks. Equations (4.24) and (4.25) suggest that the base and emitter currents follow the same behavior.

For a bipolar transistor, $I_{S}=5 \times 10^{-17} \mathrm{~A}$ and $\beta=100$. Construct the $I_{C}-V_{B E}, I_{C}-V_{C E}$, $I_{B}-V_{B E}$, and $I_{B}-V_{C E}$ characteristics.

Solution We determine a few points along the $I_{C}-V_{B E}$ characteristics, e.g.,

$$
\begin{align*}
& V_{B E 1}=700 \mathrm{mV} \Rightarrow I_{C 1}=24.6 \mu \mathrm{~A}  \tag{4.38}\\
& V_{B E 2}=750 \mathrm{mV} \Rightarrow I_{C 2}=169 \mu \mathrm{~A}  \tag{4.39}\\
& V_{B E 3}=800 \mathrm{mV} \Rightarrow I_{C 3}=1.153 \mathrm{~mA} \tag{4.40}
\end{align*}
$$

The characteristic is depicted in Fig. 4.16 (a).

Using the values obtained above, we can also plot the $I_{C}-V_{C E}$ characteristic as shown in Fig. 4.16(b), concluding that the transistor operates as a constant current source of, e.g., $169 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ if its base-emitter voltage is held at 750 mV . We also remark that, for equal increments in $V_{B E}, I_{C}$ jumps by increasingly greater steps: $24.6 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ to $169 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ to 1.153 mA . We return to this property in Section 4.4.3.

For $I_{B}$ characteristics, we simply divide the $I_{C}$ values by 100 [Figs. 4.16(c) and (d)].
Exercise What change in $V_{B E}$ doubles the base current?

The reader may wonder what exactly we learn from the I/V characteristics. After all, compared to Eqs. (4.23)-(4.25), the plots impart no additional information. However, as we will see throughout this book, the visualization of equations by means of such plots greatly enhances our understanding of the devices and the circuits employing them.

### 4.4.3 Concept of Transconductance

Our study thus far shows that the bipolar transistor acts as a voltage-dependent current source (when operating in the forward active region). An important question that arises here is, how is the performance of such a device quantified? In other words, what is the measure of the "goodness" of a voltage-dependent current source?

The example depicted in Fig. 4.1 suggests that the device becomes "stronger" as $K$ increases because a given input voltage yields a larger output current. We must therefore concentrate on the voltage-to-current conversion property of the transistor, particularly as it relates to amplification of signals. More specifically, we ask, if a signal changes the base-emitter voltage of a transistor by a small amount (Fig. 4.17), how much change is produced in the collector current? Denoting the change in $I_{C}$ by $\Delta I_{C}$, we recognize that the "strength" of the device can be represented by $\Delta I_{C} / \Delta V_{B E}$. For example, if a base-emitter voltage change of 1 mV results in a $\Delta I_{C}$ of 0.1 mA in one transistor and 0.5 mA in another, we can view the latter as a better voltage-dependent current source or "voltage-to-current converter."

The ratio $\Delta I_{C} / \Delta V_{B E}$ approaches $d I_{C} / d V_{B E}$ for very small changes and, in the limit, is called the "transconductance," $g_{m}$ :*

$$
\begin{equation*}
g_{m}=\frac{d I_{C}}{d V_{B E}} . \tag{4.41}
\end{equation*}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_67d4cb928f727340196cg-51.jpg?height=555&width=971&top_left_y=4015&top_left_x=1866)

Figure 4.17 Test circuit for measurement of $g_{m}$.
${ }^{*}$ Note that $V_{C E}$ is constant here.

Note that this definition applies to any device that approximates a voltage-dependent current source (e.g., another type of transistor described in Chapter 6). For a bipolar transistor, Eq. (4.9) gives

$$
\begin{align*}
g_{m} & =\frac{d}{d V_{B E}}\left(I_{S} \exp \frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}\right)  \tag{4.42}\\
& =\frac{1}{V_{T}} I_{S} \exp \frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}  \tag{4.43}\\
& =\frac{I_{C}}{V_{T}} \tag{4.44}
\end{align*}
$$

The close resemblance between this result and the small-signal resistance of diodes [Eq. (3.58)] is no coincidence and will become clearer in the next chapter.

Equation (4.44) reveals that, as $I_{C}$ increases, the transistor becomes a better amplifying device by producing larger collector current excursions in response to a given signal level applied between the base and the emitter. The transconductance may be expressed in $\Omega^{-1}$ or "siemens," S. For example, if $I_{C}=1 \mathrm{~mA}$, then with $V_{T}=26 \mathrm{mV}$, we have

$$
\begin{align*}
g_{m} & =0.0385 \Omega^{-1}  \tag{4.45}\\
& =0.0385 \mathrm{~S}  \tag{4.46}\\
& =38.5 \mathrm{mS} \tag{4.47}
\end{align*}
$$

However, as we will see throughout this book, it is often helpful to view $g_{m}$ as the inverse of a resistance; e.g., for $I_{C}=1 \mathrm{~mA}$, we may write

$$
\begin{equation*}
g_{m}=\frac{1}{26 \Omega} \tag{4.48}
\end{equation*}
$$

The concept of transconductance can be visualized with the aid of the transistor I/V characteristics. As shown in Fig. 4.18, $g_{m}=d I_{C} / d V_{B E}$ simply represents the slope of $I_{C}-V_{B E}$ characteristic at a given collector current, $I_{C 0}$, and the corresponding base-emitter voltage, $V_{B E 0}$. In other words, if $V_{B E}$ experiences a small perturbation $\pm \Delta V$ around $V_{B E 0}$, then the collector current displays a change of $\pm g_{m} \Delta V$ around $I_{C 0}$, where $g_{m}=I_{C 0} / V_{T}$. Thus, the
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_67d4cb928f727340196cg-52.jpg?height=789&width=1205&top_left_y=4092&top_left_x=1658)

Figure 4.18 Illustration of transconductance.
value of $I_{C 0}$ must be chosen according to the required $g_{m}$ and, ultimately, the required gain. We say the transistor is "biased" at a collector current of $I_{C 0}$, meaning the device carries a bias (or "quiescent") current of $I_{C 0}$ in the absence of signals. ${ }^{5}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_67d4cb928f727340196cg-53.jpg?height=960&width=3192&top_left_y=1044&top_left_x=573)

Figure 4.19 (a) One transistor and (b) $n$ transistors providing transconductance.
Solution Since $I_{S} \propto A_{E}, I_{S}$ is multiplied by the same factor. Thus, $I_{C}=I_{S} \exp \left(V_{B E} / V_{T}\right)$ also rises by a factor of $n$ because $V_{B E}$ is constant. As a result, the transconductance increases by a factor of $n$. From another perspective, if $n$ identical transistors, each carrying a collector current of $I_{C 0}$, are placed in parallel, then the composite device exhibits a transconductance equal to $n$ times that of each [Fig. 4.19(b)]. On the other hand, if the total collector current remains unchanged, then so does the transconductance.

Exercise Repeat the above example if $V_{B E 0}$ is reduced by $V_{T} \ln n$.

It is also possible to study the transconductance in the context of the $I_{C}-V_{C E}$ characteristics of the transistor with $V_{B E}$ as a parameter. Illustrated in Fig. 4.20 for two different bias currents $I_{C 1}$ and $I_{C 2}$, the plots reveal that a change of $\Delta V$ in $V_{B E}$ results in a greater change in $I_{C}$ for operation around $I_{C 2}$ than around $I_{C 1}$ because $g_{m 2}>g_{m 1}$.

The derivation of $g_{m}$ in Eqs. (4.42)-(4.44) suggests that the transconductance is fundamentally a function of the collector current rather than the base current. For example, if $I_{C}$ remains constant but $\beta$ varies, then $g_{m}$ does not change but $I_{B}$ does. For this reason, the collector bias current plays a central role in the analysis and design, with the base current viewed as secondary, often undesirable effect.

As shown in Fig. 4.10,the current produced by the transistor may flow through a resistor to generate a proportional voltage. We exploit this concept in Chapter 5 to design amplifiers.

### 4.4.4 Small-Signal Model

Electronic circuits, e.g., amplifiers, may incorporate a large number of transistors, thus posing great difficulties in the analysis and design. Recall from Chapter 3 that diodes can

[^18]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_67d4cb928f727340196cg-54.jpg?height=852&width=1154&top_left_y=493&top_left_x=1683)

Figure 4.20 Transconductance for different collector bias currents.
be reduced to linear devices through the use of the small-signal model. A similar benefit accrues if a small-signal model can be developed for transistors.

The derivation of the small-signal model from the large-signal counterpart is relatively straightforward. We perturb the voltage difference between every two terminals (while the third terminal remains at a constant potential), determine the changes in the currents flowing through all terminals, and represent the results by proper circuit elements such as controlled current sources or resistors. Figure 4.21 depicts two conceptual examples where $V_{B E}$ or $V_{C E}$ is changed by $\Delta V$ and the changes in $I_{C}, I_{B}$, and $I_{E}$ are examined.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_67d4cb928f727340196cg-54.jpg?height=762&width=2343&top_left_y=2776&top_left_x=1089)

Figure 4.21 Excitation of bipolar transistor with small changes in (a) base-emitter and (b) collector-emitter voltage.

Let us begin with a change in $V_{B E}$ while the collector voltage is constant (Fig. 4.22).We know from the definition of transconductance that

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta I_{C}=g_{m} \Delta V_{B E} \tag{4.49}
\end{equation*}
$$

concluding that a voltage-controlled current source must be connected between the collector and the emitter with a value equal to $g_{m} \Delta V$. For simplicity, we denote $\Delta V_{B E}$ by $v_{\pi}$ and the change in the collector current by $g_{m} v_{\pi}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_67d4cb928f727340196cg-55.jpg?height=537&width=995&top_left_y=776&top_left_x=958)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_67d4cb928f727340196cg-55.jpg?height=516&width=1787&top_left_y=758&top_left_x=1972)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_67d4cb928f727340196cg-55.jpg?height=420&width=2738&top_left_y=1387&top_left_x=1001)

Figure 4.22 Development of small-signal model.
The change in $V_{B E}$ creates another change as well:

$$
\begin{align*}
\Delta I_{B} & =\frac{\Delta I_{C}}{\beta}  \tag{4.50}\\
& =\frac{g_{m}}{\beta} \Delta V_{B E} \tag{4.51}
\end{align*}
$$

That is, if the base-emitter voltage changes by $\Delta V_{B E}$, the current flowing between these two terminals changes by $\left(g_{m} / \beta\right) \Delta V_{B E}$. Since the voltage and current correspond to the same two terminals, they can be related by Ohm's Law, i.e., by a resistor placed between the base and emitter having a value:

$$
\begin{align*}
r_{\pi} & =\frac{\Delta V_{B E}}{\Delta I_{B}}  \tag{4.52}\\
& =\frac{\beta}{g_{m}} \tag{4.53}
\end{align*}
$$

Thus, the forward-biased diode between the base and the emitter is modeled by a small-signal resistance equal to $\beta / g_{m}$. This result is expected because the diode carries a bias current equal to $I_{C} / \beta$ and, from Eq. (3.58), exhibits a small-signal resistance of $V_{T} /\left(I_{C} / \beta\right)=\beta\left(V_{T} / I_{C}\right)=\beta / g_{m}$.

We now turn our attention to the collector and apply a voltage change with respect to the emitter (Fig. 4.23). As illustrated in Fig. 4.11, for a constant $V_{B E}$, the collector voltage has no effect on $I_{C}$ or $I_{B}$ because $I_{C}=I_{S} \exp \left(V_{B E} / V_{T}\right)$ and $I_{B}=I_{C} / \beta$. Since $\Delta V_{C E}$ leads to no change in any of the terminal currents, the model developed in Fig. 4.22 need not be altered.

How about a change in the collector-base voltage? As studied in Problem 4.18, such a change also results in a zero change in the terminal currents.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_67d4cb928f727340196cg-55.jpg?height=566&width=2804&top_left_y=4443&top_left_x=950)

Figure 4.23 Response of bipolar transistor to small change in $V_{C E}$.

The simple small-signal model developed in Fig. 4.22 serves as a powerful, versatile tool in the analysis and design of bipolar circuits. We should remark that both parameters of the model, $g_{m}$ and $r_{\pi}$, depend on the bias current of the device. With a high collector bias current, a greater $g_{m}$ is obtained, but the impedance between the base and emitter falls to lower values. Studied in Chapter 5, this trade-off proves undesirable in some cases.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_67d4cb928f727340196cg-56.jpg?height=3803&width=3238&top_left_y=1415&top_left_x=470)

The equivalent circuit also predicts the change in the base current as

$$
\begin{align*}
\Delta I_{B} & =\frac{v_{1}}{r_{\pi}}  \tag{4.61}\\
& =\frac{1 \mathrm{mV}}{375 \Omega}  \tag{4.62}\\
& =2.67 \mu \mathrm{~A} \tag{4.63}
\end{align*}
$$

which is, of course, equal to $\Delta I_{C} / \beta$.

Exercise Repeat the above example if $I_{S}$ is halved.

The above example is not a useful circuit. The microphone signal produces a change in $I_{C}$, but the result flows through the $1.8-\mathrm{V}$ battery. In other words, the circuit generates no output. On the other hand, if the collector current flows through a resistor, a useful output is provided.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_67d4cb928f727340196cg-57.jpg?height=1102&width=2427&top_left_y=2303&top_left_x=579)

Figure 4.25 Simple stage with bias and small-signal excitation.

Solution
(a) The collector bias current of 6.92 mA flows through $R_{C}$, leading to a potential drop of $I_{C} R_{C}=692 \mathrm{mV}$. The collector voltage, which is equal to $V_{\text {out }}$, is thus given by:

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{\text {out }} & =V_{C C}-R_{C} I_{C}  \tag{4.64}\\
& =1.108 \mathrm{~V} . \tag{4.65}
\end{align*}
$$

Since the collector voltage (with respect to ground) is more positive than the base voltage, the device operates in the active mode.
(b) As seen in the previous example, a $1-\mathrm{mV}$ microphone signal leads to a $0.267-\mathrm{mA}$ change in $I_{C}$. Upon flowing through $R_{C}$, this change yields a change of $0.267 \mathrm{~mA} \times 100 \Omega=26.7 \mathrm{mV}$ in $V_{\text {out }}$. The circuit therefore amplifies the input by a factor of 26.7 .

Exercise What value of $R_{C}$ results in a zero collector-base voltage?

Did you know?

The first revolution afforded by the transistor was the concept of portable radios. Up to the 1940s, radios incorporated vacuum tubes, which required very high supply voltages (e.g., 60 V ) and hence a bulky and heavy radio design. The transistor, on the other hand, could operate with a few batteries. The portable "transistor radio" was thus introduced by Regency and Texas Instruments in 1954. Interestingly, a Japanese company called Tsushin Kogyo had also been working on a transistor radio around that time and was eager to enter the American market. Since the company's name was difficult to pronounce for westerners, they picked the Latin word "sonus" for sound and called themselves Sony.

The foregoing example demonstrates the amplification capability of the transistor. We will study and quantify the behavior of this and other amplifier topologies in the next chapter.

Small-Signal Model of Supply Voltage We have seen that the use of the small-signal model of diodes and transistors can simplify the analysis considerably. In such an analysis, other components in the circuit must also be represented by a small-signal model. In particular, we must determine how the supply voltage, $V_{C C}$, behaves with respect to small changes in the currents and voltages of the circuit.

The key principle here is that the supply voltage (ideally) remains constant even though various voltages and currents within the circuit may change with time. Since the supply does not change and since the smallsignal model of the circuit entails only changes in the quantities, we observe that $V_{C C}$ must be replaced with a zero voltage to signify the zero change. Thus, we simply "ground" the supply voltage in small-signal analysis. Similarly, any other constant voltage in the circuit is replaced with a ground connection. To emphasize that such grounding holds for only signals, we sometimes say a node is an "ac ground."

### 4.4.5 Early Effect

Our treatment of the bipolar transistor has thus far concentrated on the fundamental principles, ignoring second-order effects in the device and their representation in the largesignal and small-signal models. However, some circuits require attention to such effects if meaningful results are to be obtained. The following example illustrates this point.

| Example | Considering the circuit of Example 4.11 , suppose we raise $R_{C}$ to $200 \Omega$ and $V_{C C}$ to 3.6 V. |
| :---: | :--- |
| 4.12 | Verify that the device operates in the active mode and compute the voltage gain. |

Solution The voltage drop across $R_{C}$ now increases to $6.92 \mathrm{~mA} \times 200 \Omega=1.384 \mathrm{~V}$, leading to a collector voltage of $3.6 \mathrm{~V}-1.384 \mathrm{~V}=2.216 \mathrm{~V}$ and guaranteeing operation in the active mode. Note that if $V_{C C}$ is not doubled, then $V_{\text {out }}=1.8 \mathrm{~V}-1.384 \mathrm{~V}=0.416 \mathrm{~V}$ and the transistor is not in the forward active region.

Recall from part (b) of the above example that the change in the output voltage is equal to the change in the collector current multiplied by $R_{C}$. Since $R_{C}$ is doubled, the voltage gain must also double, reaching a value of 53.4. This result is also obtained with the aid of the small-signal model. Illustrated in Fig. 4.26, the
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_67d4cb928f727340196cg-58.jpg?height=675&width=1211&top_left_y=4417&top_left_x=1723)

Figure 4.26 Small-signal equivalent circuit of the stage shown in Fig. 4.25.
equivalent circuit yields $v_{\text {out }}=-g_{m} v_{\pi} R_{C}=-g_{m} v_{1} R_{C}$ and hence $v_{\text {out }} / v_{1}=-g_{m} R_{C}$. With $g_{m}=(3.75 \Omega)^{-1}$ and $R_{C}=200 \Omega$, we have $v_{\text {out }} / v_{1}=-53.4$.

Exercise What happens if $R_{C}=250 \Omega$ ?

This example points to an important trend: if $R_{C}$ increases, so does the voltage gain of the circuit. Does this mean that, if $R_{C} \rightarrow \infty$, then the gain also grows indefinitely? Does another mechanism in the circuit, perhaps in the transistor, limit the maximum gain that can be achieved? Indeed, the "Early effect" translates to a nonideality in the device that can limit the gain of amplifiers.

To understand this effect, we return to the internal operation of the transistor and reexamine the claim shown in Fig. 4.11that "the collector current does not depend on the collector voltage." Consider the device shown in Fig. 4.27(a), where the collector voltage is somewhat higher than the base voltage and the reverse bias across the junction creates a certain depletion region width. Now suppose $V_{C E}$ is raised to $V_{C E 2}$ [Fig. 4.27(b)], thus increasing the reverse bias and widening the depletion region in the collector and base areas. Since the base charge profile must still fall to zero at the edge of depletion region, $x_{2}^{\prime}$, the slope of the profile increases. Equivalently, the effective base width, $W_{B}$, in Eq. (4.8) decreases, thereby increasing the collector current. Discovered by Early, this phenomenon poses interesting problems in amplifier design (Chapter 5).

How is the Early effect represented in the transistor model? We must first modify Eq. (4.9) to include this effect. It can be proved that the rise in the collector current with $V_{C E}$ can be approximately expressed by a multiplicative factor:

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{C} & =\frac{A_{E} q D_{n} n_{i}^{2}}{N_{E} W_{B}}\left(\exp \frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}-1\right)\left(1+\frac{V_{C E}}{V_{A}}\right)  \tag{4.66}\\
& \approx\left(I_{S} \exp \frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}\right)\left(1+\frac{V_{C E}}{V_{A}}\right) \tag{4.67}
\end{align*}
$$

where $W_{B}$ is assumed constant and the second factor, $1+V_{C E} / V_{A}$, models the Early effect. The quantity $V_{A}$ is called the "Early voltage."

Figure 4.28 Collector current as a function of (a) $V_{B E}$ and (b) $V_{C E}$ with and without Early effect.

It is instructive to examine the I/V characteristics of Fig. 4.15 in the presence of the Early effect. For a constant $V_{C E}$, the dependence of $I_{C}$ upon $V_{B E}$ remains exponential but with a somewhat greater slope [Fig. 4.28(a)]. On the other hand, for a constant $V_{B E}$, the $I_{C}-V_{C E}$ characteristic displays a nonzero slope [Fig. 4.28(b)]. In fact, differentiation of Eq. (4.67) with respect to $V_{C E}$ yields

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\delta I_{C}}{\delta V_{C E}} & =I_{S}\left(\exp \frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}\right)\left(\frac{1}{V_{A}}\right)  \tag{4.68}\\
& \approx \frac{I_{C}}{V_{A}} \tag{4.69}
\end{align*}
$$

where it is assumed $V_{C E} \ll V_{A}$ and hence $I_{C} \approx I_{S} \exp \left(V_{B E} / V_{T}\right)$. This is a reasonable approximation in most cases.

The variation of $I_{C}$ with $V_{C E}$ in Fig. 4.28(b) reveals that the transistor in fact does not operate as an ideal current source, requiring modification of the perspective shown in Fig. 4.11(a). The transistor can still be viewed as a two-terminal device but with a current that varies to some extent with $V_{C E}$ (Fig. 4.29).

A bipolar transistor carries a collector current of 1 mA with $V_{C E}=2 \mathrm{~V}$. Determine the 4.13 required base-emitter voltage if $V_{A}=\infty$ or $V_{A}=20 \mathrm{~V}$. Assume $I_{S}=2 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{~A}$.

Solution With $V_{A}=\infty$, we have from Eq. (4.67)

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{B E} & =V_{T} \ln \frac{I_{C}}{I_{S}}  \tag{4.70}\\
& =760.3 \mathrm{mV} \tag{4.71}
\end{align*}
$$

If $V_{A}=20 \mathrm{~V}$, we rewrite Eq. (4.67) as

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{B E} & =V_{T} \ln \left(\frac{I_{C}}{I_{S}} \frac{1}{1+\frac{V_{C E}}{V_{A}}}\right)  \tag{4.72}\\
& =757.8 \mathrm{mV} \tag{4.73}

In fact, for $V_{C E} \ll V_{A}$, we have $\left(1+V_{C E} / V_{A}\right)^{-1} \approx 1-V_{C E} / V_{A}$

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{B E} & \approx V_{T} \ln \frac{I_{C}}{I_{S}}+V_{T} \ln \left(1-\frac{V_{C E}}{V_{A}}\right)  \tag{4.74}\\
& \approx V_{T} \ln \frac{I_{C}}{I_{S}}-V_{T} \frac{V_{C E}}{V_{A}} \tag{4.75}
\end{align*}
$$

where it is assumed $\ln (1-\epsilon) \approx-\epsilon$ for $\epsilon \ll 1$.
Exercise Repeat the above example if two such transistors are placed in parallel.

Large-Signal and Small-Signal Models The presence of Early effect alters the transistor models developed in Sections 4.4.1 and 4.4.4. The large-signal model of Fig. 4.13 must now be modified to that in Fig. 4.30, where

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{C} & =\left(I_{S} \exp \frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}\right)\left(1+\frac{V_{C E}}{V_{A}}\right)  \tag{4.76}\\
I_{B} & =\frac{1}{\beta}\left(I_{S} \exp \frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}\right)  \tag{4.77}\\
I_{E} & =I_{C}+I_{B} \tag{4.78}
\end{align*}
$$

Note that $I_{B}$ is independent of $V_{C E}$ and still given by the base-emitter voltage.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7b9ff0648e0b061c60d8g-02.jpg?height=612&width=1359&top_left_y=482&top_left_x=1581)

Figure 4.30 Large-signal model of bipolar transistor including Early effect.

For the small-signal model, we note that the controlled current source remains unchanged and $g_{m}$ is expressed as

$$
\begin{align*}
g_{m} & =\frac{d I_{C}}{d V_{B E}}  \tag{4.79}\\
& =\frac{1}{V_{T}}\left(I_{S} \exp \frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}\right)\left(1+\frac{V_{C E}}{V_{A}}\right)  \tag{4.80}\\
& =\frac{I_{C}}{V_{T}} \tag{4.81}
\end{align*}
$$

Similarly,

$$
\begin{align*}
r_{\pi} & =\frac{\beta}{g_{m}}  \tag{4.82}\\
& =\beta \frac{V_{T}}{I_{C}} \tag{4.83}
\end{align*}
$$

Considering that the collector current does vary with $V_{C E}$, let us now apply a voltage change at the collector and measure the resulting current change [Fig. 4.31(a)]:

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{C}+\Delta I_{C}=\left(I_{S} \exp \frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}\right)\left(1+\frac{V_{C E}+\Delta V_{C E}}{V_{A}}\right) \tag{4.84}
\end{equation*}
$$

It follows that

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta I_{C}=\left(I_{S} \exp \frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}\right) \frac{\Delta V_{C E}}{V_{A}} \tag{4.85}
\end{equation*}
$$

which is consistent with Eq. (4.69). Since the voltage and current change correspond to the same two terminals, they satisfy Ohm's Law, yielding an equivalent resistor:

$$
\begin{align*}
r_{O} & =\frac{\Delta V_{C E}}{\Delta I_{C}}  \tag{4.86}\\
& =\frac{V_{A}}{I_{S} \exp \frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}}  \tag{4.87}\\
& \approx \frac{V_{A}}{I_{C}} \tag{4.88}
\end{align*}
$$

Depicted in Fig. 4.31(b), the small-signal model contains only one extra element, $r_{O}$, to represent the Early effect. Called the "output resistance," $r_{O}$ plays a critical role in highgain amplifiers (Chapter 5). Note that both $r_{\pi}$ and $r_{O}$ are inversely proportionally to the bias current, $I_{C}$.

if $\beta=100$ and $V_{A}=15 \mathrm{~V}$.

Exercise What early voltage is required if the output resistance must reach $25 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ ?

In the next chapter, we return to Example 4.12 and determine the gain of the amplifier in the presence of the Early effect. We will conclude that the gain is eventually limited by the transistor output resistance, $r_{O}$. Figure 4.32 summarizes the concepts studied in this section.

An important notion that has emerged from our study of the transistor is the concept of biasing. We must create proper dc voltages and currents at the device terminals to accomplish two goals: (1) guarantee operation in the active mode ( $V_{B E}>0, V_{C E} \geq 0$ ); e.g., the load resistance tied to the collector faces an upper limit for a given supply voltage (Example 4.7); (2) establish a collector current that yields the required values for the smallsignal parameters $g_{m}, r_{O}$, and $r_{\pi}$. The analysis of amplifiers in the next chapter exercises these ideas extensively.

Finally, we should remark that the small-signal model of Fig. 4.31(b) does not reflect the high-frequency limitations of the transistor. For example, the base-emitter and basecollector junctions exhibit a depletion-region capacitance that impacts the speed. These properties are studied in Chapter 11.

## 4.5 OPERATION OF BIPOLAR TRANSISTOR

IN SATURATION MODE

As mentioned in the previous section, it is desirable to operate bipolar devices in the forward active region, where they act as voltage-controlled current sources. In this section, we study the behavior of the device outside this region and the resulting difficulties.

Let us set $V_{B E}$ to a typical value, e.g., 750 mV , and vary the collector voltage from a high level to a low level [Fig. 4.33(a)]. As $V_{C E}$ approaches $V_{B E}$, and $V_{B C}$ goes from a negative value toward zero, the base-collector junction experiences less reverse bias. For $V_{C E}=V_{B E}$, the junction sustains a zero voltage difference, but its depletion region still absorbs most of the electrons injected by the emitter into the base. But what happens if $V_{C E}<V_{B E}$, i.e., $V_{B C}>0$ and the B-C junction is forward biased? We say the transistor enters the "saturation region." Suppose $V_{C E}=550 \mathrm{mV}$ and hence $V_{B C}=+200 \mathrm{mV}$. We know from Chapter 2 that a typical diode sustaining 200 mV of forward bias carries an extremely small current. ${ }^{1}$ Thus, even in this case the

[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7b9ff0648e0b061c60d8g-05.jpg?height=908&width=2130&top_left_y=402&top_left_x=1287)

Figure 4.33 (a) Bipolar transistor with forward-biased base-collector junction, (b) flow of holes to collector.
transistor continues to operate as in the active mode, and we say the device is in "soft saturation."

If the collector voltage drops further, the B-C junction experiences greater forward bias, carrying a significant current [Fig. 4.33(b)]. Consequently, a large number of holes must be supplied to the base terminal-as if $\beta$ is reduced. In other words, heavy saturation leads to a sharp rise in the base current and hence a rapid fall in $\beta$.

| Example 4.15 | A bipolar transistor is biased with $V_{B E}=750 \mathrm{mV}$ and has a nominal $\beta$ of 100 . How much B-C forward bias can the device tolerate if $\beta$ must not degrade by more than $10 \%$ ? For simplicity, assume base-collector and base-emitter junctions have identical structures and doping levels. |
| :---: | :---: |
| Solution | If the base-collector junction is forward-biased so much that it carries a current equal to one-tenth of the nominal base current, $I_{B}$, then the $\beta$ degrades by $10 \%$. Since $I_{B}=I_{C} / 100$, the B-C junction must carry no more than $I_{C} / 1000$. We therefore ask, what B-C voltage results in a current of $I_{C} / 1000$ if $V_{B E}=750 \mathrm{mV}$ gives a collector current of $I_{C}$ ? Assuming identical B-E and B-C junctions, we have |
|  | $\begin{equation*} V_{B E}-V_{B C}=V_{T} \ln \frac{I_{C}}{I_{S}}-V_{T} \ln \frac{I_{C} / 1000}{I_{S}} \tag{4.95} \end{equation*}$ |
|  | $=V_{T} \ln 1000$ |
|  | 的 180 mV |
|  | That is, $V_{B C}=570 \mathrm{mV}$. |

Exercise Repeat the above example if $V_{B E}=800 \mathrm{mV}$.

It is instructive to study the transistor large-signal model and I-V characteristics in the saturation region. We construct the model as shown in Fig. 4.34(a), including the base-collector diode. Note that the net collector current decreases as the device enters
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7b9ff0648e0b061c60d8g-06.jpg?height=909&width=2497&top_left_y=761&top_left_x=1029)

saturation because part of the controlled current $I_{S 1} \exp \left(V_{B E} / V_{T}\right)$ is provided by the B-C diode and need not flow from the collector terminal. In fact, as illustrated in Fig. 4.34(b), if the collector is left open, then $D_{B C}$ is forward-biased so much that its current becomes equal to the controlled current.

The above observations lead to the $I_{C}-V_{C E}$ characteristics depicted in Fig. 4.35, where $I_{C}$ begins to fall for $V_{C E}$ less than $V_{1}$, about a few hundred millivolts. The term "saturation" is used because increasing the base current in this region of operation leads to little change in the collector current.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7b9ff0648e0b061c60d8g-06.jpg?height=1052&width=982&top_left_y=3053&top_left_x=1775)

Figure 4.35 Transistor I/V characteristics in different regions of operation.

In addition to a drop in $\beta$, the speed of bipolar transistors also degrades in saturation (Chapter 11). Thus, electronic circuits rarely allow operation of bipolar devices in this mode. As a rule of thumb, we permit soft saturation with $V_{B C}<400 \mathrm{mV}$ because the current in the B-C junction is negligible, provided that various tolerances in the component values do not drive the device into deep saturation.

It is important to recognize that the transistor simply draws a current from any component tied to its collector, e.g., a resistor. Thus, it is the external component that defines the collector voltage and hence the region of operation.

Example
4.16

For the circuit of Fig. 4.36, determine the relationship between $R_{C}$ and $V_{C C}$ that guarantees operation in soft saturation or active region.

(b)

Figure 4.36 (a) Simple stage, (b) acceptable range of $V_{C C}$ and $R_{C}$.

Solution In soft saturation, the collector current is still equal to $I_{S} \exp \left(V_{B E} / V_{T}\right)$. The collector voltage must not fall below the base voltage by more than 400 mV :

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{C C}-R_{C} I_{C} \geq V_{B E}-400 \mathrm{mV} \tag{4.98}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus,

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{C C} \geq I_{C} R_{C}+\left(V_{B E}-400 \mathrm{mV}\right) \tag{4.99}
\end{equation*}
$$

For a given value of $R_{C}, V_{C C}$ must be sufficiently large so that $V_{C C}-I_{C} R_{C}$ still maintains a reasonable collector voltage.

Exercise $\quad$ Determine the maximum tolerable value of $R_{C}$.

In the deep saturation region, the collector-emitter voltage approaches a constant value called $V_{C E, \text { sat }}$ (about 200 mV ). Under this condition, the transistor bears no resemblance to a controlled current source and can be modeled as shown in Fig. 4.37. (The battery tied between C and E indicates that $V_{C E}$ is relatively constant in deep saturation.)

## 4.6 THE PNP TRANSISTOR

We have thus far studied the structure and properties of the $n p n$ transistor, i.e., with the emitter and collector made of $n$-type materials and the base made of a $p$-type material. We may naturally wonder if the dopant polarities can be inverted in the three regions, forming a "pnp" device. More importantly, we may wonder why such a device would be useful.

### 4.6.1 Structure and Operation

Figure 4.38(a) shows the structure of a pnp transistor, emphasizing that the emitter is heavily doped. As with the npn counterpart, operation in the active region requires forwardbiasing the base-emitter junction and reverse-biasing the collector junction. Thus, $V_{B E}<0$ and $V_{B C}>0$. Under this condition, majority carriers in the emitter (holes) are injected into the base and swept away into the collector. Also, a linear profile of holes is formed in the base region to allow diffusion. A small number of base majority carriers (electrons) are injected into the emitter or recombined with the holes in the base region, thus creating the base current. Figure 4.38(b) illustrates the flow of the carriers. All of the operation principles and equations described for $n p n$ transistors apply to $p n p$ devices as well.

Figure 4.38(c) depicts the symbol of the pnp transistor along with constant voltage sources that bias the device in the active region. In contrast to the biasing of the $n p n$ transistor in Fig. 4.6, here the base and collector voltages are lower than the emitter voltage. Following our convention of placing more positive nodes on the top of the page, we redraw the circuit as in Fig. 4.38(d) to emphasize $V_{E B}>0$ and $V_{B C}>0$ and to illustrate the actual direction of current flow into each terminal.

### 4.6.2 Large-Signal Model

The current and voltage polarities in $n p n$ and $p n p$ transistors can be confusing. We address this issue by making the following observations. (1) The (conventional) current always flows from a positive supply (i.e., top of the page) toward a lower potential (i.e., bottom of the page). Figure 4.39(a) shows two branches employing $n p n$ and $p n p$ transistors, illustrating that the (conventional) current flows from collector to emitter in npn devices and from emitter to collector in pnp counterparts. Since the base current must be included in the emitter current, we note that $I_{B 1}$ and $I_{C 1}$ add up to $I_{E 1}$, whereas $I_{E 2}$ "loses" $I_{B 2}$ before emerging as $I_{C 2}$. (2) The distinction between active and saturation regions is based on the

We note that an $n p n$ transistor is in the active mode if the collector (voltage) is not lower than the base (voltage). For the pnp device, on the other hand, the collector must not be higher than the base. (3) The npn current equations (4.23)-(4.25) must be modified as follows for the pnp device:

$$
\begin{align*}
& I_{C}=I_{S} \exp \frac{V_{E B}}{V_{T}}  \tag{4.100}\\
& I_{B}=\frac{I_{S}}{\beta} \exp \frac{V_{E B}}{V_{T}}  \tag{4.101}\\
& I_{E}=\frac{\beta+1}{\beta} I_{S} \exp \frac{V_{E B}}{V_{T}}, \tag{4.102}

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{C}=\left(I_{S} \exp \frac{V_{E B}}{V_{T}}\right)\left(1+\frac{V_{E C}}{V_{A}}\right) \tag{4.103}
\end{equation*}
$$

Example

In the circuit shown in Fig. 4.41, determine the terminal currents of $Q_{1}$ and verify operation in the forward active region. Assume $I_{S}=2 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{~A}$ and $\beta=50$, but $V_{A}=\infty$.

Figure 4.41 Simple stage using a pnp transistor.
Solution We have $V_{E B}=2 \mathrm{~V}-1.2 \mathrm{~V}=0.8 \mathrm{~V}$ and hence

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{C} & =I_{S} \exp \frac{V_{E B}}{V_{T}}  \tag{4.104}\\
& =4.61 \mathrm{~mA} \tag{4.105}
\end{align*}
$$

It follows that

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{B} & =92.2 \mu \mathrm{~A}  \tag{4.106}\\
I_{E} & =4.70 \mathrm{~mA} \tag{4.107}
\end{align*}
$$

We must now compute the collector voltage and hence the bias across the B-C junction. Since $R_{C}$ carries $I_{C}$,

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{X} & =R_{C} I_{C}  \tag{4.108}\\
& =0.922 \mathrm{~V} \tag{4.109}
\end{align*}
$$

which is lower than the base voltage. Invoking the illustration in Fig. 4.39(b), we conclude that $Q_{1}$ operates in the active mode and the use of equations (4.100)-(4.102) is justified.

Exercise What is the maximum value of $R_{C}$ if the transistor must remain in soft saturation?

We should mention that some books assume all of the transistor terminal currents flow into the device, thus requiring that the right-hand side of Eqs. (4.100) and (4.101) be multiplied by a negative sign. We nonetheless continue with our notation as it reflects the actual direction of currents and proves more efficient in the analysis of circuits containing many $n p n$ and $p n p$ transistors.

Exercise Determine $V_{\text {out }}$ if $V_{\text {in }}=-5 \mathrm{mV}$.

### 4.6.3 Small-Signal Model

Since the small-signal model represents changes in the voltages and currents, we expect $n p n$ and $p n p$ transistors to have similar models. Depicted in Fig. 4.43(a), the smallsignal model of the pnp transistor is indeed identical to that of the npn device. Following the convention in Fig. 4.38(d), we sometimes draw the model as shown in Fig. 4.43(b).

The reader may notice that the terminal currents in the small-signal model bear an opposite direction with respect to those in the large-signal model of Fig. 4.40. This is not an inconsistency and is studied in Problem 4.50.

Did you know?

Some of the early low-cost radios used only two germanium (rather than silicon) pnp transistors to form two amplifier stages. (Silicon transistors became manufacturable later.) However, these radios had poor performance and could receive only one or two stations. For this reason, many manufacturers would proudly print the number of the transistors inside a radio on its front panel along with the brand name, e.g., "Admiral-Eight Transistors."

Figure 4.43 (a) Small-signal model of $p n p$ transistor, (b) more intuitive view of (a).

The small-signal model of pnp transistors may cause confusion, especially if drawn as in Fig. 4.43(b). In analogy with $n p n$ transistors, one may automatically assume that the "top" terminal is the collector and hence the model in Fig. 4.43(b) is not identical to that in Fig. 4.31(b). We caution the reader about this confusion. A few examples prove helpful here.

Example 4.19

If the collector and base of a bipolar transistor are tied together, a two-terminal device results. Determine the small-signal impedance of the devices shown in Fig. 4.44(a). Assume $V_{A}=\infty$.

Figure 4.44

Solution We replace the bipolar transistor $Q_{1}$ with its small-signal model and apply a small-signal voltage across the device [Fig. 4.44(b)]. Noting that $r_{p i}$ carries a current equal to $v_{X} / r_{\pi}$, we write a KCL at the input node:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{X}}{r_{\pi}}+g_{m} v_{\pi}=i_{X} \tag{4.115}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since $g_{m} r_{\pi}=\beta \gg 1$, we have

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{v_{X}}{i_{X}} & =\frac{1}{g_{m}+r_{\pi}^{-1}}  \tag{4.116}\\
& \approx \frac{1}{g_{m}}  \tag{4.117}\\
& =\frac{V_{T}}{I_{C}} . \tag{4.118}
\end{align*}
$$

Interestingly, with a bias current of $I_{C}$, the device exhibits an impedance similar to that of a diode carrying the same bias current. We call this structure a "diode-connected transistor." The same results apply to the pnp configuration in Fig. 4.44(a).

What is the impedance of a diode-connected device operating at a current of 1 mA ?

Draw the small-signal equivalent circuits for the topologies shown in Figs. 4.45(a)-(c) and compare the results.

Solution As illustrated in Figs. 4.45(d)-(f), we replace each transistor with its small-signal model and ground the supply voltage. It is seen that all three topologies reduce to the same equivalent circuit because $V_{C C}$ is grounded in the small-signal representation.

## 4.7 CHAPTER SUMMARY

- A voltage-dependent current source can form an amplifier along with a load resistor. Bipolar transistors are electronic devices that can operate as voltage-dependent current sources.
- The bipolar transistor consists of two pn junctions and three terminals: base, emitter, and collector. The carriers flow from the emitter to the collector and are controlled by the base.
- For proper operation, the base-emitter junction is forward-biased and the basecollector junction reverse-biased (forward active region). Carriers injected by the emitter into the base approach the edge of collector depletion region and are swept away by the high electric field.
- The base terminal must provide a small flow of carriers, some of which go to the emitter and some others recombine in the base region. The ratio of collector current and base current is denoted by $\beta$.
- In the forward active region, the bipolar transistor exhibits an exponential relationship between its collector current and base-emitter voltage.
- In the forward active region, a bipolar transistor behaves as a constant current source.
- The large-signal model of the bipolar transistor consists of an exponential voltagedependent current source tied between the collector and emitter, and a diode (accounting for the base current) tied between the base and emitter.
- The transconductance of a bipolar transistor is given by $g_{m}=I_{C} / V_{T}$ and remains independent of the device dimensions.
- The small-signal model of bipolar transistors consists of a linear voltage-dependent current source, a resistance tied between the base and emitter, and an output resistance.
- If the base-collector junction is forward-biased, the bipolar transistor enters saturation and its performance degrades.
- The small-signal models of $n p n$ and $p n p$ transistors are identical.
