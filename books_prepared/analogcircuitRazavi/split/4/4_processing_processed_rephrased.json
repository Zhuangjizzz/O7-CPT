Consequently, the base-collector junction experiences a reverse bias of 0.2 V.\n\nNow, let's examine the transistor's operation in active mode.

Thus, we denote the emitter region as $n^{+}$, where the superscript highlights the high doping level. Figure 4.7(a) encapsulates our findings so far, indicating that the emitter injects a substantial number of electrons into the base while receiving a minimal number of holes.\n\nUpon entering the base, what becomes of these electrons? Due to the thin base region, most electrons reach the edge of the collector-base depletion region, where they encounter the built-in electric field. As depicted in Fig. 4.5, the electrons are then swept into the collector region and absorbed by the positive battery terminal. Figures 4.7(b) and (c) depict this process in a step-by-step manner.

    "text": "In this section, we analyze the transistor's operation to demonstrate that, under specific conditions, it functions as a voltage-controlled current source. Specifically, we aim to show that (a) the current flowing from the emitter to the collector can be regarded as a current source connected between these two terminals, and (b) this current is regulated by the voltage difference between the base and the emitter, $V_{B E}$.\n\nWe initiate our study with the assumption that the base-emitter junction is forward-biased ($V_{B E}>0$) and the base-collector junction is reverse-biased ($V_{B C}<0$). Under these conditions, the device is said to be biased in the \"forward active region\" or simply in \"active mode.\" For instance, with the emitter connected to ground, the base voltage is set to approximately 0.8 V, and the collector voltage to a higher value, such as 1 V [Fig. 4.6(a)]. Consequently, the base-collector junction experiences a reverse bias of 0.2 V.\n\nLet us now examine the transistor's operation in active mode. One might be inclined to simplify the example in Fig. 4.6(a) to the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 4.6(b). After all, it seems that the bipolar transistor merely consists of two diodes sharing their anodes at the base terminal. This perspective suggests that $D_{1}$ conducts current while $D_{2}$ does not; i.e., we would expect current flow from the base to the emitter but none through the collector terminal. If this were true, the transistor would not function as a voltage-controlled current source and would be of limited utility.\n\nTo understand why the transistor cannot be simply modeled as two back-to-back diodes, we must investigate the internal charge flow, considering the base region's thinness. Since the base-emitter junction is forward-biased, electrons move from the emitter to the base, and holes move from the base to the emitter. For proper transistor operation, the former current component must significantly exceed the latter, necessitating a much higher emitter doping level than that of the base (Chapter 2). Thus, we denote the emitter region as $n^{+}$, highlighting its high doping level. Figure 4.7(a) summarizes our findings so far, indicating that the emitter injects a large number of electrons into the base while receiving a small number of holes from it.\n\nWhat occurs to electrons upon entering the base? Given the base region's thinness, most electrons reach the edge of the collector-base depletion region, where they encounter the built-in electric field. As depicted in Fig. 4.5, these electrons are then swept into the collector region and absorbed by the positive battery terminal. Figures 4.7(b) and (c) illustrate this process in detail. We thus observe that the reverse-biased collector-base junction carries a current due to the \"injection\" of minority carriers into its depletion region.\n\nLet us summarize our insights. In active mode, an npn bipolar transistor transports a large number of electrons from the emitter, through the base, to the collector, while drawing a small current of holes through the base terminal. Several questions now arise. First, how do electrons traverse the base: via drift or diffusion? Second, how does the resulting current depend on the terminal voltages? Third, what is the magnitude of the base current?\n\nAs a moderate conductor, the base region supports only a small electric field, allowing most of the field to drop across the base-emitter depletion layer. Consequently, as explained for $p n$ junctions in Chapter 2, the drift current in the base is negligible, leaving diffusion as the primary mechanism for the flow of electrons injected by the emitter.

Furthermore, since the current drawn from the collector and flowing into the emitter depends solely on the base-emitter voltage, we incorporate a voltage-controlled current source between the collector and the emitter, resulting in the model depicted in Fig. 4.13.

Thus, the base-emitter junction is modeled by a diode whose cross-sectional area is $1 / \\beta$ times that of the actual emitter area.\n\nConsidering the interdependencies of currents and voltages in a bipolar transistor, one might question the cause and effect relationships. We perceive the chain of dependencies as $V_{B E} \\rightarrow I_{C} \\rightarrow I_{B} \\rightarrow I_{E}$; that is, the base-emitter voltage generates a collector current, which necessitates a proportional base current, and the sum of the two flows through the emitter.\n\nExample\n4.7\n\nExamine the circuit shown in Fig. 4.14 (a), where $I_{S, Q 1}=5 \\times 10^{-17} \\mathrm{~A}$ and $V_{B E}=$ 800 mV.

    "text": "The large-signal model naturally leads to the I/V characteristics of the transistor. With three terminal currents and voltages, we can envision plotting different currents as a function of the potential difference between every two terminals—a complex task. However, as explained below, only a few of these characteristics are actually useful.\n\nThe first characteristic to examine is the exponential relationship inherent in the device. Figure 4.15 (a) plots $I_{C}$ versus $V_{B E}$, assuming the collector voltage is constant and not less than the base voltage. As shown in Fig. 4.11, $I_{C}$ is independent of $V_{C E}$; thus, varying $V_{C E}$ does not alter this characteristic.\n\nNext, we look at $I_{C}$ for a given $V_{B E}$ but with varying $V_{C E}$. Illustrated in Fig. 4.15(b), this characteristic appears as a horizontal line because $I_{C}$ remains constant if the device stays in the active mode ($V_{C E}>V_{B E}$). Conversely, choosing different $V_{B E}$ values causes the characteristic to shift up or down.\n\nThe two plots in Fig. 4.15 represent the primary characteristics of interest for most analysis and design tasks.

However, as explained below, only a few of these characteristics are truly useful.\n\nThe initial characteristic to examine is the exponential relationship inherent in the device. Figure 4.15 (a) plots $I_{C}$ against $V_{B E}$, assuming the collector voltage is constant and not less than the base voltage. As depicted in Fig. 4.11, $I_{C}$ is unaffected by $V_{C E}$; thus, different $V_{C E}$ values do not alter this characteristic.\n\nNext, we consider $I_{C}$ for a fixed $V_{B E}$ but with varying $V_{C E}$. Illustrated in Fig. 4.15(b), the characteristic appears as a horizontal line because $I_{C}$ remains constant if the device stays in the active mode ($V_{C E}>V_{B E}$). Conversely, if different $V_{B E}$ values are chosen, the characteristic shifts vertically.\n\nThe two plots in Fig. 4.15 represent the primary characteristics of interest in most analysis and design tasks.

    "text": "Our research to date indicates that a bipolar transistor functions as a voltage-dependent current source when it operates in the forward active region. A pivotal question that emerges is: how is the performance of such a device evaluated? In essence, what metric defines the \"quality\" of a voltage-dependent current source?\n\nThe illustration in Fig. 4.1 implies that the device strengthens as $K$ increases, since a specific input voltage results in a higher output current. Consequently, we should focus on the transistor's voltage-to-current conversion attribute, particularly in relation to signal amplification. More precisely, we inquire: if a signal causes a slight change in the base-emitter voltage of a transistor (Fig. 4.17), what is the resulting change in the collector current? By denoting the change in $I_{C}$ as $\\Delta I_{C}$, we identify that the device's \"strength\" can be represented by $\\Delta I_{C} / \\Delta V_{B E}$.

For a bipolar transistor, Eq. (4.9) yields:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ng_{m} & =\\frac{d}{d V_{B E}}\\left(I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}\\right)  \\tag{4.42}\\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{V_{T}} I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}  \\tag{4.43}\\\\\n& =\\frac{I_{C}}{V_{T}} \\tag{4.44}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe similarity between this result and the small-signal resistance of diodes [Eq. (3.58)] is not coincidental and will be further clarified in the next chapter.\n\nEquation (4.44) indicates that as $I_{C}$ rises, the transistor becomes a more effective amplifier by producing larger collector current variations in response to a given signal level between the base and emitter. Transconductance can be expressed in $\\Omega^{-1}$ or \"siemens,\" S. For example, if $I_{C}=1 \\mathrm{~mA}$ and $V_{T}=26 \\mathrm{mV}$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ng_{m} & =0.0385 \\Omega^{-1}  \\tag{4.45}\\\\\n& =0.0385 \\mathrm{~S}  \\tag{4.46}\\\\\n& =38.5 \\mathrm{mS} \\tag{4.47}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nHowever, as we will explore throughout this book, it is often useful to consider $g_{m}$ as the inverse of a resistance; for instance, for $I_{C}=1 \\mathrm{~mA}$, we can write:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ng_{m}=\\frac{1}{26 \\Omega} \\tag{4.48}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe concept of transconductance can be visualized using the transistor's I/V characteristics. As shown in Fig. 4.18, $g_{m}=d I_{C} / d V_{B E}$ represents the slope of the $I_{C}-V_{B E}$ characteristic at a specific collector current, $I_{C 0}$, and corresponding base-emitter voltage, $V_{B E 0}$. In other words, if $V_{B E}$ experiences a small perturbation $\\pm \\Delta V$ around $V_{B E 0}$, the collector current changes by $\\pm g_{m} \\Delta V$ around $I_{C 0}$, where $g_{m}=I_{C 0} / V_{T}$.

We refer to the transistor as \"biased\" at a collector current of $I_{C 0}$, meaning it carries a bias (or \"quiescent\") current of $I_{C 0}$ in the absence of signals. ${ }^{5}$\n\nImage Description: (a) A circuit diagram showing a single NPN transistor Q1 with a collector current I_C0, biased with V_BE0 and V_CE voltages, used to analyze the effect of increasing device area on transconductance.\n\nImage Description: (b) A circuit with three NPN transistors (Q1, Q2, Q3) in parallel, each with a collector current of I_C0. The base-emitter voltage (V_BE0) is constant across all transistors, and the transconductance increases by a factor of n when n identical transistors are used.\n\nFigure 4.19 (a) One transistor and (b) $n$ transistors providing transconductance.\n\nSolution: Since $I_{S} \\propto A_{E}$, $I_{S}$ increases by the same factor. Thus, $I_{C}=I_{S} \\exp \\left(V_{B E} / V_{T}\\right)$ also rises by a factor of $n$ because $V_{B E}$ is constant. Consequently, the transconductance increases by a factor of $n$. Alternatively, if $n$ identical transistors, each carrying a collector current of $I_{C 0}$, are connected in parallel, the composite device exhibits a transconductance $n$ times that of each individual transistor [Fig. 4.19(b)]. Conversely, if the total collector current remains unchanged, the transconductance remains the same.\n\nExercise: Repeat the above example if $V_{B E 0}$ is reduced by $V_{T} \\ln n$.\n\nIt is also feasible to examine transconductance within the context of the $I_{C}-V_{C E}$ characteristics of the transistor, with $V_{B E}$ as a parameter. As illustrated in Fig. 4.20 for two different bias currents $I_{C 1}$ and $I_{C 2}$, the plots show that a change of $\\Delta V$ in $V_{B E}$ results in a more significant change in $I_{C}$ for operation around $I_{C 2}$ than around $I_{C 1}$ because $g_{m 2}>g_{m 1}$.\n\nThe derivation of $g_{m}$ in Eqs. (4.42)-(4.44) suggests that transconductance is fundamentally a function of the collector current rather than the base current. For example, if $I_{C}$ remains constant but $\\beta$ varies, $g_{m}$ does not change, but $I_{B}$ does. Therefore, the collector bias current is central to analysis and design, with the base current considered a secondary, often undesirable effect.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 4.10, the current produced by the transistor can flow through a resistor to generate a proportional voltage. We leverage this concept in Chapter 5 to design amplifiers."

Thus, $I_{C}=I_{S} \\exp \\left(V_{B E} / V_{T}\\right)$ also rises by a factor of $n$ because $V_{B E}$ is constant. Consequently, the transconductance increases by a factor of $n$. From another viewpoint, if $n$ identical transistors, each carrying a collector current of $I_{C 0}$, are connected in parallel, the combined device exhibits a transconductance equal to $n$ times that of each individual transistor [Fig. 4.19(b)]. Conversely, if the total collector current remains unchanged, the transconductance does not alter.\n\nExercise Repeat the preceding example if $V_{B E 0}$ is decreased by $V_{T} \\ln n$.\n\nIt is also feasible to analyze transconductance in the context of the $I_{C}-V_{C E}$ characteristics of the transistor with $V_{B E}$ as a parameter. As shown in Fig. 4.20 for two distinct bias currents $I_{C 1}$ and $I_{C 2}$, the plots reveal that a $\\Delta V$ change in $V_{B E}$ results in a more significant change in $I_{C}$ for operation around $I_{C 2}$ than around $I_{C 1}$ due to $g_{m 2}>g_{m 1}$.\n\nThe derivation of $g_{m}$ in Eqs. (4.42)-(4.44) suggests that transconductance is fundamentally a function of the collector current rather than the base current. For example, if $I_{C}$ remains constant but $\\beta$ varies, $g_{m}$ remains unchanged while $I_{B}$ varies. Therefore, the collector bias current is central to analysis and design, with the base current considered a secondary, often undesirable effect.\n\nAs illustrated in Fig. 4.10, the current produced by the transistor can flow through a resistor to generate a proportional voltage. This principle is exploited in Chapter 5 to design amplifiers."

Thus, $I_{C}=I_{S} \\exp \\left(V_{B E} / V_{T}\\right)$ also rises by a factor of $n$ because $V_{B E}$ is constant. Consequently, the transconductance increases by a factor of $n$. From another perspective, if $n$ identical transistors, each carrying a collector current of $I_{C 0}$, are connected in parallel, the composite device exhibits a transconductance equal to $n$ times that of each [Fig. 4.19(b)]. Conversely, if the total collector current remains unchanged, the transconductance remains the same.\n\nExercise Repeat the above example if $V_{B E 0}$ is reduced by $V_{T} \\ln n$.\n\nIt is also possible to analyze transconductance in the context of the $I_{C}-V_{C E}$ characteristics of the transistor with $V_{B E}$ as a parameter. As shown in Fig. 4.20 for two different bias currents $I_{C 1}$ and $I_{C 2}$, the plots reveal that a change of $\\Delta V$ in $V_{B E}$ results in a greater change in $I_{C}$ for operation around $I_{C 2}$ than around $I_{C 1}$ because $g_{m 2}>g_{m 1}$.\n\nThe derivation of $g_{m}$ in Eqs. (4.42)-(4.44) suggests that transconductance is fundamentally a function of the collector current rather than the base current. For instance, if $I_{C}$ remains constant but $\\beta$ varies, $g_{m}$ does not change, but $I_{B}$ does. Therefore, the collector bias current is central to analysis and design, with the base current considered a secondary, often undesirable effect.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 4.10, the current produced by the transistor can flow through a resistor to generate a proportional voltage.

Thus, $I_{C}=I_{S} \\exp \\left(V_{B E} / V_{T}\\right)$ also rises by a factor of $n$ because $V_{B E}$ is constant. Consequently, the transconductance increases by a factor of $n$. From another perspective, if $n$ identical transistors, each carrying a collector current of $I_{C 0}$, are placed in parallel, the composite device exhibits a transconductance equal to $n$ times that of each [Fig. 4.19(b)]. Conversely, if the total collector current remains unchanged, the transconductance does not change.\n\nExercise Repeat the above example if $V_{B E 0}$ is reduced by $V_{T} \\ln n$.\n\nIt is also feasible to study transconductance in the context of the $I_{C}-V_{C E}$ characteristics of the transistor with $V_{B E}$ as a parameter. As illustrated in Fig. 4.20 for two different bias currents $I_{C 1}$ and $I_{C 2}$, the plots reveal that a change of $\\Delta V$ in $V_{B E}$ results in a greater change in $I_{C}$ for operation around $I_{C 2}$ than around $I_{C 1}$ because $g_{m 2}>g_{m 1}$.\n\nThe derivation of $g_{m}$ in Eqs. (4.42)-(4.44) suggests that transconductance is fundamentally a function of the collector current rather than the base current. For example, if $I_{C}$ remains constant but $\\beta$ varies, $g_{m}$ does not change, but $I_{B}$ does. Therefore, the collector bias current is central to analysis and design, with the base current considered a secondary, often undesirable effect.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 4.10, the current produced by the transistor can flow through a resistor to generate a proportional voltage.

For instance, if a 1 mV change in base-emitter voltage results in a $\\Delta I_{C}$ of 0.1 mA in one transistor and 0.5 mA in another, the latter is deemed a superior voltage-dependent current source or \"voltage-to-current converter.\"\n\nThe ratio $\\Delta I_{C} / \\Delta V_{B E}$ approximates $d I_{C} / d V_{B E}$ for minimal changes and, in the limit, is termed the \"transconductance,\" $g_{m}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ng_{m}=\\frac{d I_{C}}{d V_{B E}} . \\tag{4.41}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nimage_name:Figure 4.17 Test circuit for measurement of g_m\ndescription:\n[\nname: Q1, type: NPN, ports: {C: VCE, B: VBE, E: GND}\nname: VBE, type: VoltageSource, value: VBE, ports: {Np: VBE, Nn: GND}\nname: VCE, type: VoltageSource, value: VCE, ports: {Np: VCE, Nn: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit is used for measuring the transconductance (g_m) of an NPN transistor. The base-emitter voltage (VBE) is controlled to vary the collector current (IC), while the collector-emitter voltage (VCE) is kept constant.\n\nFigure 4.17 Test circuit for measurement of $g_{m}$.\n${ }^{*}$ Note that $V_{C E}$ is constant here.\n\nThis definition is applicable to any device that acts as a voltage-dependent current source, such as another type of transistor discussed in Chapter 6. For a bipolar transistor, Eq. (4.9) yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ng_{m} & =\\frac{d}{d V_{B E}}\\left(I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}\\right)  \\tag{4.42}\\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{V_{T}} I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}  \\tag{4.43}\\\\\n& =\\frac{I_{C}}{V_{T}} \\tag{4.44}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe similarity between this result and the small-signal resistance of diodes [Eq. (3.58)] is not coincidental and will be further clarified in the next chapter.\n\nEquation (4.44) indicates that as $I_{C}$ increases, the transistor becomes a more effective amplifier by generating larger collector current variations in response to a given signal level between the base and emitter. The transconductance can be expressed in $\\Omega^{-1}$ or \"siemens,\" S. For example, if $I_{C}=1 \\mathrm{~mA}$ and $V_{T}=26 \\mathrm{mV}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ng_{m} & =0.0385 \\Omega^{-1}  \\tag{4.45}\\\\\n& =0.0385 \\mathrm{~S}  \\tag{4.46}\\\\\n& =38.5 \\mathrm{mS} \\tag{4.47}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nHowever, as we will explore throughout this book, it is often useful to consider $g_{m}$ as the inverse of a resistance; for instance, for $I_{C}=1 \\mathrm{~mA}$, we can write\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ng_{m}=\\frac{1}{26 \\Omega} \\tag{4.48}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe concept of transconductance can be visualized using the transistor's I/V characteristics. As depicted in Fig. 4.18, $g_{m}=d I_{C} / d V_{B E}$ represents the slope of the $I_{C}-V_{B E}$ characteristic at a specific collector current, $I_{C 0}$, and corresponding base-emitter voltage, $V_{B E 0}$. In other words, if $V_{B E}$ experiences a small perturbation $\\pm \\Delta V$ around $V_{B E 0}$, the collector current changes by $\\pm g_{m} \\Delta V$ around $I_{C 0}$, where $g_{m}=I_{C 0} / V_{T}$. Thus, the\nimage_name:Figure 4.18\ndescription:The graph in Figure 4.18 is a characteristic curve representing the relationship between the collector current \\( I_C \\) and the base-emitter voltage \\( V_{BE} \\) of a transistor.

The base-emitter voltage (V_BE0) is constant across all transistors. The transconductance increases by a factor of n when n identical transistors are used.\n\nFigure 4.19 (a) One transistor and (b) $n$ transistors providing transconductance.\nSolution Since $I_{S} \\propto A_{E}, I_{S}$ is multiplied by the same factor. Thus, $I_{C}=I_{S} \\exp \\left(V_{B E} / V_{T}\\right)$ also rises by a factor of $n$ because $V_{B E}$ is constant. Consequently, the transconductance increases by a factor of $n$. From another viewpoint, if $n$ identical transistors, each carrying a collector current of $I_{C 0}$, are connected in parallel, the combined device exhibits a transconductance equal to $n$ times that of each individual transistor [Fig. 4.19(b)]. Conversely, if the total collector current remains unchanged, the transconductance remains the same.\n\nExercise Repeat the above example if $V_{B E 0}$ is reduced by $V_{T} \\ln n$.\n\nIt is also feasible to analyze transconductance in the context of the $I_{C}-V_{C E}$ characteristics of the transistor, with $V_{B E}$ as a parameter. As illustrated in Fig. 4.20 for two different bias currents $I_{C 1}$ and $I_{C 2}$, the plots reveal that a $\\Delta V$ change in $V_{B E}$ results in a more significant change in $I_{C}$ for operation around $I_{C 2}$ than around $I_{C 1}$ because $g_{m 2}>g_{m 1}$.\n\nThe derivation of $g_{m}$ in Eqs. (4.42)-(4.44) suggests that transconductance is fundamentally a function of the collector current rather than the base current. For example, if $I_{C}$ remains constant but $\\beta$ varies, $g_{m}$ does not change, but $I_{B}$ does. Therefore, the collector bias current is central to analysis and design, with the base current considered a secondary, often undesirable effect.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 4.10, the current produced by the transistor can flow through a resistor to generate a proportional voltage. We leverage this concept in Chapter 5 to design amplifiers."

According to the definition of transconductance, we have:\n\n$$\n\\Delta I_{C} = g_{m} \\Delta V_{BE} \\tag{4.49}\n$$\n\nThis implies that a voltage-controlled current source must be connected between the collector and the emitter with a value equal to $g_{m} \\Delta V$. For simplicity, we denote $\\Delta V_{BE}$ by $v_{\\pi}$ and the change in the collector current by $g_{m} v_{\\pi}$.\n\nThe change in $V_{BE}$ also results in another change:\n\n$$\n\\Delta I_{B} = \\frac{\\Delta I_{C}}{\\beta} = \\frac{g_{m}}{\\beta} \\Delta V_{BE} \\tag{4.50, 4.51}\n$$\n\nThis means that if the base-emitter voltage changes by $\\Delta V_{BE}$, the current between these two terminals changes by $\\left(g_{m} / \\beta\\right) \\Delta V_{BE}$. Since voltage and current correspond to the same two terminals, they can be related by Ohm's Law, i.e., a resistor between the base and emitter with a value:\n\n$$\nr_{\\pi} = \\frac{\\Delta V_{BE}}{\\Delta I_{B}} = \\frac{\\beta}{g_{m}} \\tag{4.52, 4.53}\n$$\n\nThus, the forward-biased diode between the base and emitter is modeled by a small-signal resistance equal to $\\beta / g_{m}$. This result is expected because the diode carries a bias current equal to $I_{C} / \\beta$ and, from Eq. (3.58), exhibits a small-signal resistance of $V_{T} /\\left(I_{C} / \\beta\\right)=\\beta\\left(V_{T} / I_{C}\\right)=\\beta / g_{m}$.\n\nNow, let's consider the collector and apply a voltage change with respect to the emitter (Fig. 4.23). For a constant $V_{BE}$, the collector voltage has no effect on $I_{C}$ or $I_{B}$ because $I_{C}=I_{S} \\exp \\left(V_{BE} / V_{T}\\right)$ and $I_{B}=I_{C} / \\beta$. Since $\\Delta V_{CE}$ leads to no change in any of the terminal currents, the model developed in Fig. 4.22 need not be altered.\n\nA change in the collector-base voltage also results in no change in the terminal currents, as studied in Problem 4.18.\n\nThe simple small-signal model developed in Fig. 4.22 serves as a powerful and versatile tool for analyzing and designing bipolar circuits. Both parameters of the model, $g_{m}$ and $r_{\\pi}$, depend on the bias current of the device. With a high collector bias current, a greater $g_{m}$ is obtained, but the impedance between the base and emitter falls to lower values. This trade-off, studied in Chapter 5, proves undesirable in some cases.\n\nThe equivalent circuit also predicts the change in the base current as:\n\n$$\n\\Delta I_{B} = \\frac{v_{1}}{r_{\\pi}} = \\frac{1 \\mathrm{mV}}{375 \\Omega} = 2.67 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\tag{4.61, 4.62, 4.63}\n$$\n\nwhich is, of course, equal to $\\Delta I_{C} / \\beta$.\n\nThe example provided is not a practical circuit, as the microphone signal produces a change in $I_{C}$, but the result flows through the $1.8-\\mathrm{V}$ battery, generating no output. However, if the collector current flows through a resistor, a useful output is provided (Fig. 4.25).\n\nExercise: Repeat the above example if $I_{S}$ is halved.\n\nSolution:\n(a) The collector bias current of 6.92 mA flows through $R_{C}$, leading to a potential drop of $I_{C} R_{C}=692 \\mathrm{mV}$. The collector voltage, which is equal to $V_{\\text {out }}$, is thus given by:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text {out }} = V_{C C}-R_{C} I_{C} = 1.108 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{4.64, 4.65}\n$$\n\nSince the collector voltage (with respect to ground) is more positive than the base voltage, the device operates in the active mode.\n\n(b) As seen in the previous example, a $1-\\mathrm{mV}$ microphone signal leads to a $0.267-\\mathrm{mA}$ change in $I_{C}$. Upon flowing through $R_{C}$, this change yields a change of $0.267 \\mathrm{~mA} \\times 100 \\Omega=26.7 \\mathrm{mV}$ in $V_{\\text {out }}$. The circuit therefore amplifies the input by a factor of 26.7 .\n\nExercise: What value of $R_{C}$ results in a zero collector-base voltage?\n\nThe transistor revolutionized portable radios. Before the 1940s, radios used vacuum tubes, which required very high supply voltages (e.g., 60 V) and hence a bulky and heavy design. The transistor, on the other hand, could operate with a few batteries. The portable \"transistor radio\" was introduced by Regency and Texas Instruments in 1954. Interestingly, a Japanese company called Tsushin Kogyo had also been working on a transistor radio around that time and was eager to enter the American market. Since the company's name was difficult to pronounce for westerners, they picked the Latin word \"sonus\" for sound and called themselves Sony.\n\nThe example demonstrates the amplification capability of the transistor. We will study and quantify the behavior of this and other amplifier topologies in the next chapter.\n\nSmall-Signal Model of Supply Voltage\nWe have seen that the use of the small-signal model of diodes and transistors can simplify the analysis considerably. In such an analysis, other components in the circuit must also be represented by a small-signal model. In particular, we must determine how the supply voltage, $V_{C C}$, behaves with respect to small changes in the currents and voltages of the circuit.\n\nThe key principle here is that the supply voltage (ideally) remains constant even though various voltages and currents within the circuit may change with time. Since the supply does not change and since the small-signal model of the circuit entails only changes in the quantities, we observe that $V_{C C}$ must be replaced with a zero voltage to signify the zero change. Thus, we simply \"ground\" the supply voltage in small-signal analysis. Similarly, any other constant voltage in the circuit is replaced with a ground connection.

For simplicity, we denote $\\Delta V_{BE}$ by $v_{\\pi}$ and the change in the collector current by $g_{m} v_{\\pi}$.\n\nThe change in $V_{BE}$ also causes another change:\n\n$$\n\\Delta I_{B} = \\frac{\\Delta I_{C}}{\\beta} \\tag{4.50}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\Delta I_{B} = \\frac{g_{m}}{\\beta} \\Delta V_{BE} \\tag{4.51}\n$$\n\nThis means that if the base-emitter voltage changes by $\\Delta V_{BE}$, the current flowing between these two terminals changes by $\\left(g_{m} / \\beta\\right) \\Delta V_{BE}$. Since the voltage and current correspond to the same two terminals, they can be related by Ohm's Law, i.e., by a resistor placed between the base and emitter having a value:\n\n$$\nr_{\\pi} = \\frac{\\Delta V_{BE}}{\\Delta I_{B}} \\tag{4.52}\n$$\n\n$$\nr_{\\pi} = \\frac{\\beta}{g_{m}} \\tag{4.53}\n$$\n\nThus, the forward-biased diode between the base and the emitter is modeled by a small-signal resistance equal to $\\beta / g_{m}$. This result is expected because the diode carries a bias current equal to $I_{C} / \\beta$ and, from Eq. (3.58), exhibits a small-signal resistance of $V_{T} /\\left(I_{C} / \\beta\\right) = \\beta\\left(V_{T} / I_{C}\\right) = \\beta / g_{m}$.\n\nNow, let's consider the collector and apply a voltage change with respect to the emitter (Fig. 4.23). As shown in Fig. 4.11, for a constant $V_{BE}$, the collector voltage has no effect on $I_{C}$ or $I_{B}$ because $I_{C} = I_{S} \\exp \\left(V_{BE} / V_{T}\\right)$ and $I_{B} = I_{C} / \\beta$.

It should be noted that both parameters of the model, $g_{m}$ and $r_{\\pi}$, depend on the bias current of the device. With a high collector bias current, a greater $g_{m}$ is obtained, but the impedance between the base and emitter falls to lower values. Studied in Chapter 5, this trade-off proves undesirable in some cases.\n\nThe equivalent circuit also predicts the change in the base current as:\n\n$$\n\\Delta I_{B} = \\frac{v_{1}}{r_{\\pi}} \\tag{4.61}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\Delta I_{B} = \\frac{1 \\mathrm{mV}}{375 \\Omega} \\tag{4.62}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\Delta I_{B} = 2.67 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\tag{4.63}\n$$\n\nwhich is, of course, equal to $\\Delta I_{C} / \\beta$.\n\nThe above example is not a useful circuit.

    "text": "---[Rephrased Text]---\n\nElectronic circuits, such as amplifiers, can include a significant number of transistors, which can complicate analysis and design significantly. As we learned in Chapter 3, diodes can be simplified to linear devices using the small-signal model. A similar advantage is gained if a small-signal model can be created for transistors.\n\nDeriving the small-signal model from the large-signal model is relatively straightforward. We perturb the voltage difference between every two terminals (while the third terminal remains at a constant potential), determine the changes in the currents flowing through all terminals, and represent the results by appropriate circuit elements such as controlled current sources or resistors. Figure 4.21 depicts two conceptual examples where $V_{B E}$ or $V_{C E}$ is changed by $\\Delta V$ and the changes in $I_{C}, I_{B}$, and $I_{E}$ are examined.\n\nLet's start with a change in $V_{B E}$ while the collector voltage is constant (Fig. 4.22). We know from the definition of transconductance that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\Delta I_{C}=g_{m} \\Delta V_{B E} \\tag{4.49}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis indicates that a voltage-controlled current source must be connected between the collector and the emitter with a value equal to $g_{m} \\Delta V$. For simplicity, we denote $\\Delta V_{B E}$ by $v_{\\pi}$ and the change in the collector current by $g_{m} v_{\\pi}$.\n\nThe change in $V_{B E}$ also creates another change:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Delta I_{B} & =\\frac{\\Delta I_{C}}{\\beta}  \\tag{4.50}\\\\\n& =\\frac{g_{m}}{\\beta} \\Delta V_{B E} \\tag{4.51}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThat is, if the base-emitter voltage changes by $\\Delta V_{B E}$, the current flowing between these two terminals changes by $\\left(g_{m} / \\beta\\right) \\Delta V_{B E}$. Since the voltage and current correspond to the same two terminals, they can be related by Ohm's Law, i.e., by a resistor placed between the base and emitter having a value:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nr_{\\pi} & =\\frac{\\Delta V_{B E}}{\\Delta I_{B}}  \\tag{4.52}\\\\\n& =\\frac{\\beta}{g_{m}} \\tag{4.53}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThus, the forward-biased diode between the base and the emitter is modeled by a small-signal resistance equal to $\\beta / g_{m}$. This result is expected because the diode carries a bias current equal to $I_{C} / \\beta$ and, from Eq. (3.58), exhibits a small-signal resistance of $V_{T} /\\left(I_{C} / \\beta\\right)=\\beta\\left(V_{T} / I_{C}\\right)=\\beta / g_{m}$.\n\nNow let's consider the collector and apply a voltage change with respect to the emitter (Fig. 4.23). As illustrated in Fig. 4.11, for a constant $V_{B E}$, the collector voltage has no effect on $I_{C}$ or $I_{B}$ because $I_{C}=I_{S} \\exp \\left(V_{B E} / V_{T}\\right)$ and $I_{B}=I_{C} / \\beta$. Since $\\Delta V_{C E}$ leads to no change in any of the terminal currents, the model developed in Fig. 4.22 need not be altered.\n\nWhat about a change in the collector-base voltage? As studied in Problem 4.18, such a change also results in a zero change in the terminal currents.\n\nThe simple small-signal model developed in Fig. 4.22 serves as a powerful, versatile tool in the analysis and design of bipolar circuits. We should remark that both parameters of the model, $g_{m}$ and $r_{\\pi}$, depend on the bias current of the device. With a high collector bias current, a greater $g_{m}$ is obtained, but the impedance between the base and emitter falls to lower values. Studied in Chapter 5, this trade-off proves undesirable in some cases.\n\nThe equivalent circuit also predicts the change in the base current as\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Delta I_{B} & =\\frac{v_{1}}{r_{\\pi}}  \\tag{4.61}\\\\\n& =\\frac{1 \\mathrm{mV}}{375 \\Omega}  \\tag{4.62}\\\\\n& =2.67 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\tag{4.63}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhich is, of course, equal to $\\Delta I_{C} / \\beta$.\n\nThe above example is not a useful circuit. The microphone signal produces a change in $I_{C}$, but the result flows through the $1.8-\\mathrm{V}$ battery. In other words, the circuit generates no output. On the other hand, if the collector current flows through a resistor, a useful output is provided.\n\nThe collector bias current of 6.92 mA flows through $R_{C}$, leading to a potential drop of $I_{C} R_{C}=692 \\mathrm{mV}$. The collector voltage, which is equal to $V_{\\text {out }}$, is thus given by:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{\\text {out }} & =V_{C C}-R_{C} I_{C}  \\tag{4.64}\\\\\n& =1.108 \\mathrm{~V} . \\tag{4.65}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSince the collector voltage (with respect to ground) is more positive than the base voltage, the device operates in the active mode.\n\nAs seen in the previous example, a $1-\\mathrm{mV}$ microphone signal leads to a $0.267-\\mathrm{mA}$ change in $I_{C}$. Upon flowing through $R_{C}$, this change yields a change of $0.267 \\mathrm{~mA} \\times 100 \\Omega=26.7 \\mathrm{mV}$ in $V_{\\text {out }}$. The circuit therefore amplifies the input by a factor of 26.7 .\n\nSmall-Signal Model of Supply Voltage We have seen that the use of the small-signal model of diodes and transistors can simplify the analysis considerably. In such an analysis, other components in the circuit must also be represented by a small-signal model. In particular, we must determine how the supply voltage, $V_{C C}$, behaves with respect to small changes in the currents and voltages of the circuit.\n\nThe key principle here is that the supply voltage (ideally) remains constant even though various voltages and currents within the circuit may change with time. Since the supply does not change and since the smallsignal model of the circuit entails only changes in the quantities, we observe that $V_{C C}$ must be replaced with a zero voltage to signify the zero change. Thus, we simply \"ground\" the supply voltage in small-signal analysis. Similarly, any other constant voltage in the circuit is replaced with a ground connection.

Nevertheless, certain circuits demand consideration of these effects to yield significant outcomes. The subsequent example serves to elucidate this notion.\n\nExample | Referring to the circuit in Example 4.11, let's assume an increase in $R_{C}$ to $200 \\Omega$ and $V_{C C}$ to 3.6 V. |\n| :---: | :--- |\n| 4.12 | Confirm the device's operation in the active mode and calculate the voltage gain. |\n\nSolution The voltage across $R_{C}$ now surges to $6.92 \\mathrm{~mA} \\times 200 \\Omega=1.384 \\mathrm{~V}$, resulting in a collector voltage of $3.6 \\mathrm{~V}-1.384 \\mathrm{~V}=2.216 \\mathrm{~V}$, ensuring operation in the active mode.

Since $R_{C}$ is doubled, the voltage gain must also double, reaching a value of 53.4. This result is also achieved with the assistance of the small-signal model.

Does this imply that, if $R_{C} \\rightarrow \\infty$, the gain also escalates indefinitely? Does another mechanism within the circuit, perhaps within the transistor, constrain the maximum gain achievable? Indeed, the \"Early effect\" translates to a nonideality in the device that can cap the gain of amplifiers.\n\nTo comprehend this effect, we revert to the transistor's internal operation and reevaluate the assertion presented in Fig. 4.11—that \"the collector current is independent of the collector voltage.\" Consider the device depicted in Fig. 4.27(a), where the collector voltage surpasses the base voltage, and the reverse bias across the junction establishes a certain depletion region width. Now, suppose $V_{C E}$ is elevated to $V_{C E 2}$ [Fig. 4.27(b)], thereby intensifying the reverse bias and broadening the depletion region in the collector and base regions. Since the base charge profile must still diminish to zero at the depletion region's edge, $x_{2}^{\\prime}$, the profile's slope increases. Similarly, the effective base width, $W_{B}$, in Eq. (4.8) diminishes, consequently augmenting the collector current. Unveiled by Early, this occurrence presents intriguing challenges in amplifier design (Chapter 5).\nimage_name:Figure 4.27 (a)\ndescription:\n[\nname: VBE, type: VoltageSource, value: VBE, ports: {Np: VBE, Nn: GND}\nname: VCE1, type: VoltageSource, value: VCE1, ports: {Np: VCE1, Nn: GND}\nname: VCE2, type: VoltageSource, value: VCE2, ports: {Np: VCE2, Nn: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:This circuit exemplifies the Early effect in bipolar transistors, depicting two configurations with distinct collector-emitter voltages (VCE1 and VCE2).

We must initially adjust Eq. (4.9) to incorporate this effect. It can be demonstrated that the surge in collector current with $V_{C E}$ can be approximately represented by a multiplicative factor:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{C} & =\\frac{A_{E} q D_{n} n_{i}^{2}}{N_{E} W_{B}}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{V_{C E}}{V_{A}}\\right)  \\tag{4.66}\\\\\n& \\approx\\left(I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{V_{C E}}{V_{A}}\\right) \\tag{4.67}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere $W_{B}$ is presumed constant, and the second factor, $1+V_{C E} / V_{A}$, models the Early effect.

This demonstrates the Early effect, where $I_C$ is not entirely independent of $V_{CE}$ due to the modulation of the effective base width.\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The Early effect introduces a linear relationship between $I_C$ and $V_{CE}$, resulting in a non-zero slope. This slope reflects the impact of the Early voltage, $V_A$, on the transistor's performance.\n- The graph with Early effect is represented by a solid line, while the graph without Early effect is depicted as a dashed line.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- The graph is annotated to clearly differentiate between the behaviors with and without the Early effect, using arrows and labels to indicate the respective curves.\n- The constant level of $I_C$ without Early effect is marked by a dashed line parallel to the x-axis, whereas the line with Early effect slopes upwards, indicating the increase in $I_C$ with $V_{CE}$.\n\nOverall, this graph effectively illustrates the Early effect's impact on the collector current as a function of the collector-emitter voltage, highlighting the deviation from ideal behavior in real-world transistors.\n\nFigure 4.28 Collector current as a function of (a) $V_{B E}$ and (b) $V_{C E}$ with and without Early effect.\n\nIt is instructive to scrutinize the I/V characteristics of Fig. 4.15 in the presence of the Early effect. For a constant $V_{C E}$, the dependence of $I_{C}$ upon $V_{B E}$ persists exponentially but with a slightly greater slope [Fig. 4.28(a)]. Conversely, for a constant $V_{B E}$, the $I_{C}-V_{C E}$ characteristic exhibits a non-zero slope [Fig. 4.28(b)]. In fact, differentiating Eq. (4.67) with respect to $V_{C E}$ yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\delta I_{C}}{\\delta V_{C E}} & =I_{S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{V_{A}}\\right)  \\tag{4.68}\\\\\n& \\approx \\frac{I_{C}}{V_{A}} \\tag{4.69}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere it is assumed $V_{C E} \\ll V_{A}$ and hence $I_{C} \\approx I_{S} \\exp \\left(V_{B E} / V_{T}\\right)$. This is a reasonable approximation in most cases.\n\nThe variation of $I_{C}$ with $V_{C E}$ in Fig. 4.28(b) reveals that the transistor indeed does not function as an ideal current source, necessitating a revision of the perspective shown in Fig. 4.11(a). The transistor can still be regarded as a two-terminal device but with a current that varies to some extent with $V_{C E}$ (Fig. 4.29).\nimage_name:Figure 4.29\ndescription:\n[\nname: Q1, type: NPN, ports: {C: X, B: V1, E: GND}\nname: V1, type: VoltageSource, value: V1, ports: {Np: V1, Nn: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:This diagram portrays a realistic model of a bipolar transistor as a current source.

The large-signal model of Fig. 4.13 must now be adjusted to that in Fig. 4.30, where\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{C} & =\\left(I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{V_{C E}}{V_{A}}\\right)  \\tag{4.76}\\\\\nI_{B} & =\\frac{1}{\\beta}\\left(I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}\\right)  \\tag{4.77}\\\\\nI_{E} & =I_{C}+I_{B} \\tag{4.78}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nNote that $I_{B}$ is independent of $V_{C E}$ and still determined by the base-emitter voltage.\n\nFor the small-signal model, we observe that the controlled current source remains unchanged, and $g_{m}$ is expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ng_{m} & =\\frac{d I_{C}}{d V_{B E}}  \\tag{4.79}\\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{V_{T}}\\left(I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{V_{C E}}{V_{A}}\\right)  \\tag{4.80}\\\\\n& =\\frac{I_{C}}{V_{T}} \\tag{4.81}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSimilarly,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nr_{\\pi} & =\\frac{\\beta}{g_{m}}  \\tag{4.82}\\\\\n& =\\beta \\frac{V_{T}}{I_{C}} \\tag{4.83}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nConsidering that the collector current does vary with $V_{C E}$, let us now apply a voltage change at the collector and measure the resulting current change [Fig. 4.31(a)]:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C}+\\Delta I_{C}=\\left(I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{V_{C E}+\\Delta V_{C E}}{V_{A}}\\right) \\tag{4.84}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIt follows that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\Delta I_{C}=\\left(I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}\\right) \\frac{\\Delta V_{C E}}{V_{A}} \\tag{4.85}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhich is consistent with Eq. (4.69). Since the voltage and current change correspond to the same two terminals, they adhere to Ohm's Law, yielding an equivalent resistor:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nr_{O} & =\\frac{\\Delta V_{C E}}{\\Delta I_{C}}  \\tag{4.86}\\\\\n& =\\frac{V_{A}}{I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}}  \\tag{4.87}\\\\\n& \\approx \\frac{V_{A}}{I_{C}} \\tag{4.88}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIllustrated in Fig. 4.31(b), the small-signal model incorporates only one additional element, $r_{O}$, to represent the Early effect. Termed the \"output resistance,\" $r_{O}$ plays a crucial role in high-gain amplifiers (Chapter 5). Note that both $r_{\\pi}$ and $r_{O}$ are inversely proportional to the bias current, $I_{C}$.\n\nExample:\nA transistor is biased at a collector current of 1 mA. Determine the small-signal model if $\\beta=100$ and $V_{A}=15 \\mathrm{~V}$.\n\nExercise: What early voltage is necessary if the output resistance must attain $25 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$?\n\nIn the following chapter, we revisit Example 4.12 and ascertain the gain of the amplifier in the presence of the Early effect. We will conclude that the gain is ultimately limited by the transistor output resistance, $r_{O}$. Figure 4.32 encapsulates the concepts examined in this section.\n\nAn essential concept that has emerged from our examination of the transistor is the notion of biasing. We must establish appropriate dc voltages and currents at the device terminals to achieve two objectives: (1) ensure operation in the active mode ($V_{B E}>0, V_{C E} \\geq 0$); e.g., the load resistance connected to the collector confronts an upper limit for a given supply voltage (Example 4.7); (2) establish a collector current that yields the required values for the small-signal parameters $g_{m}, r_{O}$, and $r_{\\pi}$. The analysis of amplifiers in the subsequent chapter extensively employs these ideas.\n\nFinally, we should note that the small-signal model of Fig. 4.31(b) does not account for the high-frequency limitations of the transistor. For instance, the base-emitter and base-collector junctions exhibit a depletion-region capacitance that affects the speed. These characteristics are explored in Chapter 11."

    "text": "Our exploration of the bipolar transistor has thus far focused on its foundational concepts, neglecting secondary effects within the device and their manifestation in the large-signal and small-signal models. Nevertheless, certain circuits necessitate consideration of these effects to achieve meaningful outcomes. The subsequent example elucidates this necessity.\n\n| Example | Referring to the circuit depicted in Example 4.11, let's assume we increase $R_{C}$ to $200 \\Omega$ and $V_{C C}$ to 3.6 V. |\n| :---: | :--- |\n| 4.12 | Confirm that the device is operating in the active mode and calculate the voltage gain. |\n\nSolution The voltage across $R_{C}$ now rises to $6.92 \\mathrm{~mA} \\times 200 \\Omega=1.384 \\mathrm{~V}$, resulting in a collector voltage of $3.6 \\mathrm{~V}-1.384 \\mathrm{~V}=2.216 \\mathrm{~V}$ and ensuring operation in the active mode.

Since $R_{C}$ is doubled, the voltage gain must also double, reaching a value of 53.4. This result is also derived with the assistance of the small-signal model.

Does this imply that, if $R_{C} \\rightarrow \\infty$, the gain will also grow indefinitely? Does another mechanism within the circuit, perhaps within the transistor, impose a limit on the maximum achievable gain? Indeed, the \"Early effect\" refers to a non-ideal characteristic of the device that can constrain the gain of amplifiers.\n\nTo comprehend this effect, we revert to the internal workings of the transistor and reassess the assertion presented in Fig. 4.11—that \"the collector current is independent of the collector voltage.\" Consider the device illustrated in Fig. 4.27(a), where the collector voltage exceeds the base voltage, and the reverse bias across the junction establishes a certain depletion region width. Now, suppose $V_{C E}$ is elevated to $V_{C E 2}$ [Fig. 4.27(b)], thereby augmenting the reverse bias and widening the depletion region in the collector and base regions. Since the base charge profile must still diminish to zero at the periphery of the depletion region, $x_{2}^{\\prime}$, the slope of the profile intensifies. Similarly, the effective base width, $W_{B}$, in Eq. (4.8) diminishes, thereby augmenting the collector current. Discovered by Early, this phenomenon presents intriguing challenges in amplifier design (Chapter 5).\nimage_name:Figure 4.27 (a)\ndescription:\n[\nname: VBE, type: VoltageSource, value: VBE, ports: {Np: VBE, Nn: GND}\nname: VCE1, type: VoltageSource, value: VCE1, ports: {Np: VCE1, Nn: GND}\nname: VCE2, type: VoltageSource, value: VCE2, ports: {Np: VCE2, Nn: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit depicts the Early effect in bipolar transistors, showcasing two configurations with distinct collector-emitter voltages (VCE1 and VCE2).

We must initially modify Eq. (4.9) to encompass this effect. It can be demonstrated that the surge in the collector current with $V_{C E}$ can be approximately expressed by a multiplicative factor:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{C} & =\\frac{A_{E} q D_{n} n_{i}^{2}}{N_{E} W_{B}}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{V_{C E}}{V_{A}}\\right)  \\tag{4.66}\\\\\n& \\approx\\left(I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{V_{C E}}{V_{A}}\\right) \\tag{4.67}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere $W_{B}$ is presumed constant and the second factor, $1+V_{C E} / V_{A}$, models the Early effect.

This demonstrates the Early effect, where $I_C$ is not entirely independent of $V_{CE}$ due to the modulation of the effective base width.\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The Early effect introduces a linear relationship between $I_C$ and $V_{CE}$, resulting in a non-zero slope. This slope reflects the impact of the Early voltage, $V_A$, on the transistor's performance.\n- The graph with Early effect is represented by a solid line, while the graph without Early effect is depicted as a dashed line.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- The graph is annotated to clearly differentiate between the behaviors with and without the Early effect, using arrows and labels to indicate the respective curves.\n- The constant level of $I_C$ without Early effect is marked by a dashed line parallel to the x-axis, whereas the line with Early effect slopes upwards, indicating the increase in $I_C$ with $V_{CE}$.\n\nOverall, this graph effectively illustrates the Early effect's impact on the collector current as a function of the collector-emitter voltage, highlighting the deviation from ideal behavior in real-world transistors.\n\nFigure 4.28 Collector current as a function of (a) $V_{B E}$ and (b) $V_{C E}$ with and without Early effect.\n\nIt is instructive to analyze the I/V characteristics of Fig. 4.15 in the presence of the Early effect. For a constant $V_{C E}$, the dependence of $I_{C}$ upon $V_{B E}$ remains exponential but with a somewhat greater slope [Fig. 4.28(a)]. Conversely, for a constant $V_{B E}$, the $I_{C}-V_{C E}$ characteristic displays a nonzero slope [Fig. 4.28(b)]. In fact, differentiation of Eq. (4.67) with respect to $V_{C E}$ yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\delta I_{C}}{\\delta V_{C E}} & =I_{S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{V_{A}}\\right)  \\tag{4.68}\\\\\n& \\approx \\frac{I_{C}}{V_{A}} \\tag{4.69}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere it is assumed $V_{C E} \\ll V_{A}$ and hence $I_{C} \\approx I_{S} \\exp \\left(V_{B E} / V_{T}\\right)$. This is a reasonable approximation in most cases.\n\nThe variation of $I_{C}$ with $V_{C E}$ in Fig. 4.28(b) reveals that the transistor in fact does not operate as an ideal current source, necessitating modification of the perspective shown in Fig. 4.11(a). The transistor can still be viewed as a two-terminal device but with a current that varies to some extent with $V_{C E}$ (Fig. 4.29).\nimage_name:Figure 4.29\ndescription:\n[\nname: Q1, type: NPN, ports: {C: X, B: V1, E: GND}\nname: V1, type: VoltageSource, value: V1, ports: {Np: V1, Nn: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:The diagram illustrates a realistic model of a bipolar transistor as a current source.

Indeed, the \"Early effect\" manifests as a non-ideal aspect of the device that can restrict amplifier gain.\n\nTo comprehend this effect, we revisit the internal workings of the transistor and reevaluate the assertion in Fig. 4.11 that \"the collector current is independent of the collector voltage.\" Consider the device in Fig. 4.27(a), where the collector voltage is higher than the base voltage, and the reverse bias across the junction establishes a specific depletion region width. Now, if $V_{C E}$ is elevated to $V_{C E 2}$ [Fig. 4.27(b)], the reverse bias increases, broadening the depletion region in the collector and base regions. Because the base charge profile must still reach zero at the depletion region's edge, $x_{2}^{\\prime}$, the profile's slope increases. Consequently, the effective base width, $W_{B}$, in Eq.

For a constant $V_{C E}$, the dependence of $I_{C}$ on $V_{B E}$ remains exponential but with a slightly steeper slope [Fig. 4.28(a)]. Conversely, for a constant $V_{B E}$, the $I_{C}-V_{C E}$ characteristic exhibits a non-zero slope [Fig. 4.28(b)]. In fact, differentiating Eq.

The large-signal model of Fig. 4.13 must now be adjusted to that in Fig. 4.30, where\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{C} & =\\left(I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{V_{C E}}{V_{A}}\\right)  \\tag{4.76}\\\\\nI_{B} & =\\frac{1}{\\beta}\\left(I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}\\right)  \\tag{4.77}\\\\\nI_{E} & =I_{C}+I_{B} \\tag{4.78}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nNote that $I_{B}$ remains independent of $V_{C E}$ and is still dictated by the base-emitter voltage.\n\nFor the small-signal model, we observe that the controlled current source remains unchanged, and $g_{m}$ is expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ng_{m} & =\\frac{d I_{C}}{d V_{B E}}  \\tag{4.79}\\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{V_{T}}\\left(I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{V_{C E}}{V_{A}}\\right)  \\tag{4.80}\\\\\n& =\\frac{I_{C}}{V_{T}} \\tag{4.81}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSimilarly,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nr_{\\pi} & =\\frac{\\beta}{g_{m}}  \\tag{4.82}\\\\\n& =\\beta \\frac{V_{T}}{I_{C}} \\tag{4.83}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nConsidering that the collector current does vary with $V_{C E}$, let's now apply a voltage change at the collector and measure the resulting current change [Fig. 4.31(a)]:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C}+\\Delta I_{C}=\\left(I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{V_{C E}+\\Delta V_{C E}}{V_{A}}\\right) \\tag{4.84}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIt follows that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\Delta I_{C}=\\left(I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}\\right) \\frac{\\Delta V_{C E}}{V_{A}} \\tag{4.85}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhich aligns with Eq. (4.69). Since the voltage and current changes correspond to the same two terminals, they adhere to Ohm's Law, yielding an equivalent resistor:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nr_{O} & =\\frac{\\Delta V_{C E}}{\\Delta I_{C}}  \\tag{4.86}\\\\\n& =\\frac{V_{A}}{I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}}  \\tag{4.87}\\\\\n& \\approx \\frac{V_{A}}{I_{C}} \\tag{4.88}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIllustrated in Fig. 4.31(b), the small-signal model incorporates only one additional element, $r_{O}$, to represent the Early effect. Known as the \"output resistance,\" $r_{O}$ plays a pivotal role in high-gain amplifiers (Chapter 5). Note that both $r_{\\pi}$ and $r_{O}$ are inversely proportional to the bias current, $I_{C}$.\n\n| Example |\n| :--- |\n| 4.14 |\n\nA transistor is biased at a collector current of 1 mA.

We will conclude that the gain is ultimately capped by the transistor's output resistance, $r_{O}$. Figure 4.32 encapsulates the concepts examined in this section.\n\nA pivotal concept that has emerged from our transistor study is the notion of biasing. We must establish proper dc voltages and currents at the device terminals to achieve two objectives: (1) ensure operation in the active mode ($V_{B E}>0, V_{C E} \\geq 0$); e.g., the load resistance connected to the collector confronts an upper limit for a given supply voltage (Example 4.7); (2) set a collector current that yields the required values for the small-signal parameters $g_{m}, r_{O}$, and $r_{\\pi}$. The subsequent chapter's amplifier analysis will extensively employ these ideas.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that the small-signal model of Fig. 4.31(b) does not account for the high-frequency constraints of the transistor. For instance, the base-emitter and base-collector junctions exhibit a depletion-region capacitance that affects the speed. These characteristics are explored in Chapter 11."

    "text": "Our focus on bipolar transistors has primarily been on the underlying principles, while disregarding secondary effects within the device and their representation in both the large-signal and small-signal models. Nonetheless, for certain circuits, these secondary effects are significant and must be considered to achieve meaningful results. The following example serves to illustrate this point.\n\n| Example | Assuming the circuit from Example 4.11, let's increase $R_{C}$ to $200 \\Omega$ and $V_{C C}$ to 3.6 V. |\n| :---: | :--- |\n| 4.12 | Confirm that the device is in the active mode and calculate the voltage gain. |\n\nSolution The voltage across $R_{C}$ increases to $6.92 \\mathrm{~mA} \\times 200 \\Omega=1.384 \\mathrm{~V}$, resulting in a collector voltage of $3.6 \\mathrm{~V}-1.384 \\mathrm{~V}=2.216 \\mathrm{~V}$, ensuring operation in the active mode. It's important to note that if $V_{C C}$ isn't doubled, then $V_{\\text {out }}=1.8 \\mathrm{~V}-1.384 \\mathrm{~V}=0.416 \\mathrm{~V}$, and the transistor is not in the forward active region.\n\nFrom part (b) of the previous example, we know that the change in output voltage is equal to the change in collector current multiplied by $R_{C}$. Since $R_{C}$ is doubled, the voltage gain must also double, reaching a value of 53.4. This result is also obtained using the small-signal model. As shown in Fig. 4.26, the small-signal model of the stage depicted in Fig. 4.25 is a transistor amplifier stage. The voltage gain is determined by the expression -gm * RC. The current source gmvπ generates a current proportional to the voltage across rπ, influencing the output voltage Vout.\n\nFigure 4.26 Small-signal equivalent circuit of the stage shown in Fig. 4.25.\nequivalent circuit yields $v_{\\text {out }}=-g_{m} v_{\\pi} R_{C}=-g_{m} v_{1} R_{C}$ and hence $v_{\\text {out }} / v_{1}=-g_{m} R_{C}$. With $g_{m}=(3.75 \\Omega)^{-1}$ and $R_{C}=200 \\Omega$, we have $v_{\\text {out }} / v_{1}=-53.4$.\n\nExercise What happens if $R_{C}=250 \\Omega$ ?\n\nThis example highlights an important trend: as $R_{C}$ increases, the voltage gain of the circuit also increases. Does this imply that if $R_{C} \\rightarrow \\infty$, the gain will also grow indefinitely? Is there another mechanism in the circuit, perhaps within the transistor, that limits the maximum achievable gain? Indeed, the \"Early effect\" refers to a non-ideal behavior in the device that can limit the gain of amplifiers.\n\nTo understand this effect, we revisit the internal operation of the transistor and reconsider the claim shown in Fig. 4.11 that \"the collector current does not depend on the collector voltage.\" Consider the device shown in Fig. 4.27(a), where the collector voltage is slightly higher than the base voltage, and the reverse bias across the junction creates a certain depletion region width. Now, suppose $V_{C E}$ is increased to $V_{C E 2}$ [Fig. 4.27(b)], thus increasing the reverse bias and widening the depletion region in the collector and base areas. Since the base charge profile must still fall to zero at the edge of the depletion region, $x_{2}^{\\prime}$, the slope of the profile increases. Equivalently, the effective base width, $W_{B}$, in Eq. (4.8) decreases, thereby increasing the collector current. Discovered by Early, this phenomenon poses interesting challenges in amplifier design (Chapter 5).\nimage_name:Figure 4.27 (a)\ndescription:\n[\nname: VBE, type: VoltageSource, value: VBE, ports: {Np: VBE, Nn: GND}\nname: VCE1, type: VoltageSource, value: VCE1, ports: {Np: VCE1, Nn: GND}\nname: VCE2, type: VoltageSource, value: VCE2, ports: {Np: VCE2, Nn: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit illustrates the Early effect in bipolar transistors, showing two configurations with different collector-emitter voltages (VCE1 and VCE2).

We must first modify Eq. (4.9) to include this effect. It can be demonstrated that the increase in the collector current with $V_{C E}$ can be approximately expressed by a multiplicative factor:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{C} & =\\frac{A_{E} q D_{n} n_{i}^{2}}{N_{E} W_{B}}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{V_{C E}}{V_{A}}\\right)  \\tag{4.66}\\\\\n& \\approx\\left(I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{V_{C E}}{V_{A}}\\right) \\tag{4.67}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere $W_{B}$ is assumed constant and the second factor, $1+V_{C E} / V_{A}$, models the Early effect.

This graph illustrates the influence of the Early effect on the $I_C-V_{CE}$ characteristic of a bipolar junction transistor.\n\n1. **Type of Graph and Function:**\n- This is a characteristic curve graph showing the relationship between collector current and collector-emitter voltage.\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n- The x-axis represents the collector-emitter voltage, $V_{CE}$.\n- The y-axis represents the collector current, $I_C$.\n- There are no specific units or scales indicated, but typically $V_{CE}$ is measured in volts and $I_C$ in amperes or milliamperes.\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- Without the Early effect, the graph shows a horizontal line, indicating that the collector current $I_C$ remains constant as $V_{CE}$ increases, after reaching a certain threshold, typical of ideal transistor behavior.\n- With the Early effect, the graph exhibits a slight positive slope, indicating that $I_C$ increases linearly with $V_{CE}$. This demonstrates the Early effect, where $I_C$ is not entirely independent of $V_{CE}$ due to the modulation of the effective base width.\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The Early effect introduces a linear relationship between $I_C$ and $V_{CE}$, resulting in a non-zero slope. This slope reflects the impact of the Early voltage, $V_A$, on the transistor's performance.\n- The graph with Early effect is represented by a solid line, while the graph without Early effect is depicted as a dashed line.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- The graph is annotated to clearly differentiate between the behaviors with and without the Early effect, using arrows and labels to indicate the respective curves.\n- The constant level of $I_C$ without Early effect is marked by a dashed line parallel to the x-axis, whereas the line with Early effect slopes upwards, indicating the increase in $I_C$ with $V_{CE}$.\n\nOverall, this graph effectively illustrates the Early effect's impact on the collector current as a function of the collector-emitter voltage, highlighting the deviation from ideal behavior in real-world transistors.\n\nFigure 4.28 Collector current as a function of (a) $V_{B E}$ and (b) $V_{C E}$ with and without Early effect.\n\nIt is instructive to examine the I/V characteristics of Fig. 4.15 in the presence of the Early effect. For a constant $V_{C E}$, the dependence of $I_{C}$ upon $V_{B E}$ remains exponential but with a somewhat greater slope [Fig. 4.28(a)]. On the other hand, for a constant $V_{B E}$, the $I_{C}-V_{C E}$ characteristic displays a non-zero slope [Fig. 4.28(b)]. In fact, differentiation of Eq. (4.67) with respect to $V_{C E}$ yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\delta I_{C}}{\\delta V_{C E}} & =I_{S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{V_{A}}\\right)  \\tag{4.68}\\\\\n& \\approx \\frac{I_{C}}{V_{A}} \\tag{4.69}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere it is assumed $V_{C E} \\ll V_{A}$ and hence $I_{C} \\approx I_{S} \\exp \\left(V_{B E} / V_{T}\\right)$. This is a reasonable approximation in most cases.\n\nThe variation of $I_{C}$ with $V_{C E}$ in Fig. 4.28(b) reveals that the transistor in fact does not operate as an ideal current source, requiring modification of the perspective shown in Fig. 4.11(a). The transistor can still be viewed as a two-terminal device but with a current that varies to some extent with $V_{C E}$ (Fig. 4.29).\nimage_name:Figure 4.29\ndescription:\n[\nname: Q1, type: NPN, ports: {C: X, B: V1, E: GND}\nname: V1, type: VoltageSource, value: V1, ports: {Np: V1, Nn: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:The diagram illustrates a realistic model of a bipolar transistor as a current source.

    "text": "The examination of the bipolar transistor has predominantly focused on its fundamental principles, neglecting the secondary effects within the device and their depiction in the large-signal and small-signal models. Nonetheless, certain circuits necessitate the consideration of these effects to yield significant outcomes. The subsequent example elucidates this perspective.\n\n| Example | Examining the circuit depicted in Example 4.11, let's assume we elevate $R_{C}$ to $200 \\Omega$ and $V_{C C}$ to 3.6 V. |\n| :---: | :--- |\n| 4.12 | Confirmed that the device operates within the active region and calculated the voltage amplification. |\n\nSolution The voltage drop across $R_{C}$ now expands to $6.92 \\mathrm{~mA} \\times 200 \\Omega=1.384 \\mathrm{~V}$, resulting in a collector voltage of $3.6 \\mathrm{~V}-1.384 \\mathrm{~V}=2.216 \\mathrm{~V}$, thereby ensuring the active mode of operation.

Given that $R_{C}$ is doubled, the voltage amplification must also double, attaining a value of 53.4. This outcome is also ascertainable using the small-signal model.

Does this imply that if $R_{C} \\rightarrow \\infty$, then the amplification would indefinitely grow? Might another mechanism within the circuit, perhaps within the transistor,制约 the maximum amplification achievable? Indeed, the \"Early effect\" represents a non-ideal characteristic of the device that can cap the amplification of amplifiers.\n\nTo grasp this impact, we revert to the internal workings of the transistor and reassess the assertion depicted in Fig. 4.11 that \"the collector current does not rely on the collector voltage.\" Contemplating the transistor illustrated in Fig. 4.27(a), where the collector voltage is slightly greater than the base voltage, and the reverse bias across the junction generates a certain depletion region width. Now envision $V_{C E}$ ascending to $V_{C E 2}$ [Fig. 4.27(b)], thereby augmenting the reverse bias and expanding the depletion region within the collector and base regions. Since the base charge profile must still diminish to zero at the boundary of the depletion region, $x_{2}^{\\prime}$, the gradient of the profile intensifies. Equivalently, the effective base width, $W_{B}$, in Eq. (4.8) diminishes, consequently augmenting the collector current. Observed by Early, this phenomenon presents intriguing challenges in amplifier design (Chapter 5).\nimage_name:Figure 4.27 (a)\ndescription:\n[\nname: VBE, type: VoltageSource, value: VBE, ports: {Np: VBE, Nn: GND}\nname: VCE1, type: VoltageSource, value: VCE1, ports: {Np: VCE1, Nn: GND}\nname: VCE2, type: VoltageSource, value: VCE2, ports: {Np: VCE2, Nn: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit demonstrates the Early effect in bipolar transistors, presenting two configurations with distinct collector-emitter voltages (VCE1 and VCE2).

This section examines the behavior of the device outside this region and the associated challenges.\n\nConsider setting $V_{B E}$ to a typical value, such as 750 mV, and varying the collector voltage from a high to a low level [Fig. 4.33(a)]. As $V_{C E}$ approaches $V_{B E}$ and $V_{B C}$ moves from a negative value toward zero, the base-collector junction experiences reduced reverse bias. When $V_{C E}=V_{B E}$, the junction maintains zero voltage difference, but its depletion region still absorbs most of the electrons injected by the emitter into the base. However, if $V_{C E}<V_{B E}$, i.e., $V_{B C}>0$, and the B-C junction becomes forward-biased, the transistor enters the \"saturation region.\" Suppose $V_{C E}=550 \\mathrm{mV}$, resulting in $V_{B C}=+200 \\mathrm{mV}$. From Chapter 2, we know that a diode with a forward bias of 200 mV conducts an extremely small current. ${ }^{1}$ Thus, even in this scenario, the transistor continues to operate similarly to the active mode, a state referred to as \"soft saturation.\"\n\nIf the collector voltage decreases further, the B-C junction experiences greater forward bias, carrying a significant current [Fig. 4.33(b)].

Thus, the external component determines the collector voltage and, consequently, the operational region.\n\nExample\n4.16\n\nFor the circuit in Fig. 4.36, determine the relationship between $R_{C}$ and $V_{C C}$ that ensures operation in either soft saturation or the active region.\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:\n[\nname: Q1, type: NPN, ports: {C: d1rc, B: VBE, E: GND}\nname: RC, type: Resistor, value: RC, ports: {N1: VCC, N2: d1rc}\nname: VBE, type: VoltageSource, value: VBE, ports: {Np: VBE, Nn: GND}\nname: VCC, type: VoltageSource, value: VCC, ports: {Np: VCC, Nn: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit consists of an NPN transistor Q1 with its collector connected to a resistor RC and a voltage source VCC. The base is connected to a voltage source VBE. The emitter is grounded. The collector current IC flows through RC.\n\n(a)\nimage_name:(b)\ndescription:The graph in Figure 4.36 (b) is a linear plot showing the acceptable range of the supply voltage \\( V_{CC} \\) and the collector resistor \\( R_{C} \\) for a given transistor circuit.\n\n**Axes Labels and Units:**\n- The horizontal axis represents the collector resistor \\( R_{C} \\), likely in ohms, though the unit is not explicitly marked.\n- The vertical axis represents the supply voltage \\( V_{CC} \\), likely in volts.\n\n**Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- The graph shows a linear relationship between \\( V_{CC} \\) and \\( R_{C} \\).

The collector voltage must not drop more than 400 mV below the base voltage:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{C C}-R_{C} I_{C} \\geq V_{B E}-400 \\mathrm{mV} \\tag{4.98}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{C C} \\geq I_{C} R_{C}+\\left(V_{B E}-400 \\mathrm{mV}\\right) \\tag{4.99}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor a given $R_{C}$, $V_{C C}$ must be sufficiently high to ensure that $V_{C C}-I_{C} R_{C}$ maintains a reasonable collector voltage.\n\nExercise: Determine the maximum allowable value of $R_{C}$.\n\nIn the deep saturation region, the collector-emitter voltage approaches a constant value, $V_{C E, \\text { sat }}$ (around 200 mV). Under this condition, the transistor no longer resembles a controlled current source and can be modeled as shown in Fig. 4.37. (The battery between C and E indicates that $V_{C E}$ is relatively constant in deep saturation.)\nimage_name:Figure 4.37 Transistor model in deep saturation\ndescription:\n[\nname: 800 mV, type: VoltageSource, value: 800 mV, ports: {Np: B, Nn: E}\nname: 200 mV, type: VoltageSource, value: 200 mV, ports: {Np: C, Nn: E}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit represents a transistor model in deep saturation with two voltage sources connected between the base, collector, and emitter.\n\nFigure 4.37 Transistor model in deep saturation."
