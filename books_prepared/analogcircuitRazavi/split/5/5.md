# Bipolar Amplifiers

With the physics and operation of bipolar transistors described in Chapter 4, we now deal with amplifier circuits employing such devices. While the field of microelectronics involves much more than amplifiers, our study of cellphones and digital cameras in Chapter 1 indicates the extremely wide usage of amplification, motivating us to master the analysis and design of such building blocks. This chapter proceeds as follows.

Building the foundation for the remainder of this book, this chapter is quite long. Most of the concepts introduced here are invoked again in Chapter 7 (MOS amplifiers). The reader is therefore encouraged to take frequent breaks and absorb the material in small doses.

## 5.1 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

Recall from Chapter 4 that a voltage-controlled current source along with a load resistor can form an amplifier. In general, an amplifier produces an output (voltage or current) that is a magnified version of the input (voltage or current). Since most electronic circuits both sense and produce voltage quantities, ${ }^{1}$ our discussion primarily centers around "voltage amplifiers" and the concept of "voltage gain," $v_{\text {out }} / v_{\text {in }}$.

What other aspects of an amplifier's performance are important? Three parameters that readily come to mind are (1) power dissipation (e.g., because it determines the battery lifetime in a cellphone or a digital camera); (2) speed (e.g., some amplifiers in a cellphone or analog-to-digital converters in a digital camera must operate at high frequencies);

[^1](3) noise (e.g., the front-end amplifier in a cellphone or a digital camera processes small signals and must introduce negligible noise of its own).

### 5.1.1 Input and Output Impedances

In addition to the above parameters, the input and output (I/O) impedances of an amplifier play a critical role in its capability to interface with preceding and following stages. To understand this concept, let us first determine the I/O impedances of an ideal voltage amplifier. At the input, the circuit must operate as a voltmeter, i.e., sense a voltage without disturbing (loading) the preceding stage. The ideal input impedance is therefore infinite. At the output, the circuit must behave as a voltage source, i.e., deliver a constant signal level to any load impedance. Thus, the ideal output impedance is equal to zero.

In reality, the I/O impedances of a voltage amplifier may considerably depart from the ideal values, requiring attention to the interface with other stages. The following example illustrates the issue.

An amplifier with a voltage gain of 10 senses a signal generated by a microphone and applies the amplified output to a speaker [Fig. 5.1(a)]. Assume the microphone can be modeled with a voltage source having a $10-\mathrm{mV}$ peak-to-peak signal and a series resistance of $200 \Omega$. Also assume the speaker can be represented by an $8-\Omega$ resistor.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7b9ff0648e0b061c60d8g-17.jpg?height=1874&width=2382&top_left_y=3053&top_left_x=1172)

Figure 5.1 (a) Simple audio system, (b) signal loss due to amplifier input impedance, (c) signal loss due to amplifier output impedance.
(a) Determine the signal level sensed by the amplifier if the circuit has an input impedance of $2 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ or $500 \Omega$.
(b) Determine the signal level delivered to the speaker if the circuit has an output impedance of $10 \Omega$ or $2 \Omega$.

Solution (a) Figure 5.1(b) shows the interface between the microphone and the amplifier. The voltage sensed by the amplifier is therefore given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{1}=\frac{R_{\text {in }}}{R_{\text {in }}+R_{m}} v_{m} \tag{5.1}
\end{equation*}
$$

For $R_{\text {in }}=2 \mathrm{k} \Omega$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{1}=0.91 v_{m} \tag{5.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

only $9 \%$ less than the microphone signal level. On the other hand, for $R_{\text {in }}=$ $500 \Omega$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{1}=0.71 v_{m} \tag{5.3}
\end{equation*}
$$

i.e., nearly $30 \%$ loss. It is therefore desirable to maximize the input impedance in this case.
(b) Drawing the interface between the amplifier and the speaker as in Fig. 5.1(c), we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{\text {out }}=\frac{R_{L}}{R_{L}+R_{\text {amp }}} v_{\text {amp }} \tag{5.4}
\end{equation*}
$$

For $R_{a m p}=10 \Omega$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{\text {out }}=0.44 v_{\text {amp }}, \tag{5.5}
\end{equation*}
$$

a substantial attenuation. For $R_{a m p}=2 \Omega$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{\text {out }}=0.8 v_{\text {amp }} \tag{5.6}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus, the output impedance of the amplifier must be minimized.

Exercise If the signal delivered to the speaker is equal to $0.2 v_{m}$, find the ratio of $R_{m}$ and $R_{L}$.

The importance of I/O impedances encourages us to carefully prescribe the method of measuring them. As with the impedance of two-terminal devices such as resistors and capacitors, the input (output) impedance is measured between the input (output) nodes of the circuit while all independent sources in the circuit are set to zero. ${ }^{2}$ Illustrated in Fig. 5.2, the method involves applying a voltage source to the two nodes (also called "ports") of interest, measuring the resulting current, and defining $v_{X} / i_{X}$ as the impedance. Also shown are arrows to denote "looking into" the input or output port and the corresponding impedance.

The reader may wonder why the output port in Fig. 5.2(a) is left open whereas the input port in Fig. 5.2(b) is shorted. Since a voltage amplifier is driven by a voltage source during normal operation, and since all independent sources must be set to zero, the input

[^2]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7b9ff0648e0b061c60d8g-19.jpg?height=778&width=2205&top_left_y=684&top_left_x=1255)

Figure 5.2 Measurement of (a) input and (b) output impedances.
port in Fig. 5.2(b) must be shorted to represent a zero voltage source. That is, the procedure for calculating the output impedance is identical to that used for obtaining the Thevenin impedance of a circuit (Chapter 1). In Fig. 5.2(a), on the other hand, the output remains open because it is not connected to any external sources.

Determining the transfer of signals from one stage to the next, the I/O impedances are usually regarded as small-signal quantities-with the tacit assumption that the signal levels are indeed small. For example, the input impedance is obtained by applying a small change in the input voltage and measuring the resulting change in the input current. The small-signal models of semiconductor devices therefore prove crucial here.

Example

Assuming that the transistor operates in the forward active region, determine the input impedance of the circuit shown in Fig. 5.3(a).

Solution Constructing the small-signal equivalent circuit depicted in Fig. 5.3(b), we note that the input impedance is simply given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{x}}{i_{x}}=r_{\pi} \tag{5.7}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since $r_{\pi}=\beta / g_{m}=\beta V_{T} / I_{C}$, we conclude that a higher $\beta$ or lower $I_{C}$ yield a higher input impedance.

Exercise What happens if $R_{C}$ is doubled?

Figure 5.4 Concept of impedance seen at a node.
To simplify the notations and diagrams, we often refer to the impedance seen at a node rather than between two nodes (i.e., at a port). As illustrated in Fig. 5.4, such a convention simply assumes that the other node is the ground, i.e., the test voltage source is applied between the node of interest and ground.

Example 5.3

Calculate the impedance seen looking into the collector of $Q_{1}$ in Fig. 5.5(a).

Solution Setting the input voltage to zero and using the small-signal model in Fig. 5.5(b), we note that $v_{\pi}=0, g_{m} v_{\pi}=0$, and hence $R_{\text {out }}=r_{O}$.

Figure 5.6 (a) Impedance seen at emitter, (b) small-signal model.

Solution Setting the input voltage to zero and replacing $V_{C C}$ with ac ground, we arrive at the small-signal circuit shown in Fig. 5.6(b). Interestingly, $v_{\pi}=-v_{X}$ and

$$
\begin{equation*}
g_{m} v_{\pi}+\frac{v_{\pi}}{r_{\pi}}=-i_{X} \tag{5.8}

$$

That is,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{X}}{i_{X}}=\frac{1}{g_{m}+\frac{1}{r_{\pi}}} \tag{5.9}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since $r_{\pi}=\beta / g_{m} \gg 1 / g_{m}$, we have $R_{\text {out }} \approx 1 / g_{m}$.
Exercise What happens if a resistance of value $R_{1}$ is placed in series with the collector?

The above three examples provide three important rules that will be used throughout this book (Fig. 5.7): Looking into the base, we see $r_{\pi}$ if the emitter is (ac) grounded. Looking into the collector, we see $r_{O}$ if the emitter is (ac) grounded. Looking into the emitter, we see $1 / g_{m}$ if the base is (ac) grounded and the Early effect is neglected. It is imperative that the reader master these rules and be able to apply them in more complex circuits. ${ }^{3}$

### 5.1.2 Biasing

Recall from Chapter 4 that a bipolar transistor operates as an amplifying device if it is biased in the active mode; that is, in the absence of signals, the environment surrounding the device must ensure that the base-emitter and base-collector junctions are forward- and reverse-biased, respectively. Moreover, as explained in Section 4.4, amplification properties of the transistor such as $g_{m}, r_{\pi}$, and $r_{O}$ depend on the quiescent (bias) collector current. Thus, the surrounding circuitry must also set (define) the device bias currents properly.

### 5.1.3 DC and Small-Signal Analysis

The foregoing observations lead to a procedure for the analysis of amplifiers (and many other circuits). First, we compute the operating (quiescent) conditions (terminal voltages and currents) of each transistor in the absence of signals. Called the "dc analysis" or "bias

[^3]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7b9ff0648e0b061c60d8g-22.jpg?height=806&width=875&top_left_y=556&top_left_x=1823)

Figure 5.8 Bias and signal levels for a bipolar transistor.
analysis," this step determines both the region of operation (active or saturation) and the small-signal parameters of each device. Second, we perform "small-signal analysis," i.e., study the response of the circuit to small signals and compute quantities such as the voltage gain and I/O impedances. As an example, Fig. 5.8 illustrates the bias and signal components of a voltage and a current.

It is important to bear in mind that small-signal analysis deals with only (small) changes in voltages and currents in a circuit around their quiescent values. Thus, as mentioned in Section 4.4.4, all constant sources, i.e., voltage and current sources that do not vary with time, must be set to zero for small-signal analysis. For example, the supply voltage is constant and, while establishing proper bias points, plays no role in the response to small signals. We therefore ground all constant voltage sources ${ }^{4}$ and open all constant current sources while constructing the small-signal equivalent circuit. From another point of view, the two steps described above follow the superposition principle: first, we determine the effect of constant voltages and currents while signal sources are set to zero, and second, we analyze the response to signal sources while constant sources are set to zero. Figure 5.9 summarizes these concepts.

DC Analysis

Figure 5.9 Steps in a general circuit analysis.

We should remark that the design of amplifiers follows a similar procedure. First, the circuitry around the transistor is designed to establish proper bias conditions and hence the necessary small-signal parameters. Second, the small-signal behavior of the circuit is studied to verify the required performance. Some iteration between the two steps may often be necessary so as to converge toward the desired behavior.

How do we differentiate between small-signal and large-signal operations? In other words, under what conditions can we represent the devices with their small-signal models?

[^4]If the signal perturbs the bias point of the device only negligibly, we say the circuit operates in the small-signal regime. In Fig. 5.8, for example, the change in $I_{C}$ due to the signal must remain small. This criterion is justified because the amplifying properties of the transistor such as $g_{m}$ and $r_{\pi}$ are considered constant in small-signal analysis even though they in fact vary as the signal perturbs $I_{C}$. That is, a linear representation of the transistor holds only if the small-signal parameters themselves vary negligibly. The definition of "negligibly" depends somewhat on the circuit and the application, but as a rule of thumb, we consider $10 \%$ variation in the collector current as the upper bound for small-signal operation.

In drawing circuit diagrams hereafter, we will employ some simplified notations and symbols. Illustrated in Fig. 5.10 is an example where the battery serving as the supply voltage is replaced with a horizontal bar labeled $V_{C C} .{ }^{5}$ Also, the input voltage source is simplified to one node called $V_{i n}$, with the understanding that the other node is ground.

Figure 5.10 Notation for supply voltage.
In this chapter, we begin with the DC analysis and design of bipolar stages, developing skills to determine or create bias conditions. This phase of our study requires no knowledge of signals and hence the input and output ports of the circuit. Next, we introduce various amplifier topologies and examine their small-signal behavior.

## 5.2 OPERATING POINT ANALYSIS AND DESIGN

It is instructive to begin our treatment of operating points with an example.

A student familiar with bipolar devices constructs the circuit shown in Fig. 5.11 and attempts to amplify the signal produced by a microphone. If $I_{S}=6 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{~A}$ and the peak value of the microphone signal is 20 mV , determine the peak value of the output signal.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7b9ff0648e0b061c60d8g-23.jpg?height=618&width=669&top_left_y=4172&top_left_x=2006)

Figure 5.11 Amplifier driven directly by a microphone.

[^5]Solution Unfortunately, the student has forgotten to bias the transistor. (The microphone does not produce a dc output.) If $V_{i n}\left(=V_{B E}\right)$ reaches 20 mV , then

$$
\begin{align*}
\Delta I_{C} & =I_{S} \exp \frac{\Delta V_{B E}}{V_{T}}  \tag{5.10}\\
& =1.29 \times 10^{-15} \mathrm{~A} \tag{5.11}
\end{align*}
$$

This change in the collector current yields a change in the output voltage equal to

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{C} \Delta I_{C}=1.29 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{~V} \tag{5.12}
\end{equation*}
$$

The circuit generates virtually no output because the bias current (in the absence of the microphone signal) is zero and so is the transconductance.

Exercise Repeat the above example if a constant voltage of 0.65 V is placed in series with the microphone.

As mentioned in Section 5.1.2, biasing seeks to fulfill two objectives: ensure operation in the forward active region, and set the collector current to the value required in the application. Let us return to the above example for a moment.

Example
5.6

Having realized the bias problem, the student in Example 5.5 modifies the circuit as shown in Fig. 5.12, connecting the base to $V_{C C}$ to allow dc biasing for the base-emitter junction. Explain why the student needs to learn more about biasing.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7b9ff0648e0b061c60d8g-24.jpg?height=600&width=766&top_left_y=3056&top_left_x=1877)

Figure 5.12 Amplifier with base tied to $V_{C C}$.
Solution The fundamental issue here is that the signal generated by the microphone is shorted to $V_{C C}$. Acting as an ideal voltage source, $V_{C C}$ maintains the base voltage at a constant value, prohibiting any change introduced by the microphone. Since $V_{B E}$ remains constant, so does $V_{\text {out }}$, leading to no amplification.

Another important issue relates to the value of $V_{B E}$ : with $V_{B E}=V_{C C}=2.5 \mathrm{~V}$, enormous currents flow into the transistor.

Exercise Does the circuit operate better if a resistor is placed in series with the emitter of $Q_{1}$ ?

### 5.2.1 Simple Biasing

Now consider the topology shown in Fig. 5.13, where the base is tied to $V_{C C}$ through a relatively large resistor, $R_{B}$, so as to forward-bias the base-emitter junction. Our objective is to determine the terminal voltages and currents of $Q_{1}$ and obtain the
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7b9ff0648e0b061c60d8g-25.jpg?height=601&width=532&top_left_y=533&top_left_x=2074)

Figure 5.13 Use of base resistance for base current path.
conditions that ensure biasing in the active mode. How do we analyze this circuit? One can replace $Q_{1}$ with its large-signal model and apply KVL and KCL, but the resulting nonlinear equation(s) yield little intuition. Instead, we recall that the baseemitter voltage in most cases falls in the range of 700 to 800 mV and can be considered relatively constant. Since the voltage drop across $R_{B}$ is equal to $R_{B} I_{B}$, we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{B} I_{B}+V_{B E}=V_{C C} \tag{5.13}
\end{equation*}
$$

and hence

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{B}=\frac{V_{C C}-V_{B E}}{R_{B}} \tag{5.14}
\end{equation*}
$$

With the base current known, we write

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{C}=\beta \frac{V_{C C}-V_{B E}}{R_{B}} \tag{5.15}
\end{equation*}
$$

note that the voltage drop across $R_{C}$ is equal to $R_{C} I_{C}$, and hence obtain $V_{C E}$ as

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{C E} & =V_{C C}-R_{C} I_{C}  \tag{5.16}\\
& =V_{C C}-\beta \frac{V_{C C}-V_{B E}}{R_{B}} R_{C} \tag{5.17}
\end{align*}
$$

Calculation of $V_{C E}$ is necessary as it reveals whether the device operates in the active mode or not. For example, to avoid saturation completely, we require the collector voltage to remain above the base voltage:

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{C C}-\beta \frac{V_{C C}-V_{B E}}{R_{B}} R_{C}>V_{B E} \tag{5.18}
\end{equation*}
$$

The circuit parameters can therefore be chosen so as to guarantee this condition.
In summary, using the sequence $I_{B} \rightarrow I_{C} \rightarrow V_{C E}$, we have computed the important terminal currents and voltages of $Q_{1}$. While not particularly interesting here, the emitter current is simply equal to $I_{C}+I_{B}$.

The reader may wonder about the error in the above calculations due to the assumption of a constant $V_{B E}$ in the range of 700 to 800 mV . An example clarifies this issue. sume $\beta=100$ and $I_{S}=10^{-17} \mathrm{~A}$. Verify that $Q_{1}$ operates in the forward active region.

Solution
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7b9ff0648e0b061c60d8g-26.jpg?height=640&width=988&top_left_y=793&top_left_x=1772)

Figure 5.14 Simple biased stage.

Since $I_{S}$ is relatively small, we surmise that the base-emitter voltage required to carry typical current level is relatively large. Thus, we use $V_{B E}=800 \mathrm{mV}$ as an initial guess and write Eq. (5.14) as

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{B} & =\frac{V_{C C}-V_{B E}}{R_{B}}  \tag{5.19}\\
& \approx 17 \mu \mathrm{~A} \tag{5.20}
\end{align*}
$$

It follows that

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{C}=1.7 \mathrm{~mA} \tag{5.21}
\end{equation*}
$$

With this result for $I_{C}$, we calculate a new value for $V_{B E}$ :

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{B E} & =V_{T} \ln \frac{I_{C}}{I_{S}}  \tag{5.22}\\
& =852 \mathrm{mV} \tag{5.23}
\end{align*}
$$

and iterate to obtain more accurate results. That is,

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{B} & =\frac{V_{C C}-V_{B E}}{R_{B}}  \tag{5.24}\\
& =16.5 \mu \mathrm{~A} \tag{5.25}
\end{align*}
$$

and hence

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{C}=1.65 \mathrm{~mA} \tag{5.26}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since the values given by (5.21) and (5.26) are quite close, we consider $I_{C}=$ 1.65 mA accurate enough and iterate no more.

Writing (5.16), we have

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{C E} & =V_{C C}-R_{C} I_{C}  \tag{5.27}\\
& =0.85 \mathrm{~V} \tag{5.28}
\end{align*}
$$

a value nearly equal to $V_{B E}$. The transistor therefore operates near the edge of active and saturation modes.

Exercise What value of $R_{B}$ provides a reverse bias of 200 mV across the base-collector junction?

The biasing scheme of Fig. 5.13 merits a few remarks. First, the effect of $V_{B E}$ "uncertainty" becomes more pronounced at low values of $V_{C C}$ because $V_{C C}-V_{B E}$ determines the base current. Thus, in low-voltage design-an increasingly common paradigm in modern electronic systems-the bias is more sensitive to $V_{B E}$ variations among transistors or with temperature. Second, we recognize from Eq. (5.15) that $I_{C}$ heavily depends on $\beta$, a parameter that may change considerably. In the above example, if $\beta$ increases from 100 to 120 , then $I_{C}$ rises to 1.98 mA and $V_{C E}$ falls to 0.52 , driving the transistor toward heavy saturation. For these reasons, the topology of Fig. 5.13 is rarely used in practice.

### 5.2.2 Resistive Divider Biasing

In order to suppress the dependence of $I_{C}$ upon $\beta$, we return to the fundamental rela-

Did you know?

Even in the first transistor radio introduced by Regency and Texas Instruments, it was recognized that the simple biasing technique would be a poor choice for production. The four transistors in this radio would need to maintain a relatively constant bias despite manufacturing variations and extreme temperatures in different places around the globe. For this reason, each stage incorporated "emitter degeneration" to stabilize the bias point.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7b9ff0648e0b061c60d8g-27.jpg?height=709&width=1416&top_left_y=1752&top_left_x=2460)

Simplified front end of Regency's TR1 radio. tionship $I_{C}=I_{S} \exp \left(V_{B E} / V_{T}\right)$ and postulate that $I_{C}$ must be set by applying a well-defined $V_{B E}$. Figure 5.15 depicts an example, where $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ act as a voltage divider, providing a base-emitter voltage equal to

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{X}=\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} V_{C C} \tag{5.29}
\end{equation*}
$$

if the base current is negligible. Thus,

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{C}=I_{S} \exp \left(\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} \cdot \frac{V_{C C}}{V_{T}}\right) \tag{5.30}
\end{equation*}
$$

a quantity independent of $\beta$. Nonetheless, the design must ensure that the base current remains negligible.

Solution Neglecting the base current of $Q_{1}$, we have

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{X} & =\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} V_{C C}  \tag{5.31}\\
& =800 \mathrm{mV} . \tag{5.32}
\end{align*}
$$

It follows that

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{C} & =I_{S} \exp \frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}  \tag{5.33}\\
& =231 \mu \mathrm{~A} \tag{5.34}
\end{align*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{B}=2.31 \mu \mathrm{~A} \tag{5.35}
\end{equation*}
$$

Is the base current negligible? With which quantity should this value be compared? Provided by the resistive divider, $I_{B}$ must be negligible with respect to the current flowing through $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{B} \stackrel{?}{\ll} \frac{V_{C C}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} . \tag{5.36}
\end{equation*}
$$

This condition indeed holds in this example because $V_{C C} /\left(R_{1}+R_{2}\right)=$ $100 \mu \mathrm{~A} \approx 43 I_{B}$.

We also note that

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{C E}=1.345 \mathrm{~V} \tag{5.37}
\end{equation*}
$$

and hence $Q_{1}$ operates in the active region.
Exercise What is the maximum value of $R_{C}$ if $Q_{1}$ must remain in soft saturation?

The analysis approach taken in the above example assumes a negligible base current, requiring verification at the end. But what if the end result indicates that $I_{B}$ is not negligible? We now analyze the circuit without this assumption. Let us replace the voltage divider with a Thevenin equivalent (Fig. 5.17), noting that $V_{T h e v}$ is equal to the open-circuit output voltage ( $V_{X}$ when the amplifier is disconnected):

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text {Thev }}=\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} V_{C C} \tag{5.38}
\end{equation*}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7b9ff0648e0b061c60d8g-29.jpg?height=1116&width=1975&top_left_y=441&top_left_x=1364)

Figure 5.17 Use of Thevenin equivalent to calculate bias.

Moreover, $R_{\text {Thev }}$ is given by the output resistance of the network if $V_{C C}$ is set to zero:

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{\text {Thev }}=R_{1} \| R_{2} \tag{5.39}
\end{equation*}
$$

The simplified circuit yields:

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{X}=V_{\text {Thev }}-I_{B} R_{\text {Thev }} \tag{5.40}
\end{equation*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{C}=I_{S} \exp \frac{V_{\text {Thev }}-I_{B} R_{\text {Thev }}}{V_{T}} . \tag{5.41}
\end{equation*}
$$

This result along with $I_{C}=\beta I_{B}$ forms the system of equations leading to the values of $I_{C}$ and $I_{B}$. As in the previous examples, iterations prove useful here, but the exponential dependence in Eq. (5.41) gives rise to wide fluctuations in the intermediate solutions. For this reason, we rewrite Eq. (5.41) as

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{B}=\left(V_{\text {Thev }}-V_{T} \ln \frac{I_{C}}{I_{S}}\right) \cdot \frac{1}{R_{\text {Thev }}}, \tag{5.42}
\end{equation*}
$$

and begin with a guess for $V_{B E}=V_{T} \ln \left(I_{C} / I_{S}\right)$. The iteration then follows the sequence $V_{B E} \rightarrow I_{B} \rightarrow I_{C} \rightarrow V_{B E} \rightarrow \cdots$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7b9ff0648e0b061c60d8g-29.jpg?height=241&width=3146&top_left_y=3630&top_left_x=573)

Solution Constructing the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 5.18(b), we note that

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{\text {Thev }} & =\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} V_{C C}  \tag{5.43}\\
& =800 \mathrm{mV} \tag{5.44}
\end{align*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{align*}
R_{\text {Thev }} & =R_{1} \| R_{2}  \tag{5.45}\\
& =54.4 \mathrm{k} \Omega . \tag{5.46}
\end{align*}
$$

We begin the iteration with an initial guess $V_{B E}=750 \mathrm{mV}$ (because we know that the voltage drop across $R_{\text {Thev }}$ makes $V_{B E}$ less than $V_{\text {Thev }}$ ), thereby arriving at the base current:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7b9ff0648e0b061c60d8g-30.jpg?height=1136&width=1942&top_left_y=996&top_left_x=1301)

Figure 5.18 (a) Stage with resistive divider bias, (b) stage with Thevenin equivalent for the resistive divider and $V_{C C}$.

Thus, $I_{C}=\beta I_{B}=91.9 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ and

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{B E} & =V_{T} \ln \frac{I_{C}}{I_{S}}  \tag{5.49}\\
& =776 \mathrm{mV} \tag{5.50}
\end{align*}
$$

It follows that $I_{B}=0.441 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ and hence $I_{C}=44.1 \mu \mathrm{~A}$, still a large fluctuation with respect to the first value from above. Continuing the iteration, we obtain $V_{B E}=757 \mathrm{mV}, I_{B}=0.79 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ and $I_{C}=79.0 \mu \mathrm{~A}$. After many iterations, $V_{B E} \approx$ 766 mV and $I_{C}=63 \mu \mathrm{~A}$.

Exercise How much can $R_{2}$ be increased if $Q_{1}$ must remain in soft saturation?

While proper choice of $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ in the topology of Fig. 5.15 makes the bias relatively insensitive to $\beta$, the exponential dependence of $I_{C}$ upon the voltage generated by the resistive divider still leads to substantial bias variations. For example, if $R_{2}$ is $1 \%$ higher than its nominal value, so is $V_{X}$, thus multiplying the collector current by $\exp \left(0.01 V_{B E} / V_{T}\right) \approx 1.36$ (for $V_{B E}=800 \mathrm{mV}$ ). In other words, a $1 \%$ error in one resistor value introduces a $36 \%$ error in the collector current. The circuit is therefore still of little practical value.

### 5.2.3 Biasing with Emitter Degeneration

A biasing configuration that alleviates the problem of sensitivity to $\beta$ and $V_{B E}$ is shown in Fig. 5.19. Here, resistor $R_{E}$ appears in series with the emitter, thereby lowering the sensitivity to $V_{B E}$. From an intuitive viewpoint, this occurs because $R_{E}$ exhibits a linear (rather than exponential) I-V relationship. Thus, an error in $V_{X}$ due to inaccuracies in $R_{1}$, $R_{2}$, or $V_{C C}$ is partly "absorbed" by $R_{E}$, introducing a smaller error in $V_{B E}$ and hence $I_{C}$. Called "emitter degeneration," the addition of $R_{E}$ in series with the emitter alters many attributes of the circuit, as described later in this chapter.

To understand the above property, let us determine the bias currents of the transistor. Neglecting the base current, we have $V_{X}=V_{C C} R_{2} /\left(R_{1}+R_{2}\right)$. Also, $V_{P}=V_{X}-V_{B E}$,
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7b9ff0648e0b061c60d8g-31.jpg?height=823&width=515&top_left_y=525&top_left_x=2094)

Figure 5.19 Addition of degeneration resistor to stabilize bias point.
yielding

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{E} & =\frac{V_{P}}{R_{E}}  \tag{5.51}\\
& =\frac{1}{R_{E}}\left(V_{C C} \frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}-V_{B E}\right)  \tag{5.52}\\
& \approx I_{C}, \tag{5.53}
\end{align*}
$$

if $\beta \gg 1$. How can this result be made less sensitive to $V_{X}$ or $V_{B E}$ variations? If the voltage drop across $R_{E}$, i.e., the difference between $V_{C C} R_{2} /\left(R_{1}+R_{2}\right)$ and $V_{B E}$, is large enough to absorb and swamp such variations, then $I_{E}$ and $I_{C}$ remain relatively constant. An example illustrates this point.

Calculate the bias currents in the circuit of Fig. 5.20 and verify that $Q_{1}$ operates in the forward active region. Assume $\beta=100$ and $I_{S}=5 \times 10^{-17} \mathrm{~A}$. How much does the collector current change if $R_{2}$ is $1 \%$ higher than its nominal value?
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7b9ff0648e0b061c60d8g-31.jpg?height=789&width=966&top_left_y=3099&top_left_x=1869)

Figure 5.20 Example of biased stage.
Solution We neglect the base current and write

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{X} & =V_{C C} \frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}  \tag{5.54}\\
& =900 \mathrm{mV} \tag{5.55}
\end{align*}
$$

Using $V_{B E}=800 \mathrm{mV}$ as an initial guess, we have

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{P} & =V_{X}-V_{B E}  \tag{5.56}\\
& =100 \mathrm{mV} \tag{5.57}
\end{align*}
$$

and hence

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{E} \approx I_{C} \approx 1 \mathrm{~mA} \tag{5.58}
\end{equation*}
$$

With this result, we must reexamine the assumption of $V_{B E}=800 \mathrm{mV}$. Since

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{B E} & =V_{T} \ln \frac{I_{C}}{I_{S}}  \tag{5.59}\\
& =796 \mathrm{mV} \tag{5.60}
\end{align*}
$$

we conclude that the initial guess is reasonable. Furthermore, Eq. (5.57) suggests that a 4-mV error in $V_{B E}$ leads to a $4 \%$ error in $V_{P}$ and hence $I_{E}$, indicating a good approximation.

Let us now determine if $Q_{1}$ operates in the active mode. The collector voltage is given by

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{Y} & =V_{C C}-I_{C} R_{C}  \tag{5.61}\\
& =1.5 \mathrm{~V} . \tag{5.62}
\end{align*}
$$

With the base voltage at 0.9 V , the device is indeed in the active region.
Is the assumption of negligible base current valid? With $I_{C} \approx 1 \mathrm{~mA}, I_{B} \approx$ $10 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ whereas the current flowing through $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ is equal to $100 \mu \mathrm{~A}$. The assumption is therefore reasonable. For greater accuracy, an iterative procedure similar to that in Example 5.9 can be followed.

If $R_{2}$ is $1.6 \%$ higher than its nominal value, then Eq. (5.54) indicates that $V_{X}$ rises to approximately 909 mV . We may assume that the $9-\mathrm{mV}$ change directly appears across $R_{E}$, raising the emitter current by $9 \mathrm{mV} / 100 \Omega=90 \mu \mathrm{~A}$. From Eq. (5.56), we note that this assumption is equivalent to considering $V_{B E}$ constant, which is reasonable because the emitter and collector currents have changed by only $9 \%$.

Exercise What value of $R_{2}$ places $Q_{1}$ at the edge of saturation?

The bias topology of Fig. 5.19 is used extensively in discrete circuits and occasionally in integrated circuits. Illustrated in Fig. 5.21, two rules are typically followed: (1) $I_{1} \gg I_{B}$ to lower sensitivity to $\beta$, and (2) $V_{R E}$ must be large enough ( 100 mV to several hundred millivolts) to suppress the effect of uncertainties in $V_{X}$ and $V_{B E}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7b9ff0648e0b061c60d8g-32.jpg?height=823&width=1593&top_left_y=4149&top_left_x=1464)

Figure 5.21 Summary of robust bias conditions.

Design Procedure It is possible to prescribe a design procedure for the bias topology of Fig. 5.21 that serves most applications: (1) decide on a collector bias current that yields proper small-signal parameters such as $g_{m}$ and $r_{\pi}$; (2) based on the expected variations of $R_{1}, R_{2}$, and $V_{B E}$, choose a value for $V_{R E} \approx I_{C} R_{E}$, e.g., 200 mV ; (3) calculate $V_{X}=V_{B E}+I_{C} R_{E}$ with $V_{B E}=V_{T} \ln \left(I_{C} / I_{S}\right)$; (4) choose $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ so as to provide the necessary value of $V_{X}$ and establish $I_{1} \gg I_{B}$. Determined by small-signal gain requirements, the value of $R_{C}$ is bounded by a maximum that places $Q_{1}$ at the edge of saturation. The following example illustrates these concepts.

Design the circuit of Fig. 5.21 so as to provide a transconductance of $1 /(52 \Omega)$ for $Q_{1}$. Assume $V_{C C}=2.5 \mathrm{~V}, \beta=100$, and $I_{S}=5 \times 10^{-17} \mathrm{~A}$. What is the maximum tolerable value of $R_{C}$ ?

Solution A $g_{m}$ of $(52 \Omega)^{-1}$ translates to a collector current of 0.5 mA and a $V_{B E}$ of 778 mV . Assuming $R_{E} I_{C}=200 \mathrm{mV}$, we obtain $R_{E}=400 \Omega$. To establish $V_{X}=$ $V_{B E}+R_{E} I_{C}=978 \mathrm{mV}$, we must have

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} V_{C C}=V_{B E}+R_{E} I_{C} \tag{5.63}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the base current is neglected. For the base current $I_{B}=5 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ to be negligible,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{V_{C C}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} \gg I_{B} \tag{5.64}
\end{equation*}
$$

e.g., by a factor of 10 . Thus, $R_{1}+R_{2}=50 \mathrm{k} \Omega$, which in conjunction with Eq. (5.63) yields

$$
\begin{align*}
& R_{1}=30.45 \mathrm{k} \Omega  \tag{5.65}\\
& R_{2}=19.55 \mathrm{k} \Omega \tag{5.66}
\end{align*}
$$

How large can $R_{C}$ be? Since the collector voltage is equal to $V_{C C}-R_{C} I_{C}$, we pose the following constraint to ensure active mode operation:

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{C C}-R_{C} I_{C}>V_{X} \tag{5.67}
\end{equation*}
$$

that is,

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{C} I_{C}<1.522 \mathrm{~V} \tag{5.68}
\end{equation*}
$$

Consequently,

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{C}<3.044 \mathrm{k} \Omega \tag{5.69}
\end{equation*}
$$

If $R_{C}$ exceeds this value, the collector voltage falls below the base voltage. As mentioned in Chapter 4, the transistor can tolerate soft saturation, i.e., up to about 400 mV of base-collector forward bias. Thus, in low-voltage applications, we may allow $V_{Y} \approx V_{X}-400 \mathrm{mV}$ and hence a greater value for $R_{C}$.

Exercise Repeat the above example if the power budget is only 1 mW and the transconductance of $Q_{1}$ is not given.

The two rules depicted in Fig. 5.21 to lower sensitivities do impose some trade-offs. Specifically, an overly conservative design faces the following issues: (1) if we wish $I_{1}$ to be much much greater than $I_{B}$, then $R_{1}+R_{2}$ and hence $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ are quite small, leading to a low input impedance; (2) if we choose a very large $V_{R E}$, then $V_{X}\left(=V_{B E}+V_{R E}\right)$ must be high, thereby limiting the minimum value of the collector voltage to avoid saturation. Let us return to the above example and study these issues.

Example $\quad$ Repeat Example 5.11 but assuming $V_{R E}=500 \mathrm{mV}$ and $I_{1} \geq 100 I_{B}$.
Solution The collector current and base-emitter voltage remain unchanged. The value of $R_{E}$ is now given by $500 \mathrm{mV} / 0.5 \mathrm{~mA}=1 \mathrm{k} \Omega$. Also, $V_{X}=V_{B E}+R_{E} I_{C}=1.278 \mathrm{~V}$ and Eq. (5.63) still holds. We rewrite Eq. (5.64) as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{V_{C C}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} \geq 100 I_{B}, \tag{5.70}
\end{equation*}
$$

obtaining $R_{1}+R_{2}=5 \mathrm{k} \Omega$. It follows that

$$
\begin{align*}
& R_{1}=1.45 \mathrm{k} \Omega  \tag{5.71}\\
& R_{2}=3.55 \mathrm{k} \Omega . \tag{5.72}
\end{align*}
$$

Since the base voltage has risen to 1.278 V , the collector voltage must exceed this value to avoid saturation, leading to

$$
\begin{align*}
R_{C} & <\frac{V_{C C}-V_{X}}{I_{C}}  \tag{5.73}\\
& <1.044 \mathrm{k} \Omega . \tag{5.74}
\end{align*}
$$

As seen in Section 5.3.1, the reduction in $R_{C}$ translates to a lower voltage gain. Also, the much smaller values of $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ here than in Example 5.11 introduce a low input impedance, loading the preceding stage. We compute the exact input impedance of this circuit in Section 5.3.1.

Exercise Repeat the above example if $V_{R E}$ is limited to 100 mV .

### 5.2.4 Self-Biased Stage

Another biasing scheme commonly used in discrete and integrated circuits is shown in Fig. 5.22. Called "self-biased" because the base current and voltage are provided from the collector, this stage exhibits many interesting and useful attributes.

Let us begin the analysis of the circuit with the observation that the base voltage is always lower than the collector voltage: $V_{X}=V_{Y}-I_{B} R_{B}$. A result of self-biasing, this important property guarantees that $Q_{1}$ operates in the active mode regardless of device and circuit parameters. For example, if $R_{C}$ increases indefinitely, $Q_{1}$ remains in the active region, a critical advantage over the circuit of Fig. 5.21.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7b9ff0648e0b061c60d8g-35.jpg?height=625&width=614&top_left_y=698&top_left_x=2033)

Figure 5.22 Self-biased stage.

We now determine the collector bias current by assuming $I_{B} \ll I_{C}$; i.e., $R_{C}$ carries a current equal to $I_{C}$, thereby yielding

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{Y}=V_{C C}-R_{C} I_{C} . \tag{5.75}
\end{equation*}
$$

Also,

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{Y} & =R_{B} I_{B}+V_{B E}  \tag{5.76}\\
& =\frac{R_{B} I_{C}}{\beta}+V_{B E} \tag{5.77}
\end{align*}
$$

Equating the right-hand sides of Eqs. (5.75) and (5.77) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{C}=\frac{V_{C C}-V_{B E}}{R_{C}+\frac{R_{B}}{\beta}} \tag{5.78}
\end{equation*}
$$

As usual, we begin with an initial guess for $V_{B E}$, compute $I_{C}$, and utilize $V_{B E}=$ $V_{T} \ln \left(I_{C} / I_{S}\right)$ to improve the accuracy of our calculations.

Example Determine the collector current and voltage of $Q_{1}$ in Fig. 5.22 if $R_{C}=1 \mathrm{k} \Omega, R_{B}=10 \mathrm{k} \Omega$,
5.13 $V_{C C}=2.5 \mathrm{~V}, I_{S}=5 \times 10^{-17} \mathrm{~A}$, and $\beta=100$. Repeat the calculations for $R_{C}=2 \mathrm{k} \Omega$.

Solution Assuming $V_{B E}=0.8 \mathrm{~V}$, we have from Eq. (5.78):

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{C}=1.545 \mathrm{~mA} \tag{5.79}
\end{equation*}
$$

and hence $V_{B E}=V_{T} \ln \left(I_{C} / I_{S}\right)=807.6 \mathrm{mV}$, concluding that the initial guess for $V_{B E}$ and the value of $I_{C}$ given by it are reasonably accurate. We also note that $R_{B} I_{B}=154.5 \mathrm{mV}$ and $V_{Y}=R_{B} I_{B}+V_{B E} \approx 0.955 \mathrm{~V}$.

If $R_{C}=2 \mathrm{k} \Omega$, then with $V_{B E}=0.8 \mathrm{~V}$, Eq. (5.78) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{C}=0.810 \mathrm{~mA} \tag{5.80}
\end{equation*}
$$

To check the validity of the initial guess, we write $V_{B E}=V_{T} \ln \left(I_{C} / I_{S}\right)=791 \mathrm{mV}$. Compared with $V_{C C}-V_{B E}$ in the numerator of Eq. (5.78), the $9-\mathrm{mV}$ error is negligible and the value of $I_{C}$ in Eq. (5.80) is acceptable. Since $R_{B} I_{B}=81 \mathrm{mV}, V_{Y} \approx 0.881 \mathrm{~V}$.

Exercise What happens if the base resistance is doubled?

Equation (5.78) and the preceding example suggest two important guidelines for the design of the self-biased stage: (1) $V_{C C}-V_{B E}$ must be much greater than the uncertainties
in the value of $V_{B E}$; (2) $R_{C}$ must be much greater than $R_{B} / \beta$ to lower sensitivity to $\beta$. In fact, if $R_{C} \gg R_{B} / \beta$, then

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{C} \approx \frac{V_{C C}-V_{B E}}{R_{C}} \tag{5.81}
\end{equation*}
$$

and $V_{Y}=V_{C C}-I_{C} R_{C} \approx V_{B E}$. This result serves as a quick estimate of the transistor bias conditions.

Design Procedure Equation (5.78) together with the condition $R_{C} \gg R_{B} / \beta$ provides the basic expressions for the design of the circuit. With the required value of $I_{C}$ known from small-signal considerations, we choose $R_{C}=10 R_{B} / \beta$ and rewrite Eq. (5.78) as

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{C}=\frac{V_{C C}-V_{B E}}{1.1 R_{C}} \tag{5.82}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $V_{B E}=V_{T} \ln \left(I_{C} / I_{S}\right)$. That is,

$$
\begin{align*}
R_{C} & =\frac{V_{C C}-V_{B E}}{1.1 I_{C}}  \tag{5.83}\\
R_{B} & =\frac{\beta R_{C}}{10} \tag{5.84}
\end{align*}
$$

The choice of $R_{B}$ also depends on small-signal requirements and may deviate from this value, but it must remain substantially lower than $\beta R_{C}$.
$\begin{array}{ll}\text { Example } & \text { Design the self-biased stage of Fig. } 5.22 \text { for } g_{m}=1 /(13 \Omega) \text { and } V_{C C}=1.8 \mathrm{~V} \text {. Assume } \\ \text { 5.14 } & I_{S}=5 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{~A} \text { and } \beta=100 \text {. }\end{array}$ $I_{S}=5 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{~A}$ and $\beta=100$.

Solution Since $g_{m}=I_{C} / V_{T}=1 /(13 \Omega)$, we have $I_{C}=2 \mathrm{~mA}, V_{B E}=754 \mathrm{mV}$, and

$$
\begin{align*}
R_{C} & \approx \frac{V_{C C}-V_{B E}}{1.1 I_{C}}  \tag{5.85}\\
& \approx 475 \Omega \tag{5.86}
\end{align*}
$$

Also,

$$
\begin{align*}
R_{B} & =\frac{\beta R_{C}}{10}  \tag{5.87}\\
& =4.75 \mathrm{k} \Omega \tag{5.88}
\end{align*}
$$

Note that $R_{B} I_{B}=95 \mathrm{mV}$, yielding a collector voltage of $754 \mathrm{mV}+95 \mathrm{mV}=$ 849 mV .

Exercise Repeat the above design with a supply voltage of 2.5 V .

### 5.2.5 Biasing of PNP Transistors

The dc bias topologies studied thus far incorporate $n p n$ transistors. Circuits using pnp devices follow the same analysis and design procedures while requiring attention to voltage and current polarities. We illustrate these points with the aid of some examples.

Did you know?

The self-biased stage incorporates "negative feedback" to stabilize the bias. For example, if the collector voltage tends to increase due to a temperature change, then resistor $R_{B}$ passes this voltage increase to the base, raising the $V_{B E}$ and hence the collector current. The collector voltage thus falls back to nearly its original value.

The use of negative feedback also improves the speed of the circuit. In fact, optical communication links used in the backbone of the Internet often employ this type of amplifier topology 50 as to accommodate data rates as high as $40 \mathrm{~Gb} / \mathrm{s}$. Next time you send an email, bear in mind that your data may go through a self-biased stage.

Figure 5.24 Simple biasing of pnp stage.
Solution The topology is the same as that in Fig. 5.13 and we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{B} R_{B}+V_{E B}=V_{C C} \tag{5.89}
\end{equation*}
$$

That is,

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{B}=\frac{V_{C C}-V_{E B}}{R_{B}} \tag{5.90}
\end{equation*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{C}=\beta \frac{V_{C C}-V_{E B}}{R_{B}} \tag{5.91}
\end{equation*}
$$

The circuit suffers from sensitivity to $\beta$.
If $R_{C}$ is increased, $V_{Y}$ rises, thus approaching $V_{X}\left(=V_{C C}-V_{E B}\right)$ and bringing $Q_{1}$ closer to saturation. The transistor enters saturation at $V_{Y}=V_{X}$, i.e.,

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{C} R_{C, \max }=V_{C C}-V_{E B} \tag{5.92}
\end{equation*}
$$

and hence

$$
\begin{align*}
R_{C, \max } & =\frac{V_{C C}-V_{E B}}{I_{C}}  \tag{5.93}\\
& =\frac{R_{B}}{\beta} . \tag{5.94}
\end{align*}
$$

From another perspective, since $V_{X}=I_{B} R_{B}$ and $V_{Y}=I_{C} R_{C}$, we have $I_{B} R_{B}=$ $I_{C} R_{C, \max }$ as the condition for edge of saturation, obtaining $R_{B}=\beta R_{C, \max }$.

Exercise For a given $R_{C}$, what value of $R_{B}$ places the device at the edge of saturation?

Figure 5.25 (a) $P N P$ stage with resistive divider biasing, (b) Thevenin equivalent of divider and $V_{C C}$.

Solution As a general case, we assume $I_{B}$ is significant and construct the Thevenin equivalent of the voltage divider as depicted in Fig. 5.25(b):

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{\text {Thev }} & =\frac{R_{1}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} V_{C C}  \tag{5.95}\\
R_{\text {Thev }} & =R_{1} \| R_{2} \tag{5.96}
\end{align*}
$$

Adding the voltage drop across $R_{\text {Thev }}$ and $V_{E B}$ to $V_{\text {Thev }}$ yields

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text {Thev }}+I_{B} R_{\text {Thev }}+V_{E B}=V_{C C} \tag{5.97}
\end{equation*}
$$

that is,

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{B} & =\frac{V_{C C}-V_{T h e v}-V_{E B}}{R_{T h e v}}  \tag{5.98}\\
& =\frac{\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} V_{C C}-V_{E B}}{R_{\text {Thev }}} \tag{5.99}
\end{align*}
$$

It follows that

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{C}=\beta \frac{\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} V_{C C}-V_{E B}}{R_{T h e v}} \tag{5.100}
\end{equation*}
$$

As in Example 5.9, some iteration between $I_{C}$ and $V_{E B}$ may be necessary.
Equation (5.100) indicates that if $I_{B}$ is significant, then the transistor bias heavily depends on $\beta$. On the other hand, if $I_{B} \ll I_{1}$, we equate the voltage drop across $R_{2}$ to $V_{E B}$, thereby obtaining the collector current:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} V_{C C} & =V_{E B}  \tag{5.101}\\
I_{C} & =I_{S} \exp \left(\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} \frac{V_{C C}}{V_{T}}\right) \tag{5.102}
\end{align*}
$$

Note that this result is identical to Eq. (5.30).
Exercise What is the maximum value of $R_{C}$ if $Q_{1}$ must remain in soft saturation?

Example

Figure 5.26 $P N P$ stage with degeneration resistor.

Solution
With $I_{B} \ll I_{1}$, we have $V_{X}=V_{C C} R_{1} /\left(R_{1}+R_{2}\right)$. Adding to $V_{X}$ the emitter-base voltage and the drop across $R_{E}$, we obtain

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{X}+V_{E B}+R_{E} I_{E}=V_{C C} \tag{5.103}
\end{equation*}
$$

and hence

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{E}=\frac{1}{R_{E}}\left(\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} V_{C C}-V_{E B}\right) \tag{5.104}
\end{equation*}
$$

Using $I_{C} \approx I_{E}$, we can compute a new value for $V_{E B}$ and iterate if necessary. Also, with $I_{B}=I_{C} / \beta$, we can verify the assumption $I_{B} \ll I_{1}$.

In arriving at Eq. (5.104), we have written a KVL from $V_{C C}$ to ground, Eq. (5.103). But a more straightforward approach is to recognize that the voltage drop across $R_{2}$ is equal to $V_{E B}+I_{E} R_{E}$, i.e.,

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{C C} \frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}=V_{E B}+I_{E} R_{E} \tag{5.105}
\end{equation*}
$$

which yields the same result as in Eq. (5.104).
The maximum allowable value of $R_{C}$ is obtained by equating the base and collector voltages:

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{C C} \frac{R_{1}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} & =R_{C, \max } I_{C}  \tag{5.106}\\
& \approx \frac{R_{C, \max }}{R_{E}}\left(\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} V_{C C}-V_{E B}\right) \tag{5.107}
\end{align*}
$$

It follows that

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{C, \max }=R_{E} V_{C C} \frac{R_{1}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} V_{C C}-V_{E B}} \tag{5.108}
\end{equation*}
$$

Exercise $\quad$ Repeat the above example if $R_{2}=\infty$.

Figure 5.27 Self-biased $p n p$ stage.

Solution We must write a KVL from $V_{C C}$ through the emitter-base junction of $Q_{1}, R_{B}$, and $R_{C}$ to ground. Since $\beta \gg 1$ and hence $I_{C} \gg I_{B}, R_{C}$ carries a current approximately equal to $I_{C}$, creating $V_{Y}=R_{C} I_{C}$. Moreover, $V_{X}=R_{B} I_{B}+V_{Y}=R_{B} I_{B}+R_{C} I_{C}$, yielding

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{C C} & =V_{E B}+V_{X}  \tag{5.109}\\
& =V_{E B}+R_{B} I_{B}+I_{C} R_{C}  \tag{5.110}\\
& =V_{E B}+\left(\frac{R_{B}}{\beta}+R_{C}\right) I_{C} \tag{5.111}
\end{align*}
$$

Thus,

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{C}=\frac{V_{C C}-V_{E B}}{\frac{R_{B}}{\beta}+R_{C}} \tag{5.112}
\end{equation*}
$$

a result similar to Eq. (5.78). As usual, we begin with a guess for $V_{E B}$, compute $I_{C}$, and determine a new value for $V_{E B}$, etc. Note that, since the base is higher than the collector voltage, $Q_{1}$ always remains in the active mode.

Exercise How far is $Q_{1}$ from saturation?

## 5.3 BIPOLAR AMPLIFIER TOPOLOGIES

Following our detailed study of biasing, we can now delve into different amplifier topologies and examine their small-signal properties. ${ }^{6}$

Since the bipolar transistor contains three terminals, we may surmise that three possibilities exist for applying the input signal to the device, as conceptually illustrated in Figs. 5.28(a)-(c). Similarly, the output signal can be sensed from any of the terminals (with respect to ground) [Figs. 5.28(d)-(f)], leading to nine possible combinations of input and output networks and hence nine amplifier topologies.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7b9ff0648e0b061c60d8g-41.jpg?height=1223&width=1867&top_left_y=2705&top_left_x=1464)

Figure 5.28 Possible input and output connections to a bipolar transistor.

However, as seen in Chapter 4, bipolar transistors operating in the active mode respond to base-emitter voltage variations by varying their collector current. This property rules out the input connection shown in Fig. 5.28(c) because here $V_{i n}$ does not affect the base or emitter voltages. Also, the topology in Fig. 5.28(f) proves of no value as $V_{\text {out }}$ is not a function of the collector current. The number of possibilities therefore falls to four. But we note that the input and output connections in

[^6]Figs. 5.28(b) and (e) remain incompatible because $V_{\text {out }}$ would be sensed at the input node (the emitter) and the circuit would provide no function.

The foregoing observations reveal three possible amplifier topologies. We study each carefully, seeking to compute its gain and input and output impedances. In all cases, the bipolar transistors operate in the active mode. The reader is encouraged to review Examples (5.2)-(5.4) and the three resulting rules illustrated in Fig. 5.7 before proceeding further.

### 5.3.1 Common-Emitter Topology

Our initial thoughts in Section 4.1 pointed to the circuit of Fig. 4.1(b) and hence the topology of Fig. 4.25 as an amplifier. If the input signal is applied to the base [Fig. 5.28(a)] and the output signal is sensed at the collector [Fig. 5.28(d)], the circuit is called a "commonemitter" (CE) stage (Fig. 5.29). We have encountered and analyzed this circuit in different contexts without giving it a name. The term "common-emitter" is used because the emitter terminal is grounded and hence appears in common to the input and output ports. Nevertheless, we identify the stage based on the input and output connections (to the base and from the collector, respectively) so as to avoid confusion in more complex topologies.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7b9ff0648e0b061c60d8g-42.jpg?height=777&width=949&top_left_y=2614&top_left_x=1786)

Figure 5.29 Common-emitter stage.

We deal with the CE amplifier in two phases: (a) analysis of the CE core to understand its fundamental properties, and (b) analysis of the CE stage including the bias circuitry as a more realistic case.

Analysis of CE Core Recall from the definition of transconductance in Section 4.4.3 that a small increment of $\Delta V$ applied to the base of $Q_{1}$ in Fig. 5.29 increases the collector current by $g_{m} \Delta V$ and hence the voltage drop across $R_{C}$ by $g_{m} \Delta V R_{C}$. In order to examine the amplifying properties of the CE stage, we construct the small-signal equivalent of the circuit, shown in Fig. 5.30. As explained in Chapter 4, the supply voltage node, $V_{C C}$, acts
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7b9ff0648e0b061c60d8g-42.jpg?height=458&width=1223&top_left_y=4691&top_left_x=1649)

Figure 5.30 Small-signal model of CE stage.
as an ac ground because its value remains constant with time. We neglect the Early effect for now.

Let us first compute the small-signal voltage gain $A_{v}=v_{o u t} / v_{i n}$. Beginning from the output port and writing a KCL at the collector node, we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
-\frac{v_{\text {out }}}{R_{C}}=g_{m} v_{\pi} \tag{5.113}
\end{equation*}
$$

and $v_{\pi}=v_{i n}$. It follows that

$$
\begin{equation*}
A_{v}=-g_{m} R_{C} \tag{5.114}
\end{equation*}
$$

Equation (5.114) embodies two interesting and important properties of the CE stage. First, the small-signal gain is negative because raising the base voltage and hence the collector current in Fig. 5.29 lowers $V_{\text {out }}$. Second, $A_{v}$ is proportional to $g_{m}$ (i.e., the collector bias current) and the collector resistor, $R_{C}$.

Interestingly, the voltage gain of the stage is limited by the supply voltage. A higher collector bias current or a larger $R_{C}$ demands a greater voltage drop across $R_{C}$, but this drop cannot exceed $V_{C C}$. In fact, denoting the dc drop across $R_{C}$ with $V_{R C}$ and writing $g_{m}=I_{C} / V_{T}$, we express Eq. (5.113) as

$$
\begin{align*}
\left|A_{v}\right| & =\frac{I_{C} R_{C}}{V_{T}}  \tag{5.115}\\
& =\frac{V_{R C}}{V_{T}} \tag{5.116}
\end{align*}
$$

Since $V_{R C}<V_{C C}$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|A_{v}\right|<\frac{V_{C C}}{V_{T}} \tag{5.117}
\end{equation*}
$$

Furthermore, the transistor itself requires a minimum collector-emitter voltage of about $V_{B E}$ to remain in the active region, lowering the limit to

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|A_{v}\right|<\frac{V_{C C}-V_{B E}}{V_{T}} \tag{5.118}
\end{equation*}
$$

Design a CE core with $V_{C C}=1.8 \mathrm{~V}$ and a power budget, $P$, of 1 mW while achieving maximum voltage gain.

Solution $\quad$ Since $P=I_{C} \cdot V_{C C}=1 \mathrm{~mW}$, we have $I_{C}=0.556 \mathrm{~mA}$. The value of $R_{C}$ that places $Q_{1}$ at the edge of saturation is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{C C}-R_{C} I_{C}=V_{B E}, \tag{5.119}
\end{equation*}
$$

which, along with $V_{B E} \approx 800 \mathrm{mV}$, yields

$$
\begin{align*}
R_{C} & \leq \frac{V_{C C}-V_{B E}}{I_{C}}  \tag{5.120}\\
& \leq 1.8 \mathrm{k} \Omega . \tag{5.121}
\end{align*}
$$

The voltage gain is therefore equal to

$$
\begin{align*}
A_{v} & =-g_{m} R_{C}  \tag{5.122}\\
& =-38.5 \tag{5.123}
\end{align*}
$$

Under this condition, an input signal drives the transistor into saturation. As illustrated in Fig. 5.31(a), a $2-\mathrm{mV}_{\mathrm{pp}}$ input results in a $77-\mathrm{mV}_{\mathrm{pp}}$ output, forward-biasing the basecollector junction for half of each cycle. Nevertheless, so long as $Q_{1}$ remains in soft saturation $\left(V_{B C}>400 \mathrm{mV}\right)$, the circuit amplifies properly.

A more aggressive design may allow $Q_{1}$ to operate in soft saturation, e.g., $V_{C E} \approx 400 \mathrm{mV}$ and hence

$$
\begin{align*}
R_{C} & \leq \frac{V_{C C}-400 \mathrm{mV}}{I_{C}}  \tag{5.124}\\
& \leq 2.52 \mathrm{k} \Omega \tag{5.125}
\end{align*}
$$

In this case, the maximum voltage gain is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
A_{v}=-53.9 \tag{5.126}
\end{equation*}
$$

Of course, the circuit can now tolerate only very small voltage swings at the output. For example, a 2-mV $\mathrm{mp}_{\mathrm{pp}}$ input signal gives rise to a $107.8-\mathrm{mV}_{\mathrm{pp}}$ output, driving $Q_{1}$ into heavy saturation [Fig. 5.31(b)]. We say the circuit suffers from a trade-off between voltage gain and voltage "headroom."
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7b9ff0648e0b061c60d8g-44.jpg?height=1594&width=1810&top_left_y=2913&top_left_x=1367)

Figure 5.32 (a) Input and (b) output impedance calculation of CE stage.

Let us now calculate the I/O impedances of the CE stage. Using the equivalent circuit depicted in Fig. 5.32(a), we write

$$
\begin{align*}
R_{i n} & =\frac{v_{X}}{i_{X}}  \tag{5.127}\\
& =r_{\pi} \tag{5.128}
\end{align*}
$$

Thus, the input impedance is simply equal to $\beta / g_{m}=\beta V_{T} / I_{C}$ and decreases as the collector bias increases.

The output impedance is obtained from Fig. 5.32(b), where the input voltage source is set to zero (replaced with a short). Since $v_{\pi}=0$, the dependent current source also vanishes, leaving $R_{C}$ as the only component seen by $v_{X}$. In other words,

$$
\begin{align*}
R_{\text {out }} & =\frac{v_{X}}{i_{X}}  \tag{5.129}\\
& =R_{C} \tag{5.130}
\end{align*}
$$

The output impedance therefore trades with the voltage gain, $-g_{m} R_{C}$.
Figure 5.33 summarizes the trade-offs in the performance of the CE topology along with the parameters that create such trade-offs. For example, for a given value of output impedance, $R_{C}$ is fixed and the voltage gain can be increased by increasing $I_{C}$, thereby lowering both the voltage headroom and the input impedance.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7b9ff0648e0b061c60d8g-45.jpg?height=1097&width=1154&top_left_y=3647&top_left_x=1769)

|  | Interestingly, if the I/O impedances are specified, then the voltage gain is automatically set. We will develop other circuits in this book that avoid this "coupling" of design specifications. |

Exercise What happens to this result if the supply voltage is halved?

Inclusion of Early Effect Equation (5.114) suggests that the voltage gain of the CE stage can be increased indefinitely if $R_{C} \rightarrow \infty$ while $g_{m}$ remains constant. Mentioned in Section 4.4.5, this trend appears valid if $V_{C C}$ is also raised to ensure the transistor remains in the active mode. From an intuitive point of view, a given change in the input voltage and hence the collector current gives rise to an increasingly larger output swing as $R_{C}$ increases.

In reality, however, the Early effect limits the voltage gain even if $R_{C}$ approaches infinity. Since achieving a high gain proves critical in circuits such as operational amplifiers, we must reexamine the above derivations in the presence of the Early effect.

Figure 5.34 depicts the small-signal equivalent circuit of the CE stage including the transistor output resistance. Note that $r_{O}$ appears in parallel with $R_{C}$, allowing us to rewrite Eq. (5.114) as

$$
\begin{equation*}
A_{v}=-g_{m}\left(R_{C} \| r_{O}\right) \tag{5.133}
\end{equation*}
$$

We also recognize that the input impedance remains equal to $r_{\pi}$ whereas the output impedance falls to

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{\text {out }}=R_{C} \| r_{O} \tag{5.134}
\end{equation*}
$$

Example The circuit of Fig. 5.29 is biased with a collector current of 1 mA and $R_{C}=1 \mathrm{k} \Omega$. If 5.21 $\beta=100$ and $V_{A}=10 \mathrm{~V}$, determine the small-signal voltage gain and the I/O impedances.

Solution We have

$$
\begin{align*}
g_{m} & =\frac{I_{C}}{V_{T}}  \tag{5.135}\\
& =(26 \Omega)^{-1} \tag{5.136}
\end{align*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{align*}
r_{O} & =\frac{V_{A}}{I_{C}}  \tag{5.137}\\
& =10 \mathrm{k} \Omega \tag{5.138}
\end{align*}
$$

Thus,

$$
\begin{align*}
A_{v} & =-g_{m}\left(R_{C} \| r_{O}\right)  \tag{5.139}\\
& \approx 35 \tag{5.140}
\end{align*}
$$

(As a comparison, if $V_{A}=\infty$, then $A_{v} \approx 38$.) For the I/O impedances, we write

$$
\begin{align*}
R_{i n} & =r_{\pi}  \tag{5.141}\\
& =\frac{\beta}{g_{m}}  \tag{5.142}\\
& =2.6 \mathrm{k} \Omega \tag{5.143}
\end{align*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{align*}
R_{\text {out }} & =R_{C} \| r_{O}  \tag{5.144}\\
& =0.91 \mathrm{k} \Omega \tag{5.145}
\end{align*}
$$

Exercise Calculate the gain if $V_{A}=5 \mathrm{~V}$.

Let us determine the gain of a CE stage as $R_{C} \rightarrow \infty$. Equation (5.132) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
A_{v}=-g_{m} r_{O} \tag{5.146}
\end{equation*}
$$

Called the "intrinsic gain" of the transistor to emphasize that no external device loads the circuit, $g_{m} r_{O}$ represents the maximum voltage gain provided by a single transistor, playing a fundamental role in high-gain amplifiers.

We now substitute $g_{m}=I_{C} / V_{T}$ and $r_{O}=V_{A} / I_{C}$ in Eq. (5.133), thereby arriving at

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|A_{v}\right|=\frac{V_{A}}{V_{T}} \tag{5.147}
\end{equation*}
$$

Interestingly, the intrinsic gain of a bipolar transistor is independent of the bias current. In modern integrated bipolar transistors, $V_{A}$ falls in the vicinity of 5 V , yielding
a gain of nearly $200 .{ }^{7}$ In this book, we assume $g_{m} r_{O} \gg 1$ (and hence $r_{O} \gg 1 / g_{m}$ ) for all transistors.

Another parameter of the CE stage that may prove relevant in some applications is the "current gain," defined as

$$
\begin{equation*}
A_{I}=\frac{i_{\text {out }}}{i_{\text {in }}} \tag{5.148}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $i_{\text {out }}$ denotes the current delivered to the load and $i_{\text {in }}$ the current flowing to the input. We rarely deal with this parameter for voltage amplifiers, but note that $A_{I}=\beta$ for the stage shown in Fig. 5.29 because the entire collector current is delivered to $R_{C}$.

Did you know?

The Early effect was discovered by James Early, who worked under Shockley at Bell Laboratories in the 1950s. Early was also involved in the development of transistors and solar cells for satellites. Early was the first to recognize that the speed of a bipolar transistor can be improved if the base region is made much thinner than the collector region.

CE Stage With Emitter Degeneration In many applications, the CE core of Fig. 5.29 is modified as shown in Fig. 5.35(a), where a resistor $R_{E}$ appears in series with the emitter. Called "emitter degeneration," this technique improves the "linearity" of the circuit and provides many other interesting properties that are studied in more advanced courses.

Figure 5.35 (a) CE stage with degeneration, (b) effect of input voltage change.
As with the CE core, we intend to determine the voltage gain and I/O impedances of the circuit, assuming $Q_{1}$ is biased properly. Before delving into a detailed analysis, it is instructive to make some qualitative observations. Suppose the input signal raises the base voltage by $\Delta V$ [Fig. 5.35(b)]. If $R_{E}$ were zero, then the base-emitter voltage would also increase by $\Delta V$, producing a collector current change of $g_{m} \Delta V$. But with $R_{E} \neq 0$, some fraction of $\Delta V$ appears across $R_{E}$, thus leaving a voltage change across the BE junction that is less than $\Delta V$. Consequently, the collector current change is also less than $g_{m} \Delta V$. We therefore expect that the voltage gain of the degenerated stage is lower than that of the CE core with no degeneration. While undesirable, the reduction in gain is incurred to improve other aspects of the performance.

How about the input impedance? Since the collector current change is less than $g_{m} \Delta V$, the base current also changes by less than $g_{m} \Delta V / \beta$, yielding an input impedance greater than $\beta / g_{m}=r_{\pi}$. Thus, emitter degeneration increases the input impedance of the CE stage, a desirable property. A common mistake is to conclude that $R_{i n}=r_{\pi}+R_{E}$, but as explained below, $R_{i n}=r_{\pi}+(\beta+1) R_{E}$.

Figure 5.36 Small-signal model of CE stage with emitter degeneration.
We now quantify the foregoing observations by analyzing the small-signal behavior of the circuit. Depicted in Fig. 5.36 is the small-signal equivalent circuit, where $V_{C C}$ is replaced with an ac ground and the Early effect is neglected. Note that $v_{\pi}$ appears across $r_{\pi}$ and not from the base to ground. To determine $v_{\text {out }} / v_{\text {in }}$, we first write a KCL at the output node,

$$
\begin{equation*}
g_{m} v_{\pi}=-\frac{v_{\text {out }}}{R_{C}} \tag{5.149}
\end{equation*}
$$

obtaining

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{\pi}=-\frac{v_{\text {out }}}{g_{m} R_{C}} \tag{5.150}
\end{equation*}
$$

We also recognize that two currents flow through $R_{E}$ : one originating from $r_{\pi}$ equal to $v_{\pi} / r_{\pi}$ and another equal to $g_{m} v_{\pi}$. Thus, the voltage drop across $R_{E}$ is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{R E}=\left(\frac{v_{\pi}}{r_{\pi}}+g_{m} v_{\pi}\right) R_{E} \tag{5.151}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since the voltage drop across $r_{\pi}$ and $R_{E}$ must add up to $v_{i n}$, we have

$$
\begin{align*}
v_{i n} & =v_{\pi}+v_{R E}  \tag{5.152}\\
& =v_{\pi}+\left(\frac{v_{\pi}}{r_{\pi}}+g_{m} v_{\pi}\right) R_{E}  \tag{5.153}\\
& =v_{\pi}\left[1+\left(\frac{1}{r_{\pi}}+g_{m}\right) R_{E}\right] . \tag{5.154}
\end{align*}
$$

Substituting for $v_{\pi}$ from Eq. (5.150) and rearranging the terms, we arrive at

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{\text {out }}}{v_{\text {in }}}=-\frac{g_{m} R_{C}}{1+\left(\frac{1}{r_{\pi}}+g_{m}\right) R_{E}} \tag{5.155}
\end{equation*}
$$

As predicted earlier, the magnitude of the voltage gain is lower than $g_{m} R_{C}$ for $R_{E} \neq 0$. With $\beta \gg 1$, we can assume $g_{m} \gg 1 / r_{\pi}$ and hence

$$
\begin{equation*}
A_{v}=-\frac{g_{m} R_{C}}{1+g_{m} R_{E}} \tag{5.156}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus, the gain falls by a factor of $1+g_{m} R_{E}$.
To arrive at an interesting interpretation of Eq. (5.156), we divide the numerator and denominator by $g_{m}$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
A_{v}=-\frac{R_{C}}{\frac{1}{g_{m}}+R_{E}} \tag{5.157}
\end{equation*}
$$

It is helpful to memorize this result as "the gain of the degenerated CE stage is equal to the total load resistance seen at the collector (to ground) divided by $1 / g_{m}$ plus the total resistance placed in series with the emitter." (In verbal descriptions, we often ignore the negative sign in the gain, with the understanding that it must be included.) This and similar interpretations throughout this book greatly simplify the analysis of amplifiers-often obviating the need for drawing small-signal circuits.

Example Determine the voltage gain of the stage shown in Fig. 5.37(a).

Figure 5.37 (a) CE stage example, (b) simplified circuit.
Solution We identify the circuit as a CE stage because the input is applied to the base of $Q_{1}$ and the output is sensed at its collector. This transistor is degenerated by two devices: $R_{E}$ and the base-emitter junction of $Q_{2}$. The latter exhibits an impedance of $r_{\pi 2}$ (as illustrated in Fig. 5.7), leading to the simplified model depicted in Fig. 5.37(b). The total resistance placed in series with the emitter is therefore equal to $R_{E} \| r_{\pi 2}$, yielding

$$
\begin{equation*}
A_{v}=-\frac{R_{C}}{\frac{1}{g_{m 1}}+R_{E} \| r_{\pi 2}} \tag{5.158}
\end{equation*}
$$

Without the above observations, we would need to draw the small-signal model of both $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ and solve a system of several equations.

Exercise Repeat the above example if a resistor is placed in series with the emitter of $Q_{2}$.

Example Calculate the voltage gain of the circuit in Fig. 5.38(a).

Solution The topology is a CE stage degenerated by $R_{E}$, but the load resistance between the collector of $Q_{1}$ and ac ground consists of $R_{C}$ and the base-emitter junction of $Q_{2}$. Modeling the latter by $r_{\pi 2}$, we reduce the circuit to that shown in Fig. 5.38(b), where the total load resistance seen at the collector of $Q_{1}$ is equal to $R_{C} \| r_{\pi 2}$. The
voltage gain is thus given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
A_{v}=-\frac{R_{C} \| r_{\pi 2}}{\frac{1}{g_{m 1}}+R_{E}} \tag{5.159}
\end{equation*}

Figure 5.38 (a) CE stage example, (b) simplified circuit.

Exercise Repeat the above example if a resistor is placed in series with the emitter of $Q_{2}$.

To compute the input impedance of the degenerated CE stage, we redraw the smallsignal model as in Fig. 5.39(a) and calculate $v_{X} / i_{X}$. Since $v_{\pi}=r_{\pi} i_{X}$, the current flowing through $R_{E}$ is equal to $i_{X}+g_{m} r_{\pi} i_{X}=(1+\beta) i_{X}$, creating a voltage drop of $R_{E}(1+\beta) i_{X}$. Summing $v_{\pi}$ and $v_{R E}$ and equating the result to $v_{X}$, we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{X}=r_{\pi} i_{X}+R_{E}(1+\beta) i_{X} \tag{5.160}
\end{equation*}
$$

and hence

$$
\begin{align*}
R_{i n} & =\frac{v_{X}}{i_{X}}  \tag{5.161}\\
& =r_{\pi}+(\beta+1) R_{E} \tag{5.162}
\end{align*}
$$

As predicted by our qualitative reasoning, emitter degeneration increases the input impedance [Fig. 5.39(b)].

Why is $R_{i n}$ not simply equal to $r_{\pi}+R_{E}$ ? This would hold only if $r_{\pi}$ and $R_{E}$ were exactly in series, i.e., if the two carried equal currents, but in the circuit of Fig. 5.39(a), the collector current, $g_{m} v_{\pi}$, also flows into node $P$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7b9ff0648e0b061c60d8g-51.jpg?height=726&width=2364&top_left_y=4038&top_left_x=1130)

Figure 5.40 Output impedance of degenerated stage.

Does the factor $\beta+1$ bear any intuitive meaning? We observe that the flow of both base and collector currents through $R_{E}$ results in a large voltage drop, $(\beta+1) i_{X} R_{E}$, even though the current drawn from $v_{X}$ is merely $i_{X}$. In other words, the test voltage source, $v_{X}$, supplies a current of only $i_{X}$ while producing a voltage drop of $(\beta+1) i_{X} R_{E}$ across $R_{E}$-as if $i_{X}$ flows through a resistor equal to $(\beta+1) R_{E}$.

The above observation is articulated as follows: any impedance tied between the emitter and ground is multiplied by $\beta+1$ when "seen from the base." The expression "seen from the base" means the impedance measured between the base and ground.

We also calculate the output impedance of the stage with the aid of the equivalent shown in Fig. 5.40, where the input voltage is set to zero. Equation (5.153) applies to this circuit as well:

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{i n}=0=v_{\pi}+\left(\frac{v_{\pi}}{r_{\pi}}+g_{m} v_{\pi}\right) R_{E} \tag{5.163}
\end{equation*}
$$

yielding $v_{\pi}=0$ and hence $g_{m} v_{\pi}=0$. Thus, all of $i_{X}$ flows through $R_{C}$, and

$$
\begin{align*}
R_{\text {out }} & =\frac{v_{X}}{i_{X}}  \tag{5.164}\\
& =R_{C} \tag{5.165}
\end{align*}
$$

revealing that emitter degeneration does not alter the output impedance if the Early effect is neglected.

Example A CE stage is biased at a collector current of 1 mA . If the circuit provides a voltage gain

5.24 of 20 with no emitter degeneration and 10 with degeneration, determine $R_{C}, R_{E}$, and the I/O impedances. Assume $\beta=100$.

Solution For $A_{v}=20$ in the absence of degeneration, we require

$$
\begin{equation*}
g_{m} R_{C}=20 \tag{5.166}
\end{equation*}
$$

which, together with $g_{m}=I_{C} / V_{T}=(26 \Omega)^{-1}$, yields

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{C}=520 \Omega \tag{5.167}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since degeneration lowers the gain by a factor of two,

$$
\begin{equation*}
1+g_{m} R_{E}=2 \tag{5.168}
\end{equation*}
$$

i.e.,

$$
\begin{align*}
R_{E} & =\frac{1}{g_{m}}  \tag{5.169}\\
& =26 \Omega \tag{5.170}
\end{align*}
$$

The input impedance is given by

$$
\begin{align*}
R_{i n} & =r_{\pi}+(\beta+1) R_{E}  \tag{5.171}\\
& =\frac{\beta}{g_{m}}+(\beta+1) R_{E}  \tag{5.172}\\
& \approx 2 r_{\pi} \tag{5.173}
\end{align*}
$$

because $\beta \gg 1$ and $R_{E}=1 / g_{m}$ in this example. Thus, $R_{i n}=5200 \Omega$. Finally,

$$
\begin{align*}
R_{\text {out }} & =R_{C}  \tag{5.174}\\
& =520 \Omega \tag{5.175}
\end{align*}
$$

Exercise What bias current would result in a gain of 5 with such emitter and collector resistor values?

Example Compute the voltage gain and I/O impedances of the circuit depicted in Fig. 5.41. Assume 5.25 a very large value for $C_{1}$.

Figure 5.41 CE stage example.
Solution If $C_{1}$ is very large, it acts as a short circuit for the signal frequencies of interest. Also, the constant current source is replaced with an open circuit in the small-signal equivalent circuit. Thus, the stage reduces to that in Fig. 5.35(a) and Eqs. (5.157), (5.162), (5.165) apply.

Exercise Repeat the above example if we tie another capacitor from the base to ground.

The degenerated CE stage can be analyzed from a different perspective to provide more insight. Let us place the transistor and the emitter resistor in a black box having still three terminals [Fig. 5.42(a)]. For small-signal operation, we can view the box as a
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7b9ff0648e0b061c60d8g-54.jpg?height=789&width=1874&top_left_y=667&top_left_x=1352)

Figure 5.42 (a) Degenerated bipolar transistor viewed as a black box, (b) small-signal equivalent.
new transistor (or "active" device) and model its behavior by new values of transconductance and impedances. Denoted by $G_{m}$ to avoid confusion with $g_{m}$ of $Q_{1}$, the equivalent transconductance is obtained from Fig. 5.42(b). Since Eq. (5.154) still holds, we have

$$
\begin{align*}
i_{\text {out }} & =g_{m} v_{\pi}  \tag{5.176}\\
& =g_{m} \frac{v_{\text {in }}}{1+\left(r_{\pi}^{-1}+g_{m}\right) R_{E}} \tag{5.177}
\end{align*}
$$

and hence

$$
\begin{align*}
G_{m} & =\frac{i_{\text {out }}}{v_{\text {in }}}  \tag{5.178}\\
& \approx \frac{g_{m}}{1+g_{m} R_{E}} \tag{5.179}
\end{align*}
$$

For example, the voltage gain of the stage with a load resistance of $R_{D}$ is given by $-G_{m} R_{D}$.
An interesting property of the degenerated CE stage is that its voltage gain becomes relatively independent of the transistor transconductance and hence bias current if $g_{m} R_{E} \gg 1$. From Eq. (5.157), we note that $A_{v} \rightarrow-R_{C} / R_{E}$ under this condition. As studied in Problem 5.40, this trend in fact represents the "linearizing" effect of emitter degeneration.

As a more general case, we now consider a degenerated CE stage containing a resistance in series with the base [Fig. 5.43(a)]. As seen below, $R_{B}$ only degrades the
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7b9ff0648e0b061c60d8g-54.jpg?height=840&width=1827&top_left_y=4124&top_left_x=1324)

Figure 5.43 (a) CE stage with base resistance, (b) equivalent circuit.
performance of the circuit, but often proves inevitable. For example, $R_{B}$ may represent the output resistance of a microphone connected to the input of the amplifier.

To analyze the small-signal behavior of this stage, we can adopt one of two approaches:
(a) draw the small-signal model of the entire circuit and solve the resulting equations, or
(b) recognize that the signal at node $A$ is simply an attenuated version of $v_{i n}$ and write

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{\text {out }}}{v_{\text {in }}}=\frac{v_{A}}{v_{\text {in }}} \cdot \frac{v_{\text {out }}}{v_{A}} . \tag{5.180}
\end{equation*}
$$

Here, $v_{A} / v_{\text {in }}$ denotes the effect of voltage division between $R_{B}$ and the impedance seen at the base of $Q_{1}$, and $v_{\text {out }} / v_{A}$ represents the voltage gain from the base of $Q_{1}$ to the output, as already obtained in Eqs. (5.155) and (5.157). We leave the former approach for Problem 5.44 and continue with the latter here.

Let us first compute $v_{A} / v_{\text {in }}$ with the aid of Eq. (5.162) and the model depicted in Fig. 5.39(b), as illustrated in Fig. 5.43(b). The resulting voltage divider yields

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{A}}{v_{i n}}=\frac{r_{\pi}+(\beta+1) R_{E}}{r_{\pi}+(\beta+1) R_{E}+R_{B}} \tag{5.181}
\end{equation*}
$$

Combining Eqs. (5.155) and (5.157), we arrive at the overall gain as

$$
\begin{align*}
& \frac{v_{\text {out }}}{v_{\text {in }}}=\frac{r_{\pi}+(\beta+1) R_{E}}{r_{\pi}+(\beta+1) R_{E}+R_{B}} \cdot \frac{-g_{m} R_{C}}{1+\left(\frac{1}{r_{\pi}}+g_{m}\right) R_{E}}  \tag{5.182}\\
& =\frac{r_{\pi}+(\beta+1) R_{E}}{r_{\pi}+(\beta+1) R_{E}+R_{B}} \cdot \frac{-g_{m} r_{\pi} R_{C}}{r_{\pi}+(1+\beta) R_{E}}  \tag{5.183}\\
& =\frac{-\beta R_{C}}{r_{\pi}+(\beta+1) R_{E}+R_{B}} . \tag{5.184}
\end{align*}
$$

To obtain a more intuitive expression, we divide the numerator and the denominator by $\beta$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
A_{v} \approx \frac{-R_{C}}{\frac{1}{g_{m}}+R_{E}+\frac{R_{B}}{\beta+1}} \tag{5.185}
\end{equation*}
$$

Compared to Eq. (5.157), this result contains only one additional term in the denominator equal to the base resistance divided by $\beta+1$.

The above results reveal that resistances in series with the emitter and the base have similar effects on the voltage gain, but $R_{B}$ is scaled down by $\beta+1$. The significance of this observation becomes clear later.

For the stage of Fig. 5.43(a), we can define two different input impedances, one seen at the base of $Q_{1}$ and another at the left terminal of $R_{B}$ (Fig. 5.44). The former is equal to

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{i n 1}=r_{\pi}+(\beta+1) R_{E} \tag{5.186}
\end{equation*}
$$

and the latter,

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{i n 2}=R_{B}+r_{\pi}+(\beta+1) R_{E} \tag{5.187}
\end{equation*}
$$

In practice, $R_{i n 1}$ proves more relevant and useful. We also note that the output impedance of the circuit remains equal to

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{\text {out }}=R_{C} \tag{5.188}
\end{equation*}
$$

even with $R_{B} \neq 0$. This is studied in Problem 5.45.

Example A microphone having an output resistance of $1 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ generates a peak signal level of $5.26 \quad 2 \mathrm{mV}$. Design a CE stage with a bias current of 1 mA that amplifies this signal to 40 mV . Assume $R_{E}=4 / g_{m}$ and $\beta=100$.

Solution The following quantities are obtained: $R_{B}=1 \mathrm{k} \Omega, g_{m}=(26 \Omega)^{-1},\left|A_{v}\right|=20$, and $R_{E}=104 \Omega$. From Eq. (5.185),

$$
\begin{align*}
R_{C} & =\left|A_{v}\right|\left(\frac{1}{g_{m}}+R_{E}+\frac{R_{B}}{\beta+1}\right)  \tag{5.189}\\
& \approx 2.8 \mathrm{k} \Omega \tag{5.190}

#### Effect of Transistor Output Resistance

The analysis of the degenerated CE stage has thus far neglected the Early effect. Somewhat beyond the scope of this book, the derivation of the circuit properties in the presence of this effect is outlined in Problem 5.48 for the interested reader. We nonetheless explore one aspect of the circuit, namely, the output resistance, as it provides the foundation for many other topologies studied later.

Our objective is to determine the output impedance seen looking into the collector of a degenerated transistor [Fig. 5.46(a)]. Recall from Fig. 5.7 that $R_{\text {out }}=r_{O}$ if $R_{E}=0$. Also, $R_{\text {out }}=\infty$ if $V_{A}=\infty$ (why?). To include the Early effect, we draw the smallsignal equivalent circuit as in Fig. 5.46(b), grounding the input terminal. A common mistake here is to write $R_{\text {out }}=r_{O}+R_{E}$. Since $g_{m} v_{\pi}$ flows from the output node into $P$, resistors $r_{O}$ and $R_{E}$ are not in series. We readily note that $R_{E}$ and $r_{\pi}$ appear in parallel, and the current flowing through $R_{E} \| r_{\pi}$ is equal to $i_{X}$. Thus,

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{\pi}=-i_{X}\left(R_{E} \| r_{\pi}\right) \tag{5.194}
\end{equation*}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7b9ff0648e0b061c60d8g-57.jpg?height=755&width=2197&top_left_y=4183&top_left_x=1225)

Figure 5.46 (a) Output impedance of degenerated stage, (b) equivalent circuit.
where the negative sign arises because the positive side of $v_{\pi}$ is at ground. We also recognize that $r_{O}$ carries a current of $i_{X}-g_{m} v_{\pi}$ and hence sustains a voltage of $\left(i_{X}-g_{m} v_{\pi}\right) r_{O}$. Adding this voltage to that across $R_{E}\left(=-v_{\pi}\right)$ and equating the result to $v_{X}$, we obtain

$$
\begin{align*}
v_{X} & =\left(i_{X}-g_{m} v_{\pi}\right) r_{O}-v_{\pi}  \tag{5.195}\\
& =\left[i_{X}+g_{m} i_{X}\left(R_{E} \| r_{\pi}\right)\right] r_{O}+i_{X}\left(R_{E} \| r_{\pi}\right) \tag{5.196}
\end{align*}
$$

It follows that

$$
\begin{align*}
R_{\text {out }} & =\left[1+g_{m}\left(R_{E} \| r_{\pi}\right)\right] r_{O}+R_{E} \| r_{\pi}  \tag{5.197}\\
& =r_{O}+\left(g_{m} r_{O}+1\right)\left(R_{E} \| r_{\pi}\right) \tag{5.198}
\end{align*}
$$

Recall from Eq. (5.146) that the intrinsic gain of the transistor, $g_{m} r_{O} \gg 1$, and hence

$$
\begin{align*}
R_{\text {out }} & \approx r_{O}+g_{m} r_{O}\left(R_{E} \| r_{\pi}\right)  \tag{5.199}\\
& \approx r_{O}\left[1+g_{m}\left(R_{E} \| r_{\pi}\right)\right] \tag{5.200}
\end{align*}
$$

Interestingly, emitter degeneration raises the output impedance from $r_{O}$ to the above value, i.e., by a factor of $1+g_{m}\left(R_{E} \| r_{\pi}\right)$.

The reader may wonder if the increase in the output resistance is desirable or undesirable. The "boosting" of output resistance as a result of degeneration proves extremely useful in circuit design, producing amplifiers with a higher gain as well as creating more ideal current sources. These concepts are studied in Chapter 9.

It is instructive to examine Eq. (5.200) for two special cases $R_{E} \gg r_{\pi}$ and $R_{E} \ll r_{\pi}$. For $R_{E} \gg r_{\pi}$, we have $R_{E} \| r_{\pi} \rightarrow r_{\pi}$ and

$$
\begin{align*}
R_{\text {out }} & \approx r_{O}\left(1+g_{m} r_{\pi}\right)  \tag{5.201}\\
& \approx \beta r_{O} \tag{5.202}
\end{align*}
$$

because $\beta \gg 1$. Thus, the maximum resistance seen at the collector of a bipolar transistor is equal to $\beta r_{O}$-if the degeneration impedance becomes much larger than $r_{\pi}$.

For $R_{E} \ll r_{\pi}$, we have $R_{E} \| r_{\pi} \rightarrow R_{E}$ and

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{\text {out }} \approx\left(1+g_{m} R_{E}\right) r_{O} \tag{5.203}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus, the output resistance is boosted by a factor of $1+g_{m} R_{E}$.
In the analysis of circuits, we sometimes draw the transistor output resistance explicitly to emphasize its significance (Fig. 5.47). This representation, of course, assumes $Q_{1}$ itself does not contain another $r_{O}$.

Example

We wish to design a current source having a value of 1 mA and an output resistance of
5.28
$20 \mathrm{k} \Omega$. The available bipolar transistor exhibits $\beta=100$ and $V_{A}=10 \mathrm{~V}$. Determine the minimum required value of emitter degeneration resistance.

Solution Since $r_{O}=V_{A} / I_{C}=10 \mathrm{k} \Omega$, degeneration must raise the output resistance by a factor of two. We postulate that the condition $R_{E} \ll r_{\pi}$ holds and write

$$
\begin{equation*}
1+g_{m} R_{E}=2 \tag{5.204}
\end{equation*}
$$

That is,

$$
\begin{align*}
R_{E} & =\frac{1}{g_{m}}  \tag{5.205}\\
& =26 \Omega . \tag{5.206}
\end{align*}
$$

Note that indeed $r_{\pi}=\beta / g_{m} \gg R_{E}$.

Solution Replacing $V_{b}$ and $C_{1}$ with an ac ground and $I_{1}$ with an open circuit, we arrive at the simplified model in Fig. 5.48(b). Since $R_{1}$ appears in parallel with the resistance seen looking into the collector of $Q_{1}$, we ignore $R_{1}$ for the moment, reducing the circuit to that in Fig. 5.48(c). In analogy with Fig. 5.40, we rewrite Eq. (5.200) as

Exercise What is the output resistance if a very large capacitor is tied between the emitter of $Q_{1}$ and ground?

The procedure of progressively simplifying a circuit until it resembles a known topology proves extremely critical in our work. Called "analysis by inspection," this method obviates the need for complex small-signal models and lengthy calculations. The reader is encouraged to attempt the above example using the small-signal model of the overall circuit to appreciate the efficiency and insight provided by our intuitive approach.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_7b9ff0648e0b061c60d8g-60.jpg?height=1080&width=2484&top_left_y=1207&top_left_x=482)

Figure 5.49 (a) CE stage example, (b) simplified circuit.
Solution Recall from Fig. 5.7 that the impedance seen at the collector is equal to $r_{O}$ if the base and emitter are (ac) grounded. Thus, $Q_{2}$ can be replaced with $r_{O 2}$ [Fig. 5.49(b)]. From another perspective, $Q_{2}$ is reduced to $r_{O 2}$ because its base-emitter voltage is fixed by $V_{b 1}$, yielding a zero $g_{m 2} v_{\pi 2}$.

Now, $r_{O 2}$ plays the role of emitter degeneration resistance for $Q_{1}$. In analogy with Fig. 5.40(a), we rewrite Eq. (5.200) as

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{\text {out }}=\left[1+g_{m 1}\left(r_{O 2} \| r_{\pi 1}\right)\right] r_{O 1} \tag{5.210}
\end{equation*}
$$

Called a "cascode" circuit, this topology is studied and utilized extensively in Chapter 9.

Exercise Repeat the above example for a "stack" of three transistors.

CE Stage with Biasing Having learned the small-signal properties of the commonemitter amplifier and its variants, we now study a more general case wherein the circuit contains a bias network as well. We begin with simple biasing schemes described in Section 5.2 and progressively add complexity (and more robust performance) to the circuit. Let us begin with an example.

A student familiar with the CE stage and basic biasing constructs the circuit shown in Fig. 5.50 to amplify the signal produced by a microphone. Unfortunately, $Q_{1}$ carries no current, failing to amplify. Explain the cause of this problem.

[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ About nine orders of magnitude less than one sustaining 750 mV : $(750 \mathrm{mV}-200 \mathrm{mV}) /$ $(60 \mathrm{mV} / \mathrm{dec}) \approx 9.2$.

[^1]:    ${ }^{1}$ Exceptions are described in Chapter 12

[^2]:    ${ }^{2}$ Recall that a zero voltage source is replaced by a short and a zero current source by an open.

[^3]:    ${ }^{3}$ While beyond the scope of this book, it can be shown that the impedance seen at the emitter is approximately equal to $1 / g_{m}$ only if the collector is tied to a relatively low impedance.

[^4]:    ${ }^{4}$ We say all constant voltage sources are replaced by an "ac ground."

[^5]:    ${ }^{5}$ The subscript $C C$ indicates supply voltage feeding the collector.

[^6]:    ${ }^{6}$ While beyond the scope of this book, the large-signal behavior of amplifiers also becomes important in many applications.

Figure 5.50 Microphone amplifier.
Solution Many microphones exhibit a small low-frequency resistance (e.g., $<100 \Omega$ ). If used in this circuit, such a microphone creates a low resistance from the base of $Q_{1}$ to ground, forming a voltage divider with $R_{B}$ and providing a very low base voltage. For example, a microphone resistance of $100 \Omega$ yields

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{X} & =\frac{100 \Omega}{100 \mathrm{k} \Omega+100 \Omega} \times 2.5 \mathrm{~V}  \tag{5.211}\\
& \approx 2.5 \mathrm{mV} \tag{5.212}
\end{align*}
$$

Thus, the microphone low-frequency resistance disrupts the bias of the amplifier.
Exercise Does the circuit operate better if $R_{B}$ is halved?

How should the circuit of Fig. 5.50 be fixed? Since only the signal generated by the microphone is of interest, a series capacitor can be inserted as depicted in Fig. 5.51 so as to isolate the dc biasing of the amplifier from the microphone. That is, the bias point of $Q_{1}$ remains independent of the resistance of the microphone because $C_{1}$ carries no bias current. The value of $C_{1}$ is chosen so that it provides a relatively low impedance (almost a short circuit) for the frequencies of interest. We say $C_{1}$ is a "coupling" capacitor and the input of this stage is "ac-coupled" or "capacitively coupled." Many circuits employ capacitors to isolate the bias conditions from "undesirable" effects. More examples clarify this point later.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d14406c858dcab7c2524g-01.jpg?height=560&width=1012&top_left_y=3858&top_left_x=1823)

Figure 5.51 Capacitive coupling at the input of microphone amplifier.

The foregoing observation suggests that the methodology illustrated in Fig. 5.9 must include an additional rule: replace all capacitors with an open circuit for dc analysis and a short circuit for small-signal analysis.

Let us begin with the stage depicted in Fig. 5.52(a). For bias calculations, the signal source is set to zero and $C_{1}$ is opened, leading to Fig. 5.52(b). From Section 5.2.1,
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d14406c858dcab7c2524g-02.jpg?height=1205&width=2775&top_left_y=813&top_left_x=844)

Figure 5.52 (a) Capacitive coupling at the input of a CE stage, (b) simplified stage for bias calculation, (c) simplified stage for small-signal calculation, (d) simplified circuit for input impedance calculation, (e) simplified circuit for output impedance calculation.
we have

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{C} & =\beta \frac{V_{C C}-V_{B E}}{R_{B}}  \tag{5.213}\\
V_{Y} & =V_{C C}-\beta R_{C} \frac{V_{C C}-V_{B E}}{R_{B}} \tag{5.214}
\end{align*}
$$

To avoid saturation, $V_{Y} \geq V_{B E}$.
With the bias current known, the small-signal parameters $g_{m}, r_{\pi}$, and $r_{O}$ can be calculated. We now turn our attention to small-signal analysis, considering the simplified circuit of Fig. 5.52(c). Here, $C_{1}$ is replaced with a short and $V_{C C}$ with ac ground, but $Q_{1}$ is maintained as a symbol. We attempt to solve the circuit by inspection: if unsuccessful, we will resort to using a small-signal model for $Q_{1}$ and writing KVLs and KCLs.

The circuit of Fig. 5.52(c) resembles the CE core illustrated in Fig. 5.29, except for $R_{B}$. Interestingly, $R_{B}$ has no effect on the voltage at node $X$ so long as $v_{i n}$ remains an ideal voltage source; i.e., $v_{X}=v_{i n}$ regardless of the value of $R_{B}$. Since the voltage gain from the base to the collector is given by $v_{\text {out }} / v_{X}=-g_{m} R_{C}$, we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{\text {out }}}{v_{\text {in }}}=-g_{m} R_{C} \tag{5.215}
\end{equation*}
$$

If $V_{A}<\infty$, then

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{\text {out }}}{v_{\text {in }}}=-g_{m}\left(R_{C} \| r_{O}\right) \tag{5.216}
\end{equation*}
$$

However, the input impedance is affected by $R_{B}$ [Fig. 5.52(d)]. Recall from Fig. 5.7 that the impedance seen looking into the base, $R_{i n 1}$, is equal to $r_{\pi}$ if the emitter is grounded. Here, $R_{B}$ simply appears in parallel with $R_{i n 1}$, yielding

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{i n 2}=r_{\pi} \| R_{B} . \tag{5.217}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus, the bias resistor lowers the input impedance. Nevertheless, as shown in Problem 5.51 , this effect is usually negligible.

To determine the output impedance, we set the input source to zero [Fig. 5.52(e)]. Comparing this circuit with that in Fig. 5.32(b), we recognize that $R_{\text {out }}$ remains unchanged:

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{\text {out }}=R_{C} \| r_{O} \tag{5.218}
\end{equation*}
$$

because both terminals of $R_{B}$ are shorted to ground.
In summary, the bias resistor, $R_{B}$, negligibly impacts the performance of the stage shown in Fig. 5.52(a).

Example
5.32

Having learned about ac coupling, the student in Example 5.31 modifies the design to that shown in Fig. 5.53 and attempts to drive a speaker. Unfortunately, the circuit still fails. Explain why.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d14406c858dcab7c2524g-03.jpg?height=578&width=1006&top_left_y=1823&top_left_x=1826)

Figure 5.53 Amplifier with direct connection of speaker.

Solution Typical speakers incorporate a solenoid (inductor) to actuate a membrane. The solenoid exhibits a very low dc resistance, e.g., less than $1 \Omega$. Thus, the speaker in Fig. 5.53 shorts the collector to ground, driving $Q_{1}$ into deep saturation.

Exercise Does the circuit operate better if the speaker is tied between the output node and $V_{C C}$ ?

The student applies ac coupling to the output as well [Fig. 5.54(a)] and measures the quiescent points to ensure proper biasing. The collector bias voltage is 1.5 V , indicating that $Q_{1}$ operates in the active region. However, the student still observes no gain in the circuit. (a) If $I_{S}=5 \times 10^{-17} \mathrm{~A}$ and $V_{A}=\infty$, compute the $\beta$ of the transistor. (b) Explain why the circuit provides no gain.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d14406c858dcab7c2524g-03.jpg?height=658&width=2793&top_left_y=3935&top_left_x=921)

Figure 5.54 (a) Amplifier with capacitive coupling at the input and output, (b) simplified small-signal model.

Solution (a) A collector voltage of 1.5 V translates to a voltage drop of 1 V across $R_{C}$ and hence a collector current of 1 mA . Thus,

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{B E} & =V_{T} \ln \frac{I_{C}}{I_{S}}  \tag{5.219}\\
& =796 \mathrm{mV} \tag{5.220}
\end{align*}
$$

It follows that

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{B} & =\frac{V_{C C}-V_{B E}}{R_{B}}  \tag{5.221}\\
& =17 \mu \mathrm{~A}, \tag{5.222}
\end{align*}
$$

and $\beta=I_{C} / I_{B}=58.8$.
(b) Speakers typically exhibit a low impedance in the audio frequency range, e.g., $8 \Omega$. Drawing the ac equivalent as in Fig. 5.54(b), we note that the total resistance seen at the collector node is equal to $1 \mathrm{k} \Omega \| 8 \Omega$, yielding a gain of

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|A_{v}\right|=g_{m}\left(R_{C} \| R_{S}\right)=0.31 \tag{5.223}
\end{equation*}
$$

Exercise Repeat the above example for $R_{C}=500 \Omega$.

The design in Fig. 5.54(a) exemplifies an improper interface between an amplifier and a load: the output impedance is so much higher than the load impedance that the connection of the load to the amplifier drops the gain drastically.

How can we remedy the problem of loading here? Since the voltage gain is proportional to $g_{m}$, we can bias $Q_{1}$ at a much higher current to raise the gain. This is studied in Problem 5.53. Alternatively, we can interpose a "buffer" stage between the CE amplifier and the speaker (Section 5.3.3).

Let us now consider the biasing scheme shown in Fig. 5.15 and repeated in Fig. 5.55(a). To determine the bias conditions, we set the signal source to zero and open the capacitor(s). Equations (5.38)-(5.41) can then be used. For small-signal analysis, the simplified circuit in Fig. 5.55(b) reveals a resemblance to that in Fig. 5.52(b), except that both $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d14406c858dcab7c2524g-04.jpg?height=709&width=2221&top_left_y=4058&top_left_x=1127)

Figure 5.56 (a) Degenerated stage with capacitive coupling, (b) simplified circuit.
appear in parallel with the input. Thus, the voltage gain is still equal to $-g_{m}\left(R_{C} \| r_{O}\right)$ and the input impedance is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{i n}=r_{\pi}\left\|R_{1}\right\| R_{2} \tag{5.224}
\end{equation*}
$$

The output resistance is equal to $R_{C} \| r_{O}$.
We next study the more robust biasing scheme of Fig. 5.19, repeated in Fig. 5.56(a) along with an input coupling capacitor. The bias point is determined by opening $C_{1}$ and following Eqs. (5.52) and (5.53). With the collector current known, the smallsignal parameters of $Q_{1}$ can be computed. We also construct the simplified ac circuit shown in Fig. 5.56(b), noting that the voltage gain is not affected by $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ and remains equal to

$$
\begin{equation*}
A_{v}=\frac{-R_{C}}{\frac{1}{g_{m}}+R_{E}} \tag{5.225}
\end{equation*}
$$

where Early effect is neglected. On the other hand, the input impedance is lowered to:

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{i n}=\left[r_{\pi}+(\beta+1) R_{E}\right]\left\|R_{1}\right\| R_{2}, \tag{5.226}
\end{equation*}
$$

whereas the output impedance remains equal to $R_{C}$ if $V_{A}=\infty$.
As explained in Section 5.2.3, the use of emitter degeneration can effectively stabilize the bias point despite variations in $\beta$ and $I_{S}$. However, as evident from Eq. (5.225), degeneration also lowers the gain. Is it possible to apply degeneration to biasing but not to the signal? Illustrated in Fig. 5.57 is such a topology, where $C_{2}$ is large enough to act as a short circuit for signal frequencies of interest. We can
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d14406c858dcab7c2524g-05.jpg?height=669&width=1040&top_left_y=4426&top_left_x=1820)

therefore write

$$
\begin{equation*}
A_{v}=-g_{m} R_{C} \tag{5.227}
\end{equation*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{align*}
R_{\text {in }} & =r_{\pi}\left\|R_{1}\right\| R_{2}  \tag{5.228}\\
R_{\text {out }} & =R_{C} . \tag{5.229}
\end{align*}
$$

Example Design the stage of Fig. 5.57 to satisfy the following conditions: $I_{C}=1 \mathrm{~mA}$, voltage drop 5.34 across $R_{E}=400 \mathrm{mV}$, voltage gain $=20$ in the audio frequency range ( 20 Hz to 20 kHz ), input impedance $>2 \mathrm{k} \Omega$. Assume $\beta=100, I_{S}=5 \times 10^{-16}$, and $V_{C C}=2.5 \mathrm{~V}$.

Solution With $I_{C}=1 \mathrm{~mA} \approx I_{E}$, the value of $R_{E}$ is equal to $400 \Omega$. For the voltage gain to remain unaffected by degeneration, the maximum impedance of $C_{1}$ must be much smaller than $1 / g_{m}=26 \Omega .{ }^{8}$ Occurring at 20 Hz , the maximum impedance must remain below roughly $0.1 \times\left(1 / g_{m}\right)=2.6 \Omega$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{C_{2} \omega} \leq \frac{1}{10} \cdot \frac{1}{g_{m}} \text { for } \omega=2 \pi \times 20 \mathrm{~Hz} \tag{5.230}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus,

$$
\begin{equation*}
C_{2} \geq 30,607 \mu \mathrm{~F} \tag{5.231}
\end{equation*}
$$

(This value is unrealistically large, requiring modification of the design.) We also have

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|A_{v}\right|=g_{m} R_{C}=20 \tag{5.232}
\end{equation*}
$$

obtaining

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{C}=520 \Omega \tag{5.233}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since the voltage across $R_{E}$ is equal to 400 mV and $V_{B E}=V_{T} \ln \left(I_{C} / I_{S}\right)=736 \mathrm{mV}$, we have $V_{X}=1.14 \mathrm{~V}$. Also, with a base current of $10 \mu \mathrm{~A}$, the current flowing through $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ must exceed $100 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ to lower sensitivity to $\beta$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{V_{C C}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}>10 I_{B} \tag{5.234}
\end{equation*}
$$

and hence

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{1}+R_{2}<25 \mathrm{k} \Omega \tag{5.235}
\end{equation*}
$$

Under this condition,

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{X} \approx \frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} V_{C C}=1.14 \mathrm{~V} \tag{5.236}
\end{equation*}
$$

yielding

$$
\begin{align*}
R_{2} & =11.4 \mathrm{k} \Omega  \tag{5.237}\\
R_{1} & =13.6 \mathrm{k} \Omega \tag{5.238}
\end{align*}
$$

[^0]We must now check to verify that this choice of $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ satisfies the condition $R_{i n}>2 \mathrm{k} \Omega$. That is,

$$
\begin{align*}
R_{i n} & =r_{\pi}\left\|R_{1}\right\| R_{2}  \tag{5.239}\\
& =1.83 \mathrm{k} \Omega . \tag{5.240}
\end{align*}
$$

Unfortunately, $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ lower the input impedance excessively. To remedy the problem, we can allow a smaller current through $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ than $10 I_{B}$, at the cost of creating more sensitivity to $\beta$. For example, if this current is set to $5 I_{B}=50 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ and we still neglect $I_{B}$ in the calculation of $V_{X}$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{V_{C C}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}>5 I_{B} \tag{5.241}
\end{equation*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{1}+R_{2}<50 \mathrm{k} \Omega \tag{5.242}
\end{equation*}
$$

Consequently,

$$
\begin{align*}
& R_{2}=22.8 \mathrm{k} \Omega  \tag{5.243}\\
& R_{1}=27.2 \mathrm{k} \Omega \tag{5.244}
\end{align*}
$$

giving

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{\text {in }}=2.15 \mathrm{k} \Omega \tag{5.245}
\end{equation*}
$$

Exercise Redesign the above stage for a gain of 10 and compare the results.

We conclude our study of the CE stage with a brief look at the more general case depicted in Fig. 5.58(a), where the input signal source exhibits a finite resistance and the output is tied to a load $R_{L}$. The biasing remains identical to that of Fig. 5.56(a), but $R_{S}$ and $R_{L}$ lower the voltage gain $v_{\text {out }} / v_{\text {in }}$. The simplified ac circuit of Fig. 5.58(b) reveals $V_{i n}$ is attenuated by the voltage division between $R_{S}$ and the impedance seen at node $X$, $R_{1}\left\|R_{2}\right\|\left[r_{\pi}+(\beta+1) R_{E}\right]$, i.e.,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{X}}{v_{i n}}=\frac{R_{1}\left\|R_{2}\right\|\left[r_{\pi}+(\beta+1) R_{E}\right]}{R_{1}\left\|R_{2}\right\|\left[r_{\pi}+(\beta+1) R_{E}\right]+R_{S}} \tag{5.246}
\end{equation*}
$$

The voltage gain from $v_{i n}$ to the output is given by

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{v_{\text {out }}}{v_{\text {in }}} & =\frac{v_{X}}{v_{\text {in }}} \cdot \frac{v_{\text {out }}}{v_{X}}  \tag{5.247}\\
& =-\frac{R_{1}\left\|R_{2}\right\|\left[r_{\pi}+(\beta+1) R_{E}\right]}{R_{1}\left\|R_{2}\right\|\left[r_{\pi}+(\beta+1) R_{E}\right]+R_{S}} \frac{R_{C} \| R_{L}}{\frac{1}{g_{m}}+R_{E}} \tag{5.248}
\end{align*}
$$

As expected, lower values of $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ reduce the gain.

Did you know?

What we have learned so far readily allows us to construct interesting circuits. One of the first gadgets that you can build are radio receivers and transmitters. Shown below is an FM transmitter operating in the vicinity of 100 MHz . A self-biased CE stage amplifies the microphone signal, applying the result to an oscillator. The audio signal "modulates" (varies) the frequency of the oscillator, creating an FM output.

Simple FM transmitter.

The above computation views the input network as a voltage divider. Alternatively, we can utilize a Thevenin equivalent to include the effect of $R_{S}, R_{1}$, and $R_{2}$ on the voltage gain. Illustrated in Fig. 5.58(c), the idea is to replace $v_{i n}, R_{S}$ and $R_{1} \| R_{2}$ with $v_{\text {Thev }}$ and $R_{\text {Thev }}$ :

$$
\begin{align*}
v_{\text {Thev }} & =\frac{R_{1} \| R_{2}}{R_{1} \| R_{2}+R_{S}} v_{\text {in }}  \tag{5.249}\\
R_{\text {Thev }} & =R_{S}\left\|R_{1}\right\| R_{2} \tag{5.250}
\end{align*}
$$

The resulting circuit resembles that in Fig. 5.43(a) and follows Eq. (5.185):

$$
\begin{equation*}
A_{v}=-\frac{R_{C} \| R_{L}}{\frac{1}{g_{m}}+R_{E}+\frac{R_{\text {Thev }}}{\beta+1}} \cdot \frac{R_{1} \| R_{2}}{R_{1} \| R_{2}+R_{S}} \tag{5.251}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the second fraction on the right accounts for the voltage attenuation given by Eq. (5.249). The reader is encouraged to prove that Eqs. (5.248) and (5.251) are identical.

The two approaches described above exemplify analysis techniques used to solve circuits and gain insight. Neither requires drawing the small-signal model of the transistor because the reduced circuits can be "mapped" into known topologies.

Figure 5.59 summarizes the concepts studied in this section.

### 5.3.2 Common-Base Topology

Following our extensive study of the CE stage, we now turn our attention to the "commonbase" (CB) topology. Nearly all of the concepts described for the CE configuration apply here as well. We therefore follow the same train of thought, but at a slightly faster pace.

Given the amplification capabilities of the CE stage, the reader may wonder why we study other amplifier topologies. As we will see, other configurations provide different circuit properties that are preferable to those of the CE stage in some applications. The reader is encouraged to review Examples 5.2-5.4, their resulting rules illustrated in Fig. 5.7, and the possible topologies in Fig. 5.28 before proceeding further.

Figure 5.60 shows the CB stage. The input is applied to the emitter and the output is sensed at the collector. Biased at a proper voltage, the base acts as ac ground and hence as a node "common" to the input and output ports. As with the CE stage, we first study the core and subsequently add the biasing elements.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d14406c858dcab7c2524g-09.jpg?height=800&width=1057&top_left_y=3430&top_left_x=1766)

Figure 5.60 Common-base stage.
Analysis of CB Core How does the CB stage of Fig. 5.61(a) respond to an input signal? ${ }^{9}$ If $V_{\text {in }}$ goes up by a small amount $\Delta V$, the base-emitter voltage of $Q_{1}$ decreases by the same amount because the base voltage is fixed. Consequently, the collector current falls by $g_{m} \Delta V$, allowing $V_{\text {out }}$ to rise by $g_{m} \Delta V R_{C}$. We therefore surmise that the small-signal voltage gain is equal to

$$
\begin{equation*}
A_{v}=g_{m} R_{C} \tag{5.252}
\end{equation*}
$$

[^1]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d14406c858dcab7c2524g-10.jpg?height=914&width=2239&top_left_y=816&top_left_x=1124)

Figure 5.61 (a) Response of CB stage to small input change, (b) small-signal model.
Interestingly, this expression is identical to the gain of the CE topology. Unlike the CE stage, however, this circuit exhibits a positive gain because an increase in $V_{i n}$ leads to an increase in $V_{\text {out }}$.

Let us confirm these results with the aid of the small-signal equivalent depicted in Fig. 5.61(b), where the Early effect is neglected. Beginning with the output node, we equate the current flowing through $R_{C}$ to $g_{m} v_{\pi}$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
-\frac{v_{\text {out }}}{R_{C}}=g_{m} v_{\pi} \tag{5.253}
\end{equation*}
$$

obtaining $v_{\pi}=-v_{\text {out }} /\left(g_{m} R_{C}\right)$. Considering the input node next, we recognize that $v_{\pi}=-v_{i n}$. It follows that

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{\text {out }}}{v_{\text {in }}}=g_{m} R_{C} \tag{5.254}
\end{equation*}
$$

As with the CE stage, the CB topology suffers from trade-offs among the gain, the voltage headroom, and the I/O impedances. We first examine the circuit's headroom limitations. How should the base voltage, $V_{b}$, in Fig. 5.61(a) be chosen? Recall that the operation in the active region requires $V_{B E}>0$ and $V_{B C} \leq 0$ (for $n p n$ devices). Thus, $V_{b}$ must remain higher than the input by about 800 mV , and the output must remain higher than or equal to $V_{b}$. For example, if the dc level of the input is zero (Fig. 5.62), then the output must not fall below approximately 800 mV , i.e., the voltage drop across $R_{C}$ cannot exceed $V_{C C}-V_{B E}$. Similar to the CE stage limitation, this condition translates to

$$
\begin{align*}
A_{v} & =\frac{I_{C}}{V_{T}} \cdot R_{C}  \tag{5.255}\\
& =\frac{V_{C C}-V_{B E}}{V_{T}} \tag{5.256}
\end{align*}
$$

Figure 5.62 Voltage headroom in CB stage.

Example The voltage produced by an electronic thermometer is equal to 600 mV at room 5.35 temperature. Design a CB stage to sense the thermometer voltage and amplify the change with maximum gain. Assume $V_{C C}=1.8 \mathrm{~V}, I_{C}=0.2 \mathrm{~mA}, I_{S}=5 \times 10^{-17} \mathrm{~A}$, and $\beta=100$.

Solution Illustrated in Fig. 5.63(a), the circuit must operate properly with an input level of 600 mV . Thus, $V_{b}=V_{B E}+600 \mathrm{mV}=V_{T} \ln \left(I_{C} / I_{S}\right)+600 \mathrm{mV}=1.354 \mathrm{~V}$. To avoid saturation, the collector voltage must not fall below the base voltage, thereby allowing a maximum voltage drop across $R_{C}$ equal to $1.8 \mathrm{~V}-1.354 \mathrm{~V}=0.446 \mathrm{~V}$. Thus $R_{C}=2.23 \mathrm{k} \Omega$. We can then write

$$
\begin{align*}
A_{v} & =g_{m} R_{C}  \tag{5.257}\\
& =\frac{I_{C} R_{C}}{V_{T}}  \tag{5.258}\\
& =17.2 \tag{5.259}
\end{align*}
$$

The reader is encouraged to repeat the problem with $I_{C}=0.4 \mathrm{~mA}$ to verify that the maximum gain remains relatively independent of the bias current. ${ }^{10}$

Figure 5.63 (a) CB stage sensing an input, (b) bias network for base.

We must now generate $V_{b}$. A simple approach is to employ a resistive divider as depicted in Fig. 5.63(b). To lower sensitivity to $\beta$, we choose $I_{1} \approx 10 I_{B} \approx 20 \mu \mathrm{~A} \approx$ $V_{C C} /\left(R_{1}+R_{2}\right)$. Thus, $R_{1}+R_{2}=90 \mathrm{k} \Omega$. Also,

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{b} \approx \frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} V_{C C} \tag{5.260}
\end{equation*}
$$

and hence

$$
\begin{align*}
& R_{2}=67.7 \mathrm{k} \Omega  \tag{5.261}\\
& R_{1}=22.3 \mathrm{k} \Omega . \tag{5.262}
\end{align*}
$$

Exercise Repeat the above example if the thermometer voltage is 300 mV .

[^2]Let us now compute the I/O impedances of the CB topology so as to understand its capabilities in interfacing with preceding and following stages. The rules illustrated in Fig. 5.7 prove extremely useful here, obviating the need for small-signal equivalent circuits. Shown in Fig. 5.64(a), the simplified ac circuit reveals that $R_{i n}$ is simply the impedance seen looking into the emitter with the base at ac ground. From the rules in Fig. 5.7, we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{i n}=\frac{1}{g_{m}} \tag{5.263}
\end{equation*}
$$

if $V_{A}=\infty$. The input impedance of the CB stage is therefore relatively low, e.g., $26 \Omega$ for $I_{C}=1 \mathrm{~mA}$ (in sharp contrast to the corresponding value for a CE stage, $\beta / g_{m}$ ).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d14406c858dcab7c2524g-12.jpg?height=851&width=1382&top_left_y=1772&top_left_x=1552)

Figure 5.64 (a) Input impedance of CB stage, (b) response to a small change in input.

The input impedance of the CB stage can also be determined intuitively [Fig. 5.64(b)]. Suppose a voltage source $V_{X}$ tied to the emitter of $Q_{1}$ changes by a small amount $\Delta V$. The base-emitter voltage therefore changes by the same amount, leading to a change in the collector current equal to $g_{m} \Delta V$. Since the collector current flows through the input source, the current supplied by $V_{X}$ also changes by $g_{m} \Delta V$. Consequently, $R_{i n}=\Delta V_{X} / \Delta I_{X}=1 / g_{m}$.

Does an amplifier with a low input impedance find any practical use? Yes, indeed. For example, many stand-alone high-frequency amplifiers are designed with an input resistance of $50 \Omega$ to provide "impedance matching" between modules in a cascade and the transmission lines (traces on a printed-circuit board) connecting the modules (Fig. 5.65). ${ }^{11}$

The output impedance of the CB stage is computed with the aid of Fig. 5.66, where the input voltage source is set to zero. We note that $R_{\text {out }}=R_{\text {out } 1} \| R_{C}$, where $R_{\text {out } 1}$ is the impedance seen at the collector with the emitter grounded. From the rules of Fig. 5.7, we have $R_{\text {out } 1}=r_{O}$ and hence

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{\text {out }}=r_{O} \| R_{C} \tag{5.264}
\end{equation*}
$$

or

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{\text {out }}=R_{C} \text { if } V_{A}=\infty \tag{5.265}
\end{equation*}
$$

Exercise Compare this value with that obtained for the CE stage.

From Eqs. (5.256) and (5.266), we conclude that the CB stage exhibits a set of trade-offs similar to those depicted in Fig. 5.33 for the CE amplifier.

It is instructive to study the behavior of the CB topology in the presence of a finite source resistance. Shown in Fig. 5.67, such a circuit suffers from signal attenuation from the input to node $X$, thereby providing a smaller voltage gain. More specifically, since the impedance seen looking into the emitter of $Q_{1}$ (with the base grounded) is

equal to $1 / g_{m}$ (for $V_{A}=\infty$ ), we have

$$
\begin{align*}
v_{X} & =\frac{\frac{1}{g_{m}}}{R_{S}+\frac{1}{g_{m}}} v_{i n}  \tag{5.267}\\
& =\frac{1}{1+g_{m} R_{S}} v_{i n} \tag{5.268}
\end{align*}
$$

We also recall from Eq. (5.254) that the gain from the emitter to the output is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{\text {out }}}{v_{X}}=g_{m} R_{C} \tag{5.269}
\end{equation*}
$$

It follows that

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{v_{\text {out }}}{v_{\text {in }}} & =\frac{g_{m} R_{C}}{1+g_{m} R_{S}}  \tag{5.270}\\
& =\frac{R_{C}}{\frac{1}{g_{m}}+R_{S}} \tag{5.271}
\end{align*}
$$

a result identical to that of the CE stage (except for a negative sign) if $R_{S}$ is viewed as an emitter degeneration resistor.

Example A common-base stage is designed to amplify an RF signal received by a $50-\Omega$ antenna.

5.37

Determine the required bias current if the input impedance of the amplifier must "match" the impedance of the antenna. What is the voltage gain if the CB stage also drives a $50-\Omega$ load? Assume $V_{A}=\infty$.

Solution Figure 5.68 depicts the amplifier ${ }^{12}$ and the equivalent circuit with the antenna modeled by a voltage source, $v_{i n}$, and a resistance, $R_{S}=50 \Omega$. For impedance matching,
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d14406c858dcab7c2524g-14.jpg?height=783&width=1833&top_left_y=3787&top_left_x=1321)

& =0.52 \mathrm{~mA} \tag{5.273}

$$

\$\$

If $R_{C}$ itself is replaced by a $50-\Omega$ load, then Eq. (5.271) reveals that

$$
\begin{align*}
A_{v} & =\frac{R_{C}}{\frac{1}{g_{m}}+R_{S}}  \tag{5.274}\\
& =\frac{1}{2} \tag{5.275}
\end{align*}
$$

The circuit is therefore not suited to driving a $50-\Omega$ load directly.

What is the voltage gain if a $50-\Omega$ resistor is also tied from the emitter of $Q_{1}$ to ground?

Another interesting point of contrast between the CE and CB stages relates to their current gains. The CB stage displays a current gain of unity because the current flowing into the emitter simply emerges from the collector (if the base current is neglected). On the other hand, as mentioned in Section 5.3.1, $A_{I}=\beta$ for the CE stage. In fact, in the preceding example, $i_{\text {in }}=v_{i n} /\left(R_{S}+1 / g_{m}\right)$, which upon flowing through $R_{C}$, yields $v_{\text {out }}=R_{C} v_{\text {in }} /\left(R_{S}+1 / g_{m}\right)$. It is thus not surprising that the voltage gain does not exceed 0.5 if $R_{C} \leq R_{S}$.

As with the CE stage, we may desire to analyze the CB topology in the general case: with emitter degeneration, $V_{A}<\infty$, and a resistance in series with the base [Fig. 5.69(a)]. Outlined in Problem 5.64, this analysis is somewhat beyond the scope of this book. Nevertheless, it is instructive to consider a special case where $R_{B}=0$ but $V_{A}<\infty$, and we wish to compute the output impedance. As illustrated in Fig. 5.69(b), $R_{\text {out }}$ is equal to $R_{C}$ in parallel with the impedance seen looking into the collector, $R_{\text {out } 1}$. But $R_{\text {out } 1}$ is identical to the output resistance of an emitter-degenerated common emitter stage, i.e., Fig. 5.46, and hence given by Eq. (5.197):

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{\text {out } 1}=\left[1+g_{m}\left(R_{E} \| r_{\pi}\right)\right] r_{O}+\left(R_{E} \| r_{\pi}\right) \tag{5.276}
\end{equation*}
$$

Figure 5.70 (a) CE stage and (b) CB stage simplified for output impedance calculation.

It follows that

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{\text {out }}=R_{C} \|\left\{\left[1+g_{m}\left(R_{E} \| r_{\pi}\right)\right] r_{O}+\left(R_{E} \| r_{\pi}\right)\right\} \tag{5.277}
\end{equation*}
$$

The reader may have recognized that the output impedance of the CB stage is equal to that of the CE stage. Is this true in general? Recall that the output impedance is determined by setting the input source to zero. In other words, when calculating $R_{\text {out }}$, we have no knowledge of the input terminal of the circuit, as illustrated in Fig. 5.70 for CE and CB stages. It is therefore no coincidence that the output impedances are identical if the same assumptions are made for both circuits (e.g., identical values of $V_{A}$ and emitter degeneration).

Old wisdom says "the output impedance of the CB stage is substantially higher than that of the CE stage." This claim is justified by the tests illustrated in Fig. 5.71. If a constant current is injected into the base while the collector voltage is varied, $I_{C}$ exhibits a slope equal to $r_{O}^{-1}$ [Fig. 5.71(a)]. On the other hand, if a constant current is drawn from the emitter, $I_{C}$ displays much less dependence on the collector voltage. Explain why these tests do not represent practical situations.

Figure 5.71 (a) Resistance seens at collector with emitter grounded, (b) resistance seen at collector with an ideal current source in emitter, (c) small-signal model of (a), (d) smallsignal model of (b).

Solution The principal issue in these tests relates to the use of current sources to drive each stage. From a small-signal point of view, the two circuits reduce to those depicted in Figs. 5.71(c) and (d), with current sources $I_{B}$ and $I_{E}$ replaced with open circuits because they are constant. In Fig. 5.71(c), the current through $r_{\pi}$ is zero, yielding $g_{m} v_{\pi}=0$ and hence $R_{\text {out }}=r_{O}$. On the other hand, Fig. 5.71(d) resembles an emitter-degenerated stage (Fig. 5.46) with an infinite emitter resistance, exhibiting an output resistance of

$$
\begin{align*}
R_{\text {out }} & =\left[1+g_{m}\left(R_{E} \| r_{\pi}\right)\right] r_{O}+\left(R_{E} \| r_{\pi}\right)  \tag{5.278}\\
& =\left(1+g_{m} r_{\pi}\right) r_{O}+r_{\pi}  \tag{5.279}\\
& \approx \beta r_{O}+r_{\pi} \tag{5.280}
\end{align*}
$$

which is, of course, much greater than $r_{O}$. In practice, however, each stage may be driven by a voltage source having a finite impedance, making the above comparison irrelevant.

Exercise Repeat the above example if a resistor of value $R_{1}$ is inserted in series with the emitter.

Another special case of the topology shown in Fig. 5.69(a) occurs if $V_{A}=\infty$ but $R_{B}>0$. Since this case does not reduce to any of the configurations studied earlier, we employ the small-signal model shown in Fig. 5.72 to study its behavior. As usual, we write $g_{m} v_{\pi}=-v_{\text {out }} / R_{C}$ and hence $v_{\pi}=-v_{\text {out }} /\left(g_{m} R_{C}\right)$. The current flowing through $r_{\pi}$ (and $\left.R_{B}\right)$ is then equal to $v_{\pi} / r_{\pi}=-v_{\text {out }} /\left(g_{m} r_{\pi} R_{C}\right)=-v_{\text {out }} /\left(\beta R_{C}\right)$. Multiplying this current by $R_{B}+r_{\pi}$, we obtain the voltage at node $P$ :

$$
\begin{align*}
v_{P} & =-\frac{-v_{\text {out }}}{\beta R_{C}}\left(R_{B}+r_{\pi}\right)  \tag{5.281}\\
& =\frac{v_{\text {out }}}{\beta R_{C}}\left(R_{B}+r_{\pi}\right) . \tag{5.282}
\end{align*}
$$

We also write a KCL at $P$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{\pi}}{r_{\pi}}+g_{m} v_{\pi}=\frac{v_{P}-v_{i n}}{R_{E}} \tag{5.283}
\end{equation*}
$$

Did you know?

The CB gain reduction as a result of an impedance in series with the base has stumbled many a designer. This effect is especially pronounced at high frequencies because the parasitic inductances of the package (which contains the chip) may introduce a significant impedance $(=L \omega)$. As shown below, the "bond wires" connecting the chip to the package behave like inductors, thus degrading the performance. For example, a $5-\mathrm{mm}$ bond wire has an inductance of about 5 nH , exhibiting an impedance of $157 \Omega$ at 5 GHz .

Effect of bond wire inductance in a CB stage.
that is,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left(\frac{1}{r_{\pi}}+g_{m}\right) \frac{-v_{\text {out }}}{g_{m} R_{C}}=\frac{\frac{v_{\text {out }}}{\beta R_{C}}\left(R_{B}+r_{\pi}\right)-v_{\text {in }}}{R_{E}} \tag{5.284}
\end{equation*}
$$

It follows that

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{\text {out }}}{v_{\text {in }}}=\frac{\beta R_{C}}{(\beta+1) R_{E}+R_{B}+r_{\pi}} . \tag{5.285}
\end{equation*}
$$

Dividing the numerator and denominator by $\beta+1$, we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{\text {out }}}{v_{\text {in }}} \approx \frac{R_{C}}{R_{E}+\frac{R_{B}}{\beta+1}+\frac{1}{g_{m}}} \tag{5.286}
\end{equation*}
$$

As expected, the gain is positive. Furthermore, this expression is identical to that in Eq. (5.185) for the CE stage. Figure 5.73 illustrates the results, revealing that, except for a negative sign, the two stages exhibit equal gains. Note that $R_{B}$ degrades the gain and is not added to the circuit deliberately. As explained later in this section, $R_{B}$ may arise from the biasing network.

Let us now determine the input impedance of the CB stage in the presence of a resistance in series with the base, still assuming $V_{A}=\infty$. From the small-signal equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 5.74, we recognize that

Moreover, KCL at the input node gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{\pi}}{r_{\pi}}+g_{m} v_{\pi}=-i_{X} \tag{5.288}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left(\frac{1}{r_{\pi}}+g_{m}\right) \frac{-r_{\pi}}{r_{\pi}+R_{B}} v_{X}=-i_{X} \tag{5.289}
\end{equation*}

and

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{v_{X}}{i_{X}} & =\frac{r_{\pi}+R_{B}}{\beta+1}  \tag{5.290}\\
& \approx \frac{1}{g_{m}}+\frac{R_{B}}{\beta+1} . \tag{5.291}
\end{align*}
$$

Note that $R_{i n}=1 / g_{m}$ if $R_{B}=0$, an expected result from the rules illustrated in Fig. 5.7. Interestingly, the base resistance is divided by $\beta+1$ when "seen" from the emitter. This is in contrast to the case of emitter degeneration, where the emitter resistance is multiplied by $\beta+1$ when seen from the base. Figure 5.75 summarizes the two cases. Note that these results remain independent of $R_{C}$ if $V_{A}=\infty$.

[^5]Solution The circuit employs $Q_{2}$ as a common-base device, but with its base tied to a finite series resistance equal to that seen at the emitter of $Q_{1}$. Thus, we must first obtain the equivalent resistance $R_{e q}$, which from Eq. (5.291) is simply equal to

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{e q}=\frac{1}{g_{m 1}}+\frac{R_{B}}{\beta+1} . \tag{5.292}
\end{equation*}
$$

Reducing the circuit to that shown in Fig. 5.76(b), we have

$$
\begin{align*}
R_{X} & =\frac{1}{g_{m 2}}+\frac{R_{e q}}{\beta+1}  \tag{5.293}\\
& =\frac{1}{g_{m 2}}+\frac{1}{\beta+1}\left(\frac{1}{g_{m 1}}+\frac{R_{B}}{\beta+1}\right) \tag{5.294}
\end{align*}
$$

Exercise What happens if a resistor of value $R_{1}$ is placed in series with the collector of $Q_{1}$ ?

CB Stage with Biasing Having learned the small-signal properties of the CB core, we now extend our analysis to the circuit including biasing. An example proves instructive at this point.

Example
5.40

The student in Example 5.31 decides to incorporate ac coupling at the input of a CB stage to ensure the bias is not affected by the signal source, drawing the design as shown in Fig. 5.77. Explain why this circuit does not work.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d14406c858dcab7c2524g-20.jpg?height=743&width=754&top_left_y=3687&top_left_x=1866)

Figure 5.77 CB stage lacking bias current.

Solution Unfortunately, the design provides no dc path for the emitter current of $Q_{1}$, forcing a zero bias current and hence a zero transconductance. The situation is similar to the CE counterpart in Example 5.5, where no base current can be supported.

Exercise In what region does $Q_{1}$ operate if $V_{b}=V_{C C}$ ?

Somewhat embarrassed, the student quickly connects the emitter to ground so that
5.41 $V_{B E}=V_{b}$ and a reasonable collector current can be established (Fig. 5.78). Explain why "haste makes waste."
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d14406c858dcab7c2524g-21.jpg?height=738&width=749&top_left_y=1138&top_left_x=1960)

Figure 5.78 CB stage with emitter shorted to ground.
Solution As in Example 5.6, the student has shorted the signal to ac ground. That is, the emitter voltage is equal to zero regardless of the value of $v_{\text {in }}$, yielding $v_{\text {out }}=0$.

Exercise Does the circuit operate better if $V_{b}$ is raised?

The above examples imply that the emitter can remain neither open nor shorted to ground, thereby requiring some bias element. Shown in Fig. 5.79(a) is an example in which $R_{E}$ provides a path for the bias current at the cost of lowering the input impedance. We recognize that $R_{\text {in }}$ now consists of two parallel components: (1) $1 / g_{m}$, seen looking "up" into the emitter (with the base at ac ground) and (2) $R_{E}$, seen looking "down." Thus,

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{i n}=\frac{1}{g_{m}} \| R_{E} \tag{5.295}
\end{equation*}
$$

As with the input biasing network in the CE stage (Fig. 5.58), the reduction in $R_{\text {in }}$ manifests itself if the source voltage exhibits a finite output resistance. Depicted in Fig. 5.79(b), such a circuit attenuates the signal, lowering the overall voltage gain.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d14406c858dcab7c2524g-21.jpg?height=846&width=1006&top_left_y=4069&top_left_x=1192)

(b)

Figure 5.79 (a) CB stage with biasing, (b) inclusion of source resistance.

Following the analysis illustrated in Fig. 5.67, we can write

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{v_{X}}{v_{i n}} & =\frac{R_{\text {in }}}{R_{i n}+R_{S}}  \tag{5.296}\\
& =\frac{\frac{1}{g_{m}} \| R_{E}}{\frac{1}{g_{m}} \| R_{E}+R_{S}}  \tag{5.297}\\
& =\frac{1}{1+\left(1+g_{m} R_{E}\right) R_{S}} \tag{5.298}
\end{align*}
$$

Since $v_{\text {out }} / v_{X}=g_{m} R_{C}$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{\text {out }}}{v_{\text {in }}}=\frac{1}{1+\left(1+g_{m} R_{E}\right) R_{S}} \cdot g_{m} R_{C} \tag{5.299}
\end{equation*}
$$

As usual, we have preferred solution by inspection over drawing the small-signal equivalent.

The reader may see a contradiction in our thoughts: on the one hand, we view the low input impedance of the CB stage as a useful property; on the other hand, we consider the reduction of the input impedance due to $R_{E}$ undesirable. To resolve this apparent contradiction, we must distinguish between the two components $1 / g_{m}$ and $R_{E}$, noting that the latter shunts the input source current to ground, thus "wasting" the signal. As shown in Fig. 5.80, $i_{\text {in }}$ splits two ways, with only $i_{2}$ reaching $R_{C}$ and contributing to the output signal. If $R_{E}$ decreases while $1 / g_{m}$ remains constant, then $i_{2}$ also falls. ${ }^{14}$ Thus, reduction of $R_{i n}$ due to $R_{E}$ is undesirable. By contrast, if $1 / g_{m}$ decreases while $R_{E}$ remains constant, then $i_{2}$ rises. For $R_{E}$ to affect the input impedance negligibly, we must have

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{E} \gg \frac{1}{g_{m}} \tag{5.300}
\end{equation*}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d14406c858dcab7c2524g-22.jpg?height=846&width=1136&top_left_y=3344&top_left_x=1681)

Figure 5.80 Small-signal input current components in a CB stage.
and hence

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{C} R_{E} \gg V_{T} \tag{5.301}
\end{equation*}
$$

That is, the dc voltage drop across $R_{E}$ muts be much greater than $V_{T}$.

[^6]How is the base voltage, $V_{b}$, generated? We can employ a resistive divider similar to that used in the CE stage. Shown in Fig. 5.81(a), such a topology must ensure $I_{1} \gg I_{B}$ to minimize sensitivity to $\beta$, yielding

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{b} \approx \frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} V_{C C} \tag{5.302}
\end{equation*}
$$

However, recall from Eq. (5.286) that a resistance in series with the base reduces the voltage gain of the CB stage. Substituting a Thevenin equivalent for $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ as depicted in Fig. 5.81(b), we recognize that a resistance of $R_{\text {Thev }}=R_{1} \| R_{2}$ now appears in series with the base. For this reason, a "bypass capacitor" is often tied from the base to ground, acting as a short circuit at frequencies of interest [Fig. 5.81(c)].
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d14406c858dcab7c2524g-23.jpg?height=748&width=897&top_left_y=1658&top_left_x=967)

Example
5.42

Design a CB stage (Fig. 5.82) for a voltage gain of 10 and an input impedance of $50 \Omega$. Assume $I_{S}=5 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{~A}, V_{A}=\infty, \beta=100$, and $V_{C C}=2.5 \mathrm{~V}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d14406c858dcab7c2524g-23.jpg?height=714&width=988&top_left_y=3182&top_left_x=1835)

Figure 5.82 Example of CB stage with biasing.
Solution We begin by selecting $R_{E} \gg 1 / g_{m}$, e.g., $R_{E}=500 \Omega$, to minimize the undesirable effect of $R_{E}$. Thus,

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{i n} \approx \frac{1}{g_{m}}=50 \Omega \tag{5.303}
\end{equation*}
$$

and hence

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{C}=0.52 \mathrm{~mA} \tag{5.304}
\end{equation*}
$$

If the base is bypassed to ground

$$
\begin{equation*}
A_{v}=g_{m} R_{C} \tag{5.305}
\end{equation*}
$$

yielding

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{C}=500 \Omega \tag{5.306}
\end{equation*}
$$

We now determine the base bias resistors. Since the voltage drop across $R_{E}$ is equal to $500 \Omega \times 0.52 \mathrm{~mA}=260 \mathrm{mV}$ and $V_{B E}=V_{T} \ln \left(I_{C} / I_{S}\right)=899 \mathrm{mV}$, we have

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{b} & =I_{E} R_{E}+V_{B E}  \tag{5.307}\\
& =1.16 \mathrm{~V} \tag{5.308}
\end{align*}
$$

Selecting the current through $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ to be $10 I_{B}=52 \mu \mathrm{~A}$, we write

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{b} & \approx \frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} V_{C C} .  \tag{5.309}\\
\frac{V_{C C}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} & =52 \mu \mathrm{~A} \tag{5.310}
\end{align*}
$$

It follows that

$$
\begin{align*}
& R_{1}=25.8 \mathrm{k} \Omega  \tag{5.311}\\
& R_{2}=22.3 \mathrm{k} \Omega \tag{5.312}
\end{align*}
$$

The last step in the design is to compute the required values of $C_{1}$ and $C_{B}$ according to the signal frequency. For example, if the amplifier is used at the receiver front end of a 900MHz cellphone, the impedances of $C_{1}$ and $C_{B}$ must be sufficiently small at this frequency. Appearing in series with the emitter of $Q_{1}, C_{1}$ plays a role similar to $R_{S}$ in Fig. 5.67 and Eq. (5.271). Thus, its impedance, $\left|C_{1} \omega\right|^{-1}$, must remain much less than $1 / g_{m}=50 \Omega$. In high-performance applications such as cellphones, we may choose $\left|C_{1} \omega\right|^{-1}=\left(1 / g_{m}\right) / 20$ to ensure negligible gain degradation. Consequently, for $\omega=2 \pi \times(900 \mathrm{MHz})$ :

$$
\begin{align*}
C_{1} & =\frac{20 g_{m}}{\omega}  \tag{5.313}\\
& =71 \mathrm{pF} \tag{5.314}
\end{align*}
$$

Since the impedance of $C_{B}$ appears in series with the base and plays a role similar to the term $R_{B} /(\beta+1)$ in Eq. (5.286), we require that

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{\beta+1}\left|\frac{1}{C_{B} \omega}\right|=\frac{1}{20} \frac{1}{g_{m}} \tag{5.315}
\end{equation*}
$$

and hence

$$
\begin{equation*}
C_{B}=0.7 \mathrm{pF} \tag{5.316}
\end{equation*}
$$

(A common mistake is to make the impedance of $C_{B}$ negligible with respect to $R_{1} \| R_{2}$ rather than with respect to $1 / g_{m}$.)

Exercise Design the above circuit for an input impedance of $100 \Omega$.

### 5.3.3 Emitter Follower

Another important circuit topology is the emitter follower (also called the "commoncollector" stage). The reader is encouraged to review Examples 5.2-5.3, rules illustrated in Fig. 5.7, and the possible topologies in Fig. 5.28 before proceeding further. For the sake of brevity, we may also use the term "follower" to refer to emitter followers in this chapter.

Shown in Fig. 5.83, the emitter follower senses the input at the base of the transistor and produces the output at the emitter. The collector is tied to $V_{C C}$ and hence ac ground. We first study the core and subsequently add the biasing elements.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d14406c858dcab7c2524g-25.jpg?height=509&width=1280&top_left_y=1641&top_left_x=1683)

Figure 5.83 Emitter follower.

Emitter Follower Core How does the follower in Fig. 5.84(a) respond to a change in $V_{i n}$ ? If $V_{i n}$ rises by a small amount $\Delta V_{i n}$, the base-emitter voltage of $Q_{1}$ tends to increase, raising the collector and emitter currents. The higher emitter current translates to a greater drop across $R_{E}$ and hence a higher $V_{\text {out }}$. From another perspective, if we assume, for example, $V_{\text {out }}$ is constant, then $V_{B E}$ must rise and so must $I_{E}$, requiring that $V_{\text {out }}$ go up. Since $V_{\text {out }}$ changes in the same direction as $V_{i n}$, we expect the voltage gain to be positive. Note that $V_{\text {out }}$ is always lower than $V_{\text {in }}$ by an amount equal to $V_{B E}$, and the circuit is said to provide "level shift."

(b)

Figure 5.84 (a) Emitter follower sensing an input change, (b) response of the circuit.

Another interesting and important observation here is that the change in $V_{\text {out }}$ cannot be larger than the change in $V_{\text {in }}$. Suppose $V_{\text {in }}$ increases from $V_{\text {in } 1}$ to $V_{\text {in } 1}+\Delta V_{\text {in }}$ and $V_{\text {out }}$ from $V_{\text {out } 1}$ to $V_{\text {out } 1}+\Delta V_{\text {out }}$ [Fig. 5.84(b)]. If the output changes by a greater amount than the input, $\Delta V_{\text {out }}>\Delta V_{\text {in }}$, then $V_{B E 2}$ must be less than $V_{B E 1}$. But this means the emitter current also decreases and so does $I_{E} R_{E}=V_{\text {out }}$, contradicting the assumption that $V_{\text {out }}$ has increased. Thus, $\Delta V_{\text {out }}<\Delta V_{\text {in }}$, implying that the follower exhibits a voltage gain less than unity. ${ }^{15}$

[^7]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d14406c858dcab7c2524g-26.jpg?height=612&width=908&top_left_y=619&top_left_x=1818)

Figure 5.85 Small-signal model of emitter follower.

The reader may wonder if an amplifier with a subunity gain has any practical value. As explained later, the input and output impedances of the emitter follower make it a particularly useful circuit for some applications.

Let us now derive the small-signal properties of the follower, first assuming $V_{A}=\infty$. Shown in Fig. 5.85, the equivalent circuit yields

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{\pi}}{r_{\pi}}+g_{m} v_{\pi}=\frac{v_{\text {out }}}{R_{E}} \tag{5.317}
\end{equation*}
$$

and hence

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{\pi}=\frac{r_{\pi}}{\beta+1} \cdot \frac{v_{\text {out }}}{R_{E}} \tag{5.318}
\end{equation*}
$$

We also have

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{\text {in }}=v_{\pi}+v_{\text {out }} \tag{5.319}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substituting for $v_{\pi}$ from (5.318), we obtain

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{v_{\text {out }}}{v_{\text {in }}} & =\frac{1}{1+\frac{r_{\pi}}{\beta+1} \cdot \frac{1}{R_{E}}}  \tag{5.320}\\
& \approx \frac{R_{E}}{R_{E}+\frac{1}{g_{m}}} \tag{5.321}
\end{align*}
$$

The voltage gain is therefore positive and less than unity.

In integrated circuits, the follower is typically realized as shown in Fig. 5.86. Determine 5.43 the voltage gain if the current source is ideal and $V_{A}=\infty$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d14406c858dcab7c2524g-26.jpg?height=560&width=549&top_left_y=4281&top_left_x=1969)

Figure 5.86 Follower with current source.

Solution Since the emitter resistor is replaced with an ideal current source, the value of $R_{E}$ in Eq. (5.321) must tend to infinity, yielding

$$
\begin{equation*}
A_{v}=1 \tag{5.322}
\end{equation*}
$$

This result can also be derived intuitively. A constant current source flowing through $Q_{1}$ requires that $V_{B E}=V_{T} \ln \left(I_{C} / I_{S}\right)$ remain constant. Writing $V_{\text {out }}=V_{\text {in }}-V_{B E}$, we recognize that $V_{\text {out }}$ exactly follows $V_{\text {in }}$ if $V_{B E}$ is constant.

Exercise Repeat the above example if a resistor of value $R_{1}$ is placed in series with the collector.

Equation (5.321) suggests that the emitter follower acts as a voltage divider, a perspective that can be reinforced by an alternative analysis. Suppose, as shown in Fig. 5.87(a), we wish to model $v_{\text {in }}$ and $Q_{1}$ by a Thevenin equivalent. The Thevenin voltage is given by the open-circuit output voltage produced by $Q_{1}$ [Fig. 5.87(b)], as if $Q_{1}$ operates with $R_{E}=\infty$ (Example 5.43). Thus, $v_{T h e v}=v_{i n}$. The Thevenin resistance is obtained by setting the input to zero [Fig. 5.87(c)] and is equal to $1 / g_{m}$. The circuit of Fig. 5.87(a) therefore reduces to that shown in Fig. 5.87(d), confirming operation as a voltage divider.

Example 5.44

Determine the voltage gain of a follower driven by a finite source impedance of $R_{S}$ [Fig. 5.88(a)] if $V_{A}=\infty$.

Solution We model $v_{i n}, R_{S}$, and $Q_{1}$ by a Thevenin equivalent. The reader can show that the opencircuit voltage is equal to $v_{i n}$. Furthermore, the Thevenin resistance [Fig. 5.88(b)] is given by Eq. (5.291) as $R_{S} /(\beta+1)+1 / g_{m}$. Figure 5.88(c) depicts the equivalent circuit, revealing that

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{\text {out }}}{v_{\text {in }}}=\frac{R_{E}}{R_{E}+\frac{R_{S}}{\beta+1}+\frac{1}{g_{m}}} \tag{5.323}

This result can also be obtained by solving the small-signal equivalent circuit of the follower.

Exercise What happens if $R_{E}=\infty$ ?

Did you know?

Shortly after the invention of the bipolar transistor, a Bell Labs engineer named Sidney Darlington borrowed a few transistors from his boss and took them home for the weekend. It was over that weekend that he came up with what is known as the "Darlington Pair" [Fig. (a)]. Here, $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ can be viewed as two emitter followers in a cascade. The circuit provides a high input impedance but since $I_{C 1}$ is small $\left(=I_{B 2}\right), Q_{1}$ is quite slow. For this reason, the modified topologies in Figs. (b) and (c) are preferred.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d14406c858dcab7c2524g-28.jpg?height=538&width=629&top_left_y=3738&top_left_x=502)

(c)

Darlington pairs.

In order to appreciate the usefulness of emitter followers, let us compute their input and output impedances. In the equivalent circuit of Fig. 5.89(a), we have $i_{X} r_{\pi}=v_{\pi}$. Also, the current $i_{X}$ and $g_{m} v_{\pi}$ flow through $R_{E}$, producing a voltage drop equal to $\left(i_{X}+g_{m} v_{\pi}\right) R_{E}$. Adding the voltages across $r_{\pi}$ and $R_{E}$ and equating the result to $v_{X}$, we have

$$
\begin{align*}
v_{X} & =v_{\pi}+\left(i_{X}+g_{m} v_{\pi}\right) R_{E}  \tag{5.324}\\
& =i_{X} r_{\pi}+\left(i_{X}+g_{m} i_{X} r_{\pi}\right) R_{E}, \tag{5.325}
\end{align*}
$$

and hence

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{X}}{i_{X}}=r_{\pi}+(1+\beta) R_{E} \tag{5.326}
\end{equation*}

This expression is identical to that in Eq. (5.162) derived for a degenerated CE stage. This is, of course, no coincidence. Since the input impedance of the CE topology is independent of the collector resistor (for $V_{A}=\infty$ ), its value remains unchanged if $R_{C}=0$, which is the case for an emitter follower [Fig. 5.89(b)].

The key observation here is that the follower "transforms" the load resistor, $R_{E}$, to a much larger value, thereby serving as an efficient "buffer." This concept can be illustrated by an example.

Example
5.45

A CE stage exhibits a voltage gain of 20 and an output resistance of $1 \mathrm{k} \Omega$. Determine the voltage gain of the CE amplifier if
(a) The stage drives an $8-\Omega$ speaker directly.
(b) An emitter follower biased at a current of 5 mA is interposed between the CE stage and the speaker. Assume $\beta=100, V_{A}=\infty$, and the follower is biased with an ideal current source.

Solution (a) As depicted in Fig. 5.90(a), the equivalent resistance seen at the collector is now given by the parallel combination of $R_{C}$ and the speaker impedance, $R_{s p}$, reducing the gain from 20 to $20 \times\left(R_{C} \| 8 \Omega\right) / R_{C}=0.159$. The voltage gain therefore degrades drastically.

R_{i n 1} & =r_{\pi 2}+(\beta+1) R_{s p}  \tag{5.327}\\
& =1328 \Omega \tag{5.328}
\end{align*}
$$

Thus, the voltage gain of the CE stage drops from 20 to $20 \times\left(R_{C} \| R_{i n 1}\right) /$ $R_{C}=11.4$, a substantial improvement over case (a).

Figure 5.91 (a) Output impedance of a follower, (b) components of output resistance.

We now calculate the output impedance of the follower, assuming the circuit is driven by a source impedance $R_{S}$ [Fig. 5.91(a)]. Interestingly, we need not resort to a small-signal model here as $R_{\text {out }}$ can be obtained by inspection. As illustrated in Fig. 5.91(b), the output resistance can be viewed as the parallel combination of two components: one seen looking "up" into the emitter and another looking "down" into $R_{E}$. From Fig. 5.88, the former is equal to $R_{S} /(\beta+1)+1 / g_{m}$, and hence

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{\text {out }}=\left(\frac{R_{S}}{\beta+1}+\frac{1}{g_{m}}\right) \| R_{E} \tag{5.329}
\end{equation*}
$$

This result can also be derived from the Thevenin equivalent shown in Fig. 5.88(c) by setting $v_{\text {in }}$ to zero.

Equation (5.329) reveals another important attribute of the follower: the circuit transforms the source impedance, $R_{S}$, to a much lower value, thereby providing higher "driving" capability. We say the follower operates as a good "voltage buffer" because it displays a high input impedance (like a voltmeter) and a low output impedance (like a voltage source).

Effect of Transistor Output Resistance Our analysis of the follower has thus far neglected the Early effect. Fortunately, the results obtained above can be readily modified to reflect this nonideality. Figure 5.92 illustrates a key point that facilitates the analysis: in small-signal operation, $r_{O}$ appears in parallel with $R_{E}$. We can therefore rewrite Eqs. (5.323), (5.326) and (5.329) as

$$
\begin{align*}
A_{v} & =\frac{R_{E} \| r_{O}}{R_{E} \| r_{O}+\frac{R_{S}}{\beta+1}+\frac{1}{g_{m}}}  \tag{5.330}\\
R_{\text {in }} & =r_{\pi}+(\beta+1)\left(R_{E} \| r_{O}\right)  \tag{5.331}\\
R_{\text {out }} & =\left(\frac{R_{S}}{\beta+1}+\frac{1}{g_{m}}\right)\left\|R_{E}\right\| r_{O} \tag{5.332}
\end{align*}
$$

Figure 5.92 Follower including transistor output resistance.

Example Determine the small-signal properties of an emitter follower using an ideal current 5.46 source (as in Example 5.43) but with a finite source impedance $R_{S}$.

Solution Since $R_{E}=\infty$, we have

$$
\begin{align*}
A_{v} & =\frac{r_{O}}{r_{O}+\frac{R_{S}}{\beta+1}+\frac{1}{g_{m}}}  \tag{5.333}\\
R_{\text {in }} & =r_{\pi}+(\beta+1) r_{O}  \tag{5.334}\\
R_{\text {out }} & =\left(\frac{R_{S}}{\beta+1}+\frac{1}{g_{m}}\right) \| r_{O} \tag{5.335}
\end{align*}
$$

Also, $g_{m} r_{O} \gg 1$, and hence

$$
\begin{align*}
& A_{v} \approx \frac{r_{O}}{r_{O}+\frac{R_{S}}{\beta+1}}  \tag{5.336}\\
& R_{\text {in }} \approx(\beta+1) r_{O} \tag{5.337}
\end{align*}
$$

We note that $A_{v}$ approaches unity if $R_{S} \ll(\beta+1) r_{O}$, a condition typically valid.

Exercise $\quad$ How are the results modified if $R_{E}<\infty$ ?

The buffering capability of followers is sometimes attributed to their "current gain." Since a base current $i_{B}$ results in an emitter current of $(\beta+1) i_{B}$, we can say that for a current $i_{L}$ delivered to the load, the follower draws only $i_{L} /(\beta+1)$ from the source voltage (Fig. 5.93). Thus, $v_{X}$ sees the load impedance multiplied by $(\beta+1)$.

Figure 5.93 Current amplification in a follower.

Emitter Follower with Biasing The biasing of emitter followers entails defining both the base voltage and the collector (emitter) current. Figure 5.94(a) depicts an example similar to the scheme illustrated in Fig. 5.19 for the CE stage. As usual, the current flowing through $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ is chosen to be much greater than the base current.

It is interesting to note that, unlike the CE topology, the emitter follower can operate with a base voltage near $V_{C C}$. This is because the collector is tied to $V_{C C}$, allowing the same voltage for the base without driving $Q_{1}$ into saturation. For this reason, followers are often biased as shown in Fig. 5.94(b), where $R_{B} I_{B}$ is chosen much less than the

voltage drop across $R_{E}$, thus lowering the sensitivity to $\beta$. The following example illustrates this point.

Example The follower of Fig. 5.94(b) employs $R_{B}=10 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ and $R_{E}=1 \mathrm{k} \Omega$. Calculate the bias 5.47 current and voltages if $I_{S}=5 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{~A}, \beta=100$, and $V_{C C}=2.5 \mathrm{~V}$. What happens if $\beta$ drops to 50?

Solution To determine the bias current, we follow the iterative procedure described in Section 5.2.3. Writing a KVL through $R_{B}$, the base-emitter junction, and $R_{E}$ gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{R_{B} I_{C}}{\beta}+V_{B E}+R_{E} I_{C}=V_{C C} \tag{5.338}
\end{equation*}
$$

which, with $V_{B E} \approx 800 \mathrm{mV}$, leads to

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{C}=1.545 \mathrm{~mA} \tag{5.339}
\end{equation*}
$$

It follows that $V_{B E}=V_{T} \ln \left(I_{C} / I_{S}\right)=748 \mathrm{mV}$. Using this value in Eq. (5.338), we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{C}=1.593 \mathrm{~mA} \tag{5.340}
\end{equation*}
$$

a value close to that in Eq. (5.339) and hence relatively accurate. Under this condition, $I_{B} R_{B}=159 \mathrm{mV}$ whereas $R_{E} I_{C}=1.593 \mathrm{~V}$.

Since $I_{B} R_{B} \ll R_{E} I_{C}$, we expect that variation of $\beta$ and hence $I_{B} R_{B}$ negligibly affects the voltage drop across $R_{E}$ and hence the emitter and collector currents. As a rough estimate, for $\beta=50, I_{B} R_{B}$ is doubled $(\approx 318 \mathrm{mV})$, reducing the drop across $R_{E}$ by 159 mV . That is, $I_{E}=(1.593 \mathrm{~V}-0.159 \mathrm{~V}) / 1 \mathrm{k} \Omega=1.434 \mathrm{~mA}$, implying that a twofold change in $\beta$ leads to a $10 \%$ change in the collector current. The reader is encouraged to repeat the above iterations with $\beta=50$ and determine the exact current.

Exercise If $R_{B}$ is doubled, is the circuit more or less sensitive to the variation in $\beta$ ?

As manifested by Eq. (5.338), the topologies of Fig. 5.94 suffer from supplydependent biasing. In integrated circuits, this issue is resolved by replacing the emitter resistor with a constant current source (Fig. 5.95). Now, since $I_{E E}$ is constant, so are $V_{B E}$ and $R_{B} I_{B}$. Thus, if $V_{C C}$ rises, so do $V_{X}$ and $V_{Y}$, but the bias current remains constant.

## 5.4 SUMMARY AND ADDITIONAL EXAMPLES

This chapter has created a foundation for amplifier design, emphasizing that a proper bias point must be established to define the small-signal properties of each circuit. Depicted in Fig. 5.96, the three amplifier topologies studied here exhibit different gains and I/O impedances, each serving a specific application. CE and CB stages can provide a voltage gain greater than unity and their input and output impedances are independent of the load and source impedances, respectively (if $V_{A}=\infty$ ). On the other hand, followers display a voltage gain of at most unity but their terminal impedances depend on the load and source impedances.

Figure 5.97 (a) Example of CE stage, (b) equivalent circuit with $C_{1}$ shorted, (c) simplified circuit.

Solution The simplified ac model is depicted in Fig. 5.97(b), revealing that $R_{1}$ appears between base and ground, and $R_{2}$ between collector and ground. Replacing $v_{i n}, R_{S}$, and $R_{1}$ with a Thevenin equivalent [Fig. 5.97(c)], we have

$$
\begin{align*}
v_{\text {Thev }} & =\frac{R_{1}}{R_{1}+R_{S}} v_{\text {in }}  \tag{5.341}\\
R_{\text {Thev }} & =R_{1} \| R_{S} . \tag{5.342}
\end{align*}
$$

The resulting circuit resembles that in Fig. 5.43(a) and satisfies Eq. (5.185):

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{\text {out }}}{v_{\text {Thev }}}=-\frac{R_{2} \| R_{C}}{\frac{R_{\text {Thev }}}{\beta+1}+\frac{1}{g_{m}}+R_{E}} \tag{5.343}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substituting for $v_{\text {Thev }}$ and $R_{\text {Thev }}$ gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{\text {out }}}{v_{\text {in }}}=-\frac{R_{2} \| R_{C}}{\frac{R_{1} \| R_{S}}{\beta+1}+\frac{1}{g_{m}}+R_{E}} \cdot \frac{R_{1}}{R_{1}+R_{S}} \tag{5.344}

Figure 5.98 (a) Example of CE stage, (b) simplified circuit.

Solution As shown in the simplified diagram of Fig. 5.98(b), $R_{2}$ appears as an emitter degeneration resistor. As in the above example, we replace $v_{i n}, R_{S}$, and $R_{1}$ with a Thevenin equivalent and utilize Eq. (5.185):

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{\text {out }}}{v_{\text {in }}}=-\frac{R_{C}}{\frac{R_{\text {Thev }}}{\beta+1}+\frac{1}{g_{m}}+R_{2}} \tag{5.345}

and hence

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{e q}=\frac{R_{1}}{\beta+1}+\frac{1}{g_{m 2}} \tag{5.347}

(b)

Figure 5.101 (a) Example of CB stage, (b) simplified circuit.

Solution In this circuit, $Q_{1}$ operates as a common-base device (why?) but with a resistance $R_{e q}$ in series with its base [Fig. 5.101(b)]. To obtain $R_{e q}$, we recognize that $Q_{2}$ resembles an emitter follower, e.g., the topology in Fig. 5.91(a), concluding that $R_{e q}$ can be viewed as the output resistance of such a stage, as given by Eq. (5.329):

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{e q}=\left(\frac{R_{B}}{\beta+1}+\frac{1}{g_{m 2}}\right) \| R_{E} \tag{5.353}
\end{equation*}
$$

Now, from Fig. 5.101(b), we observe that $R_{\text {in }}$ contains two components: one equal to the resistance in series with the base, $R_{e q}$, divided by $\beta+1$, and another equal to $1 / g_{m 1}$ :

$$
\begin{align*}
R_{i n}=\frac{R_{e q}}{\beta+1} & +\frac{1}{g_{m 1}}  \tag{5.354}\\
\quad & =\frac{1}{\beta+1}\left[\left(\frac{R_{B}}{\beta+1}+\frac{1}{g_{m 2}}\right) \| R_{E}\right]+\frac{1}{g_{m 1}} \tag{5.355}

Solution Noting that $X$ is at ac ground, we construct the simplified circuit shown in Fig. 5.102(b), where the output resistance of $Q_{1}$ is explicitly drawn. Replacing $v_{i n}, R_{S}$, and $R_{1}$ with their Thevenin equivalent and recognizing that $R_{E}, R_{2}$, and $r_{O}$ appear in parallel [Fig. 5.102(c)], we employ Eq. (5.330) and write

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{\text {out }}}{v_{\text {Thev }}}=\frac{R_{E}\left\|R_{2}\right\| r_{O}}{R_{E}\left\|R_{2}\right\| r_{O}+\frac{1}{g_{m}}+\frac{R_{T h e v}}{\beta+1}} \tag{5.356}
\end{equation*}
$$

and hence

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{\text {out }}}{v_{\text {in }}}=\frac{R_{E}\left\|R_{2}\right\| r_{O}}{R_{E}\left\|R_{2}\right\| r_{O}+\frac{1}{g_{m}}+\frac{R_{S} \| R_{1}}{\beta+1}} \cdot \frac{R_{1}}{R_{1}+R_{S}} \tag{5.357}
\end{equation*}
$$

For the output resistance, we refer to Eq. (5.332):

$$
\begin{align*}
R_{\text {out }} & =\left(\frac{R_{\text {Thev }}}{\beta+1}+\frac{1}{g_{m}}\right) \|\left(R_{E}\left\|R_{2}\right\| r_{O}\right)  \tag{5.358}\\
& =\left(\frac{R_{S} \| R_{1}}{\beta+1}+\frac{1}{g_{m}}\right)\left\|R_{E}\right\| R_{2} \| r_{O} \tag{5.359}
\end{align*}

Figure 5.103 (a) Example of CE stage, (b) simplified circuit.

Solution
We identify the stage as a CE amplifier with emitter degeneration and a composite collector load. As the first step, we represent the role of $Q_{2}$ and $Q_{3}$ by the impedances that they create at their emitter. Since $R_{e q 1}$ denotes the impedance seen looking into the emitter of $Q_{2}$ with a base resistance of $R_{B 1}$, we have from Fig. 5.75

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{e q 1}=\frac{R_{B 1}}{\beta+1}+\frac{1}{g_{m 2}} . \tag{5.360}
\end{equation*}
$$

Similarly,

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{e q 2}=\frac{R_{B 2}}{\beta+1}+\frac{1}{g_{m 1}}, \tag{5.361}
\end{equation*}
$$

leading to the simplified circuit shown in Fig. 5.103(b). It follows that

$$
\begin{align*}
A_{v} & =-\frac{R_{C}+R_{e q 2}}{R_{e q 1}+\frac{1}{g_{m 3}}+R_{E}}  \tag{5.362}\\
& =-\frac{R_{C}+\frac{R_{B 2}}{\beta+1}+\frac{1}{g_{m 1}}}{\frac{R_{B 1}}{\beta+1}+\frac{1}{g_{m 2}}+\frac{1}{g_{m 3}}+R_{E}} \tag{5.363}
\end{align*}
$$

Also,

## 5.5 CHAPTER SUMMARY

- In addition to gain, the input and output impedances of amplifiers determine the ease with which various stages can be cascaded.
- Voltage amplifiers must ideally provide a high input impedance (so that they can sense a voltage without disturbing the node) and a low output impedance (so that they can drive a load without reduction in gain).
- The impedances seen looking into the base, collector, and emitter of a bipolar transistor are equal to $r_{\pi}$ (with emitter grounded), $r_{O}$ (with emitter grounded), and $1 / g_{m}$ (with base grounded), respectively.
- In order to obtain the required small-signal bipolar device parameters such as $g_{m}$, $r_{\pi}$, and $r_{O}$, the transistor must be "biased," i.e., carry a certain collector current and operate in the active region. Signals simply perturb these conditions.
- Biasing techniques establish the required base-emitter and base-collector voltages while providing the base current.
- With a single bipolar transistor, only three amplifier topologies are possible: commonemitter and common-base stages and emitter followers.
- The CE stage provides a moderate voltage gain, a moderate input impedance, and a moderate output impedance.
- Emitter degeneration improves the linearity but lowers the voltage gain.
- Emitter degeneration raises the output impedance of CE stages considerably.
- The CB stage provides a moderate voltage gain, a low input impedance, and a moderate output impedance.
- The voltage gain expressions for CE and CB stages are similar but for a sign.
- The emitter follower provides a voltage gain less than unity, a high input impedance, and a low output impedance, serving as a good voltage buffer.
