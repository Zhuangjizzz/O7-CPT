    "text": "The input and output impedances of an amplifier are pivotal for it to effectively connect with stages before and after it. To grasp this concept, we should first identify the input and output impedances of a perfect voltage amplifier. At the input, the circuit must act as a voltmeter—it should detect a voltage without affecting the stage preceding it. Hence, the ideal input impedance is infinite. At the output, the circuit must act as a voltage source—it should provide a consistent signal level to any load impedance. Therefore, the ideal output impedance is zero.\n\nIn practical terms, the input and output impedances of a voltage amplifier may differ significantly from the ideal values, necessitating careful attention to interfacing with other stages. The following example highlights this issue.\n\nConsider an amplifier with a voltage gain of 10 that takes a signal from a microphone and sends the amplified output to a speaker [Fig. 5.1(a)]. Assume the microphone can be modeled as a voltage source with a $10-\\mathrm{mV}$ peak-to-peak signal and a series resistance of $200 \\Omega$. Also, assume the speaker can be represented by an $8-\\Omega$ resistor.\n\nFigure 5.1(a) shows a simple audio system block diagram, illustrating the system's main components: a microphone, an amplifier, and a speaker.\n\n1. **Main Components:**\n- **Microphone:** This is the input device, modeled as a voltage source with a peak-to-peak signal of 10 mV and a series resistance of 200 Ω. It converts sound waves into electrical signals.\n- **Amplifier:** The amplifier has a voltage gain (A_v) of 10. It amplifies the signal received from the microphone to a higher voltage level before sending it to the speaker.\n- **Speaker:** Represented by an 8 Ω resistor, the speaker acts as the output device, converting the amplified electrical signal back into sound waves.\n\n2. **Flow of Information or Control:**\n- The signal flow starts at the microphone, which senses sound and converts it into a 10 mV electrical signal. This signal, along with the series resistance, is fed into the amplifier.\n- The amplifier increases the voltage of the signal by a factor of 10, preparing it for output to the speaker.\n- The amplified signal is then directed to the speaker, which outputs the sound.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n- The microphone's voltage source is labeled with a peak-to-peak value of 10 mV.\n- The series resistance of the microphone is labeled as 200 Ω.\n- The amplifier's gain is indicated as A_v = 10.\n- The speaker's resistance is noted as 8 Ω.\n\n4. **Overall System Function:**\n- The primary function of this system is to capture audio signals through the microphone, amplify these signals using the amplifier, and then output the amplified signals as sound through the speaker. The arrangement of these components ensures that the initially weak signal from the microphone is sufficiently amplified to drive the speaker effectively.\n\nFigure 5.1 (a) Simple audio system, (b) signal loss due to amplifier input impedance, (c) signal loss due to amplifier output impedance.\n\n(a) Determine the signal level sensed by the amplifier if the circuit has an input impedance of $2 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$ or $500 \\Omega$.\n\n(b) Determine the signal level delivered to the speaker if the circuit has an output impedance of $10 \\Omega$ or $2 \\Omega$.\n\nSolution (a) Figure 5.1(b) shows the interface between the microphone and the amplifier. The voltage sensed by the amplifier is therefore given by:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{1}=\\frac{R_{\\text {in }}}{R_{\\text {in }}+R_{m}} v_{m} \\tag{5.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor $R_{\\text {in }}=2 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{1}=0.91 v_{m} \\tag{5.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nonly $9 \\%$ less than the microphone signal level. On the other hand, for $R_{\\text {in }}=$ $500 \\Omega$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{1}=0.71 v_{m} \\tag{5.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\ni.e., nearly $30 \\%$ loss. It is therefore desirable to maximize the input impedance in this case.\n\n(b) Drawing the interface between the amplifier and the speaker as in Fig. 5.1(c), we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{\\text {out }}=\\frac{R_{L}}{R_{L}+R_{\\text {amp }}} v_{\\text {amp }} \\tag{5.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor $R_{a m p}=10 \\Omega$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{\\text {out }}=0.44 v_{\\text {amp }}, \\tag{5.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\na substantial attenuation. For $R_{a m p}=2 \\Omega$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{\\text {out }}=0.8 v_{\\text {amp }} \\tag{5.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, the output impedance of the amplifier must be minimized.\n\nExercise: If the signal delivered to the speaker is equal to $0.2 v_{m}$, find the ratio of $R_{m}$ and $R_{L}$.\n\nThe importance of I/O impedances encourages us to carefully prescribe the method of measuring them. As with the impedance of two-terminal devices such as resistors and capacitors, the input (output) impedance is measured between the input (output) nodes of the circuit while all independent sources in the circuit are set to zero. ${ }^{2}$ Illustrated in Fig. 5.2, the method involves applying a voltage source to the two nodes (also called \"ports\") of interest, measuring the resulting current, and defining $v_{X} / i_{X}$ as the impedance. Also shown are arrows to denote \"looking into\" the input or output port and the corresponding impedance.\n\nThe reader may wonder why the output port in Fig. 5.2(a) is left open whereas the input port in Fig. 5.2(b) is shorted.

The output port is left open, and the input port is shorted. This is because a voltage amplifier is driven by a voltage source during normal operation, and all independent sources must be set to zero.\n\nThe I/O impedances are typically considered small-signal quantities, assuming the signal levels are small. For instance, the input impedance is obtained by applying a small change in the input voltage and measuring the resulting change in the input current. Small-signal models of semiconductor devices are crucial here.\n\nExample 5.2 involves determining the input impedance of a circuit with an NPN transistor operating in the forward active region.

To comprehend this, let's examine the I/O impedances of an ideal voltage amplifier. At the input, the circuit should behave like a voltmeter, measuring voltage without affecting the previous stage. Therefore, the ideal input impedance is infinite. At the output, the circuit should act as a voltage source, delivering a constant signal level to any load impedance. Hence, the ideal output impedance is zero.\n\nIn reality, the I/O impedances of a voltage amplifier may deviate significantly from these ideal values, necessitating careful consideration when interfacing with other stages. For example, an amplifier with a voltage gain of 10 might amplify a signal from a microphone and send it to a speaker. If the microphone is modeled with a voltage source having a 10 mV peak-to-peak signal and a series resistance of 200 Ω, and the speaker is represented by an 8 Ω resistor, the system block diagram would illustrate the flow of information from the microphone, through the amplifier, to the speaker.\n\nThe primary function of this system is to capture audio signals, amplify them, and output them as sound. The components are arranged to ensure that the weak microphone signal is sufficiently amplified to drive the speaker effectively.\n\nTo measure the I/O impedances, a voltage source is applied to the nodes of interest while all independent sources are set to zero. The input impedance is measured between the input nodes, and the output impedance is measured between the output nodes. This method is similar to calculating the Thevenin impedance of a circuit.\n\nIn small-signal models, the input impedance is obtained by applying a small change in the input voltage and measuring the resulting change in the input current. The small-signal models of semiconductor devices are crucial here.\n\nFor instance, if the transistor operates in the forward active region, the input impedance of the circuit can be determined using the small-signal model. The input impedance is simply given by the resistor value in the model.\n\nThe output impedance, on the other hand, is represented by another resistor in the small-signal model. It is important to minimize the output impedance to ensure that the amplified signal is delivered effectively to the load.\n\nIn summary, the I/O impedances of an amplifier are crucial for its proper functioning and interaction with other circuit stages. Understanding and measuring these impedances are essential for designing and analyzing amplifier circuits."

Consider an amplifier with a voltage gain of 10, amplifying a microphone signal for a speaker. The microphone generates a 10 mV peak-to-peak signal with a series resistance of 200 Ω, while the speaker is modeled as an 8 Ω resistor.\n\nThe system block diagram illustrates a simple audio system consisting of three main components: a microphone, an amplifier, and a speaker. The microphone converts sound waves into electrical signals, the amplifier boosts the signal, and the speaker converts the amplified electrical signal back into sound waves.\n\nThe signal flow begins at the microphone, which senses sound and converts it into a 10 mV electrical signal. This signal, along with the series resistance, is fed into the amplifier. The amplifier increases the voltage of the signal by a factor of 10, preparing it for output to the speaker. The amplified signal is then directed to the speaker, which outputs the sound.\n\nThe microphone's voltage source is labeled with a peak-to-peak value of 10 mV, and the series resistance is labeled as 200 Ω. The amplifier's gain is indicated as A_v = 10, and the speaker's resistance is noted as 8 Ω.\n\nThe primary function of this system is to capture audio signals through the microphone, amplify these signals using the amplifier, and then output the amplified signals as sound through the speaker. The arrangement of these components ensures that the initially weak signal from the microphone is sufficiently amplified to drive the speaker effectively.\n\nThe circuit diagrams model the interface between a microphone and an amplifier, as well as the output stage of an audio amplifier system. The amplifier has a voltage gain of 10, and the speaker is modeled as an 8 Ω resistor. The amplifier's output impedance is represented by Ramp.\n\nFigure 5.1 (a) shows a simple audio system, (b) illustrates signal loss due to amplifier input impedance, and (c) shows signal loss due to amplifier output impedance.\n\nThe importance of I/O impedances encourages us to carefully prescribe the method of measuring them. As with the impedance of two-terminal devices such as resistors and capacitors, the input (output) impedance is measured between the input (output) nodes of the circuit while all independent sources in the circuit are set to zero.\n\nThe method involves applying a voltage source to the two nodes (also called \"ports\") of interest, measuring the resulting current, and defining v_X / i_X as the impedance. Also shown are arrows to denote \"looking into\" the input or output port and the corresponding impedance.\n\nSince a voltage amplifier is driven by a voltage source during normal operation, and since all independent sources must be set to zero, the input port must be shorted to represent a zero voltage source. That is, the procedure for calculating the output impedance is identical to that used for obtaining the Thevenin impedance of a circuit (Chapter 1). In Fig. 5.2(a), on the other hand, the output remains open because it is not connected to any external sources.\n\nDetermining the transfer of signals from one stage to the next, the I/O impedances are usually regarded as small-signal quantities-with the tacit assumption that the signal levels are indeed small. For example, the input impedance is obtained by applying a small change in the input voltage and measuring the resulting change in the input current. The small-signal models of semiconductor devices therefore prove crucial here.\n\nAssuming that the transistor operates in the forward active region, the input impedance of the circuit shown in Fig. 5.3(a) can be determined using the small-signal model in Fig. 5.3(b). The input impedance is simply given by v_x / i_x = r_π.\n\nSince r_π = β / g_m = β V_T / I_C, a higher β or lower I_C yields a higher input impedance.\n\nThe diagram named \"(a)\" depicts a simple amplifier stage:\n\n1. Main Components:\n   - Amplifier Block: The central component is a rectangular block representing the amplifier. It is connected to ground, indicating a common reference point for the circuit.\n   - Input Resistor (R_in): Positioned at the input of the amplifier, this resistor is connected in series with the input signal, controlling the input impedance.\n\n2. Flow of Information or Control:\n   - The input signal enters from the left, passing through the input resistor R_in before reaching the amplifier block. This configuration indicates that the amplifier processes the input signal, amplifying it according to its gain characteristics.\n   - The output is taken from the right side of the amplifier block, where it connects to the next stage of the circuit or system.\n\n3. Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:\n   - R_in: This label indicates the input resistance, which is crucial for determining the input impedance of the amplifier stage.\n   - GND (Ground): The amplifier block is connected to ground, providing a reference voltage level for the circuit.\n\n4. Overall System Function:\n   - The primary function of this amplifier stage is to increase the amplitude of the input signal. The input resistor R_in helps in setting the input impedance, which affects how the amplifier interacts with the preceding circuit stage. The connection to ground ensures that the amplifier has a stable reference point for operation. This setup is typical in analog signal processing, where signal amplification is necessary for further processing or transmission.\n\nThe diagram labeled \"(b)\" represents a small-signal model of a simple amplifier stage. It consists of a block diagram with key components and annotations that help describe its function.\n\n1. Main Components:\n   - Amplifier Block: The central component is a rectangular block which represents the amplifier. This block is connected to the ground (GND) at the bottom, indicating its reference point.\n   - Output Impedance (R_out): To the right of the amplifier block, there is an arrow pointing towards a resistor labeled R_out, which represents the output impedance of the amplifier.\n\n2. Flow of Information or Control:\n   - The diagram shows a \"Short\" connection on the left side of the amplifier block, indicating that the input side is shorted in this small-signal model. This suggests that the input is grounded or has a low impedance path to ground.\n   - The signal flow is from left to right, starting from the shorted input and moving through the amplifier to the output, where the output impedance R_out is measured.\n\n3. Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:\n   - Ground (GND): The amplifier block is connected to the ground, which is a common reference point in circuits.\n   - Short: This label on the input side indicates that the input is effectively grounded or has a negligible impedance in this model.\n\n4. Overall System Function:\n   - The primary function of this small-signal model is to analyze the output characteristics of the amplifier when the input is shorted. This model helps in understanding how the amplifier behaves when driven by a low-impedance source, focusing on the output impedance R_out. The grounding of the amplifier and the shorted input suggest an emphasis on the output side's behavior in response to the input conditions.\n\nFigure 5.4 illustrates the concept of impedance seen at a node. To simplify the notations and diagrams, we often refer to the impedance seen at a node rather than between two nodes (i.e., at a port). As illustrated, such a convention simply assumes that the other node is the ground, i.e., the test voltage source is applied between the node of interest and ground.\n\nExample 5.3 calculates the impedance seen looking into the collector of Q_1 in Fig. 5.5(a).\n\nThe circuit is a common-emitter configuration with a capacitor C1 connected to the collector and a resistor Rout connected in parallel to the capacitor, both leading to ground.\n\nThe small-signal model in Fig. 5.5(b) shows that the input impedance is simply given by v_x / i_x = r_π.\n\nSince r_π = β / g_m = β V_T / I_C, a higher β or lower I_C yields a higher input impedance.\n\nExercise: What happens if R_C is doubled?\n\nExample 5.4 calculates the impedance seen at the emitter of Q_1 in Fig. 5.6(a).\n\nThe circuit consists of an NPN transistor Q_1 with the collector connected to VCC, the base connected to Vin, and the emitter connected to node e1. A resistor Rout is connected between node e1 and ground.\n\nThe small-signal model in Fig. 5.6(b) shows that the input impedance is given by v_x / i_x = 1 / (g_m + 1 / r_π).\n\nSince r_π = β / g_m ≫ 1 / g_m, the output impedance R_out ≈ 1 / g_m.\n\nExercise: What happens if a resistance of value R_1 is placed in series with the collector?\n\nThe above examples provide three important rules that will be used throughout this book (Fig. 5.7): Looking into the base, we see r_π if the emitter is (ac) grounded. Looking into the collector, we see r_O if the emitter is (ac) grounded. Looking into the emitter, we see 1 / g_m if the base is (ac) grounded and the Early effect is neglected. It is imperative that the reader master these rules and be able to apply them in more complex circuits."

    "text": "The impedances at the input and output of an amplifier are pivotal in determining how well it interfaces with the stages before and after it. To grasp this idea, consider first the ideal input and output impedances of a voltage amplifier. Ideally, the input should function like a voltmeter, sensing voltage without affecting the preceding stage; hence, the ideal input impedance should be infinite. Conversely, the output should act as a voltage source, providing a steady signal to any load impedance, meaning the ideal output impedance should be zero.\n\nIn practical scenarios, the input and output impedances of a voltage amplifier can deviate significantly from these ideal values, necessitating careful consideration of how the amplifier interacts with other stages. For instance, consider an amplifier with a voltage gain of 10 that takes a signal from a microphone and sends the amplified output to a speaker. If the microphone is modeled as a voltage source with a 10 mV peak-to-peak signal and a 200 Ω series resistance, and the speaker as an 8 Ω resistor, the interface between these components can cause signal loss if the amplifier's input or output impedances are not appropriately matched.\n\nThe signal level sensed by the amplifier is affected by its input impedance, and the signal level delivered to the speaker is influenced by the amplifier's output impedance. For example, if the amplifier's input impedance is 2 kΩ or 500 Ω, the signal level sensed can be significantly lower than the microphone's signal level. Similarly, if the amplifier's output impedance is 10 Ω or 2 Ω, the signal level delivered to the speaker can be attenuated.\n\nTo measure the input and output impedances, a method similar to that used for two-terminal devices like resistors and capacitors is employed. This involves applying a voltage source across the two nodes (ports) of interest while setting all independent sources to zero, then measuring the resulting current to define the impedance.\n\nSmall-signal models of semiconductor devices are essential in obtaining these impedances, as they involve applying a small change in the input voltage and measuring the resulting change in the input current. For example, the input impedance of a transistor amplifier stage can be determined using its small-signal model, considering parameters like the transistor's transconductance and the input resistance.\n\nUnderstanding and mastering the rules for determining the impedances seen at the terminals of a transistor, such as looking into the base and seeing the input impedance, looking into the collector and seeing the output impedance, and looking into the emitter and seeing the impedance under certain conditions, is crucial for analyzing and designing more complex circuits."

The load is connected between the diode and the output. The input is a voltage source, and the output is measured across the load.\n\nFigure 5.9 Steps in a general circuit analysis.\n\nIt's worth noting that amplifier design follows a similar approach. Initially, the circuitry around the transistor is crafted to establish proper bias conditions and the requisite small-signal parameters. Next, the small-signal behavior of the circuit is examined to confirm the desired performance. Often, some iteration between these steps is necessary to achieve the intended behavior.\n\nHow do we distinguish between small-signal and large-signal operations? Specifically, under what conditions can we use small-signal models for devices?\n\n[^4]If the signal causes only a negligible perturbation to the device's bias point, the circuit is said to operate in the small-signal regime. In Fig. 5.8, for instance, the change in $I_{C}$ due to the signal must be minimal. This criterion is valid because the transistor's amplifying properties, such as $g_{m}$ and $r_{\\pi}$, are considered constant in small-signal analysis, even though they actually vary as the signal affects $I_{C}$. Essentially, a linear representation of the transistor is valid only if the small-signal parameters themselves change negligibly. The definition of \"negligibly\" varies depending on the circuit and application, but a common rule of thumb is a $10 \\%$ variation in the collector current as the upper limit for small-signal operation.\n\nIn subsequent circuit diagrams, we will use simplified notations and symbols. Figure 5.10 illustrates an example where the battery serving as the supply voltage is depicted as a horizontal bar labeled $V_{C C} .{ }^{5}$ Additionally, the input voltage source is simplified to a single node called $V_{i n}$, with the understanding that the other node is ground.\nimage_name:Figure 5.10\ndescription:\n[\nname: Vin, type: VoltageSource, value: Vin, ports: {Np: Vin, Nn: GND}\nname: RC, type: Resistor, value: RC, ports: {N1: VCC, N2: Vout}\nname: Q1, type: NPN, ports: {C: Vout, B: Vin, E: GND}\nname: VCC, type: VoltageSource, value: VCC, ports: {Np: VCC, Nn: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit is a basic NPN transistor amplifier configuration with a resistor RC connected to the collector. The input voltage source Vin is connected to the base, and the output is taken from the collector. The emitter is grounded, and the circuit is powered by VCC.\n\nFigure 5.10 Notation for supply voltage.\nIn this chapter, we start with the DC analysis and design of bipolar stages, focusing on determining or creating bias conditions. This phase does not require knowledge of signals, hence the input and output ports of the circuit are not considered. Subsequently, we introduce various amplifier topologies and analyze their small-signal behavior."

The value of $R_{C}$, determined by small-signal gain requirements, is constrained by a maximum that keeps $Q_{1}$ out of saturation.

Assuming $R_{E} I_{C}=200 \\mathrm{mV}$, we get $R_{E}=400 \\Omega$. To establish $V_{X}=$ $V_{B E}+R_{E} I_{C}=978 \\mathrm{mV}$, we need\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} V_{C C}=V_{B E}+R_{E} I_{C} \\tag{5.63}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nneglecting the base current.

As discussed in Chapter 4, the transistor can tolerate soft saturation, i.e., up to about 400 mV of base-collector forward bias. Therefore, in low-voltage applications, we may allow $V_{Y} \\approx V_{X}-400 \\mathrm{mV}$ and hence a higher value for $R_{C}$.\n\nExercise Repeat the above example with a power budget of only 1 mW and no specified transconductance for $Q_{1}$.\n\nThe two guidelines in Fig. 5.21 for reducing sensitivities involve trade-offs. Specifically, an overly conservative design faces the following issues: (1) if $I_{1}$ is much greater than $I_{B}$, then $R_{1}+R_{2}$ and hence $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ are quite small, resulting in low input impedance; (2) if $V_{R E}$ is very large, then $V_{X}\\left(=V_{B E}+V_{R E}\\right)$ must be high, limiting the minimum collector voltage to avoid saturation. Let's revisit the above example to explore these issues.\n\nExample Repeat Example 5.11 with $V_{R E}=500 \\mathrm{mV}$ and $I_{1} \\geq 100 I_{B}$.\nSolution The collector current and base-emitter voltage remain unchanged.

It uses resistors R1 and R2 to set the base voltage, and RC and RE to stabilize the collector and emitter currents, respectively. The design aims to keep Q1 out of saturation while maintaining stability against variations in Vx and VBE.\n\nFigure 5.21 Summary of robust bias conditions.\n\nDesign Procedure A design procedure for the bias topology of Fig. 5.21, suitable for most applications, can be outlined as follows: (1) decide on a collector bias current that provides appropriate small-signal parameters like $g_{m}$ and $r_{\\pi}$; (2) based on expected variations in $R_{1}$, $R_{2}$, and $V_{B E}$, choose a value for $V_{R E} \\approx I_{C} R_{E}$, e.g., 200 mV; (3) calculate $V_{X}=V_{B E}+I_{C} R_{E}$ using $V_{B E}=V_{T} \\ln \\left(I_{C} / I_{S}\\right)$; (4) select $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ to achieve the required $V_{X}$ and ensure $I_{1} \\gg I_{B}$. The value of $R_{C}$, determined by small-signal gain requirements, is constrained by a maximum that keeps $Q_{1}$ out of saturation. The following example demonstrates these principles.\n\nDesign the circuit of Fig. 5.21 to provide a transconductance of $1 /(52 \\Omega)$ for $Q_{1}$. Assume $V_{C C}=2.5 \\mathrm{~V}, \\beta=100$, and $I_{S}=5 \\times 10^{-17} \\mathrm{~A}$. What is the maximum allowable value of $R_{C}$?\n\nSolution A $g_{m}$ of $(52 \\Omega)^{-1}$ corresponds to a collector current of 0.5 mA and a $V_{B E}$ of 778 mV. Assuming $R_{E} I_{C}=200 \\mathrm{mV}$, we get $R_{E}=400 \\Omega$. To establish $V_{X}=$ $V_{B E}+R_{E} I_{C}=978 \\mathrm{mV}$, we must have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} V_{C C}=V_{B E}+R_{E} I_{C} \\tag{5.63}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nneglecting the base current. For the base current $I_{B}=5 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$ to be negligible,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{V_{C C}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} \\gg I_{B} \\tag{5.64}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\ne.g., by a factor of 10. Thus, $R_{1}+R_{2}=50 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$, which, in conjunction with Eq.

Since the collector voltage is $V_{C C}-R_{C} I_{C}$, we impose the following constraint to ensure active mode operation:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{C C}-R_{C} I_{C}>V_{X} \\tag{5.67}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nthat is,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{C} I_{C}<1.522 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{5.68}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nConsequently,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{C}<3.044 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega \\tag{5.69}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIf $R_{C}$ exceeds this value, the collector voltage drops below the base voltage. As discussed in Chapter 4, the transistor can tolerate soft saturation, i.e., up to about 400 mV of base-collector forward bias. Thus, in low-voltage applications, we may allow $V_{Y} \\approx V_{X}-400 \\mathrm{mV}$ and hence a larger value for $R_{C}$.\n\nExercise Repeat the above example if the power budget is limited to 1 mW and the transconductance of $Q_{1}$ is not specified.\n\nThe two guidelines in Fig. 5.21 for reducing sensitivities involve trade-offs. Specifically, an overly conservative design faces the following issues: (1) if $I_{1}$ is much greater than $I_{B}$, then $R_{1}+R_{2}$ and hence $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ are quite small, resulting in a low input impedance; (2) if $V_{R E}$ is very large, then $V_{X}\\left(=V_{B E}+V_{R E}\\right)$ must be high, limiting the minimum collector voltage to avoid saturation. Let's revisit the above example to explore these issues.\n\nExample Repeat Example 5.11 with $V_{R E}=500 \\mathrm{mV}$ and $I_{1} \\geq 100 I_{B}$.\nSolution The collector current and base-emitter voltage remain unchanged. The value of $R_{E}$ is now $500 \\mathrm{mV} / 0.5 \\mathrm{~mA}=1 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$. Also, $V_{X}=V_{B E}+R_{E} I_{C}=1.278 \\mathrm{~V}$ and Eq. (5.63) still holds. We rewrite Eq.

It follows that\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& R_{1}=1.45 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega  \\tag{5.71}\\\\\n& R_{2}=3.55 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega . \\tag{5.72}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSince the base voltage has risen to 1.278 V, the collector voltage must exceed this value to avoid saturation, leading to\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nR_{C} & <\\frac{V_{C C}-V_{X}}{I_{C}}  \\tag{5.73}\\\\\n& <1.044 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega . \\tag{5.74}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nAs seen in Section 5.3.1, the reduction in $R_{C}$ results in a lower voltage gain. Also, the much smaller values of $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ here than in Example 5.11 introduce a low input impedance, loading the preceding stage. We compute the exact input impedance of this circuit in Section 5.3.1.\n\nExercise Repeat the above example if $V_{R E}$ is limited to 100 mV."

It uses resistors R1 and R2 to set the base voltage, and RC and RE to stabilize the collector and emitter currents, respectively. The design aims to keep Q1 out of saturation while maintaining stability against variations in Vx and VBE.\n\nFigure 5.21 Summary of robust bias conditions.\n\nDesign Procedure A design procedure for the bias topology of Fig. 5.21, suitable for most applications, can be outlined: (1) choose a collector bias current that provides appropriate small-signal parameters like $g_{m}$ and $r_{\\pi}$; (2) based on expected variations in $R_{1}, R_{2}$, and $V_{B E}$, select a value for $V_{R E} \\approx I_{C} R_{E}$, e.g., 200 mV; (3) calculate $V_{X}=V_{B E}+I_{C} R_{E}$ using $V_{B E}=V_{T} \\ln \\left(I_{C} / I_{S}\\right)$; (4) choose $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ to achieve the required $V_{X}$ and ensure $I_{1} \\gg I_{B}$. The value of $R_{C}$, determined by small-signal gain requirements, is constrained by a maximum that keeps $Q_{1}$ out of saturation. The following example illustrates these concepts.\n\nDesign the circuit of Fig. 5.21 to achieve a transconductance of $1 /(52 \\Omega)$ for $Q_{1}$. Assume $V_{C C}=2.5 \\mathrm{~V}, \\beta=100$, and $I_{S}=5 \\times 10^{-17} \\mathrm{~A}$. What is the maximum allowable value of $R_{C}$?\n\nSolution A $g_{m}$ of $(52 \\Omega)^{-1}$ corresponds to a collector current of 0.5 mA and a $V_{B E}$ of 778 mV. Assuming $R_{E} I_{C}=200 \\mathrm{mV}$, we find $R_{E}=400 \\Omega$. To set $V_{X}=$ $V_{B E}+R_{E} I_{C}=978 \\mathrm{mV}$, we need\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} V_{C C}=V_{B E}+R_{E} I_{C} \\tag{5.63}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nneglecting the base current.

Thus, $R_{1}+R_{2}=50 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$, which, combined with Eq. (5.63), gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& R_{1}=30.45 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega  \\tag{5.65}\\\\\n& R_{2}=19.55 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega \\tag{5.66}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nHow large can $R_{C}$ be? Since the collector voltage is $V_{C C}-R_{C} I_{C}$, we impose the following constraint to ensure active mode operation:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{C C}-R_{C} I_{C}>V_{X} \\tag{5.67}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\ni.e.,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{C} I_{C}<1.522 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{5.68}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{C}<3.044 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega \\tag{5.69}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIf $R_{C}$ exceeds this value, the collector voltage drops below the base voltage. As discussed in Chapter 4, the transistor can tolerate soft saturation, i.e., up to about 400 mV of base-collector forward bias. Therefore, in low-voltage applications, we may allow $V_{Y} \\approx V_{X}-400 \\mathrm{mV}$ and hence a larger value for $R_{C}$.\n\nExercise Repeat the above example with a power budget of only 1 mW and no specified transconductance for $Q_{1}$.\n\nThe two guidelines in Fig. 5.21 for reducing sensitivities involve trade-offs. Specifically, an overly conservative design may face these issues: (1) if $I_{1}$ must be much greater than $I_{B}$, then $R_{1}+R_{2}$, and hence $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$, are quite small, resulting in low input impedance; (2) if $V_{R E}$ is very large, then $V_{X}\\left(=V_{B E}+V_{R E}\\right)$ must be high, limiting the minimum collector voltage to avoid saturation. Let's revisit the previous example to explore these issues.\n\nExample Repeat Example 5.11 with $V_{R E}=500 \\mathrm{mV}$ and $I_{1} \\geq 100 I_{B}$.\nSolution The collector current and base-emitter voltage remain unchanged. The value of $R_{E}$ is now $500 \\mathrm{mV} / 0.5 \\mathrm{~mA}=1 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$. Also, $V_{X}=V_{B E}+R_{E} I_{C}=1.278 \\mathrm{~V}$, and Eq. (5.63) still applies. We rewrite Eq. (5.64) as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{V_{C C}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} \\geq 100 I_{B}, \\tag{5.70}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nresulting in $R_{1}+R_{2}=5 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$. It follows that\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& R_{1}=1.45 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega  \\tag{5.71}\\\\\n& R_{2}=3.55 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega . \\tag{5.72}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSince the base voltage has risen to 1.278 V, the collector voltage must exceed this value to avoid saturation, leading to\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nR_{C} & <\\frac{V_{C C}-V_{X}}{I_{C}}  \\tag{5.73}\\\\\n& <1.044 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega . \\tag{5.74}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nAs seen in Section 5.3.1, the reduction in $R_{C}$ results in a lower voltage gain. Additionally, the much smaller values of $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ here compared to Example 5.11 lead to a low input impedance, loading the preceding stage. We compute the exact input impedance of this circuit in Section 5.3.1.\n\nExercise Repeat the above example if $V_{R E}$ is limited to 100 mV."

The value of $R_{C}$, determined by small-signal gain requirements, is constrained by a maximum that keeps $Q_{1}$ out of saturation. The following example demonstrates these concepts.\n\nDesign the circuit of Fig. 5.21 to provide a transconductance of $1 /(52 \\Omega)$ for $Q_{1}$. Assume $V_{C C}=2.5 \\mathrm{~V}, \\beta=100$, and $I_{S}=5 \\times 10^{-17} \\mathrm{~A}$. What is the maximum allowable value of $R_{C}$?\n\nSolution A $g_{m}$ of $(52 \\Omega)^{-1}$ corresponds to a collector current of 0.5 mA and a $V_{B E}$ of 778 mV. Assuming $R_{E} I_{C}=200 \\mathrm{mV}$, we find $R_{E}=400 \\Omega$. To establish $V_{X}=$ $V_{B E}+R_{E} I_{C}=978 \\mathrm{mV}$, we need\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} V_{C C}=V_{B E}+R_{E} I_{C} \\tag{5.63}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nneglecting the base current.

As discussed in Chapter 4, the transistor can tolerate soft saturation, i.e., up to about 400 mV of base-collector forward bias. Thus, in low-voltage applications, we may allow $V_{Y} \\approx V_{X}-400 \\mathrm{mV}$ and hence a higher value for $R_{C}$.\n\nExercise Repeat the above example if the power budget is limited to 1 mW and the transconductance of $Q_{1}$ is not specified.\n\nThe two guidelines in Fig. 5.21 for reducing sensitivities involve some trade-offs. Specifically, an overly conservative design faces the following issues: (1) if $I_{1}$ must be much greater than $I_{B}$, then $R_{1}+R_{2}$ and hence $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ are quite small, resulting in a low input impedance; (2) if $V_{R E}$ is very large, then $V_{X}\\left(=V_{B E}+V_{R E}\\right)$ must be high, limiting the minimum collector voltage to avoid saturation. Let's revisit the above example to explore these issues.\n\nExample Repeat Example 5.11 but with $V_{R E}=500 \\mathrm{mV}$ and $I_{1} \\geq 100 I_{B}$.\nSolution The collector current and base-emitter voltage remain unchanged.

    "text": "A commonly employed biasing technique in both discrete and integrated circuits is depicted in Fig. 5.22. This \"self-biased\" configuration is so named because the base current and voltage are derived from the collector, offering numerous intriguing and practical benefits.\n\nOur analysis of this circuit starts with the observation that the base voltage consistently remains below the collector voltage, expressed as $V_{X}=V_{Y}-I_{B} R_{B}$. This key characteristic of self-biasing ensures that $Q_{1}$ operates in the active mode, regardless of the device and circuit parameters.

The emitter is connected to VCC.\n\nFigure 5.24: Simple biasing of pnp stage.\nSolution: The topology mirrors that in Fig. 5.13, yielding:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{B} R_{B}+V_{E B}=V_{C C} \\tag{5.89}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{B}=\\frac{V_{C C}-V_{E B}}{R_{B}} \\tag{5.90}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C}=\\beta \\frac{V_{C C}-V_{E B}}{R_{B}} \\tag{5.91}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe circuit is sensitive to $\\beta$. Increasing $R_{C}$ raises $V_{Y}$, approaching $V_{X}\\left(=V_{C C}-V_{E B}\\right)$, bringing $Q_{1}$ closer to saturation. Saturation occurs at $V_{Y}=V_{X}$, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C} R_{C, \\max }=V_{C C}-V_{E B} \\tag{5.92}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nresulting in\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nR_{C, \\max } & =\\frac{V_{C C}-V_{E B}}{I_{C}}  \\tag{5.93}\\\\\n& =\\frac{R_{B}}{\\beta} . \\tag{5.94}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nFrom another perspective, since $V_{X}=I_{B} R_{B}$ and $V_{Y}=I_{C} R_{C}$, we have $I_{B} R_{B}=$ $I_{C} R_{C, \\max }$ as the saturation edge condition, giving $R_{B}=\\beta R_{C, \\max }$.\n\nExercise: For a given $R_{C}$, what $R_{B}$ value positions the device at the saturation edge?\nImage Description: Figure 5.25 (a)\n- Additional Info: Determine the collector current and voltage of Q1 in the Fig. 5.25(a) PNP stage with resistive divider biasing.

The diagram for Fig. 5.25(a) is not provided here. The context involves analyzing a PNP stage with resistive divider biasing and its Thevenin equivalent.\n\nImage Description: Figure 5.25 (a)\n- Component Details:\n  - R1: Resistor, value: R1, ports: {N1: X, N2: GND}\n  - R2: Resistor, value: R2, ports: {N1: VCC, N2: X}\n  - RC: Resistor, value: RC, ports: {N1: Y, N2: GND}\n  - Q1: PNP transistor, ports: {C: Y, B: X, E: VCC}\n- Additional Info: The circuit is a PNP transistor stage with resistive divider biasing.

The base current (IB) is drawn from VThev through RThev. The collector current (IC) flows through RC to ground. The emitter is connected to VCC.\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 5.25 (a): PNP stage with resistive divider biasing, (b): Thevenin equivalent of divider and $V_{C C}$.\n\nSolution: Generally, assuming significant $I_{B}$, we construct the Thevenin equivalent of the voltage divider as shown in Fig. 5.25(b):\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{\\text {Thev }} & =\\frac{R_{1}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} V_{C C}  \\tag{5.95}\\\\\nR_{\\text {Thev }} & =R_{1} \\| R_{2} \\tag{5.96}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nAdding the voltage drops across $R_{\\text {Thev }}$ and $V_{E B}$ to $V_{\\text {Thev }}$ results in\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {Thev }}+I_{B} R_{\\text {Thev }}+V_{E B}=V_{C C} \\tag{5.97}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nyielding\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{B} & =\\frac{V_{C C}-V_{T h e v}-V_{E B}}{R_{T h e v}}  \\tag{5.98}\\\\\n& =\\frac{\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} V_{C C}-V_{E B}}{R_{\\text {Thev }}} \\tag{5.99}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C}=\\beta \\frac{\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} V_{C C}-V_{E B}}{R_{T h e v}} \\tag{5.100}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAs in Example 5.9, iteration between $I_{C}$ and $V_{E B}$ may be necessary. Equation (5.100) shows that significant $I_{B}$ makes the transistor bias highly dependent on $\\beta$. Conversely, if $I_{B} \\ll I_{1}$, equating the voltage drop across $R_{2}$ to $V_{E B}$ gives the collector current:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} V_{C C} & =V_{E B}  \\tag{5.101}\\\\\nI_{C} & =I_{S} \\exp \\left(\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} \\frac{V_{C C}}{V_{T}}\\right) \\tag{5.102}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nNote that this result matches Eq. (5.30).\nExercise: What is the maximum $R_{C}$ value if $Q_{1}$ must remain in soft saturation?\n\nExample 5.17:\nAssuming negligible base current, calculate the collector current and voltage of $Q_{1}$ in the Fig. 5.26 circuit. What is the maximum allowable $R_{C}$ for $Q_{1}$ to operate in the forward active region?\nImage Description: Figure 5.26\n- Component Details:\n  - R1: Resistor, value: R1, ports: {N1: X, N2: GND}\n  - R2: Resistor, value: R2, ports: {N1: VCC, N2: X}\n  - RE: Resistor, value: RE, ports: {N1: VCC, N2: E1}\n  - RC: Resistor, value: RC, ports: {N1: Y, N2: GND}\n  - Q1: PNP transistor, ports: {C: Y, B: X, E: E1}\n- Additional Info: This circuit is a PNP transistor stage with a degeneration resistor RE. The circuit is powered by VCC and uses resistors R1 and R2 to set the base voltage. The collector current IC flows through RC to ground.\n\nFigure 5.26: PNP stage with degeneration resistor.\n\nSolution:\nWith $I_{B} \\ll I_{1}$, we have $V_{X}=V_{C C} R_{1} /\\left(R_{1}+R_{2}\\right)$. Adding $V_{X}$, the emitter-base voltage, and the drop across $R_{E}$, we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{X}+V_{E B}+R_{E} I_{E}=V_{C C} \\tag{5.103}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nresulting in\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{E}=\\frac{1}{R_{E}}\\left(\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} V_{C C}-V_{E B}\\right) \\tag{5.104}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nUsing $I_{C} \\approx I_{E}$, we can compute a new $V_{E B}$ value and iterate if needed. Also, with $I_{B}=I_{C} / \\beta$, we can verify the $I_{B} \\ll I_{1}$ assumption.\n\nIn deriving Eq. (5.104), we wrote a KVL from $V_{C C}$ to ground, Eq. (5.103). A simpler approach is to recognize that the voltage drop across $R_{2}$ equals $V_{E B}+I_{E} R_{E}$, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{C C} \\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}=V_{E B}+I_{E} R_{E} \\tag{5.105}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nyielding the same result as Eq. (5.104).\nThe maximum allowable $R_{C}$ is found by equating base and collector voltages:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{C C} \\frac{R_{1}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} & =R_{C, \\max } I_{C}  \\tag{5.106}\\\\\n& \\approx \\frac{R_{C, \\max }}{R_{E}}\\left(\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} V_{C C}-V_{E B}\\right) \\tag{5.107}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nresulting in\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{C, \\max }=R_{E} V_{C C} \\frac{R_{1}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} V_{C C}-V_{E B}} \\tag{5.108}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nExercise: Repeat the above example if $R_{2}=\\infty$.\n\nExample: Determine the collector current and voltage of $Q_{1}$ in the self-biased circuit of Fig. 5.27.\nImage Description: Figure 5.27\n- Component Details:\n  - Q1: PNP transistor, ports: {C: VCC, B: X, E: Y}\n  - RB: Resistor, value: RB, ports: {N1: X, N2: Y}\n  - RC: Resistor, value: RC, ports: {N1: Y, N2: GND}\n- Additional Info: This circuit is a self-biased PNP transistor stage. The collector is connected to VCC, and the emitter is connected through RC to ground. The base is connected to node X through RB.\n\nFigure 5.27: Self-biased pnp stage.\n\nSolution: We must write a KVL from $V_{C C}$ through the emitter-base junction of $Q_{1}$, $R_{B}$, and $R_{C}$ to ground. Since $\\beta \\gg 1$ and hence $I_{C} \\gg I_{B}$, $R_{C}$ carries a current approximately equal to $I_{C}$, creating $V_{Y}=R_{C} I_{C}$. Moreover, $V_{X}=R_{B} I_{B}+V_{Y}=R_{B} I_{B}+R_{C} I_{C}$, yielding\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{C C} & =V_{E B}+V_{X}  \\tag{5.109}\\\\\n& =V_{E B}+R_{B} I_{B}+I_{C} R_{C}  \\tag{5.110}\\\\\n& =V_{E B}+\\left(\\frac{R_{B}}{\\beta}+R_{C}\\right) I_{C} \\tag{5.111}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C}=\\frac{V_{C C}-V_{E B}}{\\frac{R_{B}}{\\beta}+R_{C}} \\tag{5.112}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\na result similar to Eq. (5.78). As usual, we start with a $V_{E B}$ guess, compute $I_{C}$, and determine a new $V_{E B}$ value, etc. Note that, since the base is higher than the collector voltage, $Q_{1}$ always remains in the active mode.\n\nExercise: How close is $Q_{1}$ to saturation?"
