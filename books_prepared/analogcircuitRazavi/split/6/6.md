# Physics of MOS Transistors

Today's field of microelectronics is dominated by a type of device called the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET). Conceived in the 1930s but first realized in the 1960s, MOSFETs (also called MOS devices) offer unique properties that have led to the revolution of the semiconductor industry. This revolution has culminated in microprocessors having 100 million transistors, memory chips containing billions of transistors, and sophisticated communication circuits providing tremendous signal processing capability.

Our treatment of MOS devices and circuits follows the same procedure as that taken in Chapters 2 and 3 for $p n$ junctions. In this chapter, we analyze the structure and operation of MOSFETs, seeking models that prove useful in circuit design. In Chapter 7, we utilize the models to study MOS amplifier topologies. The outline below illustrates the sequence of concepts covered in this chapter.

## 6.1 STRUCTURE OF MOSFET

Recall from Chapter 5 that any voltage-controlled current source can provide signal amplification. MOSFETs also behave as such controlled sources but their characteristics are different from those of bipolar transistors.

In order to arrive at the structure of the MOSFET, we begin with a simple geometry consisting of a conductive (e.g., metal) plate, an insulator ("dielectric"), and a doped
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d14406c858dcab7c2524g-41.jpg?height=795&width=2889&top_left_y=413&top_left_x=930)

piece of silicon. Illustrated in Fig. 6.1(a), such a structure operates as a capacitor because the p-type silicon is somewhat conductive, "mirroring" any charge deposited on the top plate.

What happens if a potential difference is applied as shown in Fig. 6.1(b)? As positive charge is placed on the top plate, it attracts negative charge, e.g., electrons, from the piece of silicon. (Even though doped with acceptors, the p-type silicon does contain a small number of electrons.) We therefore observe that a "channel" of free electrons may be created at the interface between the insulator and the piece of silicon, potentially serving as a good conductive path if the electron density is sufficiently high. The key point here is that the density of electrons in the channel varies with $V_{1}$, as evident from $Q=C V$, where $C$ denotes the capacitance between the two plates.

The dependence of the electron density upon $V_{1}$ leads to an interesting property: if, as depicted in Fig. 6.1(c), we allow a current to flow from left to right through the silicon material, $V_{1}$ can control the current by adjusting the resistivity of the channel. (Note that the current prefers to take the path of least resistance, thus flowing primarily through the channel rather than through the entire body of silicon.) This will serve our objective of building a voltage-controlled current source.

Equation $Q=C V$ suggests that, to achieve a strong control of $Q$ by $V$, the value of $C$ must be maximized, for example, by reducing the thickness of the dielectric layer separating the two plates. ${ }^{1}$ The ability of silicon fabrication technology to produce extremely thin but uniform dielectric layers (with thicknesses below $20 \AA$ today) has proven essential to the rapid advancement of microelectronic devices.

The foregoing thoughts lead to the MOSFET structure shown in Fig. 6.2(a) as a candidate for an amplifying device. Called the "gate" $(\mathrm{G})$, the top conductive plate resides on a thin dielectric (insulator) layer, which itself is deposited on the underlying $p$-type silicon "substrate." To allow current flow through the silicon material, two contacts are attached to the substrate through two heavily-doped $n$-type regions because direct connection of metal to the substrate would not produce a good "ohmic" contact. ${ }^{2}$ These two terminals are called "source" (S) and "drain" (D) to indicate that the former can provide charge carriers and the latter can absorb them. Figure 6.2(a) reveals that the device is symmetric with respect to S and D ; i.e., depending on the voltages applied to the device, either of

these two terminals can drain the charge carriers from the other. As explained in Section 6.2 , with $n$-type source/drain and $p$-type substrate, this transistor operates with electrons rather than holes and is therefore called an $n$-type MOS (NMOS) device. (The $p$-type counterpart is studied in Section 6.4.) We draw the device as shown in Fig. 6.2(b) for simplicity. Figure 6.2(c) depicts the circuit symbol for an NMOS transistor, wherein the arrow signifies the source terminal.

Before delving into the operation of the MOSFET, let us consider the types of materials used in the device. The gate plate must serve as a good conductor and was in fact realized by metal (aluminum) in the early generations of MOS technology. However, it was discovered that noncrystalline silicon ("polysilicon" or simply "poly") with heavy doping (for low resistivity) exhibits better fabrication and physical properties. Thus, today's MOSFETs employ polysilicon gates.

The dielectric layer sandwiched between the gate and the substrate plays a critical role in the performance of transistors and is created by growing silicon dioxide (or simply

"oxide") on top of the silicon area. The $n^{+}$regions are sometimes called source/drain "diffusion," referring to a fabrication method used in early days of microelectronics. We should also remark that these regions in fact form diodes with the $p$-type substrate (Fig. 6.3). As explained later, proper operation of the transistor requires that these junctions remain reverse-biased. Thus, only the depletion region capacitance associated with the two diodes must be taken into account. Figure 6.3 shows some of the device dimensions in today's state-of-the-art MOS technologies. The oxide thickness is denoted by $t_{o x}$.

## 6.2 OPERATION OF MOSFET

This section deals with a multitude of concepts related to MOSFETs. The outline is shown in Fig. 6.4.

### 6.2.1 Qualitative Analysis

Our study of the simple structures shown in Figs. 6.1 and 6.2 suggests that the MOSFET may conduct current between the source and drain if a channel of electrons is created by making the gate voltage sufficiently positive. Moreover, we expect that the magnitude of the current can be controlled by the gate voltage. Our analysis will indeed confirm these conjectures while revealing other subtle effects in the device. Note that the gate terminal draws no (low-frequency) current as it is insulated from the channel by the oxide.

Since the MOSFET contains three terminals, ${ }^{3}$ we may face many combinations of terminal voltages and currents. Fortunately, with the (low-frequency) gate current being zero, the only current of interest is that flowing between the source and the drain. We must study the dependence of this current upon the gate voltage (e.g., for a constant drain voltage) and upon the drain voltage (e.g., for a constant gate voltage). These concepts become clearer below.

Let us first consider the arrangement shown in Fig. 6.5(a), where the source and drain are grounded and the gate voltage is varied. This circuit does not appear partic-

Did you know?

The concept of MOSFET was proposed by Julins Edgar Lilienfeld in 1925, decades before the invention of the bipolar transistor. But why did it take until the 1960s for the MOS transistor to be successfully fabricated? The critical issue was the oxide-silicon interface. In initial attempts, this interface contained many "surface states," trapping the charge carriers and leading to poor conduction. As semiconductor technology advanced and "clean rooms" were invented for fabrication, the oxide could be grown on silicon with almost no surface states, yielding a high transconductance.
ularly useful but it gives us a great deal of insight. Recall from Fig. 6.1(b) that, as $V_{G}$ rises, the positive charge on the gate must be mirrored by negative charge in the substrate. While we stated in Section 6.1 that electrons are attracted to the interface, in reality, another phenomenon precedes the formation of the channel. As $V_{G}$ increases from zero, the positive charge on the gate repels the holes in the substrate, thereby exposing negative ions and creating a depletion region [Fig. 6.5(b)]. ${ }^{4}$

[^9]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d14406c858dcab7c2524g-44.jpg?height=1662&width=2627&top_left_y=550&top_left_x=964)

Figure 6.5 (a) MOSFET with gate voltage, (b) formation of depletion region, (c) formation of channel.

Note that the device still acts as a capacitor-positive charge on the gate is mirrored by negative charge in the substrate-but no channel of mobile charge is created yet. Thus, no current can flow from the source to the drain. We say the MOSFET is off.

Can the source-substrate and drain-substrate junctions carry current in this mode? To avoid this effect, the substrate itself is also tied to zero, ensuring that these diodes are not forward-biased. For simplicity, we do not show this connection in the diagrams.

What happens as $V_{G}$ increases? To mirror the charge on the gate, more negative ions are exposed and the depletion region under the oxide becomes deeper. Does this mean the transistor never turns on?! Fortunately, if $V_{G}$ becomes sufficiently positive, free electrons are attracted to the oxide-silicon interface, forming a conductive channel [Fig. 6.5(c)]. We say the MOSFET is on. The gate potential at which the channel begins to appear is called the "threshold voltage," $V_{T H}$, and falls in the range of 300 mV to 500 mV . Note that the electrons are readily provided by the $n^{+}$source and drain regions, and need not be supplied by the substrate.

It is interesting to recognize that the gate terminal of the MOSFET draws no (lowfrequency) current. Resting on top of the oxide, the gate remains insulated from other terminals and simply operates as a plate of a capacitor.

MOSFET as a Variable Resistor The conductive channel between S and D can be viewed as a resistor. Furthermore, since the density of electrons in the channel must increase as $V_{G}$ becomes more positive (why?), the value of this resistor changes with the gate voltage. Conceptually illustrated in Fig. 6.6, such a voltage-dependent resistor proves extremely useful in analog and digital circuits.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d14406c858dcab7c2524g-44.jpg?height=389&width=835&top_left_y=4657&top_left_x=1877)

Figure 6.6 MOSFET viewed as a voltage-dependent resistor.

Example
6.1

In the vicinity of a wireless base station, the signal received by a cellphone may become very strong, possibly "saturating" the circuits and prohibiting proper operation. Devise a variable-gain circuit that lowers the signal level as the cellphone approaches the base station.

Solution A MOSFET can form a voltage-controlled attenuator along with a resistor as shown in Fig. 6.7.

Since

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{\text {out }}}{v_{\text {in }}}=\frac{R_{1}}{R_{M}+R_{1}} \tag{6.1}
\end{equation*}
$$

the output signal becomes smaller as $V_{\text {cont }}$ falls because the density of electrons in the channel decreases and $R_{M}$ rises. MOSFETs are commonly utilized as voltage-dependent resistors in "variable-gain amplifiers."
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d14406c858dcab7c2524g-45.jpg?height=595&width=1085&top_left_y=2237&top_left_x=1849)

Figure 6.7 Use of MOSFET to adjust signal levels.
Exercise What happens to $R_{M}$ if the channel length is doubled?

In the arrangement of Fig. 6.5(c), no current flows between S and D because the two terminals are at the same potential. We now raise the drain voltage as shown in Fig. 6.8(a) and examine the drain current ( $=$ source current). If $V_{G}<V_{T H}$, no channel exists, the device is off, and $I_{D}=0$ regardless of the value of $V_{D}$. On the other hand, if $V_{G}>V_{T H}$, then $I_{D}>0$ [Fig. 6.8(b)]. In fact, the source-drain path may act as a simple resistor, yielding the $I_{D}-V_{D}$ characteristic shown in Fig. 6.8(c). The slope of the characteristic is equal to $1 / R_{\text {on }}$, where $R_{\text {on }}$ denotes the "on-resistance" of the transistor. ${ }^{5}$

Our brief treatment of the MOS I-V characteristics thus far points to two different views of the operation: in Fig. 6.8(b), $V_{G}$ is varied while $V_{D}$ remains constant whereas in Fig. 6.8(c), $V_{D}$ is varied while $V_{G}$ remains constant. Each view provides valuable insight into the operation of the transistor.

How does the characteristic of Fig. 6.8(b) change if $V_{G}$ increases? The higher density of electrons in the channel lowers the on-resistance, yielding a greater slope. Depicted in Fig. 6.8(d), the resulting characteristics strengthen the notion of voltage-dependent resistance.

Figure 6.8 (a) MOSFET with gate and drain voltages, (b) $I_{D}-V_{G}$ characteristic, (c) $I_{D}-V_{D}$ characteristic, (d) $I_{D}-V_{D}$ characteristics for various gate voltages

Recall from Chapter 2 that charge flow in semiconductors occurs by diffusion or drift. How about the transport mechanism in a MOSFET? Since the voltage source tied to the drain creates an electric field along the channel, the current results from the drift of charge.

The $I_{D}-V_{G}$ and $I_{D^{-}}-V_{D}$ characteristics shown in Figs. 6.8 (b) and (c), respectively, play a central role in our understanding of MOS devices. The following example reinforces the concepts studied thus far.

Sketch the $I_{D}-V_{G}$ and $I_{D}-V_{D}$ characteristics for (a) different channel lengths, and (b) different oxide thicknesses.

Solution As the channel length increases, so does the on-resistance. ${ }^{6}$ Thus, for $V_{G}>V_{T H}$, the drain current begins with lesser values as the channel length increases [Fig. 6.9(a)]. Similarly, $I_{D}$ exhibits a smaller slope as a function of $V_{D}$ [Fig. 6.9(b)]. It is therefore desirable to minimize the channel length so as to achieve large drain currents-an important trend in the MOS technology development.

How does the oxide thickness, $t_{\text {os }}$, affect the 1-V characteristics? As $t_{\text {our }}$ increases, the capacitance between the gate and the silicon substrate decreases. Thus, from $Q=C V$, we note that a given voltage results in less charge on the gate and hence a lower electron density in the channel. Consequently, the device suffers from a higher on-resistance, producing less drain current for a given gate voltage [Fig. 6.9(c)] or drain voltage [Fig. 6.9(d)]. For this reason, the semiconductor industry has continued to reduce the gate oxide thickness.
${ }^{\text {s }}$ Recall that the resistance of a conductor is proportional to the length.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d14406c858dcab7c2524g-47.jpg?height=1343&width=2256&top_left_y=436&top_left_x=1258)

Exercise The current conduction in the channel is in the form of drift. If the mobility falls at high temperatures, what can we say about the on-resistance as the temperature goes up?

While both the length and the oxide thickness affect the performance of MOSFETs, only the former is under the circuit designer's control, i.e., it can be specified in the "layout" of the transistor. The latter, on the other hand, is defined during fabrication and remains constant for all transistors in a given generation of the technology.

Another MOS parameter controlled by circuit designers is the width of the transistor, the dimension perpendicular to the length [Fig. 6.10(a)]. We therefore observe that
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d14406c858dcab7c2524g-47.jpg?height=544&width=1702&top_left_y=3421&top_left_x=1546)

"lateral" dimensions such as $L$ and $W$ can be chosen by circuit designers whereas "vertical" dimensions such as $t_{o x}$ cannot.

How does the gate width impact the I-V characteristics? As $W$ increases, so does the width of the channel, thus lowering the resistance between the source and the drain ${ }^{7}$ and yielding the trends depicted in Fig. 6.10(b). From another perspective, a wider device can be viewed as two narrower transistors in parallel, producing a high drain current [Fig. 6.10(c)]. We may then surmise that $W$ must be maximized, but we must also note that the total gate capacitance increases with $W$, possibly limiting the speed of the circuit. Thus, the width of each device in the circuit must be chosen carefully.

Channel Pinch-Off Our qualitative study of the MOSFET thus far implies that the device acts as a voltage-dependent resistor if the gate voltage exceeds $V_{T H}$. In reality, however, the transistor operates as a current source if the drain voltage is sufficiently positive. To understand this effect, we make two observations: (1) to form a channel, the potential difference between the gate and the oxide-silicon interface must exceed $V_{T H}$; (2) if the drain voltage remains higher than the source voltage, then the voltage at each point along the channel with respect to ground increases as we go from the source towards the drain. Illustrated in Fig. 6.11(a), this effect arises from the gradual voltage drop along the channel resistance. Since the gate voltage is constant (because the gate is conductive but carries no current in any direction), and since the potential at the oxide-silicon interface rises from the source to the drain, the potential difference between the gate and the oxide-silicon interface decreases along the $x$-axis [Fig. 6.11(b)]. The density of electrons in the channel follows the same trend, falling to a minimum at $x=L$ 。
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d14406c858dcab7c2524g-48.jpg?height=1286&width=1377&top_left_y=2873&top_left_x=1081)

Figure 6.12 (a) Pinchoff, (b) variation of length with drain voltage, (c) detailed operation near the drain.

From these observations, we conclude that, if the drain voltage is high enough to produce $V_{G}-V_{D} \leq V_{T H}$, then the channel ceases to exist near the drain. We say the gatesubstrate potential difference is not sufficient at $x=L$ to attract electrons and the channel is "pinched off" [Fig. 6.12(a)].

What happens if $V_{D}$ rises even higher than $V_{G}-V_{T H}$ ? Since $V(x)$ now goes from 0 at $x=0$ to $V_{D}>V_{G}-V_{T H}$ at $x=L$, the voltage difference between the gate and the substrate falls to $V_{T H}$ at some point $L_{1}<L$ [Fig. 6.12(b)]. The device therefore contains no channel between $L_{1}$ and $L$. Does this mean the transistor cannot conduct current? No, the device still conducts: as illustrated in Fig. 6.12(c), once the electrons reach the end of the channel, they experience the high electric field in the depletion region surrounding the drain junction and are rapidly swept to the drain terminal. Nonetheless, as shown in the next section, the drain voltage no longer affects the current significantly, and the MOSFET acts as a constant current source-similar to a bipolar transistor in the forward active region. Note that the source-substrate and drain-substrate junctions carry no current.

### 6.2.2 Derivation of I-V Characteristics

With the foregoing qualitative study, we can now formulate the behavior of MOSFETs in terms of their terminal voltages.

Channel Charge Density Our derivations require an expression for the channel charge (i.e., free electrons) per unit length, also called the "charge density." From $Q=C V$, we note
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d14406c858dcab7c2524g-50.jpg?height=440&width=1707&top_left_y=859&top_left_x=1441)

Figure 6.13 Illustration of capacitance per unit length.
that if $C$ is the gate capacitance per unit length and $V$ the voltage difference between the gate and the channel, then $Q$ is the desired charge density. Denoting the gate capacitance per unit area by $C_{o x}$ (expressed in $\mathrm{F} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ or $\mathrm{fF} / \mu \mathrm{m}^{2}$ ), we write $C=W C_{o x}$ to account for the width of the transistor (Fig. 6.13). Moreover, we have $V=V_{G S}-V_{T H}$ because no mobile charge exists for $V_{G S}<V_{T H}$. (Hereafter, we denote both the gate and drain voltages with respect to the source.) It follows that

$$
\begin{equation*}
Q=W C_{o x}\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\right) . \tag{6.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

Note that $Q$ is expressed in coulomb/meter. Now recall from Fig. 6.11(a) that the channel voltage varies along the length of the transistor, and the charge density falls as we go from the source to the drain. Thus, Eq. (6.2) is valid only near the source terminal, where the channel potential remains close to zero. As shown in Fig. 6.14, we denote the channel potential at $x$ by $V(x)$ and write

$$
\begin{equation*}
Q(x)=W C_{o x}\left[V_{G S}-V(x)-V_{T H}\right], \tag{6.3}
\end{equation*}
$$

noting that $V(x)$ goes from zero to $V_{D}$ if the channel is not pinched off.

Drain Current What is the relationship between the mobile charge density and the current? Consider a bar of semiconductor having a uniform charge density (per unit length) equal to $Q$ and carrying a current $I$ (Fig. 6.15). Note from Chapter 2 that (1) $I$ is given by the total charge that passes through the cross section of the bar in one second, and (2) if the carriers move with a velocity of $v \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$, then the charge enclosed in $v$ meters along the bar passes through the cross section in one second. Since the charge enclosed in $v$ meters is equal to $Q \cdot v$, we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
I=Q \cdot v . \tag{6.4}
\end{equation*}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d14406c858dcab7c2524g-50.jpg?height=754&width=1240&top_left_y=4492&top_left_x=1663)

Figure 6.15 Relationship between charge velocity and current.

As explained in Chapter 2,

$$
\begin{align*}
v & =-\mu_{n} E  \tag{6.5}\\
& =+\mu_{n} \frac{d V}{d x} \tag{6.6}
\end{align*}
$$

where $d V / d x$ denotes the derivative of the voltage at a given point. Combining Eqs. (6.3), (6.4), and (6.6), we obtain

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{D}=W C_{o x}\left[V_{G S}-V(x)-V_{T H}\right] \mu_{n} \frac{d V(x)}{d x} . \tag{6.7}
\end{equation*}
$$

Interestingly, since $I_{D}$ must remain constant along the channel (why?), $V(x)$ and $d V / d x$ must vary such that the product of $V_{G S}-V(x)-V_{T H}$ and $d V / d x$ is independent of $x$.

While it is possible to solve the above differential equation to obtain $V(x)$ in terms of $I_{D}$ (and the reader is encouraged to do that), our immediate need is to find an expression for $I_{D}$ in terms of the terminal voltages. To this end, we write

$$
\begin{equation*}
\int_{x=0}^{x=L} I_{D} d x=\int_{V(x)=0}^{V(x)=V_{D S}} \mu_{n} C_{o x} W\left[V_{G S}-V(x)-V_{T H}\right] d V . \tag{6.8}
\end{equation*}
$$

That is,

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{D}=\frac{1}{2} \mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}\left[2\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\right) V_{D S}-V_{D S}^{2}\right] . \tag{6.9}
\end{equation*}
$$

We now examine this important equation from different perspectives to gain more insight. First, the linear dependence of $I_{D}$ upon $\mu_{n}, C_{o x}$, and $W / L$ is to be expected: a higher mobility yields a greater current for a given drain-source voltage; a higher gate oxide capacitance leads to a larger electron density in the channel for a given gate-source voltage; and a larger $W / L$ (called the device "aspect ratio") is equivalent to placing more transistors in parallel [Fig. 6.10(c)]. Second, for a constant $V_{G S}, I_{D}$ varies parabolically with $V_{D S}$ (Fig. 6.16), reaching a maximum of

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{D, \max }=\frac{1}{2} \mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\right)^{2} \tag{6.10}
\end{equation*}
$$

at $V_{D S}=V_{G S}-V_{T H}$. It is common to write $W / L$ as the ratio of two values e.g., $5 \mu \mathrm{~m} / 0.18 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ (rather than 27.8) to emphasize the choice of $W$ and $L$. While only the

Figure 6.16 Parabolic $I_{D}-V_{D S}$ characteristic.
ratio appears in many MOS equations, the individual values of $W$ and $L$ also become critical in most cases. For example, if both $W$ and $L$ are doubled, the ratio remains unchanged but the gate capacitance increases.

Example Plot the $I_{D}-V_{D S}$ characteristics for different values of $V_{G S}$.

Solution As $V_{G S}$ increases, so do $I_{D, \max }$ and $V_{G S}-V_{T H}$. Illustrated in Fig. 6.17, the characteristics exhibit maxima that follow a parabolic shape themselves because $I_{D, \max } \propto\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\right)^{2}$.

Exercise What happens to the above plots if $t_{o x}$ is halved?

The nonlinear relationship between $I_{D}$ and $V_{D S}$ reveals that the transistor cannot generally be modeled as a simple linear resistor. However, if $V_{D S} \ll 2\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\right)$, Eq. (6.9) reduces to:

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{D} \approx \mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\right) V_{D S} \tag{6.11}
\end{equation*}
$$

exhibiting a linear $I_{D}-V_{D S}$ behavior for a given $V_{G S}$. In fact, the equivalent on-resistance is given by $V_{D S} / I_{D}$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{o n}=\frac{1}{\mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\right)} . \tag{6.12}
\end{equation*}
$$

From another perspective, at small $V_{D S}$ (near the origin), the parabolas in Fig. 6.17 can be approximated by straight lines having different slopes (Fig. 6.18).

As predicted in Section 6.2.1, Eq. (6.12) suggests that the on-resistance can be controlled by the gate-source voltage. In particular, for $V_{G S}=V_{T H}, R_{o n}=\infty$, i.e., the device can operate as an electronic switch.

A cordless telephone incorporates a single antenna for reception and transmission. Explain how the system must be configured.

Solution The system is designed so that the phone receives for half of the time and transmits for the other half. Thus, the antenna is alternately connected to the receiver and the transmitter in regular intervals, e.g., every 20 ms (Fig. 6.19). An electronic antenna switch is therefore necessary here. ${ }^{8}$

Exercise
Some systems employ two antennas, each of which receives and transmits signals. How many switches are needed?

[^12]In most applications, it is desirable to achieve a low on-resistance for MOS switches. The circuit designer must therefore maximize $W / L$ and $V_{G S}$. The following example illustrates this point.

Example In the cordless phone of Example 6.4, the switch connecting the transmitter to the 6.5 antenna must negligibly attenuate the signal, e.g., by no more than $10 \%$. If $V_{D D}=1.8 \mathrm{~V}$, $\mu_{n} C_{o x}=100 \mu \mathrm{~A} / \mathrm{V}^{2}$, and $V_{T H}=0.4 \mathrm{~V}$, determine the minimum required aspect ratio of the switch. Assume the antenna can be modeled as a $50-\Omega$ resistor.

Solution As depicted in Fig. 6.20, we wish to ensure

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{V_{\text {out }}}{V_{\text {in }}} \geq 0.9 \tag{6.13}
\end{equation*}
$$

and hence

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{o n} \leq 5.6 \Omega \tag{6.14}

Setting $V_{G S}$ to the maximum value, $V_{D D}$, we obtain from Eq. (6.12),

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{W}{L} \geq 1276 \tag{6.15}
\end{equation*}
$$

(Since wide transistors introduce substantial capacitance in the signal path, this choice of $W / L$ may still attenuate high-frequency signals.)

Exercise What $W / L$ is necessary if $V_{D D}$ drops to 1.2 V ?

Triode and Saturation Regions Equation (6.9) expresses the drain current in terms of the device terminal voltages, implying that the current begins to fall for $V_{D S}>V_{G S}-V_{T H}$. We say the device operates in the "triode region" (also called the "linear region") if $V_{D S}<V_{G S}-V_{T H}$ (the rising section of the parabola). We also use the term "deep triode region" for $V_{D S} \ll 2\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\right)$, where the transistor operates as a resistor.

Figure 6.21 Overall MOS characteristic.

In reality, the drain current reaches "saturation," that is, becomes constant for $V_{D S}>V_{G S}-V_{T H}$ (Fig. 6.21). To understand why, recall from Fig. 6.12 that the channel experiences pinch-off if $V_{D S}=V_{G S}-V_{T H}$. Thus, further increase in $V_{D S}$ simply shifts the pinch-off point slightly toward the drain. Also, recall that Eqs. (6.7) and (6.8) are valid only where channel charge exists. It follows that the integration in Eq. (6.8) must encompass only the channel, i.e., from $x=0$ to $x=L_{1}$ in Fig. 6.12(b), and be modified to

$$
\begin{align*}
\int_{x=0}^{x=L_{1}} I_{D} d x= & \int_{V(x)=0}^{V(x)=V_{G S}-V_{T H}} \mu_{n} C_{o x} W\left[V_{G S}\right. \\
& \left.-V(x)-V_{T H}\right] d V . \tag{6.16}
\end{align*}
$$

Note that the upper limits correspond to the channel pinch-off point. In particular, the integral on the right-hand side is evaluated up to $V_{G S}-V_{T H}$ rather than $V_{D S}$. Consequently,

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{D}=\frac{1}{2} \mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L_{1}}\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\right)^{2}, \tag{6.17}
\end{equation*}
$$

a result independent of $V_{D S}$ and identical to $I_{D, \max }$ in Eq. (6.10) if we assume $L_{1} \approx L$. Called the "overdrive voltage," the quantity $V_{G S}-V_{T H}$ plays a key role in MOS circuits. MOSFETs are sometimes called "squarelaw" devices to emphasize the relationship between $I_{D}$ and the overdrive. For the sake of brevity, we hereafter denote $L_{1}$ with $L$.

The I-V characteristic of Fig. 6.21 resembles that of bipolar devices, with the triode and saturation regions in MOSFETs appearing similar to saturation and forward active regions in bipolar transistors, respectively. It is unfortunate that the term "saturation" refers to completely different regions in MOS and bipolar I-V characteristics.

We employ the conceptual illustration in Fig. 6.22 to determine the region of operation. Note that the gate-drain potential difference suits this purpose and we need not compute the gate-source and gate-drain voltages separately.

Did you know?

The explosive growth of MOS technology is attributed to two factors: the ability to shrink the dimensions of the MOS device ( $W, L$, tox, etc.) and the ability to integrate a greater number of MOS devices on a chip each year. The latter trend was predicted by one of Intel's founders, Gordon Moore, in 1965. He observed that the number of transistors per chip doubled every two years. Indeed, starting with 50 devices per chip in 1965, we now have reached tens of billions on memory chips and several billion on microprocessor chips. Can you think of any other product in human history that has grown so much so fast (except for Bill Gates' wealth)?

Figure 6.22 Illustration of triode and saturation regions based on the gate and drain voltages.

Exhibiting a "flat" current in the saturation region, a MOSFET can operate as a current source having a value given by Eq. (6.17). Furthermore, the square-law dependence of $I_{D}$ upon $V_{G S}-V_{T H}$ suggests that the device can act as a voltage-controlled current source.

Example Calculate the bias current of $M_{1}$ in Fig. 6.23. Assume $\mu_{n} C_{o x}=100 \mu \mathrm{~A} / \mathrm{V}^{2}$ and $V_{T H}=$ 6.6 0.4 V . If the gate voltage increases by 10 mV , what is the change in the drain voltage?
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d14406c858dcab7c2524g-56.jpg?height=703&width=788&top_left_y=2936&top_left_x=1872)

Figure 6.23 Simple MOS circuit.

Solution It is unclear a priori in which region $M_{1}$ operates. Let us assume $M_{1}$ is saturated and proceed. Since $V_{G S}=1 \mathrm{~V}$,

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{D} & =\frac{1}{2} \mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\right)^{2}  \tag{6.18}\\
& =200 \mu \mathrm{~A} . \tag{6.19}
\end{align*}
$$

We must check our assumption by calculating the drain potential:

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{X} & =V_{D D}-R_{D} I_{D}  \tag{6.20}\\
& =0.8 \mathrm{~V} \tag{6.21}
\end{align*}
$$

The drain voltage is lower than the gate voltage, but by less than $V_{T H}$. The illustration in Fig. 6.22 therefore indicates that $M_{1}$ indeed operates in saturation.

If the gate voltage increases to 1.01 V , then

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{D}=206.7 \mu \mathrm{~A} \tag{6.22}
\end{equation*}
$$

lowering $V_{X}$ to

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{X}=0.766 \mathrm{~V} \tag{6.23}
\end{equation*}
$$

Fortunately, $M_{1}$ is still saturated. The $34-\mathrm{mV}$ change in $V_{X}$ reveals that the circuit can amplify the input.

Exercise What choice of $R_{D}$ places the transistor at the edge of the triode region?

It is instructive to identify several points of contrast between bipolar and MOS devices. (1) A bipolar transistor with $V_{B E}=V_{C E}$ resides at the edge of the active region whereas a MOSFET approaches the edge of saturation if its drain voltage falls below its gate voltage by $V_{T H}$. (2) Bipolar devices exhibit an exponential $I_{C}-V_{B E}$ characteristic while MOSFETs display a square-law dependence. That is, the former provide a greater transconductance than the latter (for a given bias current). (3) In bipolar circuits, most transistors have the same dimensions and hence the same $I_{S}$, whereas in MOS circuits, the aspect ratio of each device may be chosen differently to satisfy the design requirements. (4) The gate of MOSFETs draws no bias current. ${ }^{9}$

Example Determine the value of $W / L$ in Fig. 6.23 that places $M_{1}$ at the edge of saturation and calculate the drain voltage change for a 1-mV change at the gate. Assume $V_{T H}=0.4 \mathrm{~V}$.

Solution With $V_{G S}=+1 \mathrm{~V}$, the drain voltage must fall to $V_{G S}-V_{T H}=0.6 \mathrm{~V}$ for $M_{1}$ to enter the triode region. That is,

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{D} & =\frac{V_{D D}-V_{D S}}{R_{D}}  \tag{6.24}\\
& =240 \mu \mathrm{~A} . \tag{6.25}
\end{align*}
$$

Since $I_{D}$ scales linearly with $W / L$,

$$
\begin{align*}
\left.\frac{W}{L}\right|_{\max } & =\frac{240 \mu \mathrm{~A}}{200 \mu \mathrm{~A}} \cdot \frac{2}{0.18}  \tag{6.26}\\
& =\frac{2.4}{0.18} \tag{6.27}
\end{align*}
$$

If $V_{G S}$ increases by 1 mV ,

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{D}=248.04 \mu \mathrm{~A} \tag{6.28}
\end{equation*}
$$

changing $V_{X}$ by

$$
\begin{align*}
\Delta V_{X} & =\Delta I_{D} \cdot R_{D}  \tag{6.29}\\
& =4.02 \mathrm{mV} \tag{6.30}
\end{align*}
$$

The voltage gain is thus equal to 4.02 in this case.

Exercise Repeat the above example if $R_{D}$ is doubled.

Figure 6.24 Simple MOS circuit.

Solution At the edge of saturation, $V_{G S}-V_{T H}=V_{D S}=V_{D D}-R_{D} I_{D}$. Substituting for $I_{D}$ from Eq. (6.17) gives

V_{G S}-V_{T H}=V_{D D}-\frac{R_{D}}{2} \mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\right)^{2}, \tag{6.31}

and hence

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{G S}-V_{T H}=\frac{-1+\sqrt{1+2 R_{D} V_{D D} \mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}}}{R_{D} \mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}} \tag{6.32}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus,

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{G S}=\frac{-1+\sqrt{1+2 R_{D} V_{D D} \mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}}}{R_{D} \mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}}+V_{T H} \tag{6.33}
\end{equation*}
$$

### 6.2.3 Channel-Length Modulation

In our study of the pinch-off effect, we observed that the point at which the channel vanishes in fact moves toward the source as the drain voltage increases. In other words, the value of $L_{1}$ in Fig. 6.12(b) varies with $V_{D S}$ to some extent. Called "channel-length modulation" and illustrated in Fig. 6.25, this phenomenon yields a larger drain current as $V_{D S}$ increases because $I_{D} \propto 1 / L_{1}$ in Eq. (6.17). Similar to the Early effect in bipolar devices,
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d14406c858dcab7c2524g-58.jpg?height=686&width=2084&top_left_y=4378&top_left_x=1264)

Figure 6.25 Variation of $I_{D}$ in saturation region.
channel-length modulation results in a finite output impedance given by the inverse of the $I_{D}-V_{D S}$ slope in Fig. 6.25.

To account for channel-length modulation, we assume $L$ is constant, but multiply the right-hand side of Eq. (6.17) by a corrective term:

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{D}=\frac{1}{2} \mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\right)^{2}\left(1+\lambda V_{D S}\right), \tag{6.34}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\lambda$ is called the "channel-length modulation coefficient." While only an approximation, this linear dependence of $I_{D}$ upon $V_{D S}$ still provides a great deal of insight into the circuit design implications of channel-length modulation.

Unlike the Early effect in bipolar devices (Chapter 4), the amount of channel-length modulation is under the circuit designer's control. This is because $\lambda$ is inversely proportional to $L$ : for a longer channel, the relative change in $L$ (and hence in $I_{D}$ ) for a given change in $V_{D S}$ is smaller (Fig. 6.26). ${ }^{10}$ (By contrast, the base width of bipolar devices cannot be adjusted by the circuit designer, yielding a constant Early voltage for all transistors in a given technology.)

Figure 6.26 Channel-length modulation.

Example
6.9

Solution We write

$$
\begin{align*}
& I_{D 1}=\frac{1}{2} \mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\right)^{2}\left(1+\lambda V_{D S 1}\right)  \tag{6.35}\\
& I_{D 2}=\frac{1}{2} \mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\right)^{2}\left(1+\lambda V_{D S 2}\right) \tag{6.36}
\end{align*}
$$

and hence

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{D 2}=I_{D 1} \frac{1+\lambda V_{D S 2}}{1+\lambda V_{D S 1}} \tag{6.37}
\end{equation*}
$$

With $I_{D 1}=1 \mathrm{~mA}, V_{D S 1}=0.5 \mathrm{~V}, V_{D S 2}=1 \mathrm{~V}$, and $\lambda=0.1 \mathrm{~V}^{-1}$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{D 2}=1.048 \mathrm{~mA} \tag{6.38}
\end{equation*}
$$

[^14]The change in $I_{D}$ is therefore equal to $48 \mu \mathrm{~A}$, yielding an output impedance of

$$
\begin{align*}
r_{O} & =\frac{\Delta V_{D S}}{\Delta I_{D}}  \tag{6.39}\\
& =10.42 \mathrm{k} \Omega \tag{6.40}
\end{align*}
$$

Exercise Does $W$ affect the above results?

The above example reveals that channel-length modulation limits the output impedance of MOS current sources. The same effect was observed for bipolar current sources in Chapters 4 and 5.

Assuming $\lambda \propto 1 / L$, calculate $\Delta I_{D}$ and $r_{O}$ in Example 6.9 if both $W$ and $L$ are doubled.

Solution In Eqs. (6.35) and (6.36), $W / L$ remains unchanged but $\lambda$ drops to $0.05 \mathrm{~V}^{-1}$. Thus,

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{D 2} & =I_{D 1} \frac{1+\lambda V_{D S 2}}{1+\lambda V_{D S 1}}  \tag{6.41}\\
& =1.024 \mathrm{~mA} . \tag{6.42}
\end{align*}
$$

That is, $\Delta I_{D}=24 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ and

$$
\begin{equation*}
r_{O}=20.84 \mathrm{k} \Omega . \tag{6.43}
\end{equation*}
$$

Exercise What output impedance is achieved if $W$ and $L$ are quadrupled and $I_{D}$ is halved?

### 6.2.4 MOS Transconductance

As a voltage-controlled current source, a MOS transistor can be characterized by its transconductance:

$$
\begin{equation*}
g_{m}=\frac{\partial I_{D}}{\partial V_{G S}} . \tag{6.44}
\end{equation*}
$$

This quantity serves as a measure of the "strength" of the device: a higher value corresponds to a greater change in the drain current for a given change in $V_{G S}$. Using Eq. (6.17) for the saturation region, we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
g_{m}=\mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\right), \tag{6.45}
\end{equation*}
$$

concluding that (1) $g_{m}$ is linearly proportional to $W / L$ for a given $V_{G S}-V_{T H}$, and (2) $g_{m}$ is linearly proportional to $V_{G S}-V_{T H}$ for a given $W / L$. Also, substituting for $V_{G S}-V_{T H}$ from Eq. (6.17), we obtain

$$
\begin{equation*}
g_{m}=\sqrt{2 \mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L} I_{D}} \tag{6.46}
\end{equation*}
$$

That is, (1) $g_{m}$ is proportional to $\sqrt{W / L}$ for a given $I_{D}$, and (2) $g_{m}$ is proportional to $\sqrt{I_{D}}$ for a given $W / L$. Moreover, dividing Eq. (6.45) by (6.17) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
g_{m}=\frac{2 I_{D}}{V_{G S}-V_{T H}} \tag{6.47}
\end{equation*}
$$

revealing that (1) $g_{m}$ is linearly proportional to $I_{D}$ for a given $V_{G S}-V_{T H}$, and (2) $g_{m}$ is inversely proportional to $V_{G S}-V_{T H}$ for a given $I_{D}$. Summarized in Table 6.1, these dependencies prove critical in understanding performance trends of MOS devices and have no counterpart in bipolar transistors. ${ }^{11}$ Among these three expressions for $g_{m}$, Eq. (6.46) is more frequently used because $I_{D}$ may be predetermined by power dissipation requirements.

Example
6.11

For a MOSFET operating in saturation, how do $g_{m}$ and $V_{G S}-V_{T H}$ change if both $W / L$ and $I_{D}$ are doubled?

Solution Equation (6.46) indicates that $g_{m}$ is also doubled. Moreover, Eq. (6.17) suggests that the overdrive remains constant. These results can be understood intuitively if we view the doubling of $W / L$ and $I_{D}$ as shown in Fig. 6.27. Indeed, if $V_{G S}$ remains constant and the width of the device is doubled, it is as if two transistors carrying equal currents are placed in parallel, thereby doubling the transconductance. The reader can show that this trend applies to any type of transistor.

### 6.2.5 Velocity Saturation*

Recall from Section 2.1.3 that at high electric fields, carrier mobility degrades, eventually leading to a constant velocity. Owing to their very short channels (e.g., $0.1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ ), modern MOS devices experience velocity saturation even with drain-source voltages as low as 1 V . As a result, the I/V characteristics no longer follow the square-law behavior.

Let us examine the derivations in Section 6.2.2 under velocity saturation conditions. Denoting the saturated velocity by $v_{s a t}$, we have

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{D} & =v_{s a t} \cdot Q  \tag{6.48}\\
& =v_{s a t} \cdot W C_{o x}\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\right) \tag{6.49}
\end{align*}
$$

Interestingly, $I_{D}$ now exhibits a linear dependence on $V_{G S}-V_{T H}$ and no dependence on L. ${ }^{12} \mathrm{We}$ also recognize that

$$
\begin{align*}
g_{m} & =\frac{\partial I_{D}}{\partial V_{G S}}  \tag{6.50}\\
& =v_{s a t} W C_{o x}, \tag{6.51}
\end{align*}
$$

a quantity independent of $L$ and $I_{D}$.

### 6.2.6 Other Second-Order Effects

Body Effect In our study of MOSFETs, we have assumed that both the source and the substrate (also called the "bulk" or the "body") are tied to ground. However, this condition need not hold in all circuits. For example, if the source terminal rises to a positive voltage while the substrate is at zero, then the source-substrate junction remains reverse-biased and the device still operates properly.

Figure 6.28 illustrates this case. The source terminal is tied to a potential $V_{S}$ with respect to ground while the substrate is grounded through a $p^{+}$contact. ${ }^{13}$ The dashed line added to the transistor symbol indicates the substrate terminal. We denote the voltage difference between the source and the substrate (the bulk) by $V_{S B}$.

Figure 6.28 Body effect.

[^1]An interesting phenomenon occurs as the source-substrate potential difference departs from zero: the threshold voltage of the device changes. In particular, as the source becomes more positive with respect to the substrate, $V_{T H}$ increases. Called "body effect," this phenomenon is formulated as

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{T H}=V_{T H 0}+\gamma\left(\sqrt{\left|2 \phi_{F}+V_{S B}\right|}-\sqrt{\left|2 \phi_{F}\right|}\right), \tag{6.52}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $V_{T H 0}$ denotes the threshold voltage with $V_{S B}=0$ (as studied earlier), and $\gamma$ and $\phi_{F}$ are technology-dependent parameters having typical values of $0.4 \sqrt{\mathrm{~V}}$ and 0.4 V , respectively.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d6bc9046deaf6f855703g-03.jpg?height=201&width=3197&top_left_y=1700&top_left_x=582)
6.12 $W / L=50$, and $V_{T H 0}=0.6 \mathrm{~V}$. Determine the drain current if $\lambda=0$.

Solution Since the source-body voltage, $V_{S B}=0.5 \mathrm{~V}$, Eq. (6.52) and the typical values for $\gamma$ and $\phi_{F}$ yield

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{T H}=0.698 \mathrm{~V} \tag{6.53}
\end{equation*}
$$

Also, with $V_{G}=V_{D}$, the device operates in saturation (why?) and hence

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{D} & =\frac{1}{2} \mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}\left(V_{G}-V_{S}-V_{T H}\right)^{2}  \tag{6.54}\\
& =102 \mu \mathrm{~A} . \tag{6.55}
\end{align*}
$$

Exercise Sketch the drain current as a function of $V_{S}$ as $V_{S}$ goes from zero to 1 V .

Body effect manifests itself in some analog and digital circuits and is studied in more advanced texts. We neglect body effect in this book.

Subthreshold Conduction The derivation of the MOS I-V characteristic has assumed that the transistor abruptly turns on as $V_{G S}$ reaches $V_{T H}$. In reality, formation of the channel is a gradual effect, and the device conducts a small current even for $V_{G S}<V_{T H}$. Called "subthreshold conduction," this effect has become a critical issue in modern MOS devices and is studied in more advanced texts.

## 6.3 MOS DEVICE MODELS

With our study of MOS I-V characteristics in the previous section, we now develop models that can be used in circuit analysis and design.

### 6.3.1 Large-Signal Model

For arbitrary voltage and current levels, we must resort to Eqs. (6.9) and (6.34) to express the device behavior:

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{D} & =\frac{1}{2} \mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}\left[2\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\right) V_{D S}-V_{D S}^{2}\right] \text { Triode Region }  \tag{6.56}\\
I_{D} & =\frac{1}{2} \mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\right)^{2}\left(1+\lambda V_{D S}\right) \text { Saturation Region } \tag{6.57}
\end{align*}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d6bc9046deaf6f855703g-04.jpg?height=1445&width=2895&top_left_y=590&top_left_x=836)

Figure 6.29 MOS models for (a) saturation region, (b) triode region, (c) deep triode region.

In the saturation region, the transistor acts as a voltage-controlled current source, lending itself to the model shown in Fig. 6.29(a). Note that $I_{D}$ does depend on $V_{D S}$ and is therefore not an ideal current source. For $V_{D S}<V_{G S}-V_{T H}$, the model must reflect the triode region, but it can still incorporate a voltage-controlled current source, as depicted in Fig. 6.29(b). Finally, if $V_{D S} \ll 2\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\right)$, the transistor can be viewed as a voltage-controlled resistor [Fig. 6.29(c)]. In all three cases, the gate remains an open circuit to represent the zero gate current.

Example Sketch the drain current of $M_{1}$ in Fig. 6.30(a) versus $V_{1}$ as $V_{1}$ varies from zero to $V_{D D}$. Assume $\lambda=0$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d6bc9046deaf6f855703g-04.jpg?height=532&width=383&top_left_y=3530&top_left_x=1475)

(b)

Figure 6.30 (a) Simple MOS circuit, (b) variation of $I_{D}$ with $V_{1}$.

Solution Noting that the device operates in saturation (why?), we write

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{D} & =\frac{1}{2} \mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\right)^{2}  \tag{6.58}\\
& =\frac{1}{2} \mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}\left(V_{D D}-V_{1}-V_{T H}\right)^{2} . \tag{6.59}
\end{align*}
$$

At $V_{1}=0, V_{G S}=V_{D D}$ and the device carries maximum current. As $V_{1}$ rises, $V_{G S}$ falls and so does $I_{D}$. If $V_{1}$ reaches $V_{D D}-V_{T H}, V_{G S}$ drops to $V_{T H}$, turning the transistor off. The drain current thus varies as illustrated in Fig. 6.30(b). Note that, owing to body effect, $V_{T H}$ varies with $V_{1}$ if the substrate is tied to ground.

Exercise Repeat the above example if the gate of $M_{1}$ is tied to a voltage equal to 1.5 V and $V_{D D}=2 \mathrm{~V}$.

### 6.3.2 Small-Signal Model

If the bias currents and voltages of a MOSFET are only slightly disturbed by signals, the nonlinear, large-signal models can be reduced to linear, small-signal representations. The development of the model proceeds in a manner similar to that in Chapter 4 for bipolar devices. Of particular interest to us in this book is the small-signal model for the saturation region.

Viewing the transistor as a voltagecontrolled current source, we draw the basic model as in Fig. 6.31(a), where $i_{D}=g_{m} v_{G S}$ and the gate remains open. To represent channel-length modulation, i.e., variation of $i_{D}$ with $v_{D S}$, we add a resistor as in Fig. 6.31(b):

$$
\begin{align*}
r_{O} & =\left(\frac{\partial I_{D}}{\partial V_{D S}}\right)^{-1}  \tag{6.60}\\
& =\frac{1}{\frac{1}{2} \mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\right)^{2} \cdot \lambda} \tag{6.61}
\end{align*}
$$

Since channel-length modulation is relatively small, the denominator of Eq. (6.61) can be approximated as $I_{D} \cdot \lambda$, yielding

Did you know?

In addition to integrating a larger number of transistors per chip, MOS technology has also benefited tremendously from "scaling," i.e., the reduction of the transistors' dimensions. The minimum channel length has fallen from about $10 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ to about 25 nm today and the speed of MOSFETs has improved by more than 4 orders of magnitude. For example, the clock frequency of Intel's microprocessors has risen from 100 kHz to 4 GHz . But have analog circuits taken advantage of the scaling as well? Yes, indeed. Plotted below is the frequency of MOS oscillators as a function of time over the past three decades.

## 6.4 PMOS TRANSISTOR

Having seen both $n p n$ and $p n p$ bipolar transistors, the reader may wonder if a $p$ type counterpart exists for MOSFETs. Indeed, as illustrated in Fig. 6.32(a), changing the doping polarities of the substrate and the S/D areas results in a "PMOS" device. The channel now consists of holes and is formed if the gate voltage is below the source potential by one threshold voltage. That is, to turn the device on, $V_{G S}<V_{T H}$, where $V_{T H}$ itself is negative. Following the conventions used for bipolar devices, we draw the PMOS device as in Fig. 6.32(b), with the source terminal identified by the arrow and placed
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d6bc9046deaf6f855703g-06.jpg?height=549&width=1039&top_left_y=3510&top_left_x=1427)

on top to emphasize its higher potential. The transistor operates in the triode region if the drain voltage is near the source potential, approaching saturation as $V_{D}$ falls to $V_{G}-V_{T H}=V_{G}+\left|V_{T H}\right|$. Figure 6.32(c) conceptually illustrates the gate-drain voltages required for each region of operation. We say that if $V_{D S}$ of a PMOS (NMOS) device is sufficiently negative (positive), then it is in saturation.

Example In the circuit of Fig. 6.33, determine the region of operation of $M_{1}$ as $V_{1}$ goes from $V_{D D}$ 6.15 to zero. Assume $V_{D D}=2.5 \mathrm{~V}$ and $\left|V_{T H}\right|=0.5 \mathrm{~V}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d6bc9046deaf6f855703g-07.jpg?height=538&width=549&top_left_y=1740&top_left_x=2111)

Figure 6.33 Simple PMOS circuit.

Solution For $V_{1}=V_{D D}, V_{G S}=0$ and $M_{1}$ is off. As $V_{1}$ falls and approaches $V_{D D}-\left|V_{T H}\right|$, the gatesource potential is negative enough to form a channel of holes, turning the device on. At this point, $V_{G}=V_{D D}-\left|V_{T H}\right|=+2 \mathrm{~V}$ while $V_{D}=+1 \mathrm{~V}$; i.e., $M_{1}$ is saturated [Fig. 6.32(c)]. As $V_{1}$ falls further, $V_{G S}$ becomes more negative and the transistor current rises. For $V_{1}=+1 \mathrm{~V}-\left|V_{T H}\right|=0.5 \mathrm{~V}, M_{1}$ is at the edge of the triode region. As $V_{1}$ goes below 0.5 V , the transistor enters the triode region further.

The voltage and current polarities in PMOS devices can prove confusing. Using the current direction shown in Fig. 6.32(b), we express $I_{D}$ in the saturation region as

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{D, s a t}=-\frac{1}{2} \mu_{p} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\right)^{2}\left(1-\lambda V_{D S}\right) \tag{6.67}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\lambda$ is multiplied by a negative sign. ${ }^{14}$ In the triode region,

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{D, t r i}=-\frac{1}{2} \mu_{p} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}\left[2\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\right) V_{D S}-V_{D S}^{2}\right] \tag{6.68}
\end{equation*}
$$

Alternatively, both equations can be expressed in terms of absolute values:

$$
\begin{align*}
& \left|I_{D, s a t}\right|=\frac{1}{2} \mu_{p} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}\left(\left|V_{G S}\right|-\left|V_{T H}\right|\right)^{2}\left(1+\lambda\left|V_{D S}\right|\right)  \tag{6.69}\\
& \left|I_{D, t r i}\right|=\frac{1}{2} \mu_{p} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}\left[2\left(\left|V_{G S}\right|-\left|V_{T H}\right|\right)\left|V_{D S}\right|-V_{D S}^{2}\right] . \tag{6.70}
\end{align*}
$$

The small-signal model of PMOS transistor is identical to that of NMOS devices (Fig. 6.31). The following example illustrates this point.

[^2]Example
6.16

For the configurations shown in Fig. 6.34(a), determine the small-signal resistances $R_{X}$ and $R_{Y}$. Assume $\lambda \neq 0$.

Figure 6.34 (a) Diode-connected NMOS and PMOS devices, (b) small-signal model of (a), (c) small-signal model of (b).

Solution For the NMOS version, the small-signal equivalent appears as depicted in Fig. 6.34(b), yielding

$$
\begin{align*}
R_{X} & =\frac{v_{X}}{i_{X}}  \tag{6.71}\\
& =\left(g_{m 1} v_{X}+\frac{v_{X}}{r_{O 1}}\right) \frac{1}{i_{X}}  \tag{6.72}\\
& =\frac{1}{g_{m 1}} \| r_{O 1} \tag{6.73}
\end{align*}
$$

For the PMOS version, we draw the equivalent as shown in Fig. 6.34(c) and write

$$
\begin{align*}
R_{Y} & =\frac{v_{Y}}{i_{Y}}  \tag{6.74}\\
& =\left(g_{m 2} v_{Y}+\frac{v_{Y}}{r_{O 1}}\right) \frac{1}{i_{Y}}  \tag{6.75}\\
& =\frac{1}{g_{m 2}} \| r_{O 2} \tag{6.76}
\end{align*}
$$

In both cases, the small-signal resistance is equal to $1 / g_{m}$ if $\lambda \rightarrow 0$.
In analogy with their bipolar counterparts [Fig. 4.44(a)], the structures shown in Fig. 6.34(a) are called "diode-connected" devices and act as two-terminal components: we will encounter many applications of diode-connected devices in Chapters 9 and 10.

Owing to the lower mobility of holes (Chapter 2), PMOS devices exhibit a poorer performance than NMOS transistors. For example, Eq. (6.46) indicates that the transconductance of a PMOS device is lower for a given drain current. We therefore prefer to use NMOS transistors wherever possible.

## 6.5 CMOS TECHNOLOGY

Is it possible to build both NMOS and PMOS devices on the same wafer? Figures 6.2(a) and 6.32(a) reveal that the two require different types of substrate. Fortunately, a local n-type substrate can be created in a $p$-type substrate, thereby accommodating PMOS transistors.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_d6bc9046deaf6f855703g-09.jpg?height=720&width=2850&top_left_y=639&top_left_x=961)

Figure 6.35 CMOS technology.
As illustrated in Fig. 6.35, an " $n$-well" encloses a PMOS device while the NMOS transistor resides in the $p$-substrate.

Called "complementary MOS" (CMOS) technology, the above structure requires more complex processing than simple NMOS or PMOS devices. In fact, the first few generations of MOS technology contained only NMOS transistors, ${ }^{15}$ and the higher cost of CMOS processes seemed prohibitive. However, many significant advantages of complementary devices eventually made CMOS technology dominant and NMOS technology obsolete.

## 6.6 COMPARISON OF BIPOLAR AND MOS DEVICES

Having studied the physics and operation of bipolar and MOS transistors, we can now compare their properties. Table 6.2 shows some of the important aspects of each device. Note that the exponential $I_{C}-V_{B E}$ dependence of bipolar devices accords them a higher transconductance for a given bias current.

6.7 CHAPTER SUMMARY

- A voltage-dependent current source can form an amplifier along with a load resistor. MOSFETs are electronic devices that can operate as voltage-dependent current sources.
- A MOSFET consists of a conductive plate (the "gate") atop a semiconductor substrate and two junctions ("source" and "drain") in the substrate. The gate controls the current flow from the source to the drain. The gate draws nearly zero current because an insulating layer separates it from the substrate.

[^3]- As the gate voltage rises, a depletion region is formed in the substrate under the gate area. Beyond a certain gate-source voltage (the "threshold voltage"), mobile carriers are attracted to the oxide-silicon interface and a channel is formed.
- If the drain-source voltage is small, the device operates a voltage-dependent resistor.
- As the drain voltage rises, the charge density near the drain falls. If the drain voltage reaches one threshold below the gate voltage, the channel ceases to exist near the drain, leading to "pinch-off."
- MOSFETs operate in the "triode" region if the drain voltage is more than one threshold below the gate voltage. In this region, the drain current is a function of $V_{G S}$ and $V_{D S}$. The current is also proportional to the device aspect ratio, $W / L$.
- MOSFETs enter the "saturation region" if channel pinch-off occurs, i.e., the drain voltage is less than one threshold below the gate volatge. In this region, the drain current is proportional to $\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\right)^{2}$.
- MOSFETs operating in the saturation region behave as current sources and find wide application in microelectronic circuits.
- As the drain voltage exceeds $V_{G S}-V_{T H}$ and pinch-off occurs, the drain end of the channel begins to move toward the source, reducing the effective length of the device. Called "channel-length modulation," this effect leads to variation of drain current in the saturation region. That is, the device is not an ideal current source.
- A measure of the small-signal performance of voltage-dependent current sources is the "transconductance," defined as the change in the output current divided by the change in the input voltage. The transconductance of MOSFETs can be expressed by one of three equations in terms of the bias voltages and currents.
- Operation across different regions and/or with large swings exemplifies "large-signal behavior." If the signal swings are sufficiently small, the MOSFET can be represented by a small-signal model consisting of a linear voltage-dependent current source and an output resistance.
- The small-signal model is derived by making a small change in the voltage difference between two terminals while the the other voltages remain constant.
- The small-signal models of NMOS and PMOS devices are identical.
- NMOS and PMOS transistors are fabricated on the same substrate to create CMOS technology.
