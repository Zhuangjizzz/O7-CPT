Beyond this point, the MOSFET enters the saturation region, where the drain current is primarily controlled by the gate voltage and becomes largely independent of further increases in the drain voltage."

Similarly, ID exhibits a smaller slope as a function of VD. It is therefore desirable to minimize the channel length to achieve large drain currents. As the oxide thickness increases, the capacitance between the gate and the silicon substrate decreases. Thus, a given voltage results in less charge on the gate and hence a lower electron density in the channel. Consequently, the device suffers from a higher on-resistance, producing less drain current for a given gate voltage or drain voltage."

Netlist: The image illustrates the concept of equating a wide MOSFET to two transistors in parallel. On the left side, a single wide MOSFET is depicted with a gate-source voltage ($V_{GS}$) applied across the gate and source terminals, and a drain-source voltage ($V_{DS}$) applied across the drain and source terminals.

In a parallel configuration, each narrower MOSFET contributes to the total current, resulting in a cumulative effect where the total current is the sum of the currents through each individual MOSFET. Since the current-carrying capability is directly related to the width of the channel, doubling the width by using two parallel MOSFETs doubles the overall current-carrying capability. This is consistent with the principle that a wider MOSFET can carry more current than a narrower one, given the same applied voltages."
