MOSFETs also function as such controlled sources, but their characteristics differ from those of bipolar transistors.\n\nTo understand the structure of the MOSFET, we start with a simple geometry comprising a conductive plate (e.g., metal), an insulator (dielectric), and a doped silicon piece. Illustrated in Fig. 6.1(a), this setup acts as a capacitor because the p-type silicon is somewhat conductive, mirroring any charge on the top plate.\n\nWhat occurs if a potential difference is applied as shown in Fig. 6.1(b)? When positive charge is placed on the top plate, it attracts negative charge, such as electrons, from the silicon. (Despite being doped with acceptors, p-type silicon still contains a few electrons.) Consequently, a \"channel\" of free electrons may form at the interface between the insulator and the silicon, potentially offering a good conductive path if the electron density is high enough. The key point is that the electron density in the channel varies with $V_{1}$, as indicated by $Q=C V$, where $C$ represents the capacitance between the plates.\n\nThe electron density's dependence on $V_{1}$ leads to an interesting property: if, as shown in Fig. 6.1(c), we allow a current to flow through the silicon from left to right, $V_{1}$ can control the current by adjusting the channel's resistivity. (Note that the current prefers the path of least resistance, flowing mainly through the channel rather than the entire silicon body.) This meets our goal of creating a voltage-controlled current source.\n\nThe equation $Q=C V$ suggests that for strong control of $Q$ by $V$, the value of $C$ must be maximized, such as by reducing the dielectric layer's thickness between the plates. The ability of silicon fabrication technology to produce extremely thin yet uniform dielectric layers (with thicknesses below $20 \\AA$ today) has been crucial to the rapid advancement of microelectronic devices.\n\nThese considerations lead to the MOSFET structure shown in Fig. 6.2(a) as a potential amplifying device. The top conductive plate, termed the \"gate\" (G), sits on a thin dielectric layer, which is deposited on the underlying p-type silicon \"substrate.\" To enable current flow through the silicon, two contacts are attached to the substrate via heavily-doped n-type regions, as direct metal-to-substrate connections would not yield good ohmic contacts. These two terminals are called \"source\" (S) and \"drain\" (D), indicating their roles in providing and absorbing charge carriers, respectively. Fig. 6.2(a) shows that the device is symmetric with respect to S and D; i.e., depending on the applied voltages, either terminal can drain charge carriers from the other. As explained in Section 6.2, with n-type source/drain and p-type substrate, this transistor operates with electrons, earning it the name n-type MOS (NMOS) device. (The p-type counterpart is discussed in Section 6.4.) For simplicity, we represent the device as shown in Fig. 6.2(b).

However, it was found that heavily doped noncrystalline silicon (\"polysilicon\" or \"poly\") offers superior fabrication and physical properties.

MOSFETs also function as such controlled sources, but their characteristics differ from those of bipolar transistors.\n\nTo understand the structure of the MOSFET, we start with a simple configuration comprising a conductive plate (e.g., metal), an insulator (dielectric), and a doped silicon piece. This is depicted in Fig. 6.1(a).\n\n### Description of Figure 6.1 (a)\n\n1. **Identification of Components and Structure:**\n- The diagram shows a hypothetical semiconductor device with three primary layers:\n- A **conductive plate** at the top, usually made of metal.\n- An **insulator** layer beneath the conductive plate, serving as a dielectric.\n- A **p-type silicon** substrate at the bottom, acting as a semiconductor.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- The conductive plate and p-type silicon together form a basic capacitor. The conductive plate serves as one electrode, while the p-type silicon acts as the other.\n- The insulator prevents direct electrical conduction between the plate and silicon, allowing only capacitive effects.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- The diagram is marked to indicate the conductive plate, insulator, and p-type silicon.\n- Arrows indicate the potential direction of charge movement, suggesting that the p-type silicon reflects the charge on the conductive plate when a voltage is applied.\n\nThis setup demonstrates the fundamental concept of a MOSFET, where the gate (conductive plate) controls the flow of charge carriers in the semiconductor channel below.\n\n### Description of Figure 6.1 (b)\n\nThe image labeled as (b) depicts a hypothetical semiconductor device functioning as a capacitor. It consists of three main components: a conductive plate, an insulator, and a piece of p-type silicon. The conductive plate is at the top, the insulator is beneath it, and the p-type silicon is at the bottom. This structure forms a capacitor due to the conductive nature of the p-type silicon, which mirrors any charge on the conductive plate.\n\nIn this setup, a potential difference (V1) is applied across the device. The positive voltage on the conductive plate attracts electrons from the p-type silicon, forming an electron channel just below the insulator. This results in capacitive behavior, where the charge on the conductive plate induces an opposite charge in the silicon, creating an electric field across the insulator.\n\nThe diagram includes annotations showing the direction of the electric field and the formation of the electron channel, crucial for understanding the device's operation as a voltage-controlled element.\n\n### Description of Figure 6.1 (c)\n\nThe image illustrates a series of diagrams showing the operation of a hypothetical semiconductor device, focusing on the MOSFET structure and its function. The diagrams are labeled as (a), (b), and (c):\n\n1. **Diagram (a): Basic Structure**\n- **Components:**\n- A conductive plate (metal) at the top.\n- An insulator (dielectric) layer below the plate.\n- A layer of p-type silicon at the bottom.\n- **Functionality:**\n- This configuration operates as a capacitor, with the p-type silicon acting as a conductive substrate that mirrors the charge on the top plate.\n\n2. **Diagram (b): Capacitive Operation**\n- **Components:**\n- Similar to (a), with the addition of a voltage source labeled **V1**.\n- **Connections and Interactions:**\n- The voltage source **V1** is connected across the conductive plate and p-type silicon.\n- Positive charge on the plate attracts electrons to the p-type silicon surface, forming an electron channel.\n- **Key Features:**\n- The diagram indicates the formation of an electron channel beneath the insulator due to the applied voltage.\n\n3. **Diagram (c): Current Flow**\n- **Components:**\n- Similar to (b), with an additional voltage source labeled **V2**.\n- **Connections and Interactions:**\n- Voltage source **V1** is still applied across the plate and p-type silicon.\n- Voltage source **V2** is applied across the ends of the p-type silicon.\n- The combined effect of **V1** and **V2** causes current to flow through the electron channel, as indicated by an arrow.\n- **Key Features:**\n- The diagram illustrates the MOSFET's operation as a voltage-controlled current source, where **V1** controls the channel's conductivity, and **V2** drives the current through it.\n\nFigure 6.1 (a) Hypothetical semiconductor device, (b) operation as a capacitor, (c) current flow due to potential difference.\n\nConsider what occurs when a potential difference is applied as shown in Fig. 6.1(b). As positive charge is placed on the top plate, it attracts negative charge (electrons) from the silicon. (Despite being doped with acceptors, p-type silicon contains a small number of electrons.) This creates a \"channel\" of free electrons at the insulator-silicon interface, potentially forming a good conductive path if the electron density is high enough. The key point is that the electron density in the channel varies with $V_{1}$, as indicated by $Q=C V$, where $C$ represents the capacitance between the plates.\n\nThe electron density's dependence on $V_{1}$ leads to an interesting property: if, as shown in Fig. 6.1(c), we allow current to flow through the silicon from left to right, $V_{1}$ can control the current by adjusting the channel's resistivity.

When positive charge is placed on the top plate, it attracts negative charge, such as electrons, from the silicon. (Despite being doped with acceptors, p-type silicon still contains a few electrons.)

The crucial point is that the electron density in the channel varies with $V_{1}$, as indicated by $Q=C V$, where $C$ represents the capacitance between the plates.\n\nThe electron density's dependence on $V_{1}$ leads to an interesting property: if, as shown in Fig. 6.1(c), we allow a current to flow through the silicon from left to right, $V_{1}$ can control the current by adjusting the channel's resistivity. (Note that the current tends to follow the path of least resistance, primarily flowing through the channel rather than the entire silicon body.)

MOSFETs also function as such controlled sources, but their characteristics differ from those of bipolar transistors.\n\nTo understand the structure of the MOSFET, we start with a simple geometry comprising a conductive plate (e.g., metal), an insulator (dielectric), and a doped silicon piece. Figure 6.1(a) depicts this setup.\n\n### Description of Figure 6.1 (a)\n\n1. **Identification of Components and Structure:**\n   - The diagram presents a hypothetical semiconductor device with three primary layers:\n     - A **conductive plate** at the top, typically made of metal.\n     - An **insulator** layer beneath the conductive plate, serving as a dielectric.\n     - A **p-type silicon** substrate at the bottom, acting as a semiconductor.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n   - The conductive plate and p-type silicon together form a basic capacitor. The conductive plate serves as one electrode, while the p-type silicon acts as the other.\n   - The insulator prevents direct electrical conduction between the plate and silicon, allowing only capacitive effects.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n   - The diagram labels the conductive plate, insulator, and p-type silicon.\n   - Arrows indicate the potential direction of charge movement, showing that the p-type silicon mirrors the charge on the conductive plate when a voltage is applied.\n\nThis configuration exemplifies the fundamental concept of a MOSFET, where the gate (conductive plate) regulates the flow of charge carriers in the semiconductor channel below.\n\n### Description of Figure 6.1 (b)\n\nThe image labeled as (b) illustrates a semiconductor device functioning as a capacitor. It includes three main components: a conductive plate, an insulator, and a piece of p-type silicon. The conductive plate is at the top, the insulator is beneath it, and the p-type silicon is at the bottom. This structure forms a capacitor due to the conductive nature of the p-type silicon, which mirrors any charge on the conductive plate.\n\nIn this setup, a potential difference (V1) is applied across the device. The positive voltage on the conductive plate attracts electrons from the p-type silicon, creating an electron channel just below the insulator. This results in capacitive behavior, where the charge on the conductive plate induces an opposite charge in the silicon, establishing an electric field across the insulator.\n\nThe diagram includes annotations showing the direction of the electric field and the formation of the electron channel, crucial for understanding the device's operation as a voltage-controlled element.\n\n### Description of Figure 6.1 (c)\n\nThis image series illustrates the operation of a hypothetical semiconductor device, focusing on the MOSFET structure and its functioning.

This creates a \"channel\" of free electrons at the insulator-silicon interface, potentially forming a good conductive path if the electron density is high enough. The key point is that the electron density in the channel varies with $V_{1}$, as indicated by $Q=C V$, where $C$ is the capacitance between the plates.\n\nThe electron density's dependence on $V_{1}$ leads to an interesting property: if, as in Fig. 6.1(c), we allow current to flow through the silicon, $V_{1}$ can control the current by adjusting the channel's resistivity. (Note that the current prefers the path of least resistance, flowing mainly through the channel rather than the entire silicon body.)

    "text": "The analysis of the straightforward configurations depicted in Figures 6.1 and 6.2 indicates that a MOSFET might permit the flow of current between the source and the drain if a channel of electrons is established by elevating the gate voltage to a sufficiently positive level. Furthermore, it is anticipated that the level of current can be regulated by adjusting the gate voltage. Our examination will affirm these hypotheses while uncovering additional nuanced effects within the device. It is important to note that the gate terminal does not draw any (low-frequency) current as it is separated from the channel by an oxide layer.\n\nGiven that the MOSFET incorporates three terminals, we might encounter numerous combinations of terminal voltages and currents. However, since the (low-frequency) gate current is negligible, the only current of relevance is that which flows between the source and the drain. It is essential to scrutinize how this current is dependent on the gate voltage (for instance, with a constant drain voltage) and on the drain voltage (with a constant gate voltage). These concepts will be elucidated further.\n\nInitially, let us consider the setup illustrated in Figure 6.5(a), where the source and drain are grounded while the gate voltage is altered. Although this circuit may not seem particularly practical, it offers substantial insights. From Figure 6.1(b), we recall that as the gate voltage ($V_G$) increases, the positive charge on the gate must be complemented by an equivalent negative charge in the substrate. While we mentioned in Section 6.1 that electrons are drawn to the interface, in reality, another phenomenon precedes channel formation. As $V_G$ rises from zero, the positive charge on the gate repels the holes in the substrate, thereby revealing negative ions and creating a depletion region [Figure 6.5(b)].\n\nIt is worth noting that despite the absence of a conductive channel, the device still behaves as a capacitor, with positive charge on the gate mirrored by negative charge in the substrate. Hence, no current can traverse from the source to the drain. We refer to this state as the MOSFET being \"off.\"\n\nTo prevent current flow through the source-substrate and drain-substrate junctions in this mode, the substrate itself is also grounded, ensuring these diodes are not forward-biased. For the sake of simplicity, this connection is not depicted in the diagrams.\n\nWith an increase in $V_G$, more negative ions are exposed, deepening the depletion region beneath the oxide. However, this does not imply the transistor never activates\nactivates. Fortunately, if $V_G$ becomes sufficiently positive, free electrons are attracted\nattracted to the oxide-silicon interface, forming a conductive channel [Figure 6.5(c)]. We refer to this state as the MOSFET being \"on.\" The gate voltage\nvoltage at which the channel starts to form is known as the \"threshold voltage,\" $V_{TH}$, and typically falls within the range of 300 mV to 500 mV. It's important to note that the electrons are supplied by the $n^+$ source and drain regions and do not need to come from the substrate.\n\nAn intriguing aspect of the MOSFET is that the gate terminal does not draw any (low-frequency) current. Situated atop the oxide layer, the gate remains isolated from the other terminals, functioning merely as one plate of a capacitor.\n\nThe conductive channel between the source (S) and the drain (D) can be regarded as a resistor, and since the density of electrons in the channel increases as $V_G$ becomes more positive, the resistance value of this channel resistor changes with the gate voltage. This concept is visually represented in Figure 6.6, illustrating a voltage-dependent resistor that is highly useful in both analog and digital circuits.\n\nFigure 6.6 depicts a MOSFET configured as a voltage-dependent resistor, with a series of resistors connected between the source (S) and drain (D) terminals.\n\nExample 6.1 involves creating a variable-gain circuit that reduces the signal level as a cellphone approaches a wireless base station to prevent circuit saturation and ensure proper operation. A MOSFET can serve as a voltage-controlled attenuator in conjunction with a resistor, as shown in Figure 6.7.\n\nThe output signal decreases as the control voltage ($V_{\\text{cont}}$) falls because the electron density in the channel diminishes, causing the resistance ($R_M$) to rise. MOSFETs are frequently employed as voltage-dependent resistors in variable-gain amplifiers.\n\nFigure 6.7 illustrates the use of a MOSFET to adjust signal levels, with the MOSFET's resistance ($R_M$) varying with the control voltage ($V_{\\text{cont}}$), which in turn affects the output voltage ($V_{\\text{out}}$). The resistor ($R_1$) is connected between the output voltage and ground.\n\nExercise: Determine the effect on $R_M$ if the channel length is doubled.\n\nIn the configuration of Figure 6.5(c), no current flows between the source (S) and the drain (D) because both terminals are at the same potential. We now raise the drain voltage, as shown in Figure 6.8(a), and examine the drain current (which equals the source current). If $V_G < V_{TH}$, no channel exists, the device is off, and $I_D = 0$, irrespective of the drain voltage. Conversely, if $V_G > V_{TH}$, then $I_D > 0$ [Figure 6.8(b)]. In fact, the path from source to drain may act as a simple resistor, displaying the $I_D-V_D$ characteristic shown in Figure 6.8(c). The slope of this characteristic is equal to $1/R_{\\text{on}}$, where $R_{\\text{on}}$ denotes the \"on-resistance\" of the transistor.\n\nThe discussion of the MOSFET's I-V characteristics so far suggests two distinct operational views: in Figure 6.8(b), $V_G$ is varied while $V_D$ remains constant, and in Figure 6.8(c), $V_D$ is varied while $V_G$ remains constant. Each perspective provides valuable insights into the transistor's operation.\n\nAs $V_G$ increases, the higher density of electrons in the channel reduces the on-resistance, resulting in a steeper slope in the characteristic curve, as shown in Figure 6.8(d). This reinforces the concept of voltage-dependent resistance.\n\nFigure 6.8(a) shows an NMOS transistor with both gate and drain voltages applied, while Figure 6.8(b) is an I-V characteristic curve showing the relationship between the drain current ($I_D$) and the gate voltage ($V_G$) with a constant drain voltage. Figure 6.8(c) displays the $I_D-V_D$ characteristic with a constant gate voltage, and Figure 6.8(d) shows the $I_D-V_D$ characteristics for various gate voltages.\n\nCharge flow in semiconductors typically occurs through diffusion or drift. In a MOSFET, however, the current results from the drift of charge due to the electric field created by the voltage source connected to the drain along the channel.\n\nThe $I_D-V_G$ and $I_D-V_D$ characteristics depicted in Figures 6.8(b) and (c) are crucial for comprehending MOS devices. The following example reinforces the concepts discussed.\n\nExample: Sketch the $I_D-V_G$ and $I_D-V_D$ characteristics for different channel lengths and different oxide thicknesses.\n\nSolution: As the channel length increases, so does the on-resistance. Thus, for $V_G > V_{TH}$, the drain current starts at lower values as the channel length increases [Figure 6.9(a)]. Similarly, $I_D$ shows a smaller slope with respect to $V_D$ [Figure 6.9(b)]. Therefore, it is advantageous to minimize the channel length to achieve higher drain currents, which is a significant trend in MOS technology development.\n\nHow does the oxide thickness, $t_{\\text{ox}}$, affect the I-V characteristics? As $t_{\\text{ox}}$ increases, the capacitance between the gate and the silicon substrate decreases. Therefore, from the equation $Q = CV$, we observe that a given voltage leads to less charge on the gate and, consequently, a lower electron density in the channel. This results in a higher on-resistance, producing less drain current for a given gate or drain voltage [Figures 6.9(c) and (d)]. For this reason, the semiconductor industry has continuously worked towards reducing the gate oxide thickness.\n\nFigure 6.9(a) and (b) illustrate the $I_D-V_G$ and $I_D-V_D$ characteristics for different channel lengths, while Figures 6.9(c) and (d) show these characteristics for different oxide thicknesses.\n\nExercise: Considering that the current conduction in the channel is due to drift, and knowing that mobility decreases at high temperatures, what can be said about the on-resistance as the temperature increases?\n\nWhile both the channel length and the oxide thickness impact the performance of MOSFETs, only the channel length is controllable by circuit designers during the layout of the transistor. The oxide thickness, on the other hand, is determined during fabrication and remains constant for all transistors within a given technology generation.\n\nAnother MOS parameter that circuit designers can control is the width of the transistor, which is the dimension perpendicular to the length [Figure 6.10(a)]. Therefore, we observe that the \"lateral\" dimensions such as length (L) and width (W) can be specified by circuit designers, whereas \"vertical\" dimensions such as oxide thickness ($t_{\\text{ox}}$) cannot.\n\nHow does the gate width affect the I-V characteristics? As W increases, so does the width of the channel, thereby reducing the resistance between the source and the drain and resulting in the trends shown in Figure 6.10(b). From another perspective, a wider device can be thought of as two narrower transistors in parallel, yielding a higher drain current [Figure 6.10(c)]. While it may be tempting to maximize W, we must also consider that the total gate capacitance increases with W, which could potentially limit the circuit's speed. Consequently, the width of each device in the circuit must be carefully selected.\n\nFigure 6.10(a) shows the dimensions of a MOSFET, with both width (W) and length (L) under the control of the circuit designer, while Figure 6.10(b) shows the $I_D$ characteristics for different values of W, and Figure 6.10(c) illustrates the equivalence of multiple devices connected in parallel.\n\nChannel Pinch-Off: Our qualitative examination of the MOSFET so far suggests that it acts as a voltage-dependent resistor if the gate voltage exceeds $V_{TH}$. However, in reality, the transistor behaves as a current source if the drain voltage is sufficiently high. To grasp this effect, we make two observations: (1) a channel is formed when the potential difference between the gate and the oxide-silicon interface exceeds $V_{TH}$; (2) if the drain voltage remains higher than the source voltage, then the voltage at each point along the channel with respect to ground increases as we move from the source towards the drain. This effect, illustrated in Figure 6.11(a), arises from the gradual voltage drop along the channel resistance. Since the gate voltage is constant (as the gate is conductive but carries no current in any direction), and since the potential at the oxide-silicon interface rises from the source to the drain, the potential difference between the gate and the oxide-silicon interface decreases along the x-axis [Figure 6.11(b)]. The density of electrons in the channel follows the same trend, reaching a minimum at $x = L$.\n\nFigure 6.11(a) depicts the potential variation along the channel in an NMOS transistor, with the voltage dropping from $V_G$ at the source to $V_G - V_D$ at the drain, indicating a decrease in electron density along the channel. The current $I_D$ flows from the drain to the source. Figure 6.11(b) is a graph representing the gate-substrate voltage difference along the channel of a MOSFET device, showing a nonlinear decrease in potential difference from $V_G$ to $V_D - V_G$ as $x$ increases from 0 to $L$.\n\nFrom these observations, we conclude that if the drain voltage is high enough to cause $V_G - V_D \\leq V_{TH}$, the channel disappears near the drain. We say that the gate-substrate potential difference is insufficient at $x = L$ to attract electrons, and the channel is \"pinched off\" [Figure 6.12(a)].\n\nWhat occurs if $V_D$ rises even higher than $V_G - V_{TH}$? Since $V(x)$ now ranges from 0 at $x = 0$ to $V_D > V_G - V_{TH}$ at $x = L$, the voltage difference between the gate and the substrate drops to $V_{TH}$ at some point $L_1 < L$ [Figure 6.12(b)]. Therefore, the device contains no channel between $L_1$ and $L$. Does this mean the transistor cannot conduct current? No, the device still conducts: as illustrated in Figure 6.12(c), once electrons reach the end of the channel, they encounter the high electric field in the depletion region surrounding the drain junction and are swiftly swept to the drain terminal. Nonetheless, as shown in the next section, the drain voltage no longer significantly affects the current, and the MOSFET acts as a constant current source—similar to a bipolar transistor in the forward active region. It is important to note that the source-substrate and drain-substrate junctions do not carry any current."

Although this circuit may not seem immediately practical, it affords us substantial insight. Recollect from Fig. 6.1(b) that as the gate voltage ($V_G$) increases, the positive charge on the gate is counterbalanced by an equivalent negative charge in the substrate. While we previously mentioned in Section 6.1 that electrons are drawn to the interface, in actuality, an additional phenomenon occurs before the channel is formed. As $V_G$ rises from zero, the positive charge on the gate repels the holes in the substrate, thereby revealing negative ions and establishing a depletion region [Fig. 6.5(b)].\n\nThe device still functions as a capacitor at this stage—positive charge on the gate is mirrored by negative charge in the substrate—but no channel of mobile charge is yet formed. Consequently, no current can flow from the source to the drain, rendering the MOSFET in an 'off' state.\n\nIn this configuration, can the source-substrate and drain-substrate junctions conduct current? To preclude this occurrence, the substrate itself is also grounded, ensuring that these diodes remain reverse-biased. For simplicity, this connection is not depicted in the diagrams.\n\nWith the increment of $V_G$, to maintain charge equilibrium on the gate, more negative ions are exposed, deepening the depletion region beneath the oxide. However, this does not imply that the transistor will never activate. If $V_G$ becomes sufficiently positive, free electrons are attracted to the oxide-silicon interface, establishing a conductive channel [Fig. 6.5(c)]. We denote this state as the MOSFET being 'on'. The gate voltage at which the channel commences to form is known as the \"threshold voltage,\" $V_{TH}$, and typically ranges from 300 mV to 500 mV. It is noteworthy that the electrons are supplied by the $n^+$ source and drain regions, and are not derived from the substrate.\n\nA remarkable aspect of the MOSFET is that its gate terminal does not draw any (low-frequency) current. Positioned atop the oxide, the gate is electrically isolated from the other terminals and acts merely as one plate of a capacitor.\n\nThe conductive channel between the source (S) and drain (D) can be conceptualized as a resistor. Moreover, since the electron density in the channel increases with a more positive $V_G$, the resistance value is modulated by the gate voltage. As depicted conceptually in Fig. 6.6, this voltage-dependent resistor is profoundly useful in analog and digital circuits.\n\nFigure 6.6 illustrates the MOSFET as a voltage-dependent resistor.\n\nExample 6.1 involves the scenario where a cellphone near a wireless base station may receive an excessively strong signal, potentially \"saturating\" the circuits and impairing proper operation. The task is to design a variable-gain circuit that reduces the signal level as the cellphone approaches the base station.\n\nThe solution employs a MOSFET to create a voltage-controlled attenuator in conjunction with a resistor, as shown in Fig. 6.7. The output signal diminishes as the control voltage decreases because the electron density in the channel decreases, leading to an increase in the MOSFET's resistance ($R_M$). MOSFETs are frequently employed as voltage-dependent resistors in \"variable-gain amplifiers.\"\n\nFigure 6.7 demonstrates the application of a MOSFET to adjust signal levels.\n\nIn the arrangement of Fig. 6.5(c), no current flows between the source and drain since both terminals are at the same potential. We now elevate the drain voltage, as illustrated in Fig. 6.8(a), and scrutinize the drain current (which is equal to the source current). If $V_G<V_{TH}$, no channel exists, and the device is off, resulting in $I_D=0$ regardless of the drain voltage. Conversely, if $V_G>V_{TH}$, then $I_D>0$ [Fig. 6.8(b)]. In fact, the source-drain path may behave as a simple resistor, yielding the $I_D-V_D$ characteristic shown in Fig. 6.8(c). The slope of this characteristic corresponds to $1/R_{on}$, where $R_{on}$ denotes the \"on-resistance\" of the transistor.\n\nOur examination of the MOSFET I-V characteristics thus far has highlighted two distinct perspectives on the device's operation: in Fig. 6.8(b), $V_G$ is varied while $V_D$ is held constant, and in Fig. 6.8(c), $V_D$ is varied while $V_G$ is held constant. Each perspective provides valuable insights into the transistor's functionality.\n\nHow does the characteristic curve in Fig. 6.8(b) change with an increase in $V_G$? The heightened electron density in the channel diminishes the on-resistance, resulting in a steeper slope. As shown in Fig. 6.8(d), these characteristics reinforce the concept of voltage-dependent resistance.\n\nFigure 6.8 depicts various aspects of the MOSFET's I-V characteristics.\n\nIn Chapter 2, we learned that charge flow in semiconductors occurs via diffusion or drift. But what is the charge transport mechanism in a MOSFET? Since the voltage source connected to the drain generates an electric field along the channel, the current results from the drift of charge.\n\nThe $I_D-V_G$ and $I_D-V_D$ characteristics shown in Figs. 6.8 (b) and (c), respectively, are pivotal to our comprehension of MOS devices. The following example reinforces the concepts we have examined.\n\nExample: Sketch the $I_D-V_G$ and $I_D-V_D$ characteristics for (a) different channel lengths, and (b) different oxide thicknesses.\n\nSolution: As the channel length increases, so does the on-resistance. Therefore, for $V_G>V_{TH}$, the drain current starts at lower values as the channel length increases [Fig. 6.9(a)]. Similarly, $I_D$ exhibits a reduced slope as a function of $V_D$ [Fig. 6.9(b)]. Consequently, it is advantageous to minimize the channel length to achieve higher drain currents, which is a significant trend in MOS technology development.\n\nHow does the oxide thickness, $t_{ox}$, influence the I-V characteristics? As $t_{ox}$ increases, the capacitance between the gate and the silicon substrate diminishes. Hence, from the equation $Q=C\\times V$, we infer that a given voltage results in less charge on the gate, leading to a lower electron density in the channel. Consequently, the device experiences a higher on-resistance, generating less drain current for a given gate voltage [Fig. 6.9(c)] or drain voltage [Fig. 6.9(d)]. This is why the semiconductor industry has continuously strived to reduce the gate oxide thickness.\n\nFigure 6.9 presents the I-V characteristics for different channel lengths and oxide thicknesses.\n\nExercise: How does the on-resistance behave if the mobility decreases at high temperatures?\n\nAlthough both the channel length and the oxide thickness impact the performance of MOSFETs, only the former is controllable by circuit designers, i.e., it can be specified in the transistor's \"layout.\" The latter, however, is determined during fabrication and remains constant for all transistors within a given technology generation.\n\nAnother MOS parameter manageable by circuit designers is the transistor's width, which is the dimension perpendicular to the length [Fig. 6.10(a)]. Therefore, we observe that the \"lateral\" dimensions such as $L$ and $W$ can be selected by circuit designers, whereas \"vertical\" dimensions such as $t_{ox}$ cannot.\n\nHow does the gate width affect the I-V characteristics? As $W$ increases, so does the channel width, thereby reducing the resistance between the source and the drain and producing the trends depicted in Fig. 6.10(b). From another viewpoint, a wider device can be conceptualized as two narrower transistors in parallel, resulting in a higher drain current [Fig. 6.10(c)]. We might then infer that $W$ should be maximized, but we must also consider that the total gate capacitance increases with $W$, potentially restricting the circuit's speed. Hence, the width of each device in the circuit must be meticulously chosen.\n\nFigure 6.10 illustrates the dimensions of a MOSFET and its I-V characteristics for different widths.\n\nChannel Pinch-Off: Our qualitative examination of the MOSFET thus far suggests that the device behaves as a voltage-dependent resistor when the gate voltage surpasses $V_{TH}$. Nonetheless, in reality, the transistor functions as a current source if the drain voltage is sufficiently positive. To comprehend this effect, we make two observations: (1) to create a channel, the potential difference between the gate and the oxide-silicon interface must exceed $V_{TH}$; (2) if the drain voltage remains higher than the source voltage, then the voltage at each point along the channel with respect to ground increases as we move from the source towards the drain. This effect, depicted in Fig. 6.11(a), arises due to the gradual voltage drop along the channel resistance. Since the gate voltage is constant (because the gate is conductive but carries no current in any direction), and since the potential at the oxide-silicon interface rises from the source to the drain, the potential difference between the gate and the oxide-silicon interface diminishes along the $x$-axis [Fig. 6.11(b)]. Consequently, the electron density in the channel follows the same trend, reaching a minimum at $x=L$.\n\nFigure 6.11 illustrates the channel potential variation and the gate-substrate voltage difference along the channel.\n\nFrom these observations, we deduce that if the drain voltage is high enough to produce $V_G-V_D \\leq V_{TH}$, then the channel vanishes near the drain. We assert that the gate-substrate potential difference is insufficient at $x=L$ to attract electrons, and the channel is \"pinched off\" [Fig. 6.12(a)].\n\nWhat occurs if $V_D$ rises even higher than $V_G-V_{TH}$? Since $V(x)$ now ranges from 0 at $x=0$ to $V_D>V_G-V_{TH}$ at $x=L$, the voltage difference between the gate and the substrate drops to $V_{TH}$ at some point $L_1<L$ [Fig. 6.12(b)]. The device consequently contains no channel between $L_1$ and $L$. Does this imply that the transistor cannot conduct current? No, the device still conducts: as illustrated in Fig. 6.12(c), once electrons reach the end of the channel, they encounter the high electric field in the depletion region surrounding the drain junction and are swiftly swept to the drain terminal. Nonetheless, as demonstrated in the next section, the drain voltage no longer significantly affects the current, and the MOSFET behaves as a constant current source—resembling a bipolar transistor in the forward active region. It is important to note that the source-substrate and drain-substrate junctions do not conduct any current."

The following example reinforces the concepts studied thus far.\n\nSketch the \\( I_D - V_G \\) and \\( I_D - V_D \\) characteristics for (a) different channel lengths, and (b) different oxide thicknesses.\n\nAs the channel length increases, so does the on-resistance.

Similarly, \\( I_D \\) exhibits a smaller slope as a function of \\( V_D \\) [Fig. 6.9(b)]. Therefore, it is desirable to minimize the channel length to achieve higher drain currents, which is an important trend in MOS technology development.\n\nHow does the oxide thickness, \\( t_{\\text{ox}} \\), affect the I-V characteristics? As \\( t_{\\text{ox}} \\) increases, the capacitance between the gate and the silicon substrate decreases. Consequently, for a given voltage, less charge accumulates on the gate, leading to a lower electron density in the channel. This results in a higher on-resistance, producing less drain current for a given gate voltage [Fig. 6.9(c)] or drain voltage [Fig. 6.9(d)]. This is why the semiconductor industry has continually reduced the gate oxide thickness.\n\nRecall that the resistance of a conductor is proportional to its length.\n\nThe gate width also influences the I-V characteristics.

As $V_{G}$ rises from zero, the positive charge on the gate repels the holes in the substrate, thereby revealing negative ions and creating a depletion region [Fig. 6.5(b)].\n\nThe diagrams in Figs. 6.5(a), (b), and (c) depict a MOSFET with a gate voltage applied, the formation of a depletion region, and the creation of a channel, respectively. Note that while the device acts as a capacitor, with positive charge on the gate mirrored by negative charge in the substrate, no channel of mobile charge is formed yet. Consequently, no current can flow from the source to the drain. We refer to this state as the MOSFET being \"off.\"\n\nCan the source-substrate and drain-substrate junctions conduct current in this mode? To prevent this, the substrate itself is also grounded, ensuring that these diodes are not forward-biased. For simplicity, this connection is not shown in the diagrams.\n\nAs $V_{G}$ increases, more negative ions are exposed, and the depletion region beneath the oxide expands. However, if $V_{G}$ becomes sufficiently positive, free electrons are attracted to the oxide-silicon interface, forming a conductive channel [Fig. 6.5(c)]. We then say the MOSFET is \"on.\" The gate voltage at which the channel starts to form is known as the \"threshold voltage,\" $V_{T H}$, and typically ranges from 300 mV to 500 mV. It's important to note that the electrons are supplied by the $n^{+}$ source and drain regions, not the substrate.\n\nA notable feature of the MOSFET is that the gate terminal draws no (low-frequency) current. Positioned above the oxide, the gate remains insulated from the other terminals and acts merely as one plate of a capacitor.\n\nThe conductive channel between the source and drain can be regarded as a resistor, whose value changes with the gate voltage. This concept is illustrated in Fig. 6.6, where the MOSFET is viewed as a voltage-dependent resistor, a feature that is highly useful in analog and digital circuits.\n\nThe circuit in Fig. 6.7 demonstrates a MOSFET used as a voltage-controlled attenuator, which can be employed to reduce signal levels as a cellphone approaches a base station. The output signal decreases as the control voltage falls because the electron density in the channel decreases, causing the resistance $R_{M}$ to increase. MOSFETs are often used as voltage-dependent resistors in \"variable-gain amplifiers.\"\n\nAs we progress through Fig. 6.8, we see how the drain current varies with gate and drain voltages, highlighting the MOSFET's operation as a voltage-dependent resistor. In Fig. 6.8(b), the $I_{D}-V_{G}$ characteristic shows the relationship between the drain current and the gate voltage, while in Fig. 6.8(c), the $I_{D}-V_{D}$ characteristic illustrates the relationship between the drain current and the drain voltage. Each view provides valuable insights into the transistor's operation.\n\nIn Fig. 6.9, we explore the effects of varying channel lengths and oxide thicknesses on the MOSFET's characteristics. Increasing the channel length leads to higher on-resistance, resulting in lower drain currents for a given gate voltage. Similarly, increasing the oxide thickness decreases the capacitance between the gate and the substrate, which in turn reduces the electron density in the channel and increases the on-resistance, thereby to lower drain currents for a given gate or drain voltage. These observations highlight the importance of minimizing channel length and oxide thickness in MOSFET design to achieve higher drain currents and improved device.\n\nThe diagrams in Figs. 6.10(a), (b), and (c) illustrate the dimensions of a MOSFET that the $I_{D}$ characteristics for different gate widths, and the equivalence of multiple MOSFET devices connected in parallel, respectively. The gate width, a is perpendicular to the channel length, is another parameter that circuit designers can control to As\nThe examination of the depicted simple structures, as shown in Figs. 6.1 and 6.2, indicates that a MOSFET may allow current to flow from the source to the drain when a channel of electrons is formed by applying a sufficiently positive gate voltage. Furthermore, it is anticipated that the magnitude of this current can be regulated by adjusting the gate voltage. Subsequent analysis will validate these hypotheses and uncover additional nuanced effects within the device. It is important to note that the gate terminal does not draw any (low-frequency) current as it is electrically isolated from the channel by the oxide layer.\n\nGiven that the MOSFET has three terminals, we might encounter numerous combinations of terminal voltages and currents. However, since the (low-frequency) gate current is zero, our primary focus is on the current flowing between the source and the drain. We must investigate how this current depends on the gate voltage (for instance, with a constant drain voltage) and on the drain voltage (with a constant gate voltage). These ideas will become clearer as we proceed.\n\nConsider first the configuration depicted in Fig. 6.5(a), where the source and drain are grounded, and the gate voltage is altered.

    "text": "Our investigation into the depicted simple structures in Figs. 6.1 and 6.2 indicates that a MOSFET may allow current to flow from the source to the drain when a conductive channel of electrons is formed by applying a sufficiently positive gate voltage. Additionally, it is anticipated that the amplitude of the current can be regulated by adjusting the gate voltage. Our subsequent analysis will substantiate these hypotheses while also uncovering additional nuanced effects within the device. It should be noted that the gate terminal does not draw any (low-frequency) current, as it is separated from the channel by an insulating oxide layer.\n\nGiven that the MOSFET has three terminals, we might encounter a multitude of voltage and current configurations across these terminals. Fortunately, with the (low-frequency) gate current being negligible, our primary concern is the current flowing between the source and the drain. It is imperative to examine how this current is influenced by the gate voltage (for instance, with a constant drain voltage) and by the drain voltage (with a constant gate voltage). These concepts will be elucidated further in the following sections.\n\nConsider first the setup depicted in Fig. 6.5(a), where the source and drain are grounded, and the gate voltage is altered. Although this circuit may not seem particularly practical, it offers valuable insights. From Fig. 6.1(b), recall that as the gate voltage ($V_G$) increases, the positive charge on the gate is mirrored by an equal negative charge in the substrate. While we mentioned in Section 6.1 that electrons are drawn to the interface, the actual process begins with another phenomenon. As $V_G$ rises from zero, the positive charge on the gate repels the holes in the substrate, thereby revealing negative ions and creating a depletion region [Fig. 6.5(b)].\n\nThe diagrams in Figs. 6.5 (a), (b), and (c) illustrate the MOSFET's operation with varying gate voltages, the formation of a depletion region, and the creation of a conductive channel, respectively.\n\nIt is important to note that despite the presence of a conductive channel, the device still acts as a capacitor, with positive charge on the gate mirrored by negative charge in the substrate, yet no channel of mobile charge is formed. Consequently, no current flows from the source to the drain, and the MOSFET remains in the off state.\n\nTo prevent any current from flowing through the source-substrate and drain-substrate junctions in this mode, the substrate itself is also connected to zero potential, ensuring that these junctions remain reverse-biased. For simplicity, this connection is not shown in the diagrams.\n\nAs the gate voltage ($V_G$) increases, more negative ions are exposed, deepening the depletion region beneath the oxide. However, this does not mean the transistor will never turn on. If $V_G$ becomes sufficiently positive, free electrons are attracted to the oxide-silicon interface, establishing a conductive channel [Fig. 6.5(c)]. We then say the MOSFET is in the on state. The gate voltage at which the channel starts to form is known as the \"threshold voltage,\" $V_{TH}$, and typically ranges from 300 mV to 500 mV. It is noteworthy that the electrons are sourced from the $n^+$ source and drain regions and are not dependent on the substrate.\n\nAn intriguing aspect of the MOSFET is that the gate terminal draws no (low-frequency) current. Positioned atop the oxide layer, the gate acts as one plate of a capacitor, insulated from the other terminals.\n\nThe conductive channel between the source (S) and drain (D) can be regarded as a resistor, the resistance value of which changes with the gate voltage. This voltage-dependent resistor, conceptually depicted in Fig. 6.6, is highly useful in both analog and digital circuits.\n\nFigure 6.6 portrays the MOSFET as a voltage-dependent resistor.\n\nAn example is provided to demonstrate the application of a MOSFET in a variable-gain circuit, adjusting signal levels based on the proximity of a cellphone to a wireless base station.\n\nThe solution involves using a MOSFET as a voltage-controlled attenuator in conjunction with a resistor, as shown in Fig. 6.7.\n\nThe output signal's magnitude decreases as the control voltage falls because the electron density in the channel diminishes, and the MOSFET's resistance ($R_M$) increases. MOSFETs are frequently employed as voltage-dependent resistors in variable-gain amplifiers.\n\nFigure 6.7 depicts the use of a MOSFET to adjust signal levels.\n\nAn exercise is presented to explore the effect of channel length on $R_M$.\n\nIn the configuration of Fig. 6.5(c), no current flows between the source and drain since both terminals are at the same potential. We now elevate the drain voltage, as shown in Fig. 6.8(a), and examine the drain current (equivalent to the source current). If $V_G<V_{TH}$, no channel exists, the device is off, and the drain current ($I_D$) is zero regardless of the drain voltage ($V_D$). Conversely, if $V_G>V_{TH}$, then $I_D>0$ [Fig. 6.8(b)]. In fact, the source-drain path may act as a simple resistor, exhibiting an $I_D-V_D$ characteristic as shown in Fig. 6.8(c). The slope of this characteristic is equal to $1/R_{on}$, where $R_{on}$ denotes the \"on-resistance\" of the transistor.\n\nOur discussion of the MOSFET's I-V characteristics thus far presents two distinct perspectives on its operation: in Fig. 6.8(b), $V_G$ varies while $V_D$ remains constant, and in Fig. 6.8(c), $V_D$ varies while $V_G$ remains constant. Each view offers valuable insights into the transistor's functioning.\n\nHow does the characteristic in Fig. 6.8(b) change with an increase in $V_G$? The higher density of electrons in the channel reduces the on-resistance, resulting in a steeper slope. This is depicted in Fig. 6.8(d), where the characteristics reinforce the concept of voltage-dependent resistance.\n\nFigures 6.8 (a), (b), (c), and (d) illustrate the MOSFET's operation with varying gate and drain voltages, the $I_D-V_G$ characteristic, the $I_D-V_D$ characteristic, and the $I_D-V_D$ characteristics for various gate voltages, respectively.\n\nRecall from Chapter 2 that charge flow in semiconductors occurs via diffusion or drift. In a MOSFET, the current results from the drift of charge due to the electric field created by the voltage source connected to the drain.\n\nThe $I_D-V_G$ and $I_D-V_D$ characteristics shown in Figs. 6.8 (b) and (c) are crucial to understanding MOS devices. The following example reinforces the concepts discussed.\n\nSketch the $I_D-V_G$ and $I_D-V_D$ characteristics for (a) different channel lengths, and (b) different oxide thicknesses.\n\nAs the channel length increases, so does the on-resistance. Thus, for $V_G>V_{TH}$, the drain current starts at lower values with increasing channel length [Fig. 6.9(a)]. Similarly, the slope of $I_D$ as a function of $V_D$ is reduced [Fig. 6.9(b)]. Therefore, minimizing the channel length is desirable to achieve higher drain currents, which is a significant trend in MOS technology development.\n\nHow does the oxide thickness, $t_{ox}$, affect the I-V characteristics? As $t_{ox}$ increases, the capacitance between the gate and the silicon substrate decreases. Hence, for a given voltage, less charge accumulates on the gate, leading to a lower electron density in the channel. Consequently, the device exhibits a higher on-resistance, resulting in less drain current for a given gate voltage [Fig. 6.9(c)] or drain voltage [Fig. 6.9(d)]. This is why the semiconductor industry has continuously strived to reduce the gate oxide thickness.\n\nFigures 6.9 (a), (b), (c), and (d) illustrate the $I_D-V_G$ and $I_D-V_D$ characteristics for different channel lengths and oxide thicknesses, respectively.\n\nAn exercise is presented to explore the effect of mobility on the on-resistance at high temperatures.\n\nWhile both the channel length and the oxide thickness impact the performance of MOSFETs, only the former is controllable by circuit designers, i.e., it can be specified in the transistor's \"layout.\" The latter, however, is determined during fabrication and remains constant for all transistors within a given technology generation.\n\nAnother MOS parameter manageable by circuit designers is the width of the transistor, the dimension perpendicular to the length [Fig. 6.10(a)]. We observe that\n\nFigure 6.10 (a) shows the dimensions of a MOSFET, with both the width (W) and length (L) under the control of circuit designers.\n\nThe graph in Fig. 6.10(b) consists of two separate plots, both illustrating the impact of gate width (W) on the drain current (I_D) characteristics of a MOSFET.\n\nFigure 6.10(c) represents a conceptual diagram illustrating the equivalence of multiple MOSFET devices connected in parallel.\n\nIncreasing the gate width (W) decreases the resistance between the source and the drain, leading to the observed trends in Fig. 6.10(b). From another perspective, a wider device can be seen as two narrower transistors in parallel, resulting in a higher drain current [Fig. 6.10(c)]. While it may be tempting to maximize W, it is essential to consider that the total gate capacitance increases with W, potentially limiting the circuit's speed. Therefore, the width of each device in the circuit must be carefully selected.\n\nOur qualitative examination of the MOSFET suggests that it acts as a voltage-dependent resistor when the gate voltage exceeds $V_{TH}$. However, in reality, the transistor operates as a current source if the drain voltage is sufficiently positive. To comprehend this effect, we make two observations: (1) to form a channel, the potential difference between the gate and the oxide-silicon interface must exceed $V_{TH}$; (2) if the drain voltage remains higher than the source voltage, the voltage at each point along the channel increases as we move from the source towards the drain. This effect is illustrated in Fig. 6.11(a) and arises from the gradual voltage drop along the channel resistance. Since the gate voltage is constant (the gate is conductive but carries no current), and since the potential at the oxide-silicon interface rises from the source to the drain, the potential difference between the gate and the oxide-silicon interface decreases along the channel [Fig. 6.11(b)]. The electron density in the channel follows the same trend, reaching a minimum at the channel's end ($x=L$).\n\nFigures 6.11 (a) and (b) illustrate the channel potential variation and the gate-substrate voltage difference along the channel, respectively.\n\nIf the drain voltage is high enough to produce $V_G-V_D \\leq V_{TH}$, the channel disappears near the drain. We then say that the gate-substrate potential difference is insufficient at $x=L$ to attract electrons, and the channel is \"pinched off\" [Fig. 6.12(a)].\n\nWhat happens if $V_D$ exceeds $V_G-V_{TH}$? Since $V(x)$ now ranges from 0 at $x=0$ to $V_D>V_G-V_{TH}$ at $x=L$, the voltage difference between the gate and the substrate falls to $V_{TH}$ at some point $L_1<L$ [Fig. 6.12(b)]. The device therefore contains no channel between $L_1$ and $L$. However, the device still conducts: as illustrated in Fig. 6.12(c), once electrons reach the end of the channel, they encounter the high electric field in the depletion region surrounding the drain junction and are swiftly swept towards the drain terminal. Nonetheless, as shown in the next section, the drain voltage no longer significantly affects the current, and the MOSFET acts as a constant current source, similar to a bipolar transistor in the forward active region. It is important to note that the source-substrate and drain-substrate junctions carry no current."

    "text": "The analysis of the simple structures depicted in Figs. 6.1 and 6.2 indicates that a MOSFET may permit current flow between the source and drain when a channel of electrons is formed by setting the gate voltage to a sufficiently positive level. Furthermore, it is anticipated that the current's magnitude can be regulated by adjusting the gate voltage. Our examination will validate these hypotheses and also unveil additional nuanced effects within the device. It is important to note that the gate terminal does not draw any (low-frequency) current since it is separated from the channel by an oxide layer.\n\nGiven that the MOSFET has three terminals, we might encounter numerous combinations of terminal voltages and currents. However, because the (low-frequency) gate current is zero, our primary focus is on the current flowing between the source and the drain. We need to investigate how this current depends on the gate voltage (for instance, with a constant drain voltage) and on the drain voltage (for instance, with a constant gate voltage). These concepts will become clearer in the following discussion.\n\nConsider first the configuration presented in Fig. 6.5(a), where the source and drain are grounded, and the gate voltage is altered. Although this circuit may not seem particularly useful, it offers valuable insights. Remember from Fig. 6.1(b) that as the gate voltage ($V_G$) increases, the positive charge on the gate must be balanced by an equal negative charge in the substrate. While we mentioned in Section 6.1 that electrons are drawn to the interface, another phenomenon occurs before the channel forms. As $V_G$ rises from zero, the positive charge on the gate repels the holes in the substrate, thereby exposing negative ions and creating a depletion region [Fig. 6.5(b)].\n\nFigure 6.5 (a) shows a MOSFET with a gate voltage applied, (b) illustrates the formation of a depletion region, and (c) depicts the formation of a channel.\n\nKeep in mind that the device still behaves as a capacitor—positive charge on the gate is mirrored by negative charge in the substrate—but no channel of mobile charge is formed yet. Consequently, no current can flow from the source to the drain. We refer to this state as the MOSFET being \"off.\"\n\nCan the source-substrate and drain-substrate junctions conduct current in this mode? To prevent this, the substrate itself is also connected to zero, ensuring that these diodes are not forward-biased. For simplicity, this connection is not shown in the diagrams.\n\nWhat occurs as $V_G$ increases? To balance the charge on the gate, more negative ions are exposed, and the depletion region beneath the oxide grows deeper. Does this imply that the transistor never turns on? Fortunately, if $V_G$ becomes sufficiently positive, free electrons are attracted to the oxide-silicon interface, creating a conductive channel [Fig. 6.5(c)]. We say the MOSFET is \"on.\" The gate potential at which the channel starts to form is known as the \"threshold voltage,\" $V_{TH}$, and typically ranges from 300 mV to 500 mV. Note that the electrons are supplied by the $n^+$ source and drain regions, not by the substrate.\n\nIt is intriguing to observe that the gate terminal of the MOSFET does not draw any (low-frequency) current. Positioned above the oxide, the gate remains isolated from the other terminals and functions merely as one plate of a capacitor.\n\nMOSFET as a Variable Resistor The conductive channel between the source (S) and drain (D) can be regarded as a resistor. Moreover, since the electron density in the channel must increase as $V_G$ becomes more positive, the value of this resistor changes with the gate voltage. As conceptually illustrated in Fig. 6.6, this voltage-dependent resistor is extremely useful in analog and digital circuits.\n\nFigure 6.6 shows the MOSFET viewed as a voltage-dependent resistor.\n\nExample 6.1\n\nNear a wireless base station, the signal received by a cellphone may become very strong, potentially \"saturating\" the circuits and impairing proper operation. Design a variable-gain circuit that reduces the signal level as the cellphone approaches the base station.\n\nSolution A MOSFET can be used to form a voltage-controlled attenuator in conjunction with a resistor, as shown in Fig. 6.7.\n\nSince\n\n$$\n\\frac{v_{\\text {out }}}{v_{\\text {in }}}=\\frac{R_{1}}{R_{M}+R_{1}}\n$$\n\nthe output signal decreases as the control voltage falls because the electron density in the channel diminishes, and $R_M$ increases. MOSFETs are commonly used as voltage-dependent resistors in \"variable-gain amplifiers.\"\n\nFigure 6.7 illustrates the use of a MOSFET to adjust signal levels.\n\nExercise How does $R_M$ change if the channel length is doubled?\n\nIn the configuration of Fig. 6.5(c), no current flows between the source and drain because both terminals are at the same potential. We now elevate the drain voltage, as shown in Fig. 6.8(a), and examine the drain current (equal to the source current). If $V_G<V_{TH}$, no channel exists, the device is off, and $I_D=0$ regardless of the drain voltage. Conversely, if $V_G>V_{TH}$, then $I_D>0$ [Fig. 6.8(b)]. In fact, the source-drain path may act as a simple resistor, yielding the $I_D-V_D$ characteristic shown in Fig. 6.8(c). The slope of the characteristic is equal to $1/R_{\\text {on}}$, where $R_{\\text {on}}$ denotes the \"on-resistance\" of the transistor.\n\nOur brief discussion of the MOS I-V characteristics thus far has highlighted two distinct perspectives on the operation: in Fig. 6.8(b), $V_G$ is varied while $V_D$ remains constant, and in Fig. 6.8(c), $V_D$ is varied while $V_G$ remains constant. Each perspective provides valuable insights into the transistor's operation.\n\nHow does the characteristic of Fig. 6.8(b) change if $V_G$ increases? The higher electron density in the channel reduces the on-resistance, resulting in a steeper slope. As depicted in Fig. 6.8(d), these characteristics reinforce the concept of voltage-dependent resistance.\n\nFigure 6.8 (a) shows a MOSFET with gate and drain voltages, (b) presents the $I_D-V_G$ characteristic, (c) displays the $I_D-V_D$ characteristic, and (d) shows the $I_D-V_D$ characteristics for various gate voltages.\n\nRecall from Chapter 2 that charge flow in semiconductors occurs through diffusion or drift. What about the transport mechanism in a MOSFET? Since the voltage source connected to the drain generates an electric field along the channel, the current results from the drift of charge.\n\nThe $I_D-V_G$ and $I_D-V_D$ characteristics shown in Figs. 6.8 (b) and (c), respectively, play a crucial role in our understanding of MOS devices. The following example reinforces the concepts we have studied thus far.\n\nSketch the $I_D-V_G$ and $I_D-V_D$ characteristics for (a) different channel lengths, and (b) different oxide thicknesses.\n\nSolution As the channel length increases, so does the on-resistance. Thus, for $V_G>V_{TH}$, the drain current starts at lower values as the channel length increases [Fig. 6.9(a)]. Similarly, $I_D$ exhibits a smaller slope as a function of $V_D$ [Fig. 6.9(b)]. It is therefore desirable to minimize the channel length to achieve large drain currents—an important trend in MOS technology development.\n\nHow does the oxide thickness, $t_{\\text {ox}}$, affect the I-V characteristics? As $t_{\\text {ox}}$ increases, the capacitance between the gate and the silicon substrate decreases. Thus, from $Q=C V$, we note that a given voltage results in less charge on the gate and hence a lower electron density in the channel. Consequently, the device experiences a higher on-resistance, producing less drain current for a given gate voltage [Fig. 6.9(c)] or drain voltage [Fig. 6.9(d)]. For this reason, the semiconductor industry has continually reduced the gate oxide thickness.\n\nFigure 6.9 (a) shows the $I_D-V_G$ characteristics for different channel lengths, (b) presents the $I_D-V_D$ characteristics for different channel lengths, (c) displays the $I_D-V_G$ characteristics for different oxide thicknesses, and (d) shows the $I_D-V_D$ characteristics for different oxide thicknesses.\n\nExercise How does the on-resistance change if the mobility decreases at high temperatures?\n\nWhile both the length and the oxide thickness affect the performance of MOSFETs, only the former is under the circuit designer's control—it can be specified in the \"layout\" of the transistor. The latter, on the other hand, is defined during fabrication and remains constant for all transistors in a given technology generation.\n\nAnother MOS parameter controlled by circuit designers is the width of the transistor, the dimension perpendicular to the length [Fig. 6.10(a)]. We therefore observe that\n\nFigure 6.10 (a) shows the dimensions of a MOSFET ($W$ and $L$ are under the circuit designer's control), (b) presents the $I_D$ characteristics for different values of $W$, and (c) illustrates the equivalence to devices in parallel.\n\nHow does the gate width impact the I-V characteristics? As $W$ increases, so does the channel width, thereby reducing the resistance between the source and the drain and yielding the trends depicted in Fig. 6.10(b). From another perspective, a wider device can be viewed as two narrower transistors in parallel, producing a high drain current [Fig. 6.10(c)]. We might then assume that $W$ should be maximized, but we must also consider that the total gate capacitance increases with $W$, potentially limiting the speed of the circuit. Thus, the width of each device in the circuit must be carefully selected.\n\nChannel Pinch-Off Our qualitative study of the MOSFET thus far suggests that the device acts as a voltage-dependent resistor if the gate voltage exceeds $V_{TH}$. In reality, however, the transistor operates as a current source if the drain voltage is sufficiently positive. To understand this effect, we make two observations: (1) to form a channel, the potential difference between the gate and the oxide-silicon interface must exceed $V_{TH}$; (2) if the drain voltage remains higher than the source voltage, then the voltage at each point along the channel with respect to ground increases as we move from the source towards the drain. As illustrated in Fig. 6.11(a), this effect arises from the gradual voltage drop along the channel resistance. Since the gate voltage is constant (because the gate is conductive but carries no current in any direction), and since the potential at the oxide-silicon interface rises from the source to the drain, the potential difference between the gate and the oxide-silicon interface decreases along the $x$-axis [Fig. 6.11(b)]. The density of electrons in the channel follows the same trend, reaching a minimum at $x=L$.\n\nFigure 6.11 (a) shows the channel potential variation, and (b) presents the gate-substrate voltage difference along the channel.\n\nFrom these observations, we conclude that if the drain voltage is high enough to produce $V_G-V_D \\leq V_{TH}$, then the channel ceases to exist near the drain. We say the gate-substrate potential difference is not sufficient at $x=L$ to attract electrons, and the channel is \"pinched off\" [Fig. 6.12(a)].\n\nWhat happens if $V_D$ rises even higher than $V_G-V_{TH}$? Since $V(x)$ now ranges from 0 at $x=0$ to $V_D>V_G-V_{TH}$ at $x=L$, the voltage difference between the gate and the substrate falls to $V_{TH}$ at some point $L_1<L$ [Fig. 6.12(b)]. The device therefore contains no channel between $L_1$ and $L$. Does this mean the transistor cannot conduct current? No, the device still conducts: as illustrated in Fig. 6.12(c), once the electrons reach the end of the channel, they encounter the high electric field in the depletion region surrounding the drain junction and are rapidly swept to the drain terminal. Nonetheless, as shown in the next section, the drain voltage no longer significantly affects the current, and the MOSFET acts as a constant current source—similar to a bipolar transistor in the forward active region. Note that the source-substrate and drain-substrate junctions carry no current.\n\nFigure 6.12 (a) shows the pinchoff condition, (b) presents the variation of length with drain voltage, and (c) provides a detailed operation near the drain."

    "text": "The rephrased text is as follows:\n\n---\n\n**Channel Charge Density Analysis**\n\nOur analysis requires an understanding of the channel charge (i.e., free electrons) per unit length, known as the \"charge density.\" From the relationship $Q = CV$, we infer that if $C$ represents the gate capacitance per unit length and $V$ is the voltage difference between the gate and the channel, then $Q$ is the charge density we seek. Denoting the gate capacitance per unit area by $C_{ox}$ (in units of $\\mathrm{F} / \\mathrm{m}^{2}$ or $\\mathrm{fF} / \\mu \\mathrm{m}^{2}$), we express $C$ as $WC_{ox}$ to consider the transistor width (Fig. 6.13). Additionally, we have $V = V_{GS} - V_{TH}$ because no mobile charge exists when $V_{GS} < V_{TH}$. (Hereafter, both gate and drain voltages are referenced to the source.) Therefore, the charge density $Q$ is given by:\n\n$$\nQ = WC_{ox}(V_{GS} - V_{TH}) \\tag{6.2}\n$$\n\n$Q$ is expressed in coulombs per meter. Now, referring to Fig. 6.11(a), we observe that the channel voltage varies along the transistor's length, with the charge density decreasing from source to drain. Hence, Eq. (6.2) holds true only near the source terminal, where the channel potential is nearly zero. As shown in Fig. 6.14, we denote the channel potential at position $x$ as $V(x)$ and write:\n\n$$\nQ(x) = WC_{ox}[V_{GS} - V(x) - V_{TH}] \\tag{6.3}\n$$\n\nHere, $V(x)$ ranges from 0 to $V_{D}$ if the channel is not pinched off.\n\n**Drain Current Relationship**\n\nHow does the mobile charge density relate to the current? Consider a semiconductor bar with a uniform charge density $Q$ per unit length, carrying a current $I$ (Fig. 6.15). From Chapter 2, we know that (1) $I$ is the total charge passing through the bar's cross-section in one second, and (2) if carriers move at a velocity of $v$ m/s, then the charge within $v$ meters along the bar passes through the cross-section in one second. Since the charge within $v$ meters equals $Qv$, we have:\n\n$$\nI = Qv \\tag{6.4}\n$$\n\n**Velocity and Current**\n\nAs explained in Chapter 2, the carrier velocity $v$ is given by:\n\n$$\nv = -\\mu_{n} E \\tag{6.5}\nv = +\\mu_{n} \\frac{dV}{dx} \\tag{6.6}\n$$\n\nwhere $dV/dx$ is the voltage derivative at a given point. Combining Eqs. (6.3), (6.4), and (6.6), we find:\n\n$$\nI_{D} = WC_{ox}[V_{GS} - V(x) - V_{TH}] \\mu_{n} \\frac{dV(x)}{dx} \\tag{6.7}\n$$\n\nInterestingly, since $I_{D}$ must remain constant along the channel, $V(x)$ and $dV/dx$ must vary such that the product of $[V_{GS} - V(x) - V_{TH}]$ and $dV/dx$ is independent of $x$.\n\nOur immediate goal is to find an expression for $I_{D}$ in terms of terminal voltages. Thus, we write:\n\n$$\n\\int_{x=0}^{x=L} I_{D} dx = \\int_{V(x)=0}^{V(x)=V_{DS}} \\mu_{n} C_{ox} W[V_{GS} - V(x) - V_{TH}] dV \\tag{6.8}\n$$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$$\nI_{D} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}[2(V_{GS} - V_{TH})V_{DS} - V_{DS}^2] \\tag{6.9}\n$$\n\nExamining Eq. (6.9), we note that the linear dependence of $I_{D}$ on $\\mu_{n}$, $C_{ox}$, and $W/L$ is expected: higher mobility results in greater current for a given $V_{DS}$; higher gate oxide capacitance leads to a larger electron density for a given $V_{GS}$; and a larger $W/L$ (device \"aspect ratio\") is akin to placing more transistors in parallel [Fig. 6.10(c)]. Furthermore, for a constant $V_{GS}$, $I_{D}$ varies parabolically with $V_{DS}$ (Fig. 6.16), reaching a maximum of:\n\n$$\nI_{D,\\max} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}(V_{GS} - V_{TH})^2 \\tag{6.10}\n$$\n\nat $V_{DS} = V_{GS} - V_{TH}$. It is common to express $W/L$ as a ratio, e.g., $5 \\mu \\mathrm{m} / 0.18 \\mu \\mathrm{m}$, to highlight the choice of $W$ and $L$. Although the ratio appears in many MOS equations, the individual values of $W$ and $L$ are crucial in most cases. For example, if both $W$ and $L$ are doubled, the ratio remains unchanged, but the gate capacitance increases.\n\n**Example: Plotting $I_{D}-V_{DS}$ Characteristics**\n\nPlot the $I_{D}-V_{DS}$ characteristics for different $V_{GS}$ values. As $V_{GS}$ increases, both $I_{D,\\max}$ and $V_{GS} - V_{TH}$ increase. The characteristics exhibit maxima that follow a parabolic shape themselves because $I_{D,\\max} \\propto (V_{GS} - V_{TH})^2$ (Fig. 6.17).\n\n**Nonlinear Behavior and Small $V_{DS}$ Approximation**\n\nThe nonlinear relationship between $I_{D}$ and $V_{DS}$ indicates that the transistor cannot generally be modeled as a simple linear resistor. However, if $V_{DS} \\ll 2(V_{GS} - V_{TH})$, Eq. (6.9) simplifies to:\n\n$$\nI_{D} \\approx \\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}(V_{GS} - V_{TH})V_{DS} \\tag{6.11}\n$$\n\nshowing linear $I_{D}-V_{DS}$ behavior for a given $V_{GS}$. The equivalent on-resistance is given by $V_{DS} / I_{D}$:\n\n$$\nR_{on} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}(V_{GS} - V_{TH})} \\tag{6.12}\n$$\n\nAs predicted, Eq. (6.12) suggests that the on-resistance can be controlled by the gate-source voltage. For $V_{GS} = V_{TH}$, $R_{on} = \\infty$, meaning the device can operate as an electronic switch.\n\n**Cordless Telephone Antenna Configuration**\n\nIn a cordless telephone, a single antenna is used for both reception and transmission. The system is designed to receive signals for half of the time and transmit for the other half. Thus, the antenna alternately connects to the receiver and transmitter in regular intervals, e.g., every 20 ms (Fig. 6.19). An electronic antenna switch is necessary for this operation.\n\n**Example: Minimum Aspect Ratio for Antenna Switch**\n\nIn the cordless phone of Example 6.4, the switch connecting the transmitter to the antenna must minimally attenuate the signal, e.g., by no more than 10%. If $V_{DD} = 1.8 \\mathrm{~V}$, $\\mu_{n} C_{ox} = 100 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} / \\mathrm{V}^{2}$, and $V_{TH} = 0.4 \\mathrm{~V}$, determine the minimum required aspect ratio of the switch. Assume the antenna can be modeled as a $50-\\Omega$ resistor.\n\nThe on-resistance $R_{on}$ must satisfy:\n\n$$\nR_{on} \\leq 5.6 \\Omega \\tag{6.14}\n$$\n\nSetting $V_{GS}$ to the maximum value $V_{DD}$, we obtain from Eq. (6.12):\n\n$$\n\\frac{W}{L} \\geq 1276 \\tag{6.15}\n$$\n\n**Triode and Saturation Regions**\n\nEq. (6.9) expresses the drain current in terms of terminal voltages, suggesting that the current decreases for $V_{DS} > V_{GS} - V_{TH}$. We say the device operates in the \"triode region\" (or \"linear region\") if $V_{DS} < V_{GS} - V_{TH}$ (the rising section of the parabola). We also use the term \"deep triode region\" for $V_{DS} \\ll 2(V_{GS} - V_{TH})$, where the transistor acts as a resistor.\n\nIn the triode region, the drain current increases with $V_{DS}$. This region is characterized by a parabolic rise in current as $V_{DS}$ is less than $V_{GS} - V_{TH}$. The equation governing this region is shown as \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} (V_{GS} - V_{TH})^2 \\), indicating the dependence of $I_D$ on these parameters.\n\nOnce $V_{DS}$ exceeds $V_{GS} - V_{TH}$, the device enters the saturation region, where the drain current becomes constant, illustrating the saturation behavior of the MOSFET. This is because the channel experiences pinch-off, and further increases in $V_{DS}$ do not significantly affect the current.\n\nThe drain current reaches \"saturation,\" that is, becomes constant for $V_{DS} > V_{GS} - V_{TH}$ (Fig. 6.21). To understand why, recall that the channel experiences pinch-off if $V_{DS} = V_{GS} - V_{TH}$. Thus, further increases in $V_{DS}$ simply shift the pinch-off point slightly toward the drain. Also, recall that Eqs. (6.7) and (6.8) are valid only where channel charge exists. It follows that the integration in Eq. (6.8) must encompass only the channel, i.e., from $x=0$ to $x=L_{1}$ in Fig. 6.12(b), and be modified to:\n\n$$\n\\int_{x=0}^{x=L_{1}} I_{D} dx = \\int_{V(x)=0}^{V(x)=V_{GS}-V_{TH}} \\mu_{n} C_{ox} W[V_{GS} - V(x) - V_{TH}] dV \\tag{6.16}\n$$\n\nConsequently, the saturation current is given by:\n\n$$\nI_{D} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L_{1}}(V_{GS} - V_{TH})^2 \\tag{6.17}\n$$\n\nThis result is independent of $V_{DS}$ and identical to $I_{D,\\max}$ in Eq. (6.10) if we assume $L_{1} \\approx L$. The quantity $V_{GS} - V_{TH}$, known as the \"overdrive voltage,\" plays a key role in MOS circuits. MOSFETs are sometimes called \"square-law\" devices to emphasize the relationship between $I_{D}$ and the overdrive. For simplicity, we hereafter denote $L_{1}$ with $L$.\n\nThe I-V characteristic of Fig. 6.21 resembles that of bipolar devices, with the triode and saturation regions in MOSFETs appearing similar to saturation and forward active regions in bipolar transistors, respectively. It is unfortunate that the term \"saturation\" refers to completely different regions in MOS and bipolar I-V characteristics.\n\n**Example: Calculating Bias Current and Drain Voltage Change**\n\nCalculate the bias current of $M_{1}$ in Fig. 6.23. Assume $\\mu_{n} C_{ox} = 100 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} / \\mathrm{V}^{2}$ and $V_{TH} = 0.4 \\mathrm{~V}$. If the gate voltage increases by 10 mV, what is the change in the drain voltage?\n\nAssuming $M_{1}$ is saturated, with $V_{GS} = 1 \\mathrm{~V}$, we find:\n\n$$\nI_{D} = 200 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\tag{6.19}\n$$\n\nCalculating the drain potential:\n\n$$\nV_{X} = 0.8 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{6.21}\n$$\n\nThe drain voltage is lower than the gate voltage, but by less than $V_{TH}$. This indicates that $M_{1}$ operates in saturation.\n\nIf the gate voltage increases to 1.01 V, then:\n\n$$\nI_{D} = 206.7 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\tag{6.22}\n$$\n\nlowering $V_{X}$ to:\n\n$$\nV_{X} = 0.766 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{6.23}\n$$\n\n$M_{1}$ remains saturated. The $34-\\mathrm{mV}$ change in $V_{X}$ reveals that the circuit can amplify the input.\n\n**Contrasts Between Bipolar and MOS Devices**\n\nSeveral points of contrast exist between bipolar and MOS devices. (1) A bipolar transistor with $V_{BE} = V_{CE}$ resides at the edge of the active region, whereas a MOSFET approaches the edge of saturation if its drain voltage falls below its gate voltage by $V_{TH}$. (2) Bipolar devices exhibit an exponential $I_{C}-V_{BE}$ characteristic, while MOSFETs display a square-law dependence. (3) In bipolar circuits, most transistors have the same dimensions and hence the same $I_{S}$, whereas in MOS circuits, the aspect ratio of each device may be chosen differently to satisfy design requirements.

    "text": "Based on our qualitative study, we can now describe the behavior of MOSFETs in terms of their terminal voltages.\n\nOur analysis requires an expression for the channel charge (i.e., free electrons) per unit length, known as the \"charge density.\" From the equation $Q = CV$, we observe that if $C$ is the gate capacitance per unit length and $V$ is the voltage difference between the gate and the channel, then $Q$ represents the desired charge density. Denoting the gate capacitance per unit area by $C_{ox}$ (expressed in $\\mathrm{F}/\\mathrm{m}^2$ or $\\mathrm{fF}/\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2$), we write $C = WC_{ox}$ to account for the width of the transistor. Additionally, we have $V = V_{GS} - V_{TH}$ since no mobile charge exists for $V_{GS} < V_{TH}$. (Hereafter, we denote both the gate and drain voltages with respect to the source.) It follows that\n\n$$\nQ = WC_{ox}(V_{GS} - V_{TH}). \\tag{6.2}\n$$\n\nNote that $Q$ is expressed in coulombs/meter. Now, recall from Figure 6.11(a) that the channel voltage varies along the length of the transistor, and the charge density decreases as we move from the source to the drain. Thus, Equation (6.2) is valid only near the source terminal, where the channel potential remains close to zero. As shown in Figure 6.14, we denote the channel potential at $x$ by $V(x)$ and write\n\n$$\nQ(x) = WC_{ox}[V_{GS} - V(x) - V_{TH}], \\tag{6.3}\n$$\n\nnoting that $V(x)$ goes from zero to $V_{D}$ if the channel is not pinched off.\n\nDrain Current\nWhat is the relationship between the mobile charge density and the current? Consider a bar of semiconductor with a uniform charge density (per unit length) equal to $Q$ and carrying a current $I$ (Figure 6.15). Note from Chapter 2 that (1) $I$ is given by the total charge that passes through the cross-section of the bar in one second, and (2) if the carriers move with a velocity of $v \\mathrm{~m}/\\mathrm{s}$, then the charge enclosed in $v$ meters along the bar passes through the cross-section in one second. Since the charge enclosed in $v$ meters is equal to $Q \\cdot v$, we have\n\n$$\nI = Q \\cdot v. \\tag{6.4}\n$$\n\nAs explained in Chapter 2,\n\n$$\nv = -\\mu_{n} E, \\tag{6.5}\n$$\n\n$$\nv = +\\mu_{n} \\frac{dV}{dx}. \\tag{6.6}\n$$\n\nCombining Equations (6.3), (6.4), and (6.6), we obtain\n\n$$\nI_{D} = WC_{ox}[V_{GS} - V(x) - V_{TH}] \\mu_{n} \\frac{dV(x)}{dx}. \\tag{6.7}\n$$\n\nInterestingly, since $I_{D}$ must remain constant along the channel, $V(x)$ and $\\frac{dV}{dx}$ must vary such that the product of $V_{GS} - V(x) - V_{TH}$ and $\\frac{dV}{dx}$ is independent of $x$.\n\nWhile it is possible to solve the above differential equation to obtain $V(x)$ in terms of $I_{D}$ (and the reader is encouraged to do so), our immediate need is to find an expression for $I_{D}$ in terms of the terminal voltages. To this end, we write\n\n$$\n\\int_{x=0}^{x=L} I_{D} dx = \\int_{V(x)=0}^{V(x)=V_{DS}} \\mu_{n} C_{ox} W[V_{GS} - V(x) - V_{TH}] dV. \\tag{6.8}\n$$\n\nThat is,\n\n$$\nI_{D} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}[2(V_{GS} - V_{TH})V_{DS} - V_{DS}^2]. \\tag{6.9}\n$$\n\nWe now examine this important equation from different perspectives to gain more insight. First, the linear dependence of $I_{D}$ upon $\\mu_{n}, C_{ox}$, and $\\frac{W}{L}$ is to be expected: a higher mobility yields a greater current for a given drain-source voltage; a higher gate oxide capacitance leads to a larger electron density in the channel for a given gate-source voltage; and a larger $\\frac{W}{L}$ (called the device \"aspect ratio\") is equivalent to placing more transistors in parallel [Figure 6.10(c)]. Second, for a constant $V_{GS}$, $I_{D}$ varies parabolically with $V_{DS}$ (Figure 6.16), reaching a maximum of\n\n$$\nI_{D, \\max} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}(V_{GS} - V_{TH})^2 \\tag{6.10}\n$$\n\nat $V_{DS} = V_{GS} - V_{TH}$. It is common to write $\\frac{W}{L}$ as the ratio of two values, e.g., $5 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}/0.18 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ (rather than 27.8) to emphasize the choice of $W$ and $L$. While only the ratio appears in many MOS equations, the individual values of $W$ and $L$ also become critical in most cases. For example, if both $W$ and $L$ are doubled, the ratio remains unchanged but the gate capacitance increases.\n\nExample\nPlot the $I_{D}-V_{DS}$ characteristics for different values of $V_{GS}$.\n\nSolution\nAs $V_{GS}$ increases, so do $I_{D, \\max}$ and $V_{GS} - V_{TH}$. Illustrated in Figure 6.17, the characteristics exhibit maxima that follow a parabolic shape themselves because $I_{D, \\max} \\propto (V_{GS} - V_{TH})^2$.\n\nExercise\nWhat happens to the above plots if $t_{ox}$ is halved?\n\nThe nonlinear relationship between $I_{D}$ and $V_{DS}$ reveals that the transistor cannot generally be modeled as a simple linear resistor. However, if $V_{DS} \\ll 2(V_{GS} - V_{TH})$, Equation (6.9) reduces to:\n\n$$\nI_{D} \\approx \\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}(V_{GS} - V_{TH}) V_{DS}. \\tag{6.11}\n$$\n\nThis exhibits a linear $I_{D}-V_{DS}$ behavior for a given $V_{GS}$. In fact, the equivalent on-resistance is given by $V_{DS}/I_{D}$:\n\n$$\nR_{on} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}(V_{GS} - V_{TH})}. \\tag{6.12}\n$$\n\nFrom another perspective, at small $V_{DS}$ (near the origin), the parabolas in Figure 6.17 can be approximated by straight lines having different slopes (Figure 6.18).\n\nAs predicted in Section 6.2.1, Equation (6.12) suggests that the on-resistance can be controlled by the gate-source voltage. In particular, for $V_{GS} = V_{TH}$, $R_{on} = \\infty$, i.e., the device can operate as an electronic switch.\n\nA cordless telephone incorporates a single antenna for reception and transmission. Explain how the system must be configured.\n\nSolution\nThe system is designed so that the phone receives for half of the time and transmits for the other half. Thus, the antenna is alternately connected to the receiver and the transmitter in regular intervals, e.g., every 20 ms (Figure 6.19). An electronic antenna switch is therefore necessary here.\n\nExercise\nSome systems employ two antennas, each of which receives and transmits signals. How many switches are needed?\n\nIn most applications, it is desirable to achieve a low on-resistance for MOS switches. The circuit designer must therefore maximize $\\frac{W}{L}$ and $V_{GS}$. The following example illustrates this point.\n\nExample\nIn the cordless phone of Example 6.4, the switch connecting the transmitter to the antenna must negligibly attenuate the signal, e.g., by no more than $10\\%$. If $V_{DD} = 1.8 \\mathrm{~V}$, $\\mu_{n} C_{ox} = 100 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}/\\mathrm{V}^2$, and $V_{TH} = 0.4 \\mathrm{~V}$, determine the minimum required aspect ratio of the switch. Assume the antenna can be modeled as a $50-\\Omega$ resistor.\n\nSolution\nAs depicted in Figure 6.20, we wish to ensure\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{\\text{out}}}{V_{\\text{in}}} \\geq 0.9 \\tag{6.13}\n$$\n\nand hence\n\n$$\nR_{on} \\leq 5.6 \\Omega. \\tag{6.14}\n$$\n\nSetting $V_{GS}$ to the maximum value, $V_{DD}$, we obtain from Equation (6.12),\n\n$$\n\\frac{W}{L} \\geq 1276. \\tag{6.15}\n$$\n\n(Since wide transistors introduce substantial capacitance in the signal path, this choice of $\\frac{W}{L}$ may still attenuate high-frequency signals.)\n\nExercise\nWhat $\\frac{W}{L}$ is necessary if $V_{DD}$ drops to 1.2 V?\n\nTriode and Saturation Regions\nEquation (6.9) expresses the drain current in terms of the device terminal voltages, implying that the current begins to fall for $V_{DS} > V_{GS} - V_{TH}$. We say the device operates in the \"triode region\" (also called the \"linear region\") if $V_{DS} < V_{GS} - V_{TH}$ (the rising section of the parabola). We also use the term \"deep triode region\" for $V_{DS} \\ll 2(V_{GS} - V_{TH})$, where the transistor operates as a resistor.\n\nIn the triode region, which is labeled on the left side of the graph, the drain current increases with an increase in $V_{DS}$. This region is characterized by a parabolic rise in the current as $V_{DS}$ is less than $V_{GS} - V_{TH}$ (gate-source voltage minus threshold voltage). The equation governing this region is shown as $\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} (V_{GS} - V_{TH})^2$, indicating the dependence of $I_{D}$ on these parameters.\n\nOnce $V_{DS}$ exceeds $V_{GS} - V_{TH}$, the device enters the saturation region, marked on the right side of the graph. Here, the drain current becomes constant, illustrating the saturation behavior of the MOSFET. This is because the channel experiences pinch-off, and further increases in $V_{DS}$ do not significantly affect the current.\n\nThe graph is divided by a vertical dashed line at $V_{DS} = V_{GS} - V_{TH}$, clearly separating the triode region from the saturation region. The saturation region shows a flat line indicating that the current remains constant despite increases in $V_{DS}$.\n\nIn reality, the drain current reaches \"saturation,\" that is, becomes constant for $V_{DS} > V_{GS} - V_{TH}$ (Figure 6.21). To understand why, recall from Figure 6.12 that the channel experiences pinch-off if $V_{DS} = V_{GS} - V_{TH}$. Thus, further increase in $V_{DS}$ simply shifts the pinch-off point slightly toward the drain. Also, recall that Equations (6.7) and (6.8) are valid only where channel charge exists. It follows that the integration in Equation (6.8) must encompass only the channel, i.e., from $x = 0$ to $x = L_{1}$ in Figure 6.12(b), and be modified to\n\n$$\n\\int_{x=0}^{x=L_{1}} I_{D} dx = \\int_{V(x)=0}^{V(x)=V_{GS} - V_{TH}} \\mu_{n} C_{ox} W[V_{GS} - V(x) - V_{TH}] dV. \\tag{6.16}\n$$\n\nNote that the upper limits correspond to the channel pinch-off point. In particular, the integral on the right-hand side is evaluated up to $V_{GS} - V_{TH}$ rather than $V_{DS}$. Consequently,\n\n$$\nI_{D} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L_{1}}(V_{GS} - V_{TH})^2, \\tag{6.17}\n$$\n\na result independent of $V_{DS}$ and identical to $I_{D, \\max}$ in Equation (6.10) if we assume $L_{1} \\approx L$. Called the \"overdrive voltage,\" the quantity $V_{GS} - V_{TH}$ plays a key role in MOS circuits. MOSFETs are sometimes called \"square-law\" devices to emphasize the relationship between $I_{D}$ and the overdrive. For the sake of brevity, we hereafter denote $L_{1}$ with $L$.\n\nThe $I-V$ characteristic of Figure 6.21 resembles that of bipolar devices, with the triode and saturation regions in MOSFETs appearing similar to saturation and forward active regions in bipolar transistors, respectively. It is unfortunate that the term \"saturation\" refers to completely different regions in MOS and bipolar $I-V$ characteristics.\n\nWe employ the conceptual illustration in Figure 6.22 to determine the region of operation. Note that the gate-drain potential difference suits this purpose, and we need not compute the gate-source and gate-drain voltages separately.\n\nExample\nCalculate the bias current of $M_{1}$ in Figure 6.23. Assume $\\mu_{n} C_{ox} = 100 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}/\\mathrm{V}^2$ and $V_{TH} = 0.4 \\mathrm{~V}$. If the gate voltage increases by 10 mV, what is the change in the drain voltage?\n\nSolution\nIt is unclear a priori in which region $M_{1}$ operates. Let us assume $M_{1}$ is saturated and proceed. Since $V_{GS} = 1 \\mathrm{~V}$,\n\n$$\nI_{D} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}(V_{GS} - V_{TH})^2 = 200 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}. \\tag{6.19}\n$$\n\nWe must check our assumption by calculating the drain potential:\n\n$$\nV_{X} = V_{DD} - R_{D} I_{D} = 0.8 \\mathrm{~V}. \\tag{6.21}\n$$\n\nThe drain voltage is lower than the gate voltage, but by less than $V_{TH}$. The illustration in Figure 6.22, therefore, indicates that $M_{1}$ indeed operates in saturation.\n\nIf the gate voltage increases to 1.01 V, then\n\n$$\nI_{D} = 206.7 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}, \\tag{6.22}\n$$\n\nlowering $V_{X}$ to\n\n$$\nV_{X} = 0.766 \\mathrm{~V}. \\tag{6.23}\n$$\n\nFortunately, $M_{1}$ is still saturated. The $34-\\mathrm{mV}$ change in $V_{X}$ reveals that the circuit can amplify the input.\n\nExercise\nWhat choice of $R_{D}$ places the transistor at the edge of the triode region?\n\nIt is instructive to identify several points of contrast between bipolar and MOS devices. (1) A bipolar transistor with $V_{BE} = V_{CE}$ resides at the edge of the active region, whereas a MOSFET approaches the edge of saturation if its drain voltage falls below its gate voltage by $V_{TH}$. (2) Bipolar devices exhibit an exponential $I_{C}-V_{BE}$ characteristic, while MOSFETs display a square-law dependence. That is, the former provide a greater transconductance than the latter (for a given bias current). (3) In bipolar circuits, most transistors have the same dimensions and hence the same $I_{S}$, whereas in MOS circuits, the aspect ratio of each device may be chosen differently to satisfy the design requirements. (4) The gate of MOSFETs draws no bias current.\n\nExample\nDetermine the value of $\\frac{W}{L}$ in Figure 6.23 that places $M_{1}$ at the edge of saturation and calculate the drain voltage change for a 1-mV change at the gate. Assume $V_{TH} = 0.4 \\mathrm{~V}$.\n\nSolution\nWith $V_{GS} = +1 \\mathrm{~V}$, the drain voltage must fall to $V_{GS} - V_{TH} = 0.6 \\mathrm{~V}$ for $M_{1}$ to enter the triode region. That is,\n\n$$\nI_{D} = \\frac{V_{DD} - V_{DS}}{R_{D}} = 240 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}. \\tag{6.25}\n$$\n\nSince $I_{D}$ scales linearly with $\\frac{W}{L}$,\n\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{W}{L}\\right|_{\\max} = \\frac{240 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}}{200 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}} \\cdot \\frac{2}{0.18} = \\frac{2.4}{0.18}. \\tag{6.27}\n$$\n\nIf $V_{GS}$ increases by 1 mV,\n\n$$\nI_{D} = 248.04 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}, \\tag{6"

Specifically, we can describe their operation in terms of their terminal voltages. To do this, we require an expression for the charge in the channel, i.e., the free electrons, per unit length, which is known as the \"charge density.\"\n\nWe derive this from the relationship \\( Q = CV \\), where \\( C \\) is the capacitance and \\( V \\) is the voltage. This relationship helps us understand the charge density, which is crucial for our subsequent derivations.

    "text": "The provided text has been rephrased while maintaining the original meaning and length:\n\n---\n\nThrough our qualitative study, we can now describe the behavior of MOSFETs based on their terminal voltages.\n\n**Channel Charge Density**\nOur analysis requires an expression for the channel charge (free electrons) per unit length, known as the \"charge density.\" From the equation $Q = CV$, we observe that if $C$ is the gate capacitance per unit length and $V$ is the voltage difference between the gate and the channel, then $Q$ represents the desired charge density. Using $C_{ox}$ to denote the gate capacitance per unit area (in $\\mathrm{F} / \\mathrm{m}^{2}$ or $\\mathrm{fF} / \\mu \\mathrm{m}^{2}$), we express $C = WC_{ox}$ to account for the transistor width (Fig. 6.13). Furthermore, we have $V = V_{GS} - V_{TH}$ since no mobile charge exists for $V_{GS} < V_{TH}$. (Hereafter, both gate and drain voltages are referenced to the source.) It follows that:\n\n$$\nQ = WC_{ox}(V_{GS} - V_{TH}) \\tag{6.2}\n$$\n\n$Q$ is expressed in coulombs per meter. Now, referring to Fig. 6.11(a), we note that the channel voltage varies along the transistor length, and the charge density decreases from source to drain. Thus, Eq. (6.2) is valid only near the source terminal, where the channel potential remains close to zero. As shown in Fig. 6.14, we denote the channel potential at $x$ by $V(x)$ and write:\n\n$$\nQ(x) = WC_{ox}[V_{GS} - V(x) - V_{TH}] \\tag{6.3}\n$$\n\nrecognizing that $V(x)$ ranges from zero to $V_{D}$ if the channel is not pinched off.\n\n**Drain Current**\nWhat is the relationship between mobile charge density and current? Consider a semiconductor bar with a uniform charge density (per unit length) equal to $Q$ and carrying a current $I$ (Fig. 6.15). As discussed in Chapter 2, (1) $I$ is the total charge passing through the bar's cross-section in one second, and (2) if carriers move with velocity $v \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$, then the charge enclosed in $v$ meters along the bar passes through the cross-section in one second. Since the charge enclosed in $v$ meters equals $Q \\cdot v$, we have:\n\n$$\nI = Q \\cdot v \\tag{6.4}\n$$\n\nCombining Eqs. (6.3), (6.4), and (6.6), we obtain:\n\n$$\nI_{D} = WC_{ox}[V_{GS} - V(x) - V_{TH}] \\mu_{n} \\frac{dV(x)}{dx} \\tag{6.7}\n$$\n\nInterestingly, since $I_{D}$ must remain constant along the channel, $V(x)$ and $\\frac{dV}{dx}$ must vary such that the product of $V_{GS} - V(x) - V_{TH}$ and $\\frac{dV}{dx}$ is independent of $x$.\n\nWhile it is possible to solve the above differential equation to obtain $V(x)$ in terms of $I_{D}$ (and readers are encouraged to do so), our immediate goal is to find an expression for $I_{D}$ in terms of the terminal voltages. To this end, we write:\n\n$$\n\\int_{x=0}^{x=L} I_{D} dx = \\int_{V(x)=0}^{V(x)=V_{DS}} \\mu_{n} C_{ox} W[V_{GS} - V(x) - V_{TH}] dV \\tag{6.8}\n$$\n\nThat is:\n\n$$\nI_{D} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}[2(V_{GS} - V_{TH}) V_{DS} - V_{DS}^{2}] \\tag{6.9}\n$$\n\nWe now examine this important equation from different perspectives to gain more insight. First, the linear dependence of $I_{D}$ on $\\mu_{n}$, $C_{ox}$, and $\\frac{W}{L}$ is expected: higher mobility yields greater current for a given drain-source voltage; higher gate oxide capacitance leads to a larger electron density in the channel for a given gate-source voltage; and a larger $\\frac{W}{L}$ (device \"aspect ratio\") is equivalent to placing more transistors in parallel [Fig. 6.10(c)]. Second, for a constant $V_{GS}$, $I_{D}$ varies parabolically with $V_{DS}$ (Fig. 6.16), reaching a maximum of:\n\n$$\nI_{D, \\max} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}(V_{GS} - V_{TH})^{2} \\tag{6.10}\n$$\n\nat $V_{DS} = V_{GS} - V_{TH}$. It is common to express $\\frac{W}{L}$ as the ratio of two values, e.g., $5 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} / 0.18 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ (instead of 27.8), to emphasize the choice of $W$ and $L$. While only the ratio appears in many MOS equations, the individual values of $W$ and $L$ also become critical in most cases. For example, if both $W$ and $L$ are doubled, the ratio remains unchanged but the gate capacitance increases.\n\nExample: Plot the $I_{D} - V_{DS}$ characteristics for different values of $V_{GS}$.\n\nSolution: As $V_{GS}$ increases, so do $I_{D, \\max}$ and $V_{GS} - V_{TH}$. As illustrated in Fig. 6.17, the characteristics exhibit maxima that follow a parabolic shape themselves because $I_{D, \\max} \\propto (V_{GS} - V_{TH})^{2}$.\n\nExercise: What happens to the above plots if $t_{ox}$ is halved?\n\nThe nonlinear relationship between $I_{D}$ and $V_{DS}$ reveals that the transistor cannot generally be modeled as a simple linear resistor. However, if $V_{DS} \\ll 2(V_{GS} - V_{TH})$, Eq. (6.9) reduces to:\n\n$$\nI_{D} \\approx \\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}(V_{GS} - V_{TH}) V_{DS} \\tag{6.11}\n$$\n\nexhibiting a linear $I_{D} - V_{DS}$ behavior for a given $V_{GS}$. In fact, the equivalent on-resistance is given by $V_{DS} / I_{D}$:\n\n$$\nR_{on} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}(V_{GS} - V_{TH})} \\tag{6.12}\n$$\n\nAs predicted in Section 6.2.1, Eq. (6.12) suggests that the on-resistance can be controlled by the gate-source voltage. In particular, for $V_{GS} = V_{TH}$, $R_{on} = \\infty$, i.e., the device can operate as an electronic switch.\n\nA cordless telephone incorporates a single antenna for reception and transmission. Explain how the system must be configured.\n\nSolution: The system is designed so that the phone receives for half of the time and transmits for the other half. Thus, the antenna is alternately connected to the receiver and the transmitter in regular intervals, e.g., every 20 ms (Fig. 6.19). An electronic antenna switch is therefore necessary.\n\nExercise: Some systems employ two antennas, each of which receives and transmits signals. How many switches are needed?\n\nExample: In the cordless phone of Example 6.4, the switch connecting the transmitter to the antenna must negligibly attenuate the signal, e.g., by no more than $10 \\%$. If $V_{DD} = 1.8 \\mathrm{~V}$, $\\mu_{n} C_{ox} = 100 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} / \\mathrm{V}^{2}$, and $V_{TH} = 0.4 \\mathrm{~V}$, determine the minimum required aspect ratio of the switch. Assume the antenna can be modeled as a $50-\\Omega$ resistor.\n\nSolution: As depicted in Fig. 6.20, we wish to ensure:\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} \\geq 0.9 \\tag{6.13}\n$$\n\nand hence:\n\n$$\nR_{on} \\leq 5.6 \\Omega \\tag{6.14}\n$$\n\nSetting $V_{GS}$ to the maximum value, $V_{DD}$, we obtain from Eq. (6.12):\n\n$$\n\\frac{W}{L} \\geq 1276 \\tag{6.15}\n$$\n\n(Since wide transistors introduce substantial capacitance in the signal path, this choice of $\\frac{W}{L}$ may still attenuate high-frequency signals.)\n\nExercise: What $\\frac{W}{L}$ is necessary if $V_{DD}$ drops to 1.2 V?\n\nTriode and Saturation Regions\nEq. (6.9) expresses the drain current in terms of the device terminal voltages, implying that the current begins to fall for $V_{DS} > V_{GS} - V_{TH}$. We say the device operates in the \"triode region\" (also called the \"linear region\") if $V_{DS} < V_{GS} - V_{TH}$ (the rising section of the parabola). We also use the term \"deep triode region\" for $V_{DS} \\ll 2(V_{GS} - V_{TH})$, where the transistor operates as a resistor.\n\nIn the triode region, which is labeled on the left side of the graph, the drain current increases with an increase in $V_{DS}$. This region is characterized by a parabolic rise in the current as $V_{DS}$ is less than $V_{GS} - V_{TH}$ (gate-source voltage minus threshold voltage). The equation governing this region is shown as $ \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} (V_{GS} - V_{TH})^2 $, indicating the dependence of $I_D$ on these parameters.\n\nOnce $V_{DS}$ exceeds $V_{GS} - V_{TH}$, the device enters the saturation region, marked on the right side of the graph. Here, the drain current becomes constant, illustrating the saturation behavior of the MOSFET. This is because the channel experiences pinch-off, and further increases in $V_{DS}$ do not significantly affect the current.\n\nThe graph is divided by a vertical dashed line at $V_{DS} = V_{GS} - V_{TH}$, clearly separating the triode region from the saturation region. The saturation region shows a flat line indicating that the current remains constant despite increases in $V_{DS}$.\n\nIn reality, the drain current reaches \"saturation,\" that is, becomes constant for $V_{DS} > V_{GS} - V_{TH}$ (Fig. 6.21). To understand why, recall from Fig. 6.12 that the channel experiences pinch-off if $V_{DS} = V_{GS} - V_{TH}$. Thus, further increase in $V_{DS}$ simply shifts the pinch-off point slightly toward the drain. Also, recall that Eqs. (6.7) and (6.8) are valid only where channel charge exists. It follows that the integration in Eq. (6.8) must encompass only the channel, i.e., from $x = 0$ to $x = L_{1}$ in Fig. 6.12(b), and be modified to:\n\n$$\n\\int_{x=0}^{x=L_{1}} I_{D} dx = \\int_{V(x)=0}^{V(x)=V_{GS} - V_{TH}} \\mu_{n} C_{ox} W[V_{GS} - V(x) - V_{TH}] dV \\tag{6.16}\n$$\n\nNote that the upper limits correspond to the channel pinch-off point. In particular, the integral on the right-hand side is evaluated up to $V_{GS} - V_{TH}$ rather than $V_{DS}$. Consequently:\n\n$$\nI_{D} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L_{1}}(V_{GS} - V_{TH})^{2} \\tag{6.17}\n$$\n\na result independent of $V_{DS}$ and identical to $I_{D, \\max}$ in Eq. (6.10) if we assume $L_{1} \\approx L$. Called the \"overdrive voltage,\" the quantity $V_{GS} - V_{TH}$ plays a key role in MOS circuits. MOSFETs are sometimes called \"square-law\" devices to emphasize the relationship between $I_{D}$ and the overdrive. For the sake of brevity, we hereafter denote $L_{1}$ with $L$.\n\nThe I-V characteristic of Fig. 6.21 resembles that of bipolar devices, with the triode and saturation regions in MOSFETs appearing similar to saturation and forward active regions in bipolar transistors, respectively. It is unfortunate that the term \"saturation\" refers to completely different regions in MOS and bipolar I-V characteristics.\n\nWe employ the conceptual illustration in Fig. 6.22 to determine the region of operation. Note that the gate-drain potential difference suits this purpose, and we need not compute the gate-source and gate-drain voltages separately.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe explosive growth of MOS technology is attributed to two factors: the ability to shrink the dimensions of the MOS device ($W$, $L$, $t_{ox}$, etc.) and the ability to integrate a greater number of MOS devices on a chip each year. The latter trend was predicted by one of Intel's founders, Gordon Moore, in 1965. He observed that the number of transistors per chip doubled every two years. Indeed, starting with 50 devices per chip in 1965, we now have reached tens of billions on memory chips and several billion on microprocessor chips. Can you think of any other product in human history that has grown so much so fast (except for Bill Gates' wealth)?\n\nMoore's Law: transistor count per chip throughout the years.\n\nWe use the conceptual illustration in Fig. 6.22 to determine the region of operation. Note that the gate-drain potential difference suits this purpose, and we need not compute the gate-source and gate-drain voltages separately.\n\nExample: Calculate the bias current of $M_{1}$ in Fig. 6.23. Assume $\\mu_{n} C_{ox} = 100 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} / \\mathrm{V}^{2}$ and $V_{TH} = 0.4 \\mathrm{~V}$. If the gate voltage increases by 10 mV, what is the change in the drain voltage?\n\nSolution: It is unclear a priori in which region $M_{1}$ operates. Let us assume $M_{1}$ is saturated and proceed. Since $V_{GS} = 1 \\mathrm{~V}$,\n\n$$\nI_{D} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}(V_{GS} - V_{TH})^{2} = 200 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\tag{6.19}\n$$\n\nWe must check our assumption by calculating the drain potential:\n\n$$\nV_{X} = V_{DD} - R_{D} I_{D} = 0.8 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{6.21}\n$$\n\nThe drain voltage is lower than the gate voltage, but by less than $V_{TH}$. The illustration in Fig. 6.22 therefore indicates that $M_{1}$ indeed operates in saturation.\n\nIf the gate voltage increases to 1.01 V, then:\n\n$$\nI_{D} = 206.7 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\tag{6.22}\n$$\n\nlowering $V_{X}$ to:\n\n$$\nV_{X} = 0.766 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{6.23}\n$$\n\nFortunately, $M_{1}$ is still saturated. The $34 \\mathrm{~mV}$ change in $V_{X}$ reveals that the circuit can amplify the input.\n\nExercise: What choice of $R_{D}$ places the transistor at the edge of the triode region?\n\nIt is instructive to identify several points of contrast between bipolar and MOS devices. (1) A bipolar transistor with $V_{BE} = V_{CE}$ resides at the edge of the active region whereas a MOSFET approaches the edge of saturation if its drain voltage falls below its gate voltage by $V_{TH}$. (2) Bipolar devices exhibit an exponential $I_{C} - V_{BE}$ characteristic while MOSFETs display a square-law dependence. That is, the former provide a greater transconductance than the latter (for a given bias current). (3) In bipolar circuits, most transistors have the same dimensions and hence the same $I_{S}$, whereas in MOS circuits, the aspect ratio of each device may be chosen differently to satisfy the design requirements. (4) The gate of MOSFETs draws no bias current.\n\nExample: Determine the value of $W / L$ in Fig. 6.23 that places $M_{1}$ at the edge of saturation and calculate the drain voltage change for a 1-mV change at the gate. Assume $V_{TH} = 0.4 \\mathrm{~V}$.\n\nSolution: With $V_{GS} = +1 \\mathrm{~V}$, the drain voltage must fall to $V_{GS} - V_{TH} = 0.6 \\mathrm{~V}$ for $M_{1}$ to enter the triode region. That is:\n\n$$\nI_{D} = \\frac{V_{DD} - V_{DS}}{R_{D}} = 240 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\tag{6.25}\n$$\n\nSince $I_{D}$ scales linearly with $W / L$,\n\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{W}{L}\\right|_{\\max} = \\frac{240 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}}{"

The equivalent on-resistance is given by \\( R_{on} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}(V_{GS} - V_{TH})} \\).\n\nThe triode region is where \\( V_{DS} < V_{GS} - V_{TH} \\), and the saturation region is where \\( V_{DS} > V_{GS} - V_{TH} \\). In the saturation region, the drain current reaches a constant value, and the MOSFET can operate as a current source. The square-law dependence of \\( I_D \\) on \\( V_{GS} - V_{TH} \\) suggests that the device can act as a voltage-controlled current source.\n\nThe I-V characteristic of a MOSFET resembles that of bipolar devices, with the triode and saturation regions in MOSFETs appearing similar to the saturation and forward active regions in bipolar transistors, respectively. The gate-drain potential difference can be used to determine the region of operation.\n\nThe explosive growth of MOS technology is attributed to the ability to shrink the dimensions of the MOS device and the ability to integrate a greater number of MOS devices on a chip each year. This trend was predicted by Gordon Moore in 1965, who observed that the number of transistors per chip doubled every two years.\n\nThe operation of a MOSFET in the triode and saturation regions can be visualized using a graph that plots the drain current \\( I_D \\) versus the gate-source voltage \\( V_{GS} \\) minus the threshold voltage \\( V_{TH} \\) and the drain-source voltage \\( V_{DS} \\). In the triode region, \\( I_D \\) increases linearly with \\( V_{DS} \\) for a given \\( V_{GS} \\) above \\( V_{TH} \\). In the saturation region, \\( I_D \\) becomes relatively constant despite further increases in \\( V_{DS} \\).\n\nA MOSFET can be used as a voltage-controlled current source in circuits. The bias current of a MOSFET can be calculated using the equation for the saturation current. The change in drain voltage for a given change in gate voltage can also be calculated.\n\nThe choice of resistor \\( R_D \\) in a MOSFET circuit can place the transistor at the edge of the triode region. The value of \\( W/L \\) that places the transistor at the edge of saturation can be calculated, and the change in drain voltage for a given change in gate voltage can also be calculated.\n\nThere are several points of contrast between bipolar and MOS devices, such as the regions of operation, the I-V characteristics, the dimensions of the devices, and the gate current."

This is because $\\lambda$ is inversely proportional to $L$: for a longer channel, the relative change in $L$ (and thus in $I_{D}$) for a given change in $V_{D S}$ is smaller (Fig. 6.26). ${ }^{10}$ (In contrast, the base width of bipolar devices cannot be adjusted by the circuit designer, resulting in a constant Early voltage for all transistors in a given technology.)\nimage_name:L1\ndescription:The image presents two diagrams illustrating the concept of channel-length modulation in MOSFETs, labeled as \"L1\" and \"L2.\" Each diagram consists of two main components: a cross-sectional view of a MOSFET and a corresponding graph of drain current (I_D) versus drain-source voltage (V_DS).\n\n1. **Identification of Components and Structure:**\n- **Cross-sectional Views:**\n- Both diagrams show a simplified cross-sectional view of a MOSFET, featuring a source and drain region separated by a channel of length L (L1 or L2). A gate is positioned above the channel.\n- The channel length is indicated by arrows labeled L1 and L2, showing the distance between the source and drain regions.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- **Channel-Length Modulation:**\n- The diagrams illustrate how the effective channel length changes under different conditions, affecting the drain current (I_D).\n- The change in channel length is represented by angled lines in the cross-sections, indicating the modulation effect.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- **Graphs of I_D vs. V_DS:**\n- Below each cross-sectional view is a graph plotting I_D (on the vertical axis) against V_DS (on the horizontal axis).\n- The solid lines in the graphs represent the actual I_D versus V_DS characteristics, while the dashed lines indicate the ideal characteristics without channel-length modulation.\n- The left diagram with L1 shows a more pronounced modulation effect compared to the right diagram with L2, demonstrating how a longer channel reduces the modulation effect.\n\nOverall, the diagrams highlight the impact of channel-length modulation on MOSFET performance, showing that longer channel lengths (L2) result in reduced modulation effects and more stable I_D characteristics.\nimage_name:L2\ndescription:The graph in Figure 6.26 illustrates the concept of channel-length modulation in MOSFETs, presenting two scenarios with different channel lengths \\( L_1 \\) and \\( L_2 \\). The graph plots the drain current \\( I_D \\) on the vertical axis against the drain-source voltage \\( V_{DS} \\) on the horizontal axis.\n\n1. **Type of Graph and Function:**\n- This is a characteristic curve graph commonly used in electronics to depict the relationship between current and voltage in a transistor.\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n- The vertical axis is labeled \\( I_D \\), representing the drain current, typically measured in amperes.\n- The horizontal axis is labeled \\( V_{DS} \\), representing the drain-source voltage, typically measured in volts.\n- Both axes use a linear scale.\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- For both channel lengths \\( L_1 \\) and \\( L_2 \\), the drain current \\( I_D \\) initially increases sharply with \\( V_{DS} \\) and then begins to level off, indicating saturation.\n- The solid line represents the actual behavior, while the dashed line indicates the ideal behavior without channel-length modulation.\n- The graph for \\( L_1 \\) shows a more significant increase in \\( I_D \\) with \\( V_{DS} \\) in the saturation region compared to \\( L_2 \\), reflecting greater channel-length modulation.\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The difference in slope in the saturation region between \\( L_1 \\) and \\( L_2 \\) highlights the impact of channel-length modulation, which is more pronounced for shorter channel lengths (\\( L_1 \\)).\n- The dashed line represents the ideal case without channel-length modulation, showing a flat saturation region.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- The diagrams above the graphs illustrate the physical representation of the channel lengths \\( L_1 \\) and \\( L_2 \\), with \\( L_1 \\) being shorter than \\( L_2 \\).\n- No specific numerical values are provided, but the general trend indicates that the longer channel \\( L_2 \\) exhibits less channel-length modulation, maintaining a more constant \\( I_D \\) in the saturation region.\n\nFigure 6.26 Channel-length modulation.\n\nExample\n6.9\n\nSolution We write\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& I_{D 1}=\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}\\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\\right)^{2}\\left(1+\\lambda V_{D S 1}\\right)  \\tag{6.35}\\\\\n& I_{D 2}=\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}\\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\\right)^{2}\\left(1+\\lambda V_{D S 2}\\right) \\tag{6.36}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nand hence\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{D 2}=I_{D 1} \\frac{1+\\lambda V_{D S 2}}{1+\\lambda V_{D S 1}} \\tag{6.37}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWith $I_{D 1}=1 \\mathrm{~mA}, V_{D S 1}=0.5 \\mathrm{~V}, V_{D S 2}=1 \\mathrm{~V}$, and $\\lambda=0.1 \\mathrm{~V}^{-1}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{D 2}=1.048 \\mathrm{~mA} \\tag{6.38}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n[^14]The change in $I_{D}$ is thus $48 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$, resulting in an output impedance of\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nr_{O} & =\\frac{\\Delta V_{D S}}{\\Delta I_{D}}  \\tag{6.39}\\\\\n& =10.42 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega \\tag{6.40}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nExercise Does $W$ affect the above results?\n\nThe preceding example demonstrates that channel-length modulation restricts the output impedance of MOS current sources.

As $V_{1}$ increases, $V_{G S}$ decreases, leading to a reduction in $I_{D}$. If $V_{1}$ reaches $V_{D D}-V_{T H}, V_{G S}$ drops to $V_{T H}$, turning the transistor off. The drain current thus varies as depicted in Fig. 6.30(b). Note that, due to body effect, $V_{T H}$ varies with $V_{1}$ if the substrate is connected to ground.\n\nExercise Repeat the above example if the gate of $M_{1}$ is connected to a voltage of 1.5 V and $V_{D D}=2 \\mathrm{~V}$."

The gate (G) controls the channel, but the primary conduction occurs between D and S with resistance Ron.\n\nFigure 6.29 MOS models for (a) saturation region, (b) triode region, (c) deep triode region.\n\nIn the saturation region, the transistor functions as a voltage-controlled current source, corresponding to the model in Fig. 6.29(a). Note that $I_{D}$ is influenced by $V_{D S}$, thus it is not an ideal current source. For $V_{D S}<V_{G S}-V_{T H}$, the model must reflect the triode region, yet it can still include a voltage-controlled current source, as shown in Fig. 6.29(b). If $V_{D S} \\ll 2\\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\\right)$, the transistor can be considered a voltage-controlled resistor [Fig. 6.29(c)]. In all scenarios, the gate remains an open circuit to indicate zero gate current.\n\nExample Sketch the drain current of $M_{1}$ in Fig. 6.30(a) versus $V_{1}$ as $V_{1}$ varies from zero to $V_{D D}$.

The drain of M1 is connected to the node Vi, which is also the positive terminal of the voltage source V1. The source of M1 is connected to ground, and the gate is connected to VDD. The circuit likely operates in the saturation region.\n\n(a)\nimage_name:(b)\ndescription:The graph illustrates the variation of the drain current, $I_D$, with respect to the voltage $V_1$. This is a typical characteristic curve for an NMOS transistor operating in the saturation region.\n\n1. **Type of Graph and Function**: This is a current-voltage characteristic graph for an NMOS transistor.\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units**: The vertical axis represents the drain current $I_D$, and the horizontal axis represents the voltage $V_1$. The scales appear to be linear, though specific units are not provided.\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends**: The graph shows a decreasing trend of $I_D$ as $V_1$ increases. Initially, when $V_1$ is zero, $I_D$ is at its maximum value. As $V_1$ increases towards $V_{DD} - V_{TH}$, $I_D$ decreases, indicating that the NMOS transistor is operating in the saturation region. Beyond the point where $V_1 = V_{DD} - V_{TH}$, the drain current $I_D$ approaches zero.\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details**: The curve starts at a maximum value of $I_D$ when $V_1 = 0$. As $V_1$ increases, the curve slopes downward, reflecting the decrease in $I_D$. The point $V_{DD} - V_{TH}$ is marked on the horizontal axis, indicating the threshold voltage level where $I_D$ becomes very small.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points**: The graph lacks additional annotations or specific numerical data points, but the critical point $V_{DD} - V_{TH}$ is highlighted, showing where the current effectively diminishes.\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 6.30 (a) Simple MOS circuit, (b) variation of $I_{D}$ with $V_{1}$.\n\nSolution Observing that the device operates in saturation (why?), we write\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{D} & =\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}\\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\\right)^{2}  \\tag{6.58}\\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}\\left(V_{D D}-V_{1}-V_{T H}\\right)^{2} . \\tag{6.59}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nAt $V_{1}=0, V_{G S}=V_{D D}$ and the device carries maximum current. As $V_{1}$ increases, $V_{G S}$ decreases, leading to a reduction in $I_{D}$. If $V_{1}$ reaches $V_{D D}-V_{T H}, V_{G S}$ drops to $V_{T H}$, turning the transistor off. The drain current thus varies as depicted in Fig. 6.30(b). Note that, due to the body effect, $V_{T H}$ varies with $V_{1}$ if the substrate is connected to ground.\n\nExercise Repeat the above example if the gate of $M_{1}$ is connected to a voltage of 1.5 V and $V_{D D}=2 \\mathrm{~V}$."

    "text": "After observing both $n p n$ and $p n p$ bipolar transistors, readers might question whether a $p$-type equivalent exists for MOSFETs. In fact, as shown in Fig. 6.32(a), altering the doping polarities of the substrate and the S/D regions results in a \"PMOS\" device. The channel in this device consists of holes and forms when the gate voltage is one threshold voltage below the source potential. Specifically, to activate the device, $V_{G S}<V_{T H}$, where $V_{T H}$ is negative. Following the notation used for bipolar devices, we depict the PMOS device as in Fig. 6.32(b), with the source terminal indicated by an arrow and positioned at the top to highlight its higher potential. The transistor operates in the triode region if the drain voltage is close to the source potential, moving towards saturation as $V_{D}$ decreases to $V_{G}-V_{T H}=V_{G}+\\left|V_{T H}\\right|$. Figure 6.32(c) illustrates the gate-drain voltages necessary for each operational region. We state that if $V_{D S}$ of a PMOS (or NMOS) device is sufficiently negative (or positive), it is in saturation.\n\nExample: In the circuit shown in Fig. 6.33, determine the operational region of $M_{1}$ as $V_{1}$ varies from $V_{D D}$ (2.5 V) to zero, assuming $\\left|V_{T H}\\right|=0.5 V$.\n\nImage Description: Fig. 6.33 depicts a simple PMOS circuit with $M1$ having its source connected to $V_{D D}$, drain to node $d$, and gate to node $V1$. Voltage sources $V1$ and $d$ are connected to ground.\n\nSolution: At $V_{1}=V_{D D}$, $V_{G S}=0$ and $M_{1}$ is off. As $V_{1}$ decreases towards $V_{D D}-\\left|V_{T H}\\right|$, the gate-source potential becomes sufficiently negative to form a hole channel, turning the device on. At this stage, $V_{G}=V_{D D}-\\left|V_{T H}\\right|=+2 V$ and $V_{D}=+1 V$, indicating $M_{1}$ is saturated [Fig. 6.32(c)]. Further reduction in $V_{1}$ makes $V_{G S}$ more negative, increasing the transistor current. At $V_{1}=+1 V-\\left|V_{T H}\\right|=0.5 V$, $M_{1}$ is at the triode region's edge. Below 0.5 V, $M_{1}$ fully enters the triode region.\n\nThe voltage and current polarities in PMOS devices can be perplexing. Using the current direction in Fig. 6.32(b), the saturation region's $I_{D}$ is expressed as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{D, s a t}=-\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{p} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}\\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\\right)^{2}\\left(1-\\lambda V_{D S}\\right) \\tag{6.67}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is negated. In the triode region,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{D, t r i}=-\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{p} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}\\left[2\\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\\right) V_{D S}-V_{D S}^{2}\\right] \\tag{6.68}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAlternatively, these equations can be written using absolute values:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& \\left|I_{D, s a t}\\right|=\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{p} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}\\left(\\left|V_{G S}\\right|-\\left|V_{T H}\\right|\\right)^{2}\\left(1+\\lambda\\left|V_{D S}\\right|\\right)  \\tag{6.69}\\\\\n& \\left|I_{D, t r i}\\right|=\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{p} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}\\left[2\\left(\\left|V_{G S}\\right|-\\left|V_{T H}\\right|\\right)\\left|V_{D S}\\right|-V_{D S}^{2}\\right] . \\tag{6.70}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe small-signal model of a PMOS transistor mirrors that of NMOS devices (Fig. 6.31). The following example demonstrates this.\n\n[^2]Example 6.16:\n\nFor the configurations in Fig. 6.34(a), determine the small-signal resistances $R_{X}$ and $R_{Y}$, assuming $\\lambda \\neq 0$.\n\nImage Description: Fig. 6.34(b) shows a circuit with diode-connected NMOS and PMOS transistors, resistors $R_x$ and $R_y$ connected to nodes $g1d1$ and $g2d2$ respectively. The NMOS source is grounded, and the PMOS source is connected to $V_{D D}$.\n\n(a)\n\nImage Description: Fig. 6.34(b) illustrates a small-signal model with a voltage source $Vx$, a voltage-controlled current source $gm1$, and a resistor $r01$ connected to node $Vx$. The ground node is labeled $GND$.\n\n(b)\n\nImage Description: The circuit in Fig. 6.34(c) is a small-signal model with a voltage source $vY$, a current-controlled current source $iY$, and a resistor $rO2$ connected to node $vY+$. The ground node is labeled $GND$.\n\n(c)\n\nFig. 6.34 (a) Diode-connected NMOS and PMOS devices, (b) small-signal model of (a), (c) small-signal model of (b).\n\nSolution: For the NMOS version, the small-signal equivalent is as shown in Fig. 6.34(b), yielding:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nR_{X} & =\\frac{v_{X}}{i_{X}}  \\tag{6.71}\\\\\n& =\\left(g_{m 1} v_{X}+\\frac{v_{X}}{r_{O 1}}\\right) \\frac{1}{i_{X}}  \\tag{6.72}\\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{g_{m 1}} \\| r_{O 1} \\tag{6.73}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nFor the PMOS version, the equivalent circuit is as depicted in Fig. 6.34(c), giving:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nR_{Y} & =\\frac{v_{Y}}{i_{Y}}  \\tag{6.74}\\\\\n& =\\left(g_{m 2} v_{Y}+\\frac{v_{Y}}{r_{O 1}}\\right) \\frac{1}{i_{Y}}  \\tag{6.75}\\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{g_{m 2}} \\| r_{O 2} \\tag{6.76}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIn both scenarios, the small-signal resistance equals $1 / g_{m}$ if $\\lambda \\rightarrow 0$. Analogous to their bipolar counterparts [Fig. 4.44(a)], the structures in Fig. 6.34(a) are termed \"diode-connected\" devices and function as two-terminal components. We will encounter numerous applications of these devices in Chapters 9 and 10.\n\nDue to the lower mobility of holes (Chapter 2), PMOS devices exhibit inferior performance compared to NMOS transistors. For instance, Eq. (6.46) shows that the transconductance of a PMOS device is lower for a given drain current. Therefore, we prefer using NMOS transistors whenever feasible."

    "text": "Upon observing both $n p n$ and $p n p$ bipolar transistors, one might inquire about the existence of a $p$ type equivalent for MOSFETs. Indeed, as depicted in Fig. 6.32(a), altering the doping polarities of the substrate and the S/D regions results in a \"PMOS\" device. The channel in this case consists of holes and forms when the gate voltage is lower than the source potential by one threshold voltage. Specifically, to activate the device, $V_{G S}<V_{T H}$, where $V_{T H}$ is negative. Following the conventions for bipolar devices, the PMOS device is illustrated as in Fig. 6.32(b), with the source terminal indicated by an arrow and positioned at the top to highlight its higher potential. The transistor operates in the triode region if the drain voltage is close to the source potential, moving towards saturation as $V_{D}$ decreases to $V_{G}-V_{T H}=V_{G}+\\left|V_{T H}\\right|$. Figure 6.32(c) conceptually shows the gate-drain voltages necessary for each operational region. It is stated that if $V_{D S}$ of a PMOS (or NMOS) device is sufficiently negative (or positive), it enters saturation.\n\nExample: In the circuit of Fig. 6.33, determine the operational region of $M_{1}$ as $V_{1}$ varies from $V_{D D}$ (6.15V) to zero.

This setup is used to analyze M1's operational region as V1 changes from VDD to 0V.\n\nFigure 6.33 Simple PMOS circuit.\n\nSolution: For $V_{1}=V_{D D}$, $V_{G S}=0$ and $M_{1}$ is off. As $V_{1}$ decreases and approaches $V_{D D}-\\left|V_{T H}\\right|$, the gate-source potential becomes sufficiently negative to form a hole channel, turning the device on. At this point, $V_{G}=V_{D D}-\\left|V_{T H}\\right|=+2 \\mathrm{~V}$ while $V_{D}=+1 \\mathrm{~V}$; thus, $M_{1}$ is in saturation [Fig. 6.32(c)]. As $V_{1}$ continues to fall, $V_{G S}$ becomes more negative, increasing the transistor current. For $V_{1}=+1 \\mathrm{~V}-\\left|V_{T H}\\right|=0.5 \\mathrm{~V}$, $M_{1}$ is at the edge of the triode region. When $V_{1}$ drops below 0.5V, the transistor further enters the triode region.\n\nThe voltage and current polarities in PMOS devices can be perplexing.

This \"channel-length modulation\" results in variations in the drain current in the saturation region, indicating the device is not an ideal current source.\n- The \"transconductance,\" a metric for the small-signal performance of voltage-dependent current sources, is defined as the ratio of the change in output current to the change in input voltage.

It is important to note that the exponential relationship between $I_{C}$ and $V_{B E}$ in bipolar transistors grants them a higher transconductance for a specified bias current.\n\nTABLE 6.2 Comparison of bipolar and MOS transistors.\n\n| Bipolar Transistor | MOSFET |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Exponential Characteristic | Quadratic Characteristic |\n| Active: $V_{C B}>0$ | Saturation: $V_{D S}>V_{G S}-V_{T H}$ (NMOS) |\n| Saturation: $V_{C B}<0$ | Triode: $V_{D S}<V_{G S}-V_{T H}$ (NMOS) |\n| Finite Base Current | Zero Gate Current |\n| Early Effect | Channel-Length Modulation |\n| Diffusion Current | Drift Current |\n| - | Voltage-Dependent Resistor |\n\n6.7 CHAPTER SUMMARY\n\n- A voltage-dependent current source, combined with a load resistor, can form an amplifier. MOSFETs are electronic devices capable of functioning as voltage-dependent current sources.\n- A MOSFET comprises a conductive plate (the \"gate\") situated above a semiconductor substrate, with two junctions (\"source\" and \"drain\") within the substrate. The gate regulates the current flow between the source and the drain. Due to an insulating layer, the gate draws almost no current.\n\n[^3]- As the gate voltage increases, a depletion region forms beneath the gate area in the substrate. Once the gate-source voltage exceeds a specific threshold (the \"threshold voltage\"), mobile carriers are drawn to the oxide-silicon interface, creating a channel.\n- When the drain-source voltage is low, the device functions as a voltage-dependent resistor.\n- As the drain voltage rises, the charge density near the drain decreases. If the drain voltage falls to one threshold below the gate voltage, the channel near the drain disappears, resulting in \"pinch-off.\"\n- MOSFETs operate in the \"triode\" region when the drain voltage is more than one threshold below the gate voltage. In this region, the drain current depends on $V_{G S}$ and $V_{D S}$ and is proportional to the device's aspect ratio, $W / L$.\n- MOSFETs enter the \"saturation region\" if channel pinch-off occurs, meaning the drain voltage is less than one threshold below the gate voltage. Here, the drain current is proportional to $\\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\\right)^{2}$.\n- MOSFETs in the saturation region act as current sources and are widely used in microelectronic circuits.\n- When the drain voltage surpasses $V_{G S}-V_{T H}$ and pinch-off happens, the channel's drain end moves toward the source, shortening the effective device length. This phenomenon, known as \"channel-length modulation,\" causes variations in the drain current in the saturation region, indicating the device is not an ideal current source.\n- The \"transconductance,\" which measures the small-signal performance of voltage-dependent current sources, is defined as the change in output current divided by the change in input voltage. The transconductance of MOSFETs can be described by one of three equations based on bias voltages and currents.\n- Operating across different regions or with significant voltage swings illustrates \"large-signal behavior.\" For small signal swings, the MOSFET can be modeled using a small-signal model that includes a linear voltage-dependent current source and an output resistance.\n- The small-signal model is derived by making a slight adjustment to the voltage difference between two terminals while keeping other voltages constant.\n- The small-signal models for NMOS and PMOS devices are the same.\n- NMOS and PMOS transistors are manufactured on the same substrate to develop CMOS technology."
