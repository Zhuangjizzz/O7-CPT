This choice, despite a reasonable $V_{GS}$, caused the drain voltage to be too low, violating the saturation condition $V_{DS} > V_{GS} - V_{TH}$. To resolve this issue, the value of $R_{D}$ was halved, and $g_{m}$ was doubled by increasing the width-to-length ratio ($W/L$) of the transistor by a factor of four.
