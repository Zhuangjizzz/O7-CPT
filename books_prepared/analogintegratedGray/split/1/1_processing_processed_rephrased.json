    "text": "The characteristics of reverse-biased $p n$ junctions significantly impact the features of many integrated-circuit components. For instance, reverse-biased pn junctions are present between numerous integrated-circuit elements and the underlying substrate, contributing voltage-dependent parasitic capacitances. Moreover, essential traits of active devices, such as breakdown voltage and output resistance, are directly influenced by the properties of the depletion region of a reverse-biased pn junction. Additionally, the fundamental operation of the junction field-effect transistor is governed by the width of the depletion region of a pn junction. Due to its significance and relevance to various problems, an analysis of the depletion region of a reverse-biased pn junction is provided below. The properties of forward-biased pn junctions are discussed in Section 1.3 when bipolar-transistor operation is explained.\n\nConsider a $p n$ junction under reverse bias, as depicted in Fig. 1.1. Assume constant doping densities of $N_{D}$ atoms $/ \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ in the $n$-type material and $N_{A}$ atoms $/ \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ in the $p$-type material. (The characteristics of junctions with nonconstant doping densities will be described later.) Owing to the disparity in carrier concentrations in the $p$-type and $n$-type regions, there exists a region at the junction where the mobile holes and electrons have been depleted, leaving behind the fixed acceptor and donor ions. Each acceptor atom carries a negative charge, and each donor atom carries a positive charge, resulting in a region near the junction with significant space charge and a high electric field. This region is known as the depletion region or space-charge region. It is assumed that the edges of the depletion region are sharply defined, as shown in Fig. 1.1, and this is a good approximation in most cases.\n\nFor zero applied bias, there exists a voltage $\\psi_{0}$ across the junction called the built-in potential. This potential hinders the diffusion of mobile holes and electrons across the junction in equilibrium and has a value ${ }^{1}$\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\psi_{0}=V_{T} \\ln \\frac{N_{A} N_{D}}{n_{i}^{2}} \\tag{1.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nV_{T}=\\frac{k T}{q} \\simeq 26 \\mathrm{mV} \\quad \\text { at } \\quad 300^{\\circ} \\mathrm{K}\n$$\n\nthe quantity $n_{i}$ is the intrinsic carrier concentration in a pure sample of the semiconductor and $n_{i} \\simeq 1.5 \\times 10^{10} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$ at $300^{\\circ} \\mathrm{K}$ for silicon.\n\nIn Fig. 1.1, the built-in potential is augmented by the applied reverse bias, $V_{R}$, and the total voltage across the junction is $\\left(\\psi_{0}+V_{R}\\right)$.

The abrupt junction model assumes that the edges of the depletion region are sharply defined, as shown in Fig. 1.1, which is a good approximation in most cases.\n\nFor zero applied bias, there exists a voltage $\\psi_{0}$ across the junction called the built-in potential. This potential opposes the diffusion of mobile holes and electrons across the junction in equilibrium and has a value ${ }^{1}$\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\psi_{0}=V_{T} \\ln \\frac{N_{A} N_{D}}{n_{i}^{2}} \\tag{1.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nV_{T}=\\frac{k T}{q} \\simeq 26 \\mathrm{mV} \\quad \\text { at } \\quad 300^{\\circ} \\mathrm{K}\n$$\n\nthe quantity $n_{i}$ is the intrinsic carrier concentration in a pure sample of the semiconductor and $n_{i} \\simeq 1.5 \\times 10^{10} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$ at $300^{\\circ} \\mathrm{K}$ for silicon.\n\nIn Fig. 1.1, the built-in potential is augmented by the applied reverse bias, $V_{R}$, and the total voltage across the junction is $\\left(\\psi_{0}+V_{R}\\right)$. If the depletion region penetrates a distance $W_{1}$ into the $p$-type region and $W_{2}$ into the $n$-type region, then we require\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nW_{1} N_{A}=W_{2} N_{D} \\tag{1.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nbecause the total charge per unit area on either side of the junction must be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.\n\nPoisson's equation in one dimension requires that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{d^{2} V}{d x^{2}}=-\\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon}=\\frac{q N_{A}}{\\epsilon} \\quad \\text { for } \\quad-W_{1}<x<0 \\tag{1.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\rho$ is the charge density, $q$ is the electron charge ( $1.6 \\times 10^{-19}$ coulomb), and $\\epsilon$ is the permittivity of the silicon $\\left(1.04 \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{farad} / \\mathrm{cm}\\right)$. The permittivity is often expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\epsilon=K_{S} \\epsilon_{0} \\tag{1.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $K_{S}$ is the dielectric constant of silicon and $\\epsilon_{0}$ is the permittivity of free space $(8.86 \\times$ $10^{-14} \\mathrm{~F} / \\mathrm{cm}$ ). Integration of (1.3) gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{d V}{d x}=\\frac{q N_{A}}{\\epsilon} x+C_{1} \\tag{1.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $C_{1}$ is a constant. However, the electric field $\\mathscr{E}$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathscr{E}=-\\frac{d V}{d x}=-\\left(\\frac{q N_{A}}{\\epsilon} x+C_{1}\\right) \\tag{1.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince there is zero electric field outside the depletion region, a boundary condition is\n\n$$\n\\mathscr{E}=0 \\quad \\text { for } \\quad x=-W_{1}\n$$\n\nand use of this condition in (1.6) gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathscr{E}=-\\frac{q N_{A}}{\\epsilon}\\left(x+W_{1}\\right)=-\\frac{d V}{d x} \\quad \\text { for } \\quad-W_{1}<x<0 \\tag{1.7}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus the dipole of charge existing at the junction gives rise to an electric field that varies linearly with distance.\n\nIntegration of (1.7) gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV=\\frac{q N_{A}}{\\epsilon}\\left(\\frac{x^{2}}{2}+W_{1} x\\right)+C_{2} \\tag{1.8}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIf the zero for potential is arbitrarily taken to be the potential of the neutral $p$-type region, then a second boundary condition is\n\n$$\nV=0 \\quad \\text { for } \\quad x=-W_{1}\n$$\n\nand use of this in (1.8) gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV=\\frac{q N_{A}}{\\epsilon}\\left(\\frac{x^{2}}{2}+W_{1} x+\\frac{W_{1}^{2}}{2}\\right) \\quad \\text { for } \\quad-W_{1}<x<0 \\tag{1.9}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAt $x=0$, we define $V=V_{1}$, and then (1.9) gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{1}=\\frac{q N_{A}}{\\epsilon} \\frac{W_{1}^{2}}{2} \\tag{1.10}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIf the potential difference from $x=0$ to $x=W_{2}$ is $V_{2}$, then it follows that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{2}=\\frac{q N_{D}}{\\epsilon} \\frac{W_{2}^{2}}{2} \\tag{1.11}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand thus the total voltage across the junction is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\psi_{0}+V_{R}=V_{1}+V_{2}=\\frac{q}{2 \\epsilon}\\left(N_{A} W_{1}^{2}+N_{D} W_{2}^{2}\\right) \\tag{1.12}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSubstitution of (1.2) in (1.12) gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\psi_{0}+V_{R}=\\frac{q W_{1}^{2} N_{A}}{2 \\epsilon}\\left(1+\\frac{N_{A}}{N_{D}}\\right) \\tag{1.13}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFrom (1.13), the penetration of the depletion layer into the $p$-type region is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nW_{1}=\\left[\\frac{2 \\epsilon\\left(\\psi_{0}+V_{R}\\right)}{q N_{A}\\left(1+\\frac{N_{A}}{N_{D}}\\right)}\\right]^{1 / 2} \\tag{1.14}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSimilarly,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nW_{2}=\\left[\\frac{2 \\epsilon\\left(\\psi_{0}+V_{R}\\right)}{q N_{D}\\left(1+\\frac{N_{D}}{N_{A}}\\right)}\\right]^{1 / 2} \\tag{1.15}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquations 1.14 and 1.15 show that the depletion regions extend into the $p$-type and $n$-type regions in inverse relation to the impurity concentrations and in proportion to $\\sqrt{\\psi_{0}+V_{R}}$. If either $N_{D}$ or $N_{A}$ is much larger than the other, the depletion region exists almost entirely in the lightly doped region.\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nAn abrupt $p n$ junction in silicon has doping densities $N_{A}=10^{15}$ atoms $/ \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and $N_{D}=10^{16}$ atoms $/ \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$.

The vertical axis shows \\( C_j \\) in arbitrary units, while the horizontal axis divides \\( V_D \\) into reverse and forward bias regions, marked at \\( \\psi_0 \\). The graph includes two curves: one based on Equation 1.21, showing a gradual increase in capacitance from a baseline \\( C_{j0} \\) under reverse bias to a rapid increase in forward bias. The more accurate curve diverges in forward bias, predicting a steeper rise near \\( \\psi_0 \\). Key features include constant capacitance in reverse bias, increasing capacitance in forward bias, and critical points at \\( \\psi_0 \\) and \\( \\psi_0/2 \\).\n\nBoth (1.21) and (1.22) predict \\( C_{j} \\) approaching infinity as \\( V_{D} \\) nears \\( \\psi_{0} \\).

    "text": "In the preceding section's analysis, it was assumed that the collector-base junction was reverse biased and had no impact on the collector currents, which is a useful approximation for initial calculations but not entirely accurate in real scenarios. There are instances where the effect of collector voltage on collector current is significant, and this will be examined now.\n\nThe collector voltage profoundly influences the collector current in two operational regions of the device: saturation (where $V_{CE}$ approaches zero) and breakdown (where $V_{CE}$ is very high), which will be discussed later. For $V_{CE}$ values between these extremes, the collector current rises gradually as $V_{CE}$ increases. This behavior can be understood from Fig. 1.9, a sketch depicting the minority-carrier concentration in the transistor's base. Consider the impact of $V_{CE}$ variations on carrier concentration with a constant $V_{BE}$. Since $V_{BE}$ remains constant, any change in $V_{CE}$ equates to a change in $V_{CB}$, leading to an increase in the collector-base depletion-layer width, as illustrated. The change in the transistor's base width, $\\Delta W_{B}$, equals the change in the depletion-layer width, resulting in an increase, $\\Delta I_{C}$, in the collector current.\n\nFrom equations (1.35) and (1.38), we derive\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C}=\\frac{q A \\bar{D}_{n} n_{i}^{2}}{Q_{B}} \\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}} \\tag{1.52}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nimage_name:Figure 1.9\ndescription:This graphical representation illustrates the carrier concentration across a bipolar transistor, highlighting the effects of an increased collector-emitter voltage, \\( V_{CE} \\).\n\nGraph Type and Function:\n- The graph is a conceptual diagram, not a numerical plot, showing the relationship between carrier concentration and position across the transistor.\n\nAxes Labels and Units:\n- The vertical axis represents \"Carrier concentration\" without specific units, as it is a qualitative diagram.\n- The horizontal axis is labeled with transistor positions: \"Emitter,\" \"Base,\" and \"Collector.\"\n\nGeneral Behavior and Trends:\n- The graph shows how an increase in \\( V_{CE} \\) causes the collector depletion region to expand, indicated by the rightward shift of the rightmost dashed line.\n- The initial depletion region is marked, and the increase in depletion width is denoted by \\( \\Delta W_B \\).\n\nKey Features and Technical Details:\n- The base-emitter junction's carrier concentration is given by \\( n_p(0) = n_{po} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) \\), indicating an exponential dependency on \\( V_{BE} \\).\n- The diagram illustrates two current paths: \\( I_C \\) and \\( I_C + \\Delta I_C \\), showing the increase in collector current due to \\( \\Delta W_B \\).\n- The carrier concentration slope decreases from emitter to collector, reflecting the concentration gradient.\n\nAnnotations and Specific Data Points:\n- Annotations like \"Collector depletion region widens due to \\( \\Delta V_{CE} \\)\" and \"Initial depletion region\" highlight the voltage effects on the transistor structure.\n- The base width \\( W_B \\) and its change \\( \\Delta W_B \\) are clearly indicated, showing \\( V_{CE} \\)'s impact on operation.\n\nOverall, the diagram effectively shows how \\( V_{CE} \\) increases affect the depletion region and carrier concentration in a bipolar transistor, leading to collector current changes.\n\nFigure 1.9 Impact of rising $V_{CE}$ on the collector depletion region and base width in a bipolar transistor.\n\nDifferentiating (1.52) results in\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\partial I_{C}}{\\partial V_{C E}}=-\\frac{q A \\bar{D}_{n} n_{i}^{2}}{Q_{B}^{2}}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}\\right) \\frac{d Q_{B}}{d V_{C E}} \\tag{1.53}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSubstituting (1.52) into (1.53) yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\partial I_{C}}{\\partial V_{C E}}=-\\frac{I_{C}}{Q_{B}} \\frac{d Q_{B}}{d V_{C E}} \\tag{1.54}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor a uniform-base transistor, $Q_{B}=W_{B} N_{A}$, and (1.54) becomes\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\partial I_{C}}{\\partial V_{C E}}=-\\frac{I_{C}}{W_{B}} \\frac{d W_{B}}{d V_{C E}} \\tag{1.55}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nNote that as $V_{CE}$ increases, the base width decreases, making $d W_{B} / d V_{C E}$ negative in (1.55), thus $\\partial I_{C} / \\partial V_{C E}$ is positive. The magnitude of $d W_{B} / d V_{C E}$ can be calculated from (1.18) for a uniform-base transistor. This equation suggests that $d W_{B} / d V_{C E}$ varies with the bias value of $V_{CE}$, but the variation is typically minor for a reverse-biased junction, often assumed constant. The predictions align well with experimental results.\n\nEquation 1.55 indicates that $\\partial I_{C} / \\partial V_{C E}$ is proportional to the collector-bias current and inversely proportional to the base width. Therefore, narrow-base transistors exhibit a stronger $I_{C}$ dependence on $V_{CE}$ in the forward-active region. The $\\partial I_{C} / \\partial V_{C E}$ dependence on $I_{C}$ results in typical transistor output characteristics, as shown in Fig. 1.10. These characteristics are depicted for constant $V_{BE}$ values, based on prior analysis assumptions. However, in most integrated-circuit transistors, the base current depends solely on $V_{BE}$, not $V_{CE}$, allowing constant-base-current characteristics for subsequent calculations. This is because the base current is predominantly influenced by the $I_{B 2}$ component of (1.45), which is independent of $V_{CE}$.

This approximation is useful for initial calculations but is not entirely accurate in practical scenarios. There are instances where the influence of collector voltage on collector current is significant, and this will be examined here.\n\nThe collector voltage profoundly affects the collector current in two specific regions of device operation: saturation (where $V_{C E}$ approaches zero) and breakdown (where $V_{C E}$ is very high), which will be discussed later.

This assumption is helpful for initial calculations but does not fully reflect real-world conditions. There are situations where the effect of collector voltage on collector current is significant, and this will now be examined.\n\nThe collector voltage significantly influences the collector current in two operational regions of the device: saturation (where $V_{C E}$ approaches zero) and breakdown (where $V_{C E}$ is very high), which will be discussed later.

Note the different scales for positive and negative currents and voltages.\n\n---\n\nIn the saturation region, the value of \\( n_{p}(W_{B}) \\) is no longer negligible, as \\( V_{BC} \\) is now positive. Consequently, modifications in \\( V_{CE} \\) with \\( V_{BE} \\) held constant (which induce equal modifications in \\( V_{BC} \\)) directly impact \\( n_{p}(W_{B}) \\). Since the collector current is proportional to the slope of the minority-carrier concentration in the base [refer to (1.31)], it is also proportional to \\( [n_{p}(0)-n_{p}(W_{B})] \\) from Fig. 1.11. Hence, changes in \\( n_{p}(W_{B}) \\) directly affect the collector current, making the collector node of the transistor appear to have a low impedance. As \\( V_{CE} \\) decreases in saturation with \\( V_{BE} \\) held constant, \\( V_{BC} \\) increases, as does \\( n_{p}(W_{B}) \\) from (1.59). Therefore, from Fig. 1.11, the collector current diminishes due to the decreased slope of the carrier concentration. This results in the saturation region of the \\( I_{C}-V_{CE} \\) characteristic shown in Fig. 1.12. The slope of the \\( I_{C}-V_{CE} \\) characteristic in this region is predominantly determined by the resistance in series with the collector lead due to the finite resistivity of the n-type collector material. A practical model for the transistor in this region is depicted in Fig. 1.13 and comprises a fixed voltage source to represent \\( V_{BE(on)} \\), and another fixed voltage source to represent the collector-emitter voltage \\( V_{CE(sat)} \\). A more accurate yet complex model includes a resistor in series with the collector. This resistor can range in value from 20 to \\( 500 \\Omega \\), depending on the device structure.\n\nAn additional aspect of transistor behavior in the saturation region is evident from Fig. 1.11. For a specific collector current, there is now a significantly greater amount of stored charge in the base compared to the forward-active region. Thus, the base-current contribution represented by (1.41) will be higher in saturation. Furthermore, since the collector-base junction is now forward biased, there is a new base-current component due to the injection of carriers from the base to the collector. These two effects result in a base current \\( I_{B} \\) in saturation, which is greater than in the forward-active region for a specific collector current \\( I_{C} \\). The ratio \\( I_{C} / I_{B} \\) in saturation is frequently referred to as the forced \\( \\beta \\) and is always less than \\( \\beta_{F} \\). As the forced \\( \\beta \\) is reduced with respect to \\( \\beta_{F} \\), the device is said to be more heavily saturated.\n\nThe minority-carrier concentration in saturation, as shown in Fig. 1.11, is a straight line connecting the two end points, assuming that recombination is insignificant. This can be represented as a linear superposition of the two dotted distributions as illustrated. The justification for this is that the terminal currents depend linearly on the concentrations \\( n_{p}(0) \\) and \\( n_{p}(W_{B}) \\). This representation of device carrier concentrations can be used to derive some general equations describing transistor behavior. Each of the distributions in Fig. 1.11 is considered separately, and the two contributions are combined. The emitter current that would result from \\( n_{p 1}(x) \\) above is given by the classical diode equation\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{E F}=-I_{E S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}-1\\right) \\tag{1.60}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere \\( I_{E S} \\) is a constant often referred to as the saturation current of the junction (not related to the transistor saturation previously described). Equation 1.60 predicts that the junction current is given by \\( I_{E F} \\simeq I_{E S} \\) with a reverse-bias voltage applied. However, in practice (1.60) is applicable only in the forward-bias region, since second-order effects dominate under reverse-bias conditions and typically result in a junction current several orders of magnitude larger than \\( I_{E S} \\). The junction current that flows under reverse-bias conditions is often called the leakage current of the junction.\n\nReferring back to Fig. 1.11, the collector current resulting from \\( n_{p 2}(x) \\) alone can be described as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C R}=-I_{C S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B C}}{V_{T}}-1\\right) \\tag{1.61}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere \\( I_{C S} \\) is a constant. The total collector current \\( I_{C} \\) is given by \\( I_{C R} \\) plus the fraction of \\( I_{E F} \\) that reaches the collector (considering recombination and reverse emitter injection). Thus\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C}=\\alpha_{F} I_{E S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)-I_{C S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B C}}{V_{T}}-1\\right) \\tag{1.62}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere \\( \\alpha_{F} \\) has been defined previously by (1.51). Similarly, the total emitter current is composed of \\( I_{E F} \\) plus the fraction of \\( I_{C R} \\) that reaches the emitter with the transistor functioning in an inverted mode. Thus\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{E}=-I_{E S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)+\\alpha_{R} I_{C S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B C}}{V_{T}}-1\\right) \\tag{1.63}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere \\( \\alpha_{R} \\) is the ratio of emitter to collector current with the transistor operating inverted (i.e., with the collector-base junction forward biased and emitting carriers into the base and the emitter-base junction reverse biased and collecting carriers). Typical values of \\( \\alpha_{R} \\) are 0.5 to 0.8.\n\nAn inverse current gain \\( \\beta_{R} \\) is also defined\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\beta_{R}=\\frac{\\alpha_{R}}{1-\\alpha_{R}} \\tag{1.64}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand has typical values 1 to 5. This is the current gain of the transistor when operated inverted and is much lower than \\( \\beta_{F} \\) because the device geometry and doping densities are designed to maximize \\( \\beta_{F} \\). The inverse-active region of device operation occurs for \\( V_{CE} \\) negative in an npn transistor and is shown in Fig. 1.12. To adequately display these characteristics in the same figure as the forward-active region, the negative voltage and current scales have been expanded. The inverse-active mode of operation is rarely encountered in analog circuits.\n\nEquations 1.62 and 1.63 describe npn transistor operation in the saturation region when \\( V_{BE} \\) and \\( V_{BC} \\) are both positive, and also in the forward-active and inverse-active regions. These equations are the Ebers-Moll equations. In the forward-active region, they degrade into a form similar to that of (1.35), (1.47), and (1.49) derived earlier. This can be demonstrated by substituting \\( V_{BE} \\) positive and \\( V_{BC} \\) negative in (1.62) and (1.63) to obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{C} & =\\alpha_{F} I_{E S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)+I_{C S}  \\tag{1.65}\\\\\nI_{E} & =-I_{E S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)-\\alpha_{R} I_{C S} \\tag{1.66}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nEquation 1.65 is similar in form to (1.35) except that leakage currents that were previously neglected have now been included. This minor difference is significant only at high temperatures or very low operating currents. Comparison of (1.65) with (1.35) allows us to identify \\( I_{S}=\\alpha_{F} I_{E S} \\), and it can be shown in general that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\alpha_{F} I_{E S}=\\alpha_{R} I_{C S}=I_{S} \\tag{1.67}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere this expression represents a reciprocity condition. Utilization of (1.67) in (1.62) and (1.63) allows the Ebers-Moll equations to be expressed in the general form\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{C} & =I_{S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)-\\frac{I_{S}}{\\alpha_{R}}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B C}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)  \\tag{1.62a}\\\\\nI_{E} & =-\\frac{I_{S}}{\\alpha_{F}}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)+I_{S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B C}}{V_{T}}-1\\right) \\tag{1.63a}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis form is often used for computer representation of transistor large-signal behavior.\n\nThe effect of leakage currents mentioned earlier can be further exemplified as follows. In the forward-active region, from (1.66)\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{E S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)=-I_{E}-\\alpha_{R} I_{C S} \\tag{1.68}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSubstitution of (1.68) in (1.65) yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C}=-\\alpha_{F} I_{E}+I_{C O} \\tag{1.69}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C O}=I_{C S}\\left(1-\\alpha_{R} \\alpha_{F}\\right) \\tag{1.69a}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand \\( I_{C O} \\) is the collector-base leakage current with the emitter open. Although \\( I_{C O} \\) is theoretically determined by (1.69a), in practice, surface leakage effects dominate when the collector-base junction is reverse biased, and \\( I_{C O} \\) is typically several orders of magnitude larger than the value given by (1.69a). However, (1.69) remains valid if the appropriate measured value for \\( I_{C O} \\) is used. Typical values of \\( I_{C O} \\) are from \\( 10^{-10} \\) to \\( 10^{-12} \\) A at \\( 25^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} \\), and the magnitude doubles approximately every \\( 8^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} \\). Consequently, these leakage terms can become very significant at high temperatures. For instance, consider the base current \\( I_{B} \\). From Fig. 1.5 this is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{B}=-\\left(I_{C}+I_{E}\\right) \\tag{1.70}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIf \\( I_{E} \\) is calculated from (1.69) and substituted in (1.70), the result is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{B}=\\frac{1-\\alpha_{F}}{\\alpha_{F}} I_{C}-\\frac{I_{C O}}{\\alpha_{F}} \\tag{1.71}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nBut from (1.50)\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\beta_{F}=\\frac{\\alpha_{F}}{1-\\alpha_{F}} \\tag{1.72}\n\\end{equation*"

This region lies between the saturation region and the breakdown voltage \\(BV_{CEO}\\).\n- **Saturation Region:** For low \\(V_{CE}\\) values near zero, the curves flatten, indicating the saturation region where the transistor is fully on.\n- **Inverse Active Region:** When \\(V_{CE}\\) is negative, \\(I_C\\) becomes negative, showing the inverse active region.\n\n**Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The curves are plotted for different base currents \\(I_B\\) ranging from 0 to 0.04 mA.\n- The forward active region exhibits a linear increase in \\(I_C\\) with increasing \\(V_{CE}\\) for each \\(I_B\\).\n- The breakdown voltage \\(BV_{CEO}\\) is marked near 40 volts, beyond which the curves rise steeply.\n- In the inverse active region, \\(I_C\\) decreases with increasing negative \\(V_{CE}\\), displaying a similar pattern for different \\(I_B\\) values.\n\n**Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- The graph is annotated with the base current values \\(I_B = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04\\) mA.\n- The saturation region is labeled around \\(V_{CE} = 0\\) volts.\n- The forward active region is highlighted as the area between saturation and \\(BV_{CEO}\\).\n- The inverse active region is indicated for negative \\(V_{CE}\\) values.\n\nFigure 1.12 Typical $I_{C}-V_{C E}$ characteristics for an npn bipolar transistor. Note the different scales for positive and negative currents and voltages.\nThe value of \\(n_{p}\\left(W_{B}\\right)\\) is no longer negligible due to the positive \\(V_{BC}\\). Consequently, variations in \\(V_{CE}\\) with \\(V_{BE}\\) held constant (which result in equal changes in \\(V_{BC}\\) ) directly impact \\(n_{p}\\left(W_{B}\\right)\\). Since the collector current is proportional to the slope of the minority-carrier concentration in the base [see (1.31)], it is also proportional to \\([n_{p}(0)-n_{p}\\left(W_{B}\\right)]\\) from Fig. 1.11. Thus, changes in \\(n_{p}\\left(W_{B}\\right)\\) directly affect the collector current, making the collector node of the transistor appear to have a low impedance. As \\(V_{CE}\\) decreases in saturation with \\(V_{BE}\\) held constant, \\(V_{BC}\\) increases, as does \\(n_{p}\\left(W_{B}\\right)\\) from (1.59). Hence, from Fig. 1.11, the collector current decreases because the slope of the carrier concentration decreases. This gives rise to the saturation region of the \\(I_{C}-V_{CE}\\) characteristic shown in Fig. 1.12. The slope of the \\(I_{C}-V_{CE}\\) characteristic in this region is largely determined by the resistance in series with the collector lead due to the finite resistivity of the n-type collector material. A useful model for the transistor in this region is depicted in Fig. 1.13 and comprises a fixed voltage source to represent \\(V_{BE(\\text { on })}\\), and a fixed voltage source to represent the collector-emitter voltage \\(V_{CE(\\text { sat })}\\). A more accurate but more complex model includes a resistor in series with the collector. This resistor can have a value ranging from 20 to \\(500 \\Omega\\), depending on the device structure.\n\nAn additional aspect of transistor behavior in the saturation region is evident from Fig. 1.11. For a given collector current, there is now a much larger amount of stored charge in the base compared to the forward-active region. Thus, the base-current contribution represented by (1.41) will be greater in saturation. Moreover, since the collector-base junction is now forward biased, there is a new base-current component due to injection of carriers from the base to the collector. These two effects result in a base current \\(I_{B}\\) in saturation, which is larger than in the forward-active region for a given collector current \\(I_{C}\\). The ratio \\(I_{C} / I_{B}\\) in saturation is often referred to as the forced \\(\\beta\\) and is always less than \\(\\beta_{F}\\). As the forced \\(\\beta\\) decreases with respect to \\(\\beta_{F}\\), the device is considered more heavily saturated.\n\nThe minority-carrier concentration in saturation, as shown in Fig. 1.11, is a straight line connecting the two end points, assuming that recombination is minimal. This can be represented as a linear combination of the two dotted distributions as displayed. The rationale for this is that the terminal currents depend linearly on the concentrations \\(n_{p}(0)\\) and \\(n_{p}\\left(W_{B}\\right)\\). This representation of device carrier concentrations can be used to derive some general equations describing transistor behavior. Each of the distributions in Fig. 1.11 is considered separately, and the two contributions are combined. The emitter current resulting from \\(n_{p 1}(x)\\) above is given by the classical diode equation\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{E F}=-I_{E S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}-1\\right) \\tag{1.60}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere \\(I_{E S}\\) is a constant often referred to as the saturation current of the junction (not related to the transistor saturation previously described). Equation 1.60 predicts that the junction current is given by \\(I_{E F} \\simeq I_{E S}\\) with a reverse-bias voltage applied. However, in practice, (1.60) is only applicable in the forward-bias region, as second-order effects dominate under reverse-bias conditions, typically resulting in a junction current several orders of magnitude larger than \\(I_{E S}\\). The junction current that flows under reverse-bias conditions is often called the leakage current of the junction.\n\nReferring back to Fig. 1.11, the collector current resulting from \\(n_{p 2}(x)\\) alone can be described as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C R}=-I_{C S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B C}}{V_{T}}-1\\right) \\tag{1.61}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere \\(I_{C S}\\) is a constant. The total collector current \\(I_{C}\\) is given by \\(I_{C R}\\) plus the fraction of \\(I_{E F}\\) that reaches the collector (accounting for recombination and reverse emitter injection). Thus\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C}=\\alpha_{F} I_{E S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)-I_{C S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B C}}{V_{T}}-1\\right) \\tag{1.62}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere \\(\\alpha_{F}\\) has been defined previously by (1.51). Similarly, the total emitter current is composed of \\(I_{E F}\\) plus the fraction of \\(I_{C R}\\) that reaches the emitter with the transistor operating in an inverted mode. Thus\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{E}=-I_{E S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)+\\alpha_{R} I_{C S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B C}}{V_{T}}-1\\right) \\tag{1.63}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere \\(\\alpha_{R}\\) is the ratio of emitter to collector current with the transistor operating inverted (i.e., with the collector-base junction forward biased and emitting carriers into the base and the emitter-base junction reverse biased and collecting carriers). Typical values of \\(\\alpha_{R}\\) are 0.5 to 0.8.\n\nAn inverse current gain \\(\\beta_{R}\\) is also defined\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\beta_{R}=\\frac{\\alpha_{R}}{1-\\alpha_{R}} \\tag{1.64}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand has typical values 1 to 5. This represents the current gain of the transistor when operated in the inverted mode and is significantly lower than \\(\\beta_{F}\\) because the device geometry and doping densities are designed to maximize \\(\\beta_{F}\\). The inverse-active region of device operation occurs for \\(V_{C E}\\) negative in an npn transistor and is shown in Fig. 1.12. To adequately display these characteristics in the same figure as the forward-active region, the negative voltage and current scales have been expanded. The inverse-active mode of operation is rarely encountered in analog circuits.\n\nEquations 1.62 and 1.63 describe npn transistor operation in the saturation region when \\(V_{B E}\\) and \\(V_{B C}\\) are both positive, and also in the forward-active and inverse-active regions. These equations are the Ebers-Moll equations. In the forward-active region, they simplify into a form similar to that of (1.35), (1.47), and (1.49) derived earlier. This can be shown by substituting \\(V_{B E}\\) positive and \\(V_{B C}\\) negative in (1.62) and (1.63) to obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{C} & =\\alpha_{F} I_{E S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)+I_{C S}  \\tag{1.65}\\\\\nI_{E} & =-I_{E S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)-\\alpha_{R} I_{C S} \\tag{1.66}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nEquation 1.65 is similar in form to (1.35) except that leakage currents, previously neglected, have now been included. This minor difference is significant only at high temperatures or very low operating currents. Comparison of (1.65) with (1.35) allows us to identify \\(I_{S}=\\alpha_{F} I_{E S}\\), and it can be shown ${ }^{10}$ in general that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\alpha_{F} I_{E S}=\\alpha_{R} I_{C S}=I_{S} \\tag{1.67}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere this expression represents a reciprocity condition. Utilizing (1.67) in (1.62) and (1.63) allows the Ebers-Moll equations to be expressed in the general form\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{C} & =I_{S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)-\\frac{I_{S}}{\\alpha_{R}}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B C}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)  \\tag{1.62a}\\\\\nI_{E} & =-\\frac{I_{S}}{\\alpha_{F}}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)+I_{S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B C}}{V_{T}}-1\\right) \\tag{1.63a}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis form is frequently used for computer representation of transistor large-signal behavior.\nThe impact of leakage currents, as mentioned earlier, can be further demonstrated as follows. In the forward-active region, from (1.66)\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{E S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)=-I_{E}-\\alpha_{R} I_{C S} \\tag{1.68}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSubstituting (1.68) in (1.65) gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C}=-\\alpha_{F} I_{E}+I_{C O} \\tag{1.69}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C O}=I_{C S}\\left(1-\\alpha_{R} \\alpha_{F}\\right) \\tag{1.69a}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand \\(I_{C O}\\) is the collector-base leakage current with the emitter open. Although \\(I_{C O}\\) is theoretically given by (1.69a), in practice, surface leakage effects dominate when the collector-base junction is reverse biased, and \\(I_{C O}\\) is typically several orders of magnitude larger than the value given by (1.69a). However, (1.69) remains valid if the appropriate measured value for \\(I_{C O}\\) is used. Typical values of \\(I_{C O}\\) are from \\(10^{-10}\\) to \\(10^{-12} \\mathrm{~A}\\) at \\(25^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\), and the magnitude doubles approximately every \\(8^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\). As a consequence, these leakage terms can become very significant at high temperatures. For instance, consider the base current \\(I_{B}\\).

    "text": "In the saturation region, analog circuits typically avoid operation due to the low transistor gain. However, this region is more frequently utilized in digital circuits, where it provides a defined output voltage indicative of a logical state.\n\nWhen in saturation, both the emitter-base and collector-base junctions are forward biased.

Consequently, changes in \\(V_{C E}\\) with \\(V_{B E}\\) held constant (which cause equal changes in \\(V_{B C}\\)) directly affect \\(n_{p}\\left(W_{B}\\right)\\). Since the collector current is proportional to the slope of the minority-carrier concentration in the base [see (1.31)], it is also proportional to \\(\\left[n_{p}(0)-n_{p}\\left(W_{B}\\right)\\right]\\) from Fig. 1.11. Thus changes in \\(n_{p}\\left(W_{B}\\right)\\) directly affect the collector current, and the collector node of the transistor appears to have a low impedance. As \\(V_{C E}\\) is decreased in saturation with \\(V_{B E}\\) held constant, \\(V_{B C}\\) increases, as does \\(n_{p}\\left(W_{B}\\right)\\) from (1.59). Thus, from Fig. 1.11, the collector current decreases because the slope of the carrier concentration decreases. This gives rise to the saturation region of the \\(I_{C}-V_{C E}\\) characteristic shown in Fig. 1.12. The slope of the \\(I_{C}-V_{C E}\\) characteristic in this region is largely determined by the resistance in series with the collector lead due to the finite resistivity of the \\(n\\)-type collector material.

A more accurate but more complex model includes a resistor in series with the collector. This resistor can have a value ranging from 20 to $500 \\Omega$, depending on the device structure.\n\nAn additional aspect of transistor behavior in the saturation region is apparent from Fig. 1.11. For a given collector current, there is now a much larger amount of stored charge in the base than there is in the forward-active region. Thus the base-current contribution represented by (1.41) will be larger in saturation. In addition, since the collector-base junction is now forward biased, there is a new base-current component due to injection of carriers from the base to the collector. These two effects result in a base current \\(I_{B}\\) in saturation, which is larger than in the forward-active region for a given collector current \\(I_{C}\\). Ratio \\(I_{C} / I_{B}\\) in saturation is often referred to as the forced \\(\\beta\\) and is always less than \\(\\beta_{F}\\). As the forced \\(\\beta\\) is made lower with respect to \\(\\beta_{F}\\), the device is said to be more heavily saturated.\n\nThe minority-carrier concentration in saturation shown in Fig. 1.11 is a straight line joining the two end points, assuming that recombination is small.

Consequently, changes in \\( V_{CE} \\) with \\( V_{BE} \\) held constant (which cause equal changes in \\( V_{BC} \\)) directly affect \\( n_{p}\\left(W_{B}\\right) \\). Since the collector current is proportional to the slope of the minority-carrier concentration in the base [see (1.31)], it is also proportional to \\(\\left[n_{p}(0)-n_{p}\\left(W_{B}\\right)\\right]\\) from Fig. 1.11. Thus, changes in \\( n_{p}\\left(W_{B}\\right) \\) directly affect the collector current, and the collector node of the transistor appears to have a low impedance. As \\( V_{CE} \\) is decreased in saturation with \\( V_{BE} \\) held constant, \\( V_{BC} \\) increases, as does \\( n_{p}\\left(W_{B}\\right) \\) from (1.59). Thus, from Fig. 1.11, the collector current decreases because the slope of the carrier concentration decreases. This gives rise to the saturation region of the \\( I_{C}-V_{CE} \\) characteristic shown in Fig. 1.12. The slope of the \\( I_{C}-V_{CE} \\) characteristic in this region is largely determined by the resistance in series with the collector lead due to the finite resistivity of the n-type collector material. A useful model for the transistor in this region is shown in Fig. 1.13 and consists of a fixed voltage source to represent \\( V_{BE(\\text { on })} \\), and a fixed voltage source to represent the collector-emitter voltage \\( V_{CE(\\text { sat })} \\). A more accurate but more complex model includes a resistor in series with the collector. This resistor can have a value ranging from 20 to 500 \\(\\Omega\\), depending on the device structure.\n\nAn additional aspect of transistor behavior in the saturation region is apparent from Fig. 1.11. For a given collector current, there is now a much larger amount of stored charge in the base than there is in the forward-active region. Thus, the base-current contribution represented by (1.41) will be larger in saturation. In addition, since the collector-base junction is now forward biased, there is a new base-current component due to injection of carriers from the base to the collector. These two effects result in a base current \\( I_{B} \\) in saturation, which is larger than in the forward-active region for a given collector current \\( I_{C} \\). Ratio \\( I_{C} / I_{B} \\) in saturation is often referred to as the forced \\(\\beta\\) and is always less than \\(\\beta_{F} \\). As the forced \\(\\beta\\) is made lower with respect to \\(\\beta_{F} \\), the device is said to be more heavily saturated.\n\nThe minority-carrier concentration in saturation shown in Fig. 1.11 is a straight line joining the two end points, assuming that recombination is small. This can be represented as a linear superposition of the two dotted distributions as shown. The justification for this is that the terminal currents depend linearly on the concentrations \\( n_{p}(0) \\) and \\( n_{p}\\left(W_{B}\\right) \\). This picture of device carrier concentrations can be used to derive some general equations describing transistor behavior. Each of the distributions in Fig. 1.11 is considered separately and the two contributions are combined. The emitter current that would result from \\( n_{p 1}(x) \\) above is given by the classical diode equation\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{E F}=-I_{E S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}-1\\right) \\tag{1.60}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( I_{E S} \\) is a constant that is often referred to as the saturation current of the junction (no connection with the transistor saturation previously described). Equation 1.60 predicts that the junction current is given by \\( I_{E F} \\simeq I_{E S} \\) with a reverse-bias voltage applied. However, in practice (1.60) is applicable only in the forward-bias region, since second-order effects dominate under reverse-bias conditions and typically result in a junction current several orders of magnitude larger than \\( I_{E S} \\). The junction current that flows under reverse-bias conditions is often called the leakage current of the junction.\n\nReturning to Fig. 1.11, we can describe the collector current resulting from \\( n_{p 2}(x) \\) alone as\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C R}=-I_{C S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B C}}{V_{T}}-1\\right) \\tag{1.61}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( I_{C S} \\) is a constant. The total collector current \\( I_{C} \\) is given by \\( I_{C R} \\) plus the fraction of \\( I_{E F} \\) that reaches the collector (allowing for recombination and reverse emitter injection). Thus\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C}=\\alpha_{F} I_{E S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)-I_{C S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B C}}{V_{T}}-1\\right) \\tag{1.62}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\alpha_{F} \\) has been defined previously by (1.51). Similarly, the total emitter current is composed of \\( I_{E F} \\) plus the fraction of \\( I_{C R} \\) that reaches the emitter with the transistor acting in an inverted mode. Thus\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{E}=-I_{E S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)+\\alpha_{R} I_{C S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B C}}{V_{T}}-1\\right) \\tag{1.63}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\alpha_{R} \\) is the ratio of emitter to collector current with the transistor operating inverted (i.e., with the collector-base junction forward biased and emitting carriers into the base and the emitter-base junction reverse biased and collecting carriers). Typical values of \\( \\alpha_{R} \\) are 0.5 to 0.8.\n\nAn inverse current gain \\( \\beta_{R} \\) is also defined\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\beta_{R}=\\frac{\\alpha_{R}}{1-\\alpha_{R}} \\tag{1.64}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\n\nand has typical values 1 to 5. This is the current gain of the transistor when operated inverted and is much lower than \\( \\beta_{F} \\) because the device geometry and doping densities are designed to maximize \\( \\beta_{F} \\). The inverse-active region of device operation occurs for \\( V_{CE} \\) negative in an npn transistor and is shown in Fig. 1.12. In order to display these characteristics adequately in the same figure as the forward-active region, the negative voltage and current scales have been expanded. The inverse-active mode of operation is rarely encountered in analog circuits.\n\nEquations 1.62 and 1.63 describe npn transistor operation in the saturation region when \\( V_{BE} \\) and \\( V_{BC} \\) are both positive, and also in the forward-active and inverse-active regions. These equations are the Ebers-Moll equations. In the forward-active region, they degenerate into a form similar to that of (1.35), (1.47), and (1.49) derived earlier. This can be shown by putting \\( V_{BE} \\) positive and \\( V_{BC} \\) negative in (1.62) and (1.63) to obtain\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{C} & =\\alpha_{F} I_{E S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)+I_{C S}  \\tag{1.65}\\\\\nI_{E} & =-I_{E S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)-\\alpha_{R} I_{C S} \\tag{1.66}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nEquation 1.65 is similar in form to (1.35) except that leakage currents that were previously neglected have now been included. This minor difference is significant only at high temperatures or very low operating currents. Comparison of (1.65) with (1.35) allows us to identify \\( I_{S}=\\alpha_{F} I_{E S} \\), and it can be shown \\({ }^{10}\\) in general that\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\alpha_{F} I_{E S}=\\alpha_{R} I_{C S}=I_{S} \\tag{1.67}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\n\nwhere this expression represents a reciprocity condition. Use of (1.67) in (1.62) and (1.63) allows the Ebers-Moll equations to be expressed in the general form\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{C} & =I_{S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)-\\frac{I_{S}}{\\alpha_{R}}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B C}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)  \\tag{1.62a}\\\\\nI_{E} & =-\\frac{I_{S}}{\\alpha_{F}}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)+I_{S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B C}}{V_{T}}-1\\right) \\tag{1.63a}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThis form is often used for computer representation of transistor large-signal behavior.\n\nThe effect of leakage currents mentioned above can be further illustrated as follows. In the forward-active region, from (1.66)\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{E S}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)=-I_{E}-\\alpha_{R} I_{C S} \\tag{1.68}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\n\nSubstitution of (1.68) in (1.65) gives\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C}=-\\alpha_{F} I_{E}+I_{C O} \\tag{1.69}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C O}=I_{C S}\\left(1-\\alpha_{R} \\alpha_{F}\\right) \\tag{1.69a}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\n\nand \\( I_{C O} \\) is the collector-base leakage current with the emitter open.

    "text": "Saturation is a mode of operation typically shunned in analog circuits due to the minimal transistor gain within this region. Conversely, it is a prevalent state in digital circuits, where it yields a definite output voltage signifying a logic level.\n\nIn saturation mode, both the emitter-base and collector-base junctions are forward biased. This results in a very small collector-emitter voltage, $V_{CE}$, which usually falls between 0.05 and 0.3 V. Figure 1.11 depicts the carrier concentrations in a saturated npn transistor with a consistent base doping. The minority-carrier concentration at the periphery of the depletion region in the base is once again expressed by equation (1.28) as:\n\n$$\nn_{p}(W_{B})=n_{p0} \\exp \\frac{V_{BC}}{V_{T}} \\tag{1.59}\n$$\n\nFigure 1.11 presents a spatial distribution graph illustrating the variation in carrier concentration across the different regions of the transistor: the emitter, base, and collector.\n\nFigure 1.12 portrays the collector current, $I_C$, against the collector-emitter voltage, $V_{CE}$, for an npn bipolar transistor. It delineates the typical $I_C-V_{CE}$ characteristics, demarcating distinct operational regions: saturation, forward active, and inverse active.\n\nAs $V_{BC}$ becomes positive, the value of $n_{p}(W_{B})$ is no longer trivial. Hence, alterations in $V_{CE}$, with $V_{BE}$ constant (resulting in equivalent changes in $V_{BC}$), directly impact $n_{p}(W_{B})$. Since the collector current is proportional to the slope of the minority-carrier concentration in the base, it is also proportional to $[n_{p}(0)-n_{p}(W_{B})]$ from Figure 1.11. Thus, changes in $n_{p}(W_{B})$ directly influence the collector current, making the collector node of the transistor seem to have a low impedance. As $V_{CE}$ decreases in saturation with $V_{BE}$ constant, $V_{BC}$ rises, as does $n_{p}(W_{B})$ from equation (1.59). Therefore, as depicted in Figure 1.11, the collector current diminishes due to the decreased slope of the carrier concentration. This gives rise to the saturation region of the $I_C-V_{CE}$ characteristic shown in Figure 1.12. The slope of the $I_C-V_{CE}$ characteristic in this region is primarily dictated by the resistance in series with the collector lead due to the finite resistivity of the n-type collector material. A practical model for the transistor in this region, as shown in Figure 1.13, comprises a fixed voltage source to represent $V_{BE(on)}$ and another to represent the collector-emitter voltage $V_{CE(sat)}$. A more precise yet more intricate model incorporates a resistor in series with the collector, with a value ranging from 20 to $500 \\Omega$, contingent on the device structure.\n\nAnother facet of transistor behavior in the saturation region is evident from Figure 1.11. For a specific collector current, the base holds a significantly greater stored charge compared to the forward-active region. Consequently, the base-current contribution, as represented by equation (1.41), is greater in saturation. Furthermore, since the collector-base junction is now forward biased, there is an additional base-current component due to carrier injection from the base to the collector. These two phenomena result in a base current, $I_B$, in saturation that exceeds that of the forward-active region for a given collector current, $I_C$. The ratio $I_C/I_B$ in saturation is often referred to as the forced $\\beta$ and is always less than $\\beta_F$. As the forced $\\beta$ decreases relative to $\\beta_F$, the device is deemed more heavily saturated.\n\nThe minority-carrier concentration in saturation, as shown in Figure 1.11, is a straight line connecting the two endpoints, presupposing minimal recombination. This can be depicted as a linear combination of the two dotted distributions. The rationale for this is that the terminal currents depend linearly on the concentrations $n_{p}(0)$ and $n_{p}(W_{B})$. This depiction of device carrier concentrations can be employed to derive general equations describing transistor behavior. Each distribution in Figure 1.11 is examined separately, and the two contributions are merged. The emitter current arising from $n_{p1}(x)$ is given by the classical diode equation:\n\n$$\nI_{EF}=-I_{ES}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{BE}}{V_{T}}-1\\right) \\tag{1.60}\n$$\n\nwhere $I_{ES}$ is a constant often referred to as the junction's saturation current (unrelated to the transistor saturation previously discussed). Equation 1.60 predicts that the junction current is approximately $I_{EF} \\simeq I_{ES}$ when a reverse-bias voltage is applied. Nonetheless, in practice, equation (1.60) is only valid in the forward-bias region, as higher-order effects predominate under reverse-bias conditions, typically resulting in a junction current several orders of magnitude greater than $I_{ES}$. The junction current under reverse-bias conditions is frequently called the leakage current of the junction.\n\nRevisiting Figure 1.11, the collector current due to $n_{p2}(x)$ alone can be expressed as:\n\n$$\nI_{CR}=-I_{CS}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{BC}}{V_{T}}-1\\right) \\tag{1.61}\n$$\n\nwhere $I_{CS}$ is a constant. The total collector current, $I_C$, is the sum of $I_{CR}$ and the fraction of $I_{EF}$ that reaches the collector (accounting for recombination and reverse emitter injection). Thus:\n\n$$\nI_C=\\alpha_{F} I_{ES}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{BE}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)-I_{CS}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{BC}}{V_{T}}-1\\right) \\tag{1.62}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha_{F}$ has been previously defined by equation (1.51). Similarly, the total emitter current is the sum of $I_{EF}$ and the fraction of $I_{CR}$ that reaches the emitter with the transistor operating in an inverted mode. Hence:\n\n$$\nI_E=-I_{ES}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{BE}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)+\\alpha_{R} I_{CS}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{BC}}{V_{T}}-1\\right) \\tag{1.63}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha_{R}$ is the ratio of emitter to collector current with the transistor operating inverted (i.e., with the collector-base junction forward biased and emitting carriers into the base and the emitter-base junction reverse biased and collecting carriers). Typical $\\alpha_{R}$ values range from 0.5 to 0.8.\n\nAn inverse current gain, $\\beta_R$, is also defined:\n\n$$\n\\beta_R=\\frac{\\alpha_{R}}{1-\\alpha_{R}} \\tag{1.64}\n$$\n\nwith typical values between 1 and 5. This represents the current gain of the transistor when operated inverted and is much lower than $\\beta_F$ because the device geometry and doping densities are tailored to maximize $\\beta_F$. The inverse-active region of device operation occurs for negative $V_{CE}$ in an npn transistor, as shown in Figure 1.12. To adequately display these characteristics alongside the forward-active region in the same figure, the negative voltage and current scales have been expanded. The inverse-active mode of operation is seldom encountered in analog circuits.\n\nEquations 1.62 and 1.63 describe npn transistor operation in the saturation region when both $V_{BE}$ and $V_{BC}$ are positive, as well as in the forward-active and inverse-active regions. These equations are known as the Ebers-Moll equations. In the forward-active region, they revert to a form similar to equations (1.35), (1.47), and (1.49) derived earlier. This can be demonstrated by substituting positive $V_{BE}$ and negative $V_{BC}$ into equations (1.62) and (1.63) to obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_C &= \\alpha_{F} I_{ES}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{BE}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)+I_{CS}  \\tag{1.65}\\\\\nI_E &= -I_{ES}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{BE}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)-\\alpha_{R} I_{CS}  \\tag{1.66}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nEquation 1.65 resembles equation (1.35), except that it now includes leakage currents that were previously disregarded. This minor discrepancy is only significant at high temperatures or very low operating currents. Comparing equation (1.65) with (1.35) allows us to identify $I_S=\\alpha_{F} I_{ES}$, and it can be shown that:\n\n$$\n\\alpha_{F} I_{ES}=\\alpha_{R} I_{CS}=I_S \\tag{1.67}\n$$\n\nThis expression denotes a reciprocity condition. Utilizing equation (1.67) in (1.62) and (1.63) enables the Ebers-Moll equations to be expressed in the general form:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_C &= I_S\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{BE}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)-\\frac{I_S}{\\alpha_{R}}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{BC}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)  \\tag{1.62a}\\\\\nI_E &= -\\frac{I_S}{\\alpha_{F}}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{BE}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)+I_S\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{BC}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)  \\tag{1.63a}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis form is frequently employed for computer simulations of transistor large-signal behavior.\n\nThe impact of leakage currents, as discussed earlier, can be further elucidated as follows. In the forward-active region, from equation (1.66):\n\n$$\nI_{ES}\\left(\\exp \\frac{V_{BE}}{V_{T}}-1\\right)=-I_E-\\alpha_{R} I_{CS} \\tag{1.68}\n$$\n\nSubstituting equation (1.68) into (1.65) yields:\n\n$$\nI_C=-\\alpha_{F} I_E+I_{CO} \\tag{1.69}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n\n$$\nI_{CO}=I_{CS}\\left(1-\\alpha_{R} \\alpha_{F}\\right) \\tag{1.69a}\n$$\n\nand $I_{CO}$ denotes the collector-base leakage current with the emitter open. Although $I_{CO}$ is theoretically given by equation (1.69a), in reality, surface leakage effects prevail when the collector-base junction is reverse biased, making $I_{CO}$ typically several orders of magnitude larger than the value provided by (1.69a). Nevertheless, equation (1.69) remains valid if the appropriate measured value for $I_{CO}$ is used. Typical $I_{CO}$ values range from $10^{-10}$ to $10^{-12} \\mathrm{~A}$ at $25^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, doubling approximately every $8^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. Consequently, these leakage terms can become very significant at high temperatures. For instance, consider the base current, $I_B$. From Figure 1.5, this is:\n\n$$\nI_B=-(I_C+I_E) \\tag{1.70}\n$$\n\nIf $I_E$ is calculated from equation (1.69) and substituted into (1.70), the result is:\n\n$$\nI_B=\\frac{1-\\alpha_{F}}{\\alpha_{F}} I_C-\\frac{I_{CO}}{\\alpha_{F}} \\tag{1.71}\n$$\n\nUsing equation (1.50):\n\n$$\n\\beta_F=\\frac{\\alpha_{F}}{1-\\alpha_{F}} \\tag{1.72}\n$$\n\nand substituting (1.72) into (1.71) gives:\n\n$$\nI_B=\\frac{I_C}{\\beta_F}-\\frac{I_{CO}}{\\alpha_{F}} \\tag{1.73}\n$$\n\nSince the two terms in equation (1.73) have opposite signs, the effect of $I_{CO}$ is to reduce the magnitude of the external base current at a given collector current value.\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nIf $I_{CO}$ is $10^{-10} \\mathrm{~A}$ at $24^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, estimate its value at $120^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.\nAssuming that $I_{CO}$ doubles every $8^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nI_{CO}(120^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}) &= 10^{-10} \\times 2^{12} \\\\\n&= 0.4 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$"

    "text": "In Section 1.2.2, the mechanism of avalanche breakdown in a pn junction was detailed. Similar phenomena occur at the base-emitter and base-collector junctions of a transistor, limiting the maximum applicable voltages.\n\nConsider first a transistor in the common-base configuration illustrated in Fig. 1.14a, supplied with a constant emitter current. Typical $I_{C}-V_{C B}$ characteristics for an npn transistor in this setup are depicted in Fig. 1.14b. For $I_{E}=0$, the collector-base junction breaks down at a voltage $B V_{C B O}$, indicating collector-base breakdown with an open emitter. For non-zero $I_{E}$ values, avalanche multiplication effects are evident for $V_{C B}$ values below $B V_{C B O}$. In the example shown, the effective common-base current gain $\\alpha_{F}=I_{C} / I_{E}$ exceeds unity for $V_{C B}$ values above approximately 60 V. Operation in this region (but below $B V_{C B O}$) is safe if device power dissipation remains manageable. The principles from Section 1.2.2 apply here, and neglecting leakage currents, the collector current in Fig. 1.14a can be calculated as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C}=-\\alpha_{F} I_{E} M \\tag{1.74}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $M$ is defined by (1.26), thus\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C}=-\\alpha_{F} I_{E} \\frac{1}{1-\\left(\\frac{V_{C B}}{B V_{C B O}}\\right)^{n}} \\tag{1.75}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:\n[\nname: Q1, type: NPN, ports: {C: VCB, B: GND, E: e1}\nname: IE, type: CurrentSource, value: IE, ports: {Np: e1, Nn: GND}\nname: VCB, type: VoltageSource, value: VCB, ports: {Np: VCB, Nn: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit diagram represents a common-base configuration of an NPN transistor.

This is a standard I-V characteristic curve used in transistor analysis.\n\n1. **Graph Type and Function:**\n- The graph is an I-V characteristic curve for a transistor in a common-base configuration.\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n- The horizontal axis represents the collector-base voltage (V_CB) in volts.\n- The vertical axis represents the collector current (I_C) in milliamperes (mA).\n- Both axes use a linear scale.\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- The curves illustrate the collector current I_C for different emitter currents (I_E = 0.5 mA, 1.0 mA, and 1.5 mA) as a function of V_CB.\n- At low V_CB values, the collector current remains relatively stable, indicating a flat region.\n- As V_CB increases, there is a slight upward curvature in I_C, becoming more pronounced as V_CB approaches the breakdown voltage (BV_CBO).\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The graph includes three distinct curves corresponding to different emitter currents (I_E = 0.5 mA, 1.0 mA, and 1.5 mA).\n- Each curve starts at a point on the vertical axis corresponding to its respective I_E value.\n- The breakdown voltage (BV_CBO) is marked on the V_CB axis at around 100 volts, beyond which avalanche effects become significant.\n- The Early effect is minimal in this configuration for low V_CB values.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- The graph includes annotations for I_E values on each curve.\n- A dashed vertical line marks the breakdown voltage (BV_CBO) at 100 volts, indicating the limit where the transistor may enter avalanche breakdown.\n- The curves are labeled with the corresponding I_E values for clear reference.\n\nFigure 1.14 Common-base transistor connection. (a) Test circuit. (b) $I_{C}-V_{C B}$ characteristics.\n\nAnother point to note about the common-base characteristics in Fig. 1.14b is that for low $V_{C B}$ values, where avalanche effects are minimal, the curves show little of the Early effect seen in common-emitter characteristics. Base widening still occurs with increasing $V_{C B}$, but unlike the common-emitter setup, it causes minimal change in $I_{C}$. This is because $I_{E}$ is fixed, unlike $V_{B E}$ or $I_{B}$, and in Fig. 1.9, this means the slope of the minority-carrier concentration at the emitter edge of the base remains constant, keeping the collector current largely unchanged.\n\nNow, consider the impact of avalanche breakdown on the common-emitter characteristics. Typical characteristics are shown in Fig. 1.12, with breakdown occurring at a voltage $B V_{C E O}$, sometimes termed the sustaining voltage $L V_{C E O}$. As in previous cases, operation near the breakdown voltage is harmful only if the current (and thus power dissipation) becomes excessive.\n\nThe effects of avalanche breakdown on common-emitter characteristics are more intricate than in the common-base configuration. This complexity arises because the avalanche process generates hole-electron pairs, with holes swept into the base, effectively contributing to the base current. In essence, the avalanche current is amplified by the transistor. The base current is still given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{B}=-\\left(I_{C}+I_{E}\\right) \\tag{1.76}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation 1.74 remains valid, and substituting it into (1.76) yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C}=\\frac{M \\alpha_{F}}{1-M \\alpha_{F}} I_{B} \\tag{1.77}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nM=\\frac{1}{1-\\left(\\frac{V_{C B}}{B V_{C B O}}\\right)^{n}} \\tag{1.78}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation 1.77 shows that $I_{C}$ approaches infinity as $M \\alpha_{F}$ approaches unity, meaning the effective $\\beta$ approaches infinity due to the additional base-current contribution from the avalanche process. The value of $B V_{C E O}$ can be determined by solving\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nM \\alpha_{F}=1 \\tag{1.79}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAssuming $V_{C B} \\simeq V_{C E}$, this gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\alpha_{F}}{1-\\left(\\frac{B V_{C E O}}{B V_{C B O}}\\right)^{n}}=1 \\tag{1.80}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nresulting in\n\n$$\n\\frac{B V_{C E O}}{B V_{C B O}}=\\sqrt[n]{1-\\alpha_{F}}\n$$\n\nand thus\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nB V_{C E O} \\simeq \\frac{B V_{C B O}}{\\sqrt[n]{\\beta_{F}}} \\tag{1.81}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation 1.81 indicates that $B V_{C E O}$ is significantly lower than $B V_{C B O}$. However, the $B V_{C B O}$ value used in (1.81) must be the plane junction breakdown of the collector-base junction, ignoring edge effects, as only the collector-base avalanche current under the emitter is amplified as described. As explained in Section 1.2.2, the measured $B V_{C B O}$ is usually determined by avalanche in the curved region of the collector, away from the active base. Consequently, for typical values of $\\beta_{F}=100$ and $n=4$, $B V_{C E O}$ is about half the measured $B V_{C B O}$, not 30 percent as (1.81) suggests.\n\nEquation 1.81 explains the shape of the breakdown characteristics in Fig. 1.12, considering the dependence of $\\beta_{F}$ on collector current. As $V_{C E}$ increases from zero with $I_{B}=0$, the initial collector current is roughly $\\beta_{F} I_{C O}$ from (1.73); since $I_{C O}$ is typically a few picoamperes, the collector current is very small. As detailed in the next section, $\\beta_{F}$ is small at low currents, so from (1.81), the breakdown voltage is high. However, as avalanche breakdown begins, $I_{C}$ increases, raising $\\beta_{F}$. This decreases the breakdown voltage, causing the characteristic to bend back as shown in Fig. 1.12, with a negative slope. At higher collector currents, $\\beta_{F}$ stabilizes, and the breakdown curve with $I_{B}=0$ becomes perpendicular to the $V_{C E}$ axis. The $V_{C E}$ value in this region is usually defined as $B V_{C E O}$, the maximum voltage the device can withstand. The $\\beta_{F}$ value for calculating $B V_{C E O}$ in (1.81) is the peak $\\beta_{F}$. Note that high- $\\beta$ transistors will have lower $B V_{C E O}$ values.\n\nThe base-emitter junction of a transistor is also prone to avalanche breakdown. However, the emitter doping density is high to ensure a large $\\beta_{F}\\left[N_{D}\\right.$ is large in $(1.45)$ to reduce $\\left.I_{B 2}\\right]$. Thus, the base, being the less heavily doped side, determines the breakdown characteristic. This contrasts with the collector-base junction, where the collector is the less heavily doped side, resulting in typical $B V_{C B O}$ values of 20 to 80 V or more. The base is typically an order of magnitude more heavily doped than the collector, so the base-emitter breakdown voltage, $B V_{E B O}$, is much lower, usually around 6 to 8 V. The breakdown voltage for inverse-active operation in Fig. 1.12 is approximately this value, as the base-emitter junction is reverse biased in this mode.\n\nThe base-emitter breakdown voltage of 6 to 8 V serves as a convenient reference voltage in integrated-circuit design, often used in Zener diodes. However, care must be taken to protect all other transistors in the circuit from reverse base-emitter voltages that could cause breakdown. Unlike collector-base breakdown, base-emitter breakdown is damaging to the device, potentially causing significant $\\beta_{F}$ degradation depending on the duration and magnitude of the breakdown current. ${ }^{11}$ If used purely as a Zener diode, this is insignificant, but for an amplifying transistor, $\\beta_{F}$ degradation can be serious.\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nGiven a transistor with a collector doping density of $2 \\times 10^{15} \\mathrm{atoms} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$, much lower than the base doping, calculate $B V_{C E O}$ for $\\beta=100$ and $n=4$.

However, the $B V_{C B O}$ value used in (1.81) must represent the plane junction breakdown of the collector-base junction, neglecting edge effects, as only the collector-base avalanche current under the emitter is amplified as described. As explained in Section 1.2.2, the measured $B V_{C B O}$ is usually determined by avalanche in the curved region of the collector, remote from the active base. Consequently, for typical $\\beta_{F}=100$ and $n=4$, $B V_{C E O}$ is about half the measured $B V_{C B O}$, not 30 percent as (1.81) suggests.\n\nEquation 1.81 explains the breakdown characteristics in Fig. 1.12, considering $\\beta_{F}$'s dependence on collector current. As $V_{C E}$ increases from zero with $I_{B}=0$, the initial collector current is roughly $\\beta_{F} I_{C O}$ from (1.73), with $I_{C O}$ typically in picoamperes, making the collector current very small. As detailed in the next section, $\\beta_{F}$ is low at low currents, resulting in a high breakdown voltage from (1.81). However, as avalanche breakdown begins, $I_{C}$ increases, raising $\\beta_{F}$. This decreases the breakdown voltage, causing the characteristic to bend back with a negative slope, as shown in Fig. 1.12.

The $V_{C E}$ value in this region is defined as $B V_{C E O}$, the maximum voltage the device can withstand. The $\\beta_{F}$ value for calculating $B V_{C E O}$ in (1.81) is the peak $\\beta_{F}$. Note that high- $\\beta$ transistors will have lower $B V_{C E O}$ values.\n\nThe base-emitter junction also experiences avalanche breakdown. However, the emitter's high doping density ensures a high $\\beta_{F}$ (large $N_{D}$ in (1.45) reduces $I_{B 2}$), making the base the lightly doped side and determining the breakdown characteristic. This contrasts with the collector-base junction, where the collector is the lightly doped side, resulting in $B V_{C B O}$ values of 20 to 80 V or more. The base is typically ten times more heavily doped than the collector, leading to a much lower base-emitter breakdown voltage, typically 6 to 8 V, designated $B V_{E B O}$. The inverse-active operation breakdown voltage in Fig. 1.12 is approximately this value, as the base-emitter junction is reverse-biased in this mode.\n\nThe 6 to 8 V base-emitter breakdown voltage serves as a convenient reference in integrated-circuit design, often used in Zener diodes. However, care must be taken to protect other transistors in the circuit from reverse base-emitter voltages that could cause breakdown, as base-emitter breakdown is damaging to the device.

    "text": "In Section 1.2.2, the mechanism of avalanche breakdown in a pn junction was detailed. Similar phenomena occur at the base-emitter and base-collector junctions of a transistor, limiting the maximum applicable voltages.\n\nConsider initially a transistor in the common-base configuration depicted in Fig. 1.14a, supplied with a constant emitter current. Typical $I_{C}-V_{C B}$ characteristics for an npn transistor in this setup are illustrated in Fig. 1.14b. For $I_{E}=0$, the collector-base junction undergoes breakdown at a voltage $B V_{C B O}$, representing collector-base breakdown with the emitter open.

(a) Test circuit. (b) $I_{C}-V_{C B}$ characteristics.\n\nAnother notable aspect of the common-base characteristics in Fig. 1.14b is that for low $V_{C B}$ values, where avalanche effects are minimal, the curves exhibit very little of the Early effect seen in common-emitter characteristics. Base widening still occurs with increasing $V_{C B}$, but unlike the common-emitter setup, it results in negligible changes in $I_{C}$. This is due to $I_{E}$ being fixed instead of $V_{B E}$ or $I_{B}$, meaning the slope of the minority-carrier concentration at the emitter edge of the base remains constant, keeping the collector current largely stable.\n\nNow, examine the impact of avalanche breakdown on the common-emitter characteristics of the device. Typical characteristics are shown in Fig. 1.12, with breakdown occurring at a voltage $B V_{C E O}$, sometimes termed the sustaining voltage $L V_{C E O}$. As with previous cases, operation near the breakdown voltage is harmful to the device only if the current (and thus power dissipation) becomes excessive.\n\nThe effects of avalanche breakdown on common-emitter characteristics are more intricate than in the common-base configuration. This complexity arises because the avalanche process generates hole-electron pairs, with the holes being swept into the base, effectively contributing to the base current. In essence, the avalanche current is amplified by the transistor. The base current is still given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{B}=-\\left(I_{C}+I_{E}\\right) \\tag{1.76}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation 1.74 remains valid, and substituting it into (1.76) yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C}=\\frac{M \\alpha_{F}}{1-M \\alpha_{F}} I_{B} \\tag{1.77}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nM=\\frac{1}{1-\\left(\\frac{V_{C B}}{B V_{C B O}}\\right)^{n}} \\tag{1.78}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation 1.77 indicates that $I_{C}$ approaches infinity as $M \\alpha_{F}$ approaches unity, meaning the effective $\\beta$ approaches infinity due to the additional base-current contribution from the avalanche process. The value of $B V_{C E O}$ can be determined by solving\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nM \\alpha_{F}=1 \\tag{1.79}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAssuming $V_{C B} \\simeq V_{C E}$, this leads to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\alpha_{F}}{1-\\left(\\frac{B V_{C E O}}{B V_{C B O}}\\right)^{n}}=1 \\tag{1.80}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nresulting in\n\n$$\n\\frac{B V_{C E O}}{B V_{C B O}}=\\sqrt[n]{1-\\alpha_{F}}\n$$\n\nand thus\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nB V_{C E O} \\simeq \\frac{B V_{C B O}}{\\sqrt[n]{\\beta_{F}}} \\tag{1.81}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation 1.81 shows that $B V_{C E O}$ is significantly less than $B V_{C B O}$. However, the $B V_{C B O}$ value used in (1.81) must represent the plane junction breakdown of the collector-base junction, neglecting edge effects, as only the collector-base avalanche current under the emitter is amplified as described. As explained in Section 1.2.2, the measured $B V_{C B O}$ is usually determined by avalanche in the curved region of the collector, distant from the active base. Consequently, for typical values of $\\beta_{F}=100$ and $n=4$, $B V_{C E O}$ is about half the measured $B V_{C B O}$, not 30 percent as (1.81) suggests.\n\nEquation 1.81 explains the shape of the breakdown characteristics in Fig. 1.12, considering the dependence of $\\beta_{F}$ on collector current. As $V_{C E}$ increases from zero with $I_{B}=0$, the initial collector current is roughly $\\beta_{F} I_{C O}$ from (1.73), with $I_{C O}$ typically in the picoampere range, making the collector current very small. As detailed in the next section, $\\beta_{F}$ is low at low currents, so from (1.81), the breakdown voltage is high. However, as avalanche breakdown begins, $I_{C}$ increases, raising $\\beta_{F}$. This decreases the breakdown voltage, causing the characteristic to bend back as shown in Fig. 1.12, with a negative slope. At higher collector currents, $\\beta_{F}$ stabilizes, and the breakdown curve with $I_{B}=0$ becomes perpendicular to the $V_{C E}$ axis. The $V_{C E}$ value in this region is usually defined as $B V_{C E O}$, representing the maximum voltage the device can withstand. The $\\beta_{F}$ value for calculating $B V_{C E O}$ in (1.81) is the peak $\\beta_{F}$. Note that high-$\\beta$ transistors will have lower $B V_{C E O}$ values.\n\nThe base-emitter junction of a transistor is also susceptible to avalanche breakdown. However, the emitter doping density is deliberately high to ensure a large $\\beta_{F}$ [with $N_{D}$ large in (1.45) to reduce $I_{B 2}$], making the base the more lightly doped side and determining the breakdown characteristic. This contrasts with the collector-base junction, where the collector is the more lightly doped side, resulting in typical $B V_{C B O}$ values of 20 to 80 V or more. The base is typically an order of magnitude more heavily doped than the collector, so the base-emitter breakdown voltage is much lower than $B V_{C B O}$, usually around 6 to 8 V, designated $B V_{E B O}$. The breakdown voltage for inverse-active operation in Fig. 1.12 is approximately this value because the base-emitter junction is reverse-biased in this mode.\n\nThe base-emitter breakdown voltage of 6 to 8 V serves as a convenient reference voltage in integrated-circuit design, often utilized in Zener diode form. However, care must be taken to protect all other transistors in the circuit from reverse base-emitter voltages that could cause breakdown, as base-emitter breakdown is damaging to the device. It can lead to significant $\\beta_{F}$ degradation, depending on the duration and magnitude of the breakdown current. If the device is used solely as a Zener diode, this is irrelevant, but for an amplifying transistor, $\\beta_{F}$ degradation can be severe.\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nGiven a transistor with a collector doping density of $2 \\times 10^{15} \\mathrm{atoms} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$, much lower than the base doping, calculate $B V_{C E O}$ for $\\beta=100$ and $n=4$, assuming $\\mathscr{E}_{\\text {crit }}=3 \\times 10^{5} \\mathrm{~V} / \\mathrm{cm}$.\n\nThe plane breakdown voltage in the collector can be calculated from (1.24) using $\\mathscr{E}_{\\max }=\\mathscr{E}_{\\text {crit }}$:\n\n$$\nB V_{C B O}=\\frac{\\epsilon\\left(N_{A}+N_{D}\\right)}{2 q N_{A} N_{D}} \\mathscr{E}_{\\text {crit }}^{2}\n$$\n\nSince $N_{D} \\ll N_{A}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\left.B V_{C B O}\\right|_{\\text {plane }}=\\frac{\\epsilon}{2 q N_{D}} \\mathscr{E}_{\\text {crit }}^{2}=\\frac{1.04 \\times 10^{-12}}{2 \\times 1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\times 2 \\times 10^{15}} \\times 9 \\times 10^{10} \\mathrm{~V}=146 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nFrom (1.81)\n\n$$\nB V_{C E O}=\\frac{146}{\\sqrt[4]{100}} \\mathrm{~V}=46 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$"

O}$。与之前情况一样，只有在电流（以及功耗）变得过大时，接近击穿电压的操作才会对设备造成破坏。\n\n雪崩击穿对共射极特性的影响比共基极配置更复杂。这是因为雪崩过程产生的空穴-电子对，空穴被扫入基区，有效增加了基极电流。在某种意义上，雪崩电流通过晶体管被放大。基极电流仍由\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{B}=-\\left(I_{C}+I_{E}\\right) \\tag{1.76}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n给出。方程1.74仍然成立，将其代入（1.76）得到\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C}=\\frac{M \\alpha_{F}}{1-M \\alpha_{F}} I_{B} \\tag{1.77}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n其中\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nM=\\frac{1}{1-\\left(\\frac{V_{C B}}{B V_{C B O}}\\right)^{n}} \\tag{1.78}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n方程1.77显示，当$M \\alpha_{F}$接近1时，$I_{C}$趋于无穷大。也就是说，由于雪崩过程本身增加了基极电流，有效$\\beta$趋于无穷大。$B V_{C E O}$的值可以通过求解\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nM \\alpha_{F}=1 \\tag{1.79}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n来确定。如果我们假设$V_{C B} \\simeq V_{C E}$，则得到\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\alpha_{F}}{1-\\left(\\frac{B V_{C E O}}{B V_{C B O}}\\right)^{n}}=1 \\tag{1.80}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n结果为\n\n$$\n\\frac{B V_{C E O}}{B V_{C B

O}$小很多。然而，用于（1.81）中的$B V_{C B O}$值必须是集电极-基极结的平面结击穿，忽略任何边缘效应。这是因为只有实际位于发射极下的集电极-基极雪崩电流才会如前所述被放大。然而，如第1.2.2节所述，测量的$B V_{C B O}$值通常由集电极弯曲区域的雪崩决定，该区域远离活性基区。因此，对于典型值$\\beta_{F}=100$和$n=4$，$B V_{C E O}$约为测量的$B V_{C B O}$的一半，而不是（1.81）所示的30%。\n\n方程1.81解释了图1.12中击穿特性的形状，如果包括$\\beta_{F}$对集电极电流的依赖性。随着$V_{C E}$从零开始增加且$I_{B}=0$，初始集电极电流约为$\\beta_{F} I_{C O}$，由（1.73）给出；由于$I_{C O}$通常为几皮安，集电极电流非常小。如下一节所述，低电流下$\\beta_{F}$较小，因此从（1.81）可知击穿电压较高。然而，随着设备中雪崩击穿的开始，$I_{C}$值增加，$\\beta_{F}$也随之增加。从（1.81）可知，这导致击穿电压降低，特性曲线如Fig. 1.12所示弯曲，并呈现负斜率。在更高集电极电流下，$\\beta_{F}$接近恒定值，$I_{B}=0$的击穿曲线变得与$V_{C E}$轴垂直。该区域曲线的$V_{C E}$值通常定义为$B V_{C E O}$，因为这是设备能承受的最大电压。用于计算（1.81）中$B V_{C E O}$的$\\beta_{F}$值应是$\\beta_{F}$的峰值。注意从（1.81）可知，高$\\beta$晶体管将具有低$B V_{C E O}$值。\n\n晶体管的基极-发射极结也受雪崩击穿影响。然而，发射极的掺杂密度做得非常大，以确保$\\beta_{F}$的高值[$N_{D}$在（1.45）中做得很大以减少$I_{B 2}$]。因此，基区是结的较轻掺杂侧，决定了击穿特性。这与集电极-基极结形成对比，在集电极-基极结中，集电极是较轻掺杂侧，导致典型的$B V_{C B O}$值为20至80V或更高。基区通常比集电极重掺杂一个数量级，因此基极-发射极击穿电压远小于$B V_{C B O}$，通常约为6至8V。这被指定为$B V_{E B O}$。图1.12中显示的反向活性操作击穿电压大约等于此值，因为在这种操作模式下，基极-发射极结反向偏置。\n\n6至8V的基极-发射极击穿电压为集成电路设计提供了方便的参考电压，并常以齐纳二极管的形式利用。然而，必须注意确保电路中所有其他晶体管受到保护，防止反向基极-发射极电压足以引起击穿。这是因为，与集电极-基极击穿不同，基极-发射极击穿对设备有害。它可能导致$\\beta_{F}$的大幅下降，具体取决于击穿电流流动的持续时间和幅度。${ }^{11}$如果设备纯粹用作齐纳二极管，这无关紧要，但如果设备是放大晶体管，$\\beta_{F}$的下降可能很严重。\n\n#### 示例\n\n如果晶体管的集电极掺杂密度为$2 \\times 10^{15} \\mathrm{atoms} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$，且远小于基极掺杂，计算$\\beta=100$和$n=4$时的$B V_{C E

    "text": "In Section 1.2.2, the avalanche breakdown mechanism in a pn junction was detailed. Similar phenomena occur at the base-emitter and base-collector junctions of a transistor, limiting the maximum applicable voltages.\n\nConsider initially a transistor in the common-base configuration depicted in Fig. 1.14a, powered by a constant emitter current. The typical $I_{C}-V_{C B}$ characteristics for an npn transistor in this setup are illustrated in Fig. 1.14b. For $I_{E}=0$, the collector-base junction breaks down at a voltage $B V_{C B O}$, signifying collector-base breakdown with an open emitter.

In the depicted example, the effective common-base current gain $\\alpha_{F}=I_{C} / I_{E}$ exceeds unity for $V_{C B}$ values above approximately 60 V. Operation in this region (but below $B V_{C B O}$) is safe if the device's power dissipation remains manageable.

(a) Test circuit. (b) $I_{C}-V_{C B}$ characteristics.\n\nAnother notable aspect of the common-base characteristics in Fig. 1.14b is the minimal Early effect at low $V_{C B}$ values, where avalanche effects are insignificant. Base widening still occurs as $V_{C B}$ increases, but unlike in the common-emitter configuration, it causes minimal change in $I_{C}$. This is due to the fixed $I_{E}$ instead of $V_{B E}$ or $I_{B}$, meaning the slope of the minority-carrier concentration at the emitter edge of the base remains constant, keeping $I_{C}$ largely stable.\n\nNow, consider the impact of avalanche breakdown on the common-emitter characteristics. Typical characteristics are shown in Fig. 1.12, with breakdown occurring at $B V_{C E O}$, sometimes termed the sustaining voltage $L V_{C E O}$. As with previous cases, operation near the breakdown voltage is only destructive if the current (and thus power dissipation) becomes excessive.\n\nThe effects of avalanche breakdown on common-emitter characteristics are more intricate than in the common-base setup. This complexity arises because the avalanche process generates hole-electron pairs, with holes swept into the base, effectively contributing to the base current. In essence, the avalanche current is amplified by the transistor. The base current is still given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{B}=-\\left(I_{C}+I_{E}\\right) \\tag{1.76}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation 1.74 remains valid, and substituting it into (1.76) yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C}=\\frac{M \\alpha_{F}}{1-M \\alpha_{F}} I_{B} \\tag{1.77}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nM=\\frac{1}{1-\\left(\\frac{V_{C B}}{B V_{C B O}}\\right)^{n}} \\tag{1.78}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation 1.77 indicates that $I_{C}$ approaches infinity as $M \\alpha_{F}$ approaches unity, meaning the effective $\\beta$ approaches infinity due to the additional base current from the avalanche process. The value of $B V_{C E O}$ can be determined by solving\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nM \\alpha_{F}=1 \\tag{1.79}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAssuming $V_{C B} \\simeq V_{C E}$, this gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\alpha_{F}}{1-\\left(\\frac{B V_{C E O}}{B V_{C B O}}\\right)^{n}}=1 \\tag{1.80}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nresulting in\n\n$$\n\\frac{B V_{C E O}}{B V_{C B O}}=\\sqrt[n]{1-\\alpha_{F}}\n$$\n\nand thus\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nB V_{C E O} \\simeq \\frac{B V_{C B O}}{\\sqrt[n]{\\beta_{F}}} \\tag{1.81}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation 1.81 shows that $B V_{C E O}$ is substantially lower than $B V_{C B O}$. However, the $B V_{C B O}$ value used in (1.81) must represent the plane junction breakdown of the collector-base junction, excluding edge effects. This is because only the collector-base avalanche current under the emitter is amplified as previously calculated. As explained in Section 1.2.2, the measured $B V_{C B O}$ is usually determined by avalanche in the curved region of the collector, distant from the active base. Consequently, for typical values of $\\beta_{F}=100$ and $n=4$, $B V_{C E O}$ is about half the measured $B V_{C B O}$, not 30 percent as (1.81) suggests.\n\nEquation 1.81 explains the shape of the breakdown characteristics in Fig. 1.12, considering the dependence of $\\beta_{F}$ on collector current. As $V_{C E}$ increases from zero with $I_{B}=0$, the initial $I_{C}$ is approximately $\\beta_{F} I_{C O}$ from (1.73), with $I_{C O}$ typically several picoamperes, resulting in a very small $I_{C}$. As detailed in the next section, $\\beta_{F}$ is low at low currents, leading to a high breakdown voltage from (1.81). However, as avalanche breakdown begins, $I_{C}$ increases, raising $\\beta_{F}$. This decreases the breakdown voltage, causing the characteristic to bend back as shown in Fig. 1.12, with a negative slope. At higher $I_{C}$, $\\beta_{F}$ stabilizes, and the breakdown curve with $I_{B}=0$ becomes perpendicular to the $V_{C E}$ axis. The $V_{C E}$ in this region is typically defined as $B V_{C E O}$, the maximum voltage the device can withstand. The $\\beta_{F}$ value for calculating $B V_{C E O}$ in (1.81) is the peak $\\beta_{F}$. Note that high-$\\beta$ transistors will have lower $B V_{C E O}$ values.\n\nThe base-emitter junction of a transistor is also prone to avalanche breakdown. However, the emitter's high doping density ensures a high $\\beta_{F}$ (large $N_{D}$ in $(1.45)$ reduces $I_{B 2}$), making the base the more lightly doped side and determining the breakdown characteristic. This contrasts with the collector-base junction, where the collector is more lightly doped, resulting in typical $B V_{C B O}$ values of 20 to 80 V or more. The base is typically an order of magnitude more heavily doped than the collector, so the base-emitter breakdown voltage, typically 6 to 8 V, is much lower than $B V_{C B O}$, designated $B V_{E B O}$. The breakdown voltage for inverse-active operation in Fig. 1.12 is roughly equal to this value, as the base-emitter junction is reverse-biased in this mode.\n\nThe 6 to 8 V base-emitter breakdown voltage serves as a convenient reference in integrated-circuit design, often utilized in Zener diode form. However, care must be taken to protect all transistors in a circuit from reverse base-emitter voltages sufficient to cause breakdown, as base-emitter breakdown is damaging to the device. It can significantly degrade $\\beta_{F}$, depending on the duration and magnitude of the breakdown current. If the device is used solely as a Zener diode, this is insignificant, but for an amplifying transistor, $\\beta_{F}$ degradation can be serious.\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nGiven a transistor with a collector doping density of $2 \\times 10^{15} \\mathrm{atoms} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$, much lower than the base doping, calculate $B V_{C E O}$ for $\\beta=100$ and $n=4$.

As detailed in the next section, $\\beta_{F}$ is low at low currents, so from (1.81), the breakdown voltage is high. However, as avalanche breakdown begins, $I_{C}$ increases, raising $\\beta_{F}$. This causes a decrease in the breakdown voltage, resulting in the characteristic bending back as shown in Fig. 1.12 with a negative slope.

    "text": "In Section 1.2.2, the avalanche breakdown mechanism in a pn junction was detailed. Similar phenomena occur at the base-emitter and base-collector junctions of a transistor, restricting the maximum applicable voltages.\n\nConsider initially a transistor in the common-base configuration depicted in Fig. 1.14a, with a constant emitter current. The typical $I_{C}-V_{C B}$ characteristics for an npn transistor in this setup are illustrated in Fig. 1.14b. For $I_{E}=0$, the collector-base junction breaks down at voltage $B V_{C B O}$, indicating breakdown with the emitter open. For non-zero $I_{E}$ values, avalanche multiplication effects are evident for $V_{C B}$ below $B V_{C B O}$. In the example, the effective common-base current gain $\\alpha_{F}=I_{C} / I_{E}$ exceeds unity for $V_{C B}$ above approximately 60 V. Operation in this region (but below $B V_{C B O}$) is safe if device power dissipation remains moderate. The principles from Section 1.2.2 apply, and ignoring leakage currents, the collector current in Fig. 1.14a can be calculated as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C}=-\\alpha_{F} I_{E} M \\tag{1.74}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $M$ is defined by (1.26), thus\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C}=-\\alpha_{F} I_{E} \\frac{1}{1-\\left(\\frac{V_{C B}}{B V_{C B O}}\\right)^{n}} \\tag{1.75}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:\n[\nname: Q1, type: NPN, ports: {C: VCB, B: GND, E: e1}\nname: IE, type: CurrentSource, value: IE, ports: {Np: e1, Nn: GND}\nname: VCB, type: VoltageSource, value: VCB, ports: {Np: VCB, Nn: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:This circuit diagram illustrates a common-base configuration of an NPN transistor. The collector current IC is regulated by the emitter current IE and the voltage VCB.

This is a standard I-V characteristic curve used in transistor analysis.\n\n1. **Graph Type and Function:**\n- The graph is an I-V characteristic curve for a transistor in a common-base setup.\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n- The horizontal axis represents the collector-base voltage (V_CB) in volts.\n- The vertical axis represents the collector current (I_C) in milliamperes (mA).\n- Both axes use a linear scale.\n\n3. **Behavior and Trends:**\n- The curves depict I_C for different emitter currents (I_E = 0.5 mA, 1.0 mA, and 1.5 mA) as a function of V_CB.\n- At low V_CB values, I_C remains relatively stable, indicating a flat region.\n- As V_CB rises, I_C exhibits slight upward curvature, becoming more pronounced near the breakdown voltage (BV_CBO).\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The graph includes three distinct curves corresponding to various emitter currents (I_E = 0.5 mA, 1.0 mA, and 1.5 mA).\n- Each curve starts at a point on the vertical axis reflecting its respective I_E value.\n- The breakdown voltage (BV_CBO) is marked on the V_CB axis at around 100 volts, beyond which avalanche effects become significant.\n- The Early effect is minimal in this configuration at low V_CB values.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- The graph annotates I_E values on each curve.\n- A dashed vertical line indicates the breakdown voltage (BV_CBO) at 100 volts, marking the threshold for avalanche breakdown.\n- Curves are labeled with corresponding I_E values for clear reference.\n\nFigure 1.14 Common-base transistor connection. (a) Test circuit. (b) $I_{C}-V_{C B}$ characteristics.\n\nAnother notable aspect of the common-base characteristics in Fig. 1.14b is the minimal Early effect at low $V_{C B}$ values, where avalanche effects are insignificant. Base widening still occurs with increasing $V_{C B}$, but unlike the common-emitter configuration, it causes minimal change in $I_{C}$. This is due to the fixed $I_{E}$ instead of $V_{B E}$ or $I_{B}$, meaning the minority-carrier concentration slope at the emitter edge of the base remains constant, keeping $I_{C}$ largely unchanged.\n\nNow, examine the impact of avalanche breakdown on the common-emitter characteristics. Typical characteristics are shown in Fig. 1.12, with breakdown occurring at $B V_{C E O}$, sometimes termed the sustaining voltage $L V_{C E O}$. As in prior cases, operation near the breakdown voltage is harmful only if the current (and thus power dissipation) becomes excessive.\n\nThe avalanche breakdown effects on common-emitter characteristics are more intricate than in the common-base setup. This complexity arises because the avalanche process generates hole-electron pairs, with holes swept into the base, effectively contributing to the base current. Essentially, the avalanche current is amplified by the transistor. The base current is still given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{B}=-\\left(I_{C}+I_{E}\\right) \\tag{1.76}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation 1.74 remains valid, and substituting it in (1.76) yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C}=\\frac{M \\alpha_{F}}{1-M \\alpha_{F}} I_{B} \\tag{1.77}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nM=\\frac{1}{1-\\left(\\frac{V_{C B}}{B V_{C B O}}\\right)^{n}} \\tag{1.78}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation 1.77 indicates that $I_{C}$ approaches infinity as $M \\alpha_{F}$ approaches unity, meaning the effective $\\beta$ approaches infinity due to the additional base current from the avalanche process. The $B V_{C E O}$ value can be determined by solving\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nM \\alpha_{F}=1 \\tag{1.79}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAssuming $V_{C B} \\simeq V_{C E}$, this gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\alpha_{F}}{1-\\left(\\frac{B V_{C E O}}{B V_{C B O}}\\right)^{n}}=1 \\tag{1.80}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nresulting in\n\n$$\n\\frac{B V_{C E O}}{B V_{C B O}}=\\sqrt[n]{1-\\alpha_{F}}\n$$\n\nand thus\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nB V_{C E O} \\simeq \\frac{B V_{C B O}}{\\sqrt[n]{\\beta_{F}}} \\tag{1.81}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation 1.81 shows $B V_{C E O}$ is significantly lower than $B V_{C B O}$. However, the $B V_{C B O}$ value used in (1.81) must represent the plane junction breakdown of the collector-base junction, ignoring edge effects. This is because only the collector-base avalanche current under the emitter is amplified as previously calculated. As explained in Section 1.2.2, the measured $B V_{C B O}$ is usually determined by avalanche in the curved region of the collector, distant from the active base. Thus, for typical $\\beta_{F}=100$ and $n=4$, $B V_{C E O}$ is about half the measured $B V_{C B O}$, not 30 percent as (1.81) suggests.\n\nEquation 1.81 explains the breakdown characteristics in Fig. 1.12, considering $\\beta_{F}$'s dependence on collector current. As $V_{C E}$ increases from zero with $I_{B}=0$, the initial $I_{C}$ is roughly $\\beta_{F} I_{C O}$ from (1.73); since $I_{C O}$ is typically a few picoamperes, $I_{C}$ is very small. As detailed in the next section, $\\beta_{F}$ is low at low currents, so from (1.81), the breakdown voltage is high. However, as avalanche breakdown starts, $I_{C}$ increases, raising $\\beta_{F}$. This decreases the breakdown voltage, causing the characteristic to bend back as shown in Fig. 1.12, with a negative slope. At higher $I_{C}$, $\\beta_{F}$ stabilizes, and the $I_{B}=0$ breakdown curve becomes perpendicular to the $V_{C E}$ axis. The $V_{C E}$ in this region is defined as $B V_{C E O}$, representing the maximum sustainable voltage. The $\\beta_{F}$ value for calculating $B V_{C E O}$ in (1.81) is the peak $\\beta_{F}$. Note that high-$\\beta$ transistors will have lower $B V_{C E O}$ values.\n\nThe base-emitter junction also experiences avalanche breakdown. However, the emitter's high doping density ensures a high $\\beta_{F}$ (large $N_{D}$ in $(1.45)$ reduces $I_{B 2}$), making the base the lightly doped side and determining the breakdown characteristic. This contrasts with the collector-base junction, where the collector is lightly doped, resulting in typical $B V_{C B O}$ values of 20 to 80 V or more. The base is about an order of magnitude more heavily doped than the collector, so the base-emitter breakdown voltage ($B V_{E B O}$) is much lower, typically 6 to 8 V. The inverse-active operation breakdown voltage in Fig. 1.12 is roughly equal to this value, as the base-emitter junction is reverse-biased in this mode.\n\nThe 6 to 8 V base-emitter breakdown voltage serves as a convenient reference in integrated-circuit design, often used as a Zener diode. However, care must be taken to protect other transistors in the circuit from reverse base-emitter voltages causing breakdown, as base-emitter breakdown is damaging, potentially causing significant $\\beta_{F}$ degradation depending on the duration and magnitude of the breakdown current. If used solely as a Zener diode, this is irrelevant, but for amplifying transistors, $\\beta_{F}$ degradation can be serious.\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nFor a transistor with a collector doping density of $2 \\times 10^{15} \\mathrm{atoms} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$, much lower than the base doping, calculate $B V_{C E O}$ for $\\beta=100$ and $n=4$.

    "text": "While most initial analyses of integrated circuits assume $\\beta_{F}$ to be constant, this parameter actually varies with the transistor's operating conditions. For instance, Section 1.3.2 demonstrated that increasing $V_{C E}$ raises $I_{C}$ with minimal impact on $I_{B}$, thereby increasing the transistor's effective $\\beta_{F}$. Section 1.3.4 showed that as $V_{C E}$ nears the breakdown voltage, $B V_{C E O}$, the collector current rises due to avalanche multiplication. Equation 1.77 indicates that the effective current gain approaches infinity as $V_{C E}$ approaches $B V_{C E O}$.\n\nBeyond these effects, $\\beta_{F}$ also changes with temperature and transistor collector current, as illustrated in Fig. 1.15. This figure presents typical $\\beta_{F}$ versus $I_{C}$ curves at three different temperatures for an npn integrated circuit transistor. It is clear that $\\beta_{F}$ rises with increasing temperature, with a typical temperature coefficient of $+7000 \\mathrm{ppm} /{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. This temperature dependence stems from the high doping density in the emitter, which boosts the emitter injection efficiency $\\gamma$ with temperature.\n\nThe $\\beta_{F}$ variation with collector current, evident in Fig. 1.15, can be segmented into three regions: Region I (low-current), where $\\beta_{F}$ decreases as $I_{C}$ decreases; Region II (midcurrent), where $\\beta_{F}$ remains roughly constant; and Region III (high-current), where $\\beta_{F}$ decreases as $I_{C}$ increases. Understanding this behavior requires plotting $I_{B}$ and $I_{C}$ on a $\\log$ scale.\n\n**Figure 1.15 Description:** This graph shows the relationship between forward current gain ($\\beta_{F}$) and collector current ($I_{C}$) for an npn integrated-circuit transistor with a 6 μm² emitter area. The x-axis (collector current) ranges from 0.1 μA to 10 mA on a logarithmic scale, while the y-axis (forward current gain) ranges from 0 to 400 on a linear scale. The graph is divided into three regions: Region I (low-current), Region II (midcurrent), and Region III (high-current). Curves for three temperatures (125°C, 25°C, -55°C) are plotted, showing higher $\\beta_{F}$ peaks at higher temperatures.\n\nAnalyzing $\\beta_{F}$ behavior with $I_{C}$ involves plotting $I_{B}$ and $I_{C}$ against $V_{B E}$ on a log scale, as shown in Fig. 1.16. This allows direct determination of $\\ln \\beta_{F}$ from the distance between the curves.\n\n**Figure 1.16 Description:** This semi-logarithmic graph plots base and collector currents of a bipolar transistor against the base-emitter voltage ($V_{B E}$). The vertical axis is $\\ln I$ (logarithmic), and the horizontal axis is $V_{B E}$ (linear). The graph includes two main curves: Collector Current ($I_C$) and Base Current ($I_B$), with the distance between them representing $\\ln \\beta_F$. The graph is divided into three regions, and annotations highlight $\\ln \\beta_{FL}$, $\\ln \\beta_{FM}$, and $\\ln \\beta_{FH}$.\n\nAt moderate currents (Region II), both $I_{C}$ and $I_{B}$ follow ideal behavior:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{C} & =I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}  \\tag{1.82}\\\\\nI_{B} & \\simeq \\frac{I_{S}}{\\beta_{F M}} \\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}} \\tag{1.83}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\beta_{F M}$ is the maximum $\\beta_{F}$ value (from 1.48). At low currents, $I_{C}$ adheres to (1.82), but $\\beta_{F}$ decreases due to an additional $I_{B}$ component from carrier recombination in the base-emitter depletion region. At high currents, the base current follows (1.83), and the additional component has minimal effect. The base current from recombination is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{B X} \\simeq I_{S X} \\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{m V_{T}} \\tag{1.84}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwith $m \\simeq 2$. At very low collector currents, where (1.84) dominates, the current gain is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\beta_{F L} \\simeq \\frac{I_{C}}{I_{B X}}=\\frac{I_{S}}{I_{S X}} \\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{m}\\right) \\tag{1.85}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSubstituting (1.82) into (1.85) yields:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\beta_{F L} \\simeq \\frac{I_{S}}{I_{S X}}\\left(\\frac{I_{C}}{I_{S}}\\right)^{[1-(1 / m)]} \\tag{1.86}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor $m \\simeq 2$, $\\beta_{F}$ is proportional to $\\sqrt{I_{C}}$ at very low currents. At high currents, $I_{B}$ follows (1.83), and the decrease in $\\beta_{F}$ in Region III is mainly due to $I_{C}$ dropping below (1.82) values. This drop is partly due to high-level injection, leading to:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C} \\simeq I_{S H} \\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{2 V_{T}} \\tag{1.87}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe current gain in this region is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\beta_{F H} \\simeq \\frac{I_{S H}}{I_{S}} \\beta_{F M} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{V_{B E}}{2 V_{T}}\\right) \\tag{1.88}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSubstituting (1.87) into (1.88) gives:\n\n$$\n\\beta_{F H} \\simeq \\frac{I_{S H}^{2}}{I_{S}} \\beta_{F M} \\frac{1}{I_{C}}\n$$\n\nThus, $\\beta_{F}$ decreases rapidly at high collector currents. Additionally, the Kirk effect, which occurs when minority-carrier concentration in the collector matches the donor-atom doping density, further reduces $\\beta_{F}$ at high currents by enlarging the base region."

These generate a quiescent collector current, $I_{C}$, and a quiescent base current, $I_{B}$, with the device operating in the forward-active region. A small-signal input voltage $v_{i}$ is introduced in series with $V_{B E}$, resulting in minor variations in base current $i_{b}$ and collector current $i_{c}$. The total base and collector currents are $I_{b}$ and $I_{c}$, respectively, hence $I_{b}=\\left(I_{B}+i_{b}\\right)$ and $I_{c}=\\left(I_{C}+i_{c}\\right)$. The carrier concentrations in the transistor base, corresponding to the scenario in Fig. 1.17a, are illustrated in Fig. 1.17b. With only bias voltages applied, the carrier concentrations are shown by the solid lines. The application of the small-signal voltage $v_{i}$ causes an increase in $n_{p}(0)$ at the emitter edge of the base, resulting in the concentrations indicated by the dotted lines. These illustrations can be used to derive the various components of the small-signal equivalent circuit of the bipolar transistor."

However, due to technological constraints in transistor fabrication, a number of parasitic elements must be included in the equivalent circuit for most integrated-circuit transistors. A cross-section of a typical $n p n$ transistor in a junction-isolated process is depicted in Fig. 1.19, and the fabrication process for such devices is explained in Chapter 2.\n\nAs discussed in Section 1.2, every pn junction exhibits a voltage-dependent capacitance associated with the depletion region. In the cross-section shown in Fig. 1.19, three depletion-region capacitances can be identified. The base-emitter junction has a depletion-region capacitance $C_{j e}$, while the base-collector and collector-substrate junctions have capacitances $C_{\\mu}$ and $C_{c s}$, respectively. The base-emitter junction closely resembles an abrupt junction due to the steep rise in doping density caused by the heavy doping in the emitter. Consequently, the variation of $C_{j e}$ with bias voltage is well approximated by (1.21). The collector-base junction behaves like a graded junction for small bias voltages since the doping density is a function of distance near the junction. However, for larger reverse-bias values (more than about a volt), the junction depletion region spreads into the collector, which is uniformly doped, and thus for devices with thick collectors, the junction tends to behave like an abrupt junction with uniform doping. Many modern high-speed processes, however, have very thin collector regions (of the order of one micron), and the collector depletion region can extend all the way to the buried layer for quite small reverse-bias voltages. When this occurs, both the depletion region and the associated capacitance vary quite slowly with bias voltage. The collector-base capacitance $C_{\\mu}$ thus tends to follow (1.22) for very small bias voltages and (1.21) for large bias voltages in thick-collector devices.

    "text": "The fundamental components of a bipolar transistor's small-signal equivalent circuit, which have been discussed so far, are considered elementary because they directly stem from the core functions of the device. However, the limitations inherent in the manufacturing process of transistors introduce additional parasitic elements that must be incorporated into the equivalent circuit for the majority of integrated-circuit transistors. Figure 1.19 displays a cross-section of a standard n-p-n transistor produced using a junction-isolation process, and the fabrication methodology for these devices is detailed in Chapter 2.\n\nAs outlined in Section 1.2, every p-n junction exhibits a voltage-dependent capacitance linked to the depletion region. In the cross-section depicted in Fig. 1.19, there are three depletion-region capacitances that can be discerned. The base-emitter junction is characterized by a depletion-region capacitance labeled $C_{j e}$, whereas the base-collector and collector-substrate junctions possess capacitances $C_{\\mu}$ and $C_{c s}$, respectively. The base-emitter junction closely resembles an abrupt junction due to the sharp increase in doping density resulting from the heavy doping within the emitter. Consequently, the variation of $C_{j e}$ with bias voltage is accurately represented by equation (1.21). The collector-base junction acts like a graded junction under small bias voltages, as the doping density is dependent on the distance near the junction. However, for higher reverse-bias voltages (exceeding approximately one volt), the junction's depletion region extends into the collector, which is uniformly doped, leading to a behavior akin to an abrupt junction with uniform doping in devices possessing thick collectors. Nevertheless, many contemporary high-speed processes employ exceedingly thin collector regions (on the order of one micron), allowing the collector depletion region to reach the buried layer for relatively small reverse-bias voltages. When this occurs, both the depletion region and its associated capacitance exhibit a gradual change with bias voltage. Thus, the collector-base capacitance $C_{\\mu}$ generally follows equation (1.22) for very small bias voltages and equation (1.21) for large bias voltages in devices with thick collectors. In practice, measurements indicate that the variation of $C_{\\mu}$ with bias voltage for most devices can be approximated by equation (1.117a).\n\nThe third parasitic capacitance in a monolithic n-p-n transistor is the collector-substrate capacitance $C_{c s}$, which for large reverse bias voltages varies according to the abrupt junction equation (1.21) for junction-isolated devices. However, in the case of oxide-isolated devices, the deep p diffusions used for device isolation are substituted with oxide. Consequently, the sidewall component of $C_{c s}$ consists of a fixed oxide capacitance. Equation 1.117a can then be employed to model $C_{c s}$, with an exponent n less than 0.5 providing the best approximation. Generally, equation (1.117a) will be utilized to model all three parasitic capacitances, with subscripts e, c, and s on n and $\\psi_{0}$ denoting emitter-base, collector-base, and collector-substrate capacitances, respectively. Typical zero-bias values for these parasitic capacitances in a minimum-size n-p-n transistor within a modern oxide-isolated process are approximately $C_{j e 0} \\simeq 10 \\mathrm{fF}$, $C_{\\mu 0} \\simeq 10 \\mathrm{fF}$, and $C_{c s 0} \\simeq 20 \\mathrm{fF}$. Values for other devices are summarized in Chapter 2.\n\nAs explained in Chapter 2, lateral p-n-p transistors exhibit a parasitic capacitance $C_{b s}$ from base to substrate in lieu of $C_{c s}$. It is important to note that the substrate is always connected to the most negative voltage supply in the circuit to ensure that all isolation regions are separated by reverse-biased junctions. Hence, the substrate acts as an ac ground, and all parasitic capacitance to the substrate is connected to ground in the equivalent circuit.\n\nThe last elements to be incorporated into the transistor's small-signal model are resistive parasitics. These arise from the finite resistance of the silicon between the top contacts on the transistor and the active base region beneath the emitter. As depicted in Fig. 1.19, there are notable resistances $r_{b}$ and $r_{c}$ in series with the base and collector contacts, respectively. Additionally, there is a resistance $r_{e x}$ of several ohms in series with the emitter lead, which becomes significant at high bias currents. (It should be noted that the collector resistance $r_{c}$ is actually composed of three parts labeled $r_{c 1}, r_{c 2}$, and $r_{c 3}$.) Typical values for these parameters are $r_{b}=50$ to $500 \\Omega$, $r_{e x}=1$ to $3 \\Omega$, and $r_{c}=20$ to $500 \\Omega$. The value of $r_{b}$ varies considerably with collector current due to current crowding, a phenomenon that occurs at high collector currents where the dc base current induces a lateral voltage drop in the base, preferentially forward-biasing the base-emitter junction around the emitter's edges. Consequently, the transistor's action tends to occur along the emitter perimeter rather than beneath the emitter itself, thereby reducing the distance from the base contact to the active base region. As a result, the value of $r_{b}$ decreases, and in a typical n-p-n transistor, $r_{b}$ may decrease by 50 percent as $I_{C}$ increases from 0.1 mA to 10 mA.\n\nThe values of these parasitic resistances can be diminished through modifications in the device structure. For instance, a transistor with a large area and multiple base and emitter stripes will exhibit a lower value of $r_{b}$. The inclusion of a low-resistance buried n+ layer beneath the collector can reduce the value of $r_{c}$.\n\nIncorporating the resistive and capacitive parasitics into the basic small-signal circuit depicted in Fig. 1.18 yields the complete small-signal equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 1.20. The internal base node is designated as $B^{\\prime}$ to differentiate it from the external base contact $B$. The capacitance $C_{\\pi}$ encompasses the base-charging capacitance $C_{b}$ and the emitter-base depletion layer capacitance $C_{j e}$.\n\nNote that the representation of parasitics in Fig. 1.20 is an approximation, as lumped elements have been used. In reality, as suggested by Fig. 1.19, $C_{\\mu}$ is distributed across $r_{b}$ and $C_{c s}$ is distributed across $r_{c}$. This lumped representation is generally sufficient for most applications but can lead to inaccuracies at very high frequencies. It should also be noted that while the parasitic resistances depicted in Fig. 1.20 can be highly significant at high bias currents or for high-frequency operation, they are commonly omitted from the equivalent circuit for low-frequency calculations, particularly for collector bias currents below 1 mA.\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nDevelop the complete small-signal equivalent circuit for a bipolar transistor at $I_{C}=1 \\mathrm{~mA}$, $V_{C B}=3 \\mathrm{~V}$, and $V_{C S}=5 \\mathrm{~V}$.

Equation 1.117a can model $C_{c s}$ with an exponent $n$ less than 0.5 for better approximation. Generally, (1.117a) is used to model all three parasitic capacitances, with subscripts to denote the specific junctions. Typical zero-bias values for these capacitances in a modern oxide-isolated process are around $10 \\mathrm{fF}$ for $C_{j e 0}$ and $C_{\\mu 0}$, and $20 \\mathrm{fF}$ for $C_{c s 0}$. Details for other devices are provided in Chapter 2.\n\nLateral p-n-p transistors feature a parasitic capacitance $C_{b s}$ from base to substrate instead of $C_{c s}$. The substrate, always connected to the most negative voltage supply, acts as an ac ground, grounding all parasitic capacitance to the substrate in the equivalent circuit.\n\nResistive parasitics are also integral to the transistor's small-signal model, stemming from the finite resistance of the silicon between the transistor's top contacts and the active base region beneath the emitter. Fig. 1.19 shows significant resistances $r_{b}$ and $r_{c}$ in series with the base and collector contacts, respectively, and $r_{e x}$ in series with the emitter lead, which becomes significant at high bias currents. These resistances can be reduced by altering the device structure, such as using large-area transistors with multiple stripes. The complete small-signal equivalent circuit, incorporating these resistive and capacitive parasitics, is shown in Fig. 1.20, where the internal base node is labeled $B^{\\prime}$ to differentiate it from the external base contact $B$.

    "text": "The components of the bipolar transistor's small-signal model, discussed so far, are fundamental as they derive from the core functionalities of the device. Nonetheless, due to manufacturing constraints, additional parasitic elements are necessary to complete the model for integrated-circuit transistors. The typical $n p n$ transistor structure, as depicted in Fig. 1.19, fabricated through a junction-isolation process, is described in Chapter 2.\n\nAs previously mentioned in Section 1.2, each pn junction is accompanied by a capacitance that depends on the voltage across the depletion region. The cross-section in Fig. 1.19 reveals three such capacitances. The base-emitter junction exhibits a capacitance $C_{j e}$, while the base-collector and collector-substrate junctions show capacitances $C_{\\mu}$ and $C_{c s}$, respectively. The base-emitter junction is almost an abrupt junction due to the high doping density in the emitter, which leads to a capacitance that varies with bias voltage as indicated by equation (1.21). The base-collector junction acts as a graded junction for small bias voltages due to the doping density gradient near the junction. However, for larger reverse biases (over approximately one volt), the depletion region extends into the uniformly doped collector, causing the junction to behave like an abrupt junction in thick-collector devices. In modern high-speed transistors with thin collectors (about one micron), the collector depletion region can reach the buried layer at very small reverse biases, resulting in capacitance and depletion region changes that are gradual with bias voltage. Consequently, $C_{\\mu}$ generally follows (1.22) for small bias voltages and (1.21) for large bias voltages in thick-collector devices. Empirical data suggests that the variation of $C_{\\mu}$ with bias voltage can be modeled by equation (1.117a), where $V$ is the forward bias and $n$ is an exponent between 0.2 and 0.5.\n\nThe third parasitic capacitance in a monolithic $n p n$ transistor is the collector-substrate capacitance $C_{c s}$, which, for large reverse biases, follows the abrupt junction equation (1.21) for junction-isolated devices. In oxide-isolated devices, the deep $p$ diffusions are replaced by oxide, leading to a fixed oxide capacitance for the sidewall component of $C_{c s}$. Equation 1.117a can be applied to model $C_{c s}$, with an exponent $n$ less than 0.5 providing the best approximation. Generally, (1.117a) is used to model all three parasitic capacitances, with subscripts $e$, $c$, and $s$ on $n$ and $\\psi_{0}$ distinguishing between emitter-base, collector-base, and collector-substrate capacitances, respectively. Typical zero-bias values for these capacitances in a modern oxide-isolated process are $C_{j e 0} \\simeq 10 \\mathrm{fF}$, $C_{\\mu 0} \\simeq 10 \\mathrm{fF}$, and $C_{c s 0} \\simeq 20 \\mathrm{fF}$, with further values detailed in Chapter 2.\n\nLateral $p n p$ transistors feature a parasitic capacitance $C_{b s}$ from base to substrate instead of $C_{c s}$. The substrate, always connected to the most negative voltage supply, acts as an ac ground, with all parasitic capacitance to the substrate grounded in the equivalent circuit.\n\nThe small-signal model is rounded out with resistive parasitics, stemming from the finite resistance of the silicon between the transistor's top contacts and the active base region beneath the emitter. Fig. 1.19 identifies significant resistances $r_{b}$ and $r_{c}$ in series with the base and collector contacts, respectively, as well as $r_{e x}$ in series with the emitter lead, which is notable at high bias currents. Collector resistance $r_{c}$ is actually composed of three parts: $r_{c 1}$, $r_{c 2}$, and $r_{c 3}$. Typical values for these parameters are $r_{b}=50$ to $500 \\Omega$, $r_{e x}=1$ to $3 \\Omega$, and $r_{c}=20$ to $500 \\Omega$. $r_{b}$ decreases significantly with increasing collector current due to current crowding, which forward biases the base-emitter junction preferentially around the emitter edges, reducing the distance from the base contact to the active base region.\n\nThese parasitic resistances can be minimized through structural modifications, such as using a large-area transistor with multiple base and emitter stripes to decrease $r_{b}$, or incorporating a low-resistance buried $n^{+}$ layer beneath the collector to reduce $r_{c}$.\n\nCombining these resistive and capacitive parasitics with the basic small-signal circuit (Fig. 1.18) yields the complete small-signal equivalent circuit (Fig. 1.20). The internal base node is labeled $B^{\\prime}$ to differentiate it from the external base contact $B$. The capacitance $C_{\\pi}$ encompasses the base-charging capacitance $C_{b}$ and the emitter-base depletion layer capacitance $C_{j e}$, as per equation (1.118).\n\nIt is important to note that the representation of parasitics in Fig. 1.20 is an approximation, as it uses lumped elements. In reality, $C_{\\mu}$ is distributed across $r_{b}$ and $C_{c s}$ is distributed across $r_{c}$. This approximation suffices for most applications but can lead to inaccuracies at very high frequencies. Parasitic resistances are often omitted from low-frequency calculations, especially for collector bias currents below 1 mA.\n\nAn example is provided to derive the complete small-signal equivalent circuit for a bipolar transistor at $I_{C}=1 \\mathrm{~mA}$, $V_{C B}=3 \\mathrm{~V}$, and $V_{C S}=5 \\mathrm{~V}$, using provided device parameters. The values of parasitic capacitances and resistances are calculated and the final equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 1.21."
