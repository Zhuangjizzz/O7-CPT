Consequently, the circuit in this mode does not perform a linear multiplication of two waveforms, but instead causes the output voltage of the circuit produced by the small-signal input to be alternately multiplied by +1 and -1.\n\nThe provided graphs illustrate the interaction between the small-signal input, the large-signal modulating input, and the resulting output waveform in a phase detection process. The small-signal input is a sinusoidal waveform, while the large-signal modulating input is a square wave. The output waveform reflects the modulation of the small-signal input by the large-signal square wave, resulting in an alternating pattern of positive and negative segments.\n\nThe Fourier series of the two inputs can be used to develop the spectrum of the output. For the low-frequency modulating sinusoidal input, the equation is given by $V_{m}(t)=V_{m} \\cos \\omega_{m} t$. For the high-frequency square wave input, which is assumed to have an amplitude of $\\pm 1$, the equation is given by $V_{c}(t)=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_{n} \\cos n \\omega_{c} t$, where $A_{n}=\\frac{\\sin \\frac{n \\pi}{2}}{\\frac{n \\pi}{4}}$. Thus, the output signal is expressed as $V_{o}(t)=K\\left[V_{c}(t) V_{m}(t)\\right]=K \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_{n} V_{m} \\cos \\omega_{n} t \\cos n \\omega_{c} t$. This equation can be further simplified to $V_{o}(t)=K \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{A_{n} V_{m}}{2}\\left[\\cos \\left(n \\omega_{c}+\\omega_{m}\\right) t+\\cos \\left(n \\omega_{c}-\\omega_{m}\\right) t\\right]$, where $K$ represents the gain of the multiplier from the small-signal input to the output.\n\nThe spectrum of the output signal exhibits components located at frequencies $\\omega_{m}$ above and below each of the harmonics of $\\omega_{c}$, but no component at the carrier frequency $\\omega_{c}$ or its harmonics. This is a valuable property of balanced modulators. The signal is typically filtered after the modulation process to retain only the components near $\\omega_{c}$.\n\nIf a dc component is added to the modulating input, the output will include a signal component at the carrier frequency and its harmonics. If the modulating signal is expressed as $V_{m}(t)=V_{m}\\left(1+M \\cos \\omega_{m} t\\right)$, where $M$ is the modulation index, the output is given by $V_{o}(t)=K \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_{n} V_{m}\\left[\\cos \\left(n \\omega_{c} t\\right)+\\frac{M}{2} \\cos \\left(n \\omega_{c}+\\omega_{m}\\right) t+\\frac{M}{2} \\cos \\left(n \\omega_{c}-\\omega_{m}\\right) t\\right]$. This dc component can be intentionally introduced to provide conventional amplitude modulation or can be the result of offset voltages in the devices within the modulator, leading to undesired carrier feedthrough in suppressed-carrier modulators.\n\nThe balanced modulator effectively performs frequency translation. Information contained in the modulating signal $V_{m}(t)$, originally concentrated at the modulating frequency $\\omega_{m}$, is translated by the modulator so that it is now contained in spectral components located near the harmonics of the high-frequency signal $V_{c}(t)$, commonly referred to as the carrier. Balanced modulators are also useful for demodulation, which involves extracting information from the frequency band near the carrier and retranslating it back down to low frequencies.\n\nIn frequency translation, signals at two different frequencies are applied to the two inputs, and the sum or the difference frequency component is extracted from the output. If unmodulated signals of identical frequency $\\omega_{o}$ are applied to the two inputs, the circuit behaves as a phase detector and produces an output whose dc component is proportional to the phase difference between the two inputs. For instance, consider the two input waveforms in Fig. 10.11, which are applied to the Gilbert multiplier shown in the same figure. Assuming both inputs are large in magnitude so that all the transistors in the circuit behave as switches, the resulting output waveform is depicted in Fig. 10.11c and consists of a dc component and a component at twice the incoming frequency. The dc component of this waveform is given by $V_{\\text {average }}=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi} \\int_{0}^{2 \\pi} V_{o}(t) d\\left(\\omega_{0} t\\right)$, where areas $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ are as indicated in Fig. 10.11c. Thus, the average output voltage is expressed as $V_{\\text {average }}=-\\left[I_{E E} R_{C} \\frac{(\\pi-\\phi)}{\\pi}-\\frac{I_{E E} R_{C} \\phi}{\\pi}\\right]$, where $\\phi$ represents the phase difference between the input signals.\n\nThis phase relationship is illustrated in Fig. 10.12. This phase demodulation technique is widely used in phase-locked loops. The assumption made above is that the input waveforms were large in amplitude and were square waves. If the input signal amplitude is large, the actual waveform shape is insignificant since the multiplier simply switches from one state to the other at the zero crossings of the waveform. For the case in which the amplitude of one or both of the input signals is comparable to or smaller than $V_{T}$, the circuit still functions as a phase detector. However, the output voltage then depends both on the phase difference and on the amplitude of the two input waveforms. The operation of the circuit in this mode is explored further in Section 10.3.3."

The high-speed operation is due to the absence of transistor saturation. Figure 10.9 illustrates the resulting waveforms when a sinusoid is input as the small-signal and a square wave as the large-signal. Notably, the output amplitude is independent of the square wave amplitude, given it's sufficient to fully activate or deactivate the multiplier devices. Hence, the circuit does not perform linear multiplication but alternates the output voltage by +1 and -1.\n\nThe graph in Figure 10.9 depicts three waveforms: the small-signal input, a sinusoidal waveform; the large-signal modulating input, a square wave; and the output waveform, which reflects the modulation of the small-signal by the large-signal, resulting in alternating positive and negative segments.\n\nIn balanced modulators, the output spectrum is derived from the Fourier series of the inputs. For a low-frequency sinusoidal modulating input and a high-frequency square wave input, the output signal is a series of cosines representing the product of the inputs. The spectrum lacks components at the carrier frequency, which is a beneficial property for balanced modulators.

The system comprises a phase comparator, a loop filter, an amplifier, and a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). The VCO is an oscillator whose frequency is directly proportional to an applied external voltage. When the loop locks onto an incoming periodic signal, the VCO's frequency matches that of the incoming signal precisely. The phase detector generates a dc or low-frequency signal corresponding to the phase difference between the incoming signal and the VCO output. This phase-sensitive signal is then routed through the loop filter and amplifier, ultimately being applied to the VCO's control input. For instance, if the incoming signal's frequency shifts slightly, the phase difference between the VCO signal and the incoming signal will gradually increase. This alters the VCO's control voltage to realign its frequency with the incoming signal. Thus, the loop can sustain lock even when the input signal frequency changes, with the VCO input voltage reflecting the incoming signal's frequency. This functionality makes PLLs particularly valuable for FM signal demodulation, where the input signal's frequency varies over time, encoding the desired information. The range of input frequencies over which the loop can maintain lock is termed the lock range.\n\nA critical aspect of PLL performance is the capture process, wherein the loop transitions from an unlocked, free-running state to a locked state on a signal. In the unlocked state, the VCO operates at a frequency corresponding to zero applied dc voltage at its control input, known as the center or free-running frequency. When a periodic signal with a frequency near the free-running frequency is introduced, the loop may or may not lock onto it, influenced by various factors. The capture process is inherently nonlinear, and we will describe the transient behavior qualitatively.\n\nInitially, assume the loop is open between the loop filter and the VCO control input, and a signal with a frequency close to, but not identical to, the free-running frequency is applied to the PLL input. The phase detector, typically of the type discussed previously, is assumed here to be a simple analog multiplier, multiplying the two sinusoids. Consequently, the detector's output contains sum and difference frequency components, with the sum component being high enough in frequency to be filtered out by the low-pass filter. The low-pass filter's output is a sinusoid with a frequency equal to the difference between the VCO's free-running frequency and the incoming signal frequency.\n\nNext, assume the loop is abruptly closed, applying the difference frequency sinusoid to the VCO input. This causes the VCO frequency to vary sinusoidally over time. If the incoming frequency is lower than the free-running frequency, the VCO frequency will alternately approach and diverge from the incoming signal frequency. The phase detector's output is a near-sinusoid with a frequency equal to the difference between the VCO and input frequencies. As the VCO frequency moves away from the incoming frequency, the sinusoid shifts to a higher frequency, and as it moves closer, the sinusoid shifts to a lower frequency. Examining the phase detector output reveals that the frequency of this sinusoidal difference waveform decreases when its amplitude is negative and increases when positive. This results in an asymmetrical waveform during capture, as depicted in Fig. 10.14, introducing a dc component in the phase detector output that shifts the average VCO frequency toward the incoming signal frequency, gradually reducing the difference frequency. Once locked, the difference frequency becomes zero, leaving only a dc voltage at the loop-filter output.\n\nThe capture range of the loop is the range of input frequencies around the center frequency onto which the loop can lock from an unlocked state. The pull-in time is the duration required for the loop to capture the signal. Both parameters depend on the loop's gain and the loop filter's bandwidth. The loop filter's purpose is to filter out difference components from interfering signals far from the center frequency and to provide memory for the loop if lock is momentarily lost due to a large transient interference. Reducing the loop filter bandwidth enhances out-of-band signal rejection but decreases the capture range, extends the pull-in time, and degrades the loop phase margin."

    "text": "When the phase-locked loop (PLL) is in a locked state, there exists a linear correlation between the output voltage of the phase detector and the phase disparity between the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) and the incoming signal. This linear relationship enables the analysis of the loop using conventional linear feedback mechanisms. A block diagram depiction of the system in this locked state can be seen in Fig. 10.15. The phase comparator's gain is denoted as \\( K_{D} \\mathrm{~V} / \\mathrm{rad} \\), the loop-filter transfer function is represented by \\( F(s) \\), and any amplification within the forward loop is indicated by \\( A \\). The VCO's gain is expressed as \\( K_{o} \\mathrm{rad} / \\mathrm{s} \\) per volt.\n\nA constant input voltage applied to the VCO's control input ensures that the VCO's output frequency remains stable. The phase comparator, however, is highly sensitive to any discrepancy between the phase of the VCO's output and that of the incoming signal. The phase of the VCO's output is essentially the time integral of the VCO's output frequency, as given by the equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\omega_{\\mathrm{osc}}(t)=\\frac{d \\phi_{\\mathrm{osc}}(t)}{d t} \\tag{10.44}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\phi_{\\mathrm{osc}}(t)=\\left.\\phi_{\\mathrm{osc}}\\right|_{t=0}+\\int_{0}^{t} \\omega_{\\mathrm{osc}}(t) d t \\tag{10.45}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe block diagram in Fig. 10.15 illustrates a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) system designed to synchronize the phase of the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) output with that of an incoming signal. Here is a detailed breakdown of the system:\n\n1. **Main Components:**\n   - **Phase Detector:** This component compares the phase of the incoming signal, \\( \\phi_i \\), with the phase of the VCO output, \\( \\phi_{osc} \\). It outputs a phase error signal, \\( \\phi_\\epsilon \\), which indicates the difference between these two phases.\n   - **Gain Block (\\( K_D \\) V/rad):** This block scales the phase error signal \\( \\phi_\\epsilon \\) by a gain factor \\( K_D \\), converting it into a voltage.\n   - **Filter (\\( F(s) \\)):** The filtered error signal aids in stabilizing the loop and determines the dynamic characteristics of the PLL.\n   - **Amplifier (\\( A \\)):** This block further amplifies the filtered signal to drive the VCO input.\n   - **Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO):** The VCO generates an output frequency \\( \\omega_{osc} \\) that is controlled by the input voltage \\( V_o \\). The relationship is defined as \\( \\omega_{osc} = \\omega_0 + K_O V_o \\), where \\( \\omega_0 \\) is the free-running frequency and \\( K_O \\) is the VCO gain.\n   - **Integrator (\\( 1/s \\)):** This block represents the integration of the VCO output frequency to produce the phase \\( \\phi_{osc} \\).\n\n2. **Flow of Information or Control:**\n   - The input phase \\( \\phi_i \\) and the feedback phase \\( \\phi_{osc} \\) are compared in the phase detector, generating a phase error \\( \\phi_\\epsilon \\).\n   - The error signal \\( \\phi_\\epsilon \\) is processed through the gain block \\( K_D \\), filter \\( F(s) \\), and amplifier \\( A \\) to produce the control voltage \\( V_o \\) for the VCO.\n   - The VCO adjusts its output frequency \\( \\omega_{osc} \\) based on \\( V_o \\), and this frequency is integrated to update the phase \\( \\phi_{osc} \\).\n   - The updated phase \\( \\phi_{osc} \\) is fed back to the phase detector, completing the control loop.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n   - The gain of the phase detector is labeled as \\( K_D \\) V/rad.\n   - The VCO gain is labeled as \\( K_O \\) rad/s/V.\n   - The integrator is represented by \\( 1/s \\).\n   - The output of the amplifier is denoted as \\( V_o \\).\n\n4. **Overall System Function:**\n   - The primary function of this PLL system is to lock the phase of the VCO output to the phase of the incoming signal \\( \\phi_i \\). This is achieved through the feedback loop, which continuously adjusts the VCO frequency to minimize the phase error \\( \\phi_\\epsilon \\). The integration in the loop ensures that the VCO's phase tracks the incoming signal's phase over time, maintaining synchronization.\n\nThus, an integration inherently takes place within the phase-locked loop. This integration is represented by the \\( 1 / s \\) block in Fig. 10.15.\n\nFor practical reasons, the VCO is designed such that when the VCO input voltage (i.e., \\( V_{o} \\)) is zero, the VCO frequency is not zero. The relation between the VCO output frequency \\( \\omega_{\\text {osc }} \\) and \\( V_{o} \\) is actually\n\n$$\n\\omega_{\\mathrm{osc}}=\\omega_{o}+K_{O} V_{o}\n$$\n\nwhere \\( \\omega_{o} \\) is the free-running frequency that results when \\( V_{o}=0 \\).\n\nThe system can be seen from Fig. 10.15 to be a classical linear feedback control system. The closed-loop transfer function is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{V_{o}}{\\phi_{i}} & =\\frac{K_{D} F(s) A}{1+K_{D} F(s) A \\frac{K_{o}}{s}}  \\tag{10.46}\\\\\n& =\\frac{s K_{D} F(s)

The loop lock range is the range of input frequencies about the center frequency for which the loop maintains lock. In most cases, it is limited by the fact that the phase comparator has a limited phase comparison range; once the phase difference between the input signal and the VCO output reaches some critical value, the phase comparator ceases to behave linearly. The transfer characteristic of a typical analog phase comparator is shown in Fig. 10.12. It is clear from this figure that in order to maintain lock, the phase difference between the VCO output and the incoming signal must be kept between zero and \\( \\pi \\). If the phase difference is equal to either zero or \\( \\pi \\), then the magnitude of the dc voltage at the output of the phase comparator is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV"

The system's main components are:\n\n1. **Phase Detector:** This component contrasts the phase of the incoming signal, \\( \\phi_i \\), with the phase of the VCO's output, \\( \\phi_{osc} \\), generating a phase error signal, \\( \\phi_\\epsilon \\), which signifies the discrepancy between these two phases.\n2. **Gain Block (\\( K_D \\) V/rad):** This block amplifies the phase error signal \\( \\phi_\\epsilon \\) by a factor \\( K_D \\), converting it into a voltage.\n3. **Filter (\\( F(s) \\)):** The filtered error signal aids in stabilizing the loop and defines the dynamic behavior of the PLL.\n4. **Amplifier (\\( A \\)):** This block further amplifies the filtered signal to drive the VCO input.\n5. **Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO):** The VCO generates an output frequency \\( \\omega_{osc} \\) that is modulated by the input voltage \\( V_o \\).

The error signal \\( \\phi_\\epsilon \\) is then processed through the gain block \\( K_D \\), filter \\( F(s) \\), and amplifier \\( A \\) to generate the control voltage \\( V_o \\) for the VCO.

The updated phase \\( \\phi_{osc} \\) is fed back to the phase detector, completing the control loop.\n\nThe PLL system's primary function is to lock the VCO's phase to the phase of the incoming signal \\( \\phi_i \\). This synchronization is achieved through the feedback loop, which continuously fine-tunes the VCO's frequency to minimize the phase error \\( \\phi_\\epsilon \\). The integration within the loop ensures that the VCO's phase tracks the incoming signal's phase over time, maintaining synchronization.\n\nFor practical considerations, the VCO is engineered such that when the VCO input voltage (i.e., \\( V_{o} \\)) is zero, the VCO frequency is not zero. The relationship between the VCO output frequency \\( \\omega_{\\text {osc }} \\) and \\( V_{o} \\) is expressed as:\n\n$$\n\\omega_{\\mathrm{osc}}=\\omega_{o}+K_{O} V_{o}\n$$\n\nwhere \\( \\omega_{o} \\) is the free-running frequency that results when \\( V_{o}=0 \\).

The input variable, in this case, is the frequency \\( \\omega_{i} \\) of the incoming signal. The calculated response, then, represents the system's response to frequency modulation on the incoming carrier as reflected in the loop voltage output.\n\nThe constant \\( K_{v} \\) is referred to as the loop bandwidth. If the loop is locked on a carrier signal, and the frequency of that carrier varies sinusoidally in time with a frequency \\( \\omega_{m} \\), then a sinusoid of frequency \\( \\omega_{m} \\) will be observed at the loop output.

This is achieved through the feedback loop, which continuously adjusts the VCO frequency to minimize the phase error \\( \\phi_\\epsilon \\). The integration in the loop ensures that the VCO's phase tracks the incoming signal's phase over time, maintaining synchronization.\n\nThe integration inherent in the phase-locked loop is represented by the \\( 1 / s \\) block in Fig. 10.15.\n\nFor practical reasons, the VCO is designed such that when the VCO input voltage (i.e., \\( V_{o} \\)) is zero, the VCO frequency is not zero. The relationship between the VCO output frequency \\( \\omega_{\\text {osc }} \\) and \\( V_{o} \\) is actually\n\n$$\n\\omega_{\\mathrm{osc}}=\\omega_{o}+K_{O} V_{o}\n$$\n\nwhere \\( \\omega_{o} \\) is the free-running frequency that results when \\( V_{o}=0 \\).\n\nThe system can be seen from Fig. 10.15 to be a classical linear feedback control system. The closed-loop transfer function is given by\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{o}}{\\phi_{i}} =\\frac{K_{D} F(s) A}{1+K_{D} F(s) A \\frac{K_{o}}{s}}  \\tag{10.46}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{o}}{\\phi_{i}} =\\frac{s K_{D} F(s) A}{s+K_{D} K_{O} A F(s)} \\tag{10.47}\n$$\n\nUsually, we are interested in the response of this loop to frequency variations at the input, so that the input variable is frequency rather than phase. Since\n\n$$\n\\omega_{i}=\\frac{d \\phi_{i}}{d t} \\tag{10.48}\n$$\n\nthen\n\n$$\n\\omega_{i}(s)=s \\phi_{i}(s) \\tag{10.49}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{o}}{\\omega_{i}}=\\frac{1}{s} \\frac{V_{o}}{\\phi_{i}}=\\frac{K_{D} F(s) A}{s+K_{D} K_{O} A F(s)} \\tag{10.50}\n$$\n\nWe first consider the case in which the loop filter is removed entirely, and \\( F(s) \\) is unity. This is called a first-order loop and we have\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{o}}{\\omega_{i}}=\\left(\\frac{K_{v}}{s+K_{v}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{K_{O}}\\right) \\tag{10.51}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nK_{v}=K_{O} K_{D} A \\tag{10.52}\n$$\n\nThus the loop inherently produces a first-order, low-pass transfer characteristic. Remember that we regard the input variable as the frequency \\( \\omega_{i} \\) of the incoming signal. The response calculated above, then, is really the response from the frequency modulation on the incoming carrier to the loop voltage output.\n\nThe constant above \\( (K_{v}) \\) is termed the loop bandwidth. If the loop is locked on a carrier signal, and the frequency of that carrier is made to vary sinusoidally in time with a frequency \\( \\omega_{m} \\), then a sinusoid of frequency \\( \\omega_{m} \\) will be observed at the loop output. When \\( \\omega_{m} \\) is increased above \\( K_{v} \\), the magnitude of the sinusoid at the output falls. The loop bandwidth \\( K_{v} \\), then, is the effective bandwidth for the modulating signal that is being demodulated by the PLL. In terms of the loop parameters, \\( K_{v} \\) is simply the product of the phase detector gain, VCO gain, and any other electrical gain in the loop. The root locus of this single pole as a function of loop gain \\( K_{v} \\) is shown in Fig. 10.16a. The frequency response is also shown in this figure. The response of the loop to variations in input frequency is illustrated in Fig. $10.16 b$ and by the following example.\n\nFor a PLL with a \\( K_{O} \\) of \\( 2 \\pi(1 \\mathrm{kHz} / \\mathrm{V}) \\), a \\( K_{v} \\) of \\( 500 \\mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\), and a free-running frequency of 500 Hz, we can calculate the output voltage for different input signal frequencies.\n\n$$\nV_{o}=\\frac{\\omega_{i}-\\omega_{o}}{K_{O}}\n$$\n\nwhere \\( \\omega_{o} \\) is the oscillator free-running frequency.\n\nAt 250 Hz,\n\n$$\nV_{o}=\\frac{2 \\pi(250 \\mathrm{~Hz})-2 \\pi(500 \\mathrm{~Hz})}{2 \\pi(1 \\mathrm{kHz} / \\mathrm{V})}=-0.25 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nAt 1 kHz,\n\n$$\nV_{o}=\\frac{2 \\pi(1 \\mathrm{kHz})-2 \\pi(500 \\mathrm{~Hz})}{2 \\pi(1 \\mathrm{kHz} / \\mathrm{V})}=+0.5 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nFor a frequency-modulated input signal,\n\n$$\n\\omega_{i}(t)=(2 \\pi) 500 \\mathrm{~Hz}\\left[1+0.1 \\sin \\left(2 \\pi \\times 10^{2}\\right) t\\right]\n$$\n\nthe output signal \\( V_{o}(t) \\) can be calculated using the transfer function.\n\nOperating the loop with no loop filter has several practical drawbacks. Since the phase detector is really a multiplier, it produces a sum frequency component at its output as well as the difference frequency component. This component at twice the carrier frequency will be fed directly to the output if there is no loop filter. Also, all the out-of-band interfering signals present at the input will appear, shifted in frequency, at the output. Thus, a loop filter is very desirable in applications where interfering signals are present.\n\nThe most common configuration for integrated circuit PLLs is the second-order loop. Here, loop filter \\( F(s) \\) is simply a single-pole, low-pass filter, usually realized with a single resistor and capacitor. Thus\n\n$$\nF(s)=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+\\frac{s}{\\omega_{1}}}\\right) \\tag{10.53}\n$$\n\nBy substituting into (10.50), the transfer function becomes\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{o}}{\\omega_{1}}(s)=\\frac{1}{K_{O}}\\left(\\frac{1}{1+\\frac{s}{K_{v}}+\\frac{s^{2}}{\\omega_{1} K_{v}}}\\right) \\tag{10.54}\n$$\n\nThe root locus for this feedback system as \\( K_{v} \\) varies is shown in Fig. 10.17, along with the corresponding frequency response. The roots of the transfer function are\n\n$$\ns=-\\frac{\\omega_{1}}{2}\\left(1 \\pm \\sqrt{1-\\frac{4 K_{v}}{\\omega_{1}}}\\right) \\tag{10.55}\n$$\n\nEquation 10.54 can be expressed as\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{o}}{\\omega_{i}}=\\frac{1}{K_{O}}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\frac{s^{2}}{\\omega_{n}^{2}}+\\frac{2 \\zeta}{\\omega_{n}} s+1}\\right) \\tag{10.56}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\omega_{n} =\\sqrt{K_{v} \\omega_{1}}  \\tag{10.57}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\zeta =\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega_{1}}{K_{v}}} \\tag{10.58}\n$$\n\nThe basic factor setting the loop bandwidth is \\( K_{v} \\) as in the first-order case. The magnitude \\( \\omega_{1} \\) of the additional pole is then made as low as possible without causing an unacceptable amount of peaking in the frequency response. This peaking is of concern both because it distorts the demodulated FM output and because it causes the loop to ring, or experience a poorly damped oscillatory response, when a transient disturbs the loop. A good compromise is using a maximally flat low-pass pole configuration in which the poles are placed on radials angled \\( 45^{\\circ} \\) from the negative real axis. For this response, the damping factor \\( \\zeta \\) should be equal to \\( 1 / \\sqrt{2} \\). Thus\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}=\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega_{1}}{K_{v}}} \\tag{10.59}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\omega_{1}=2 K_{v} \\tag{10.60}\n$$\n\nThe \\( -3-\\mathrm{dB} \\) frequency of the transfer function \\( \\left(V_{o} / \\omega_{i}\\right)(j \\omega) \\) is then\n\n$$\n\\omega_{-3 \\mathrm{~dB}}=\\omega_{n}=\\sqrt{K_{v} \\omega_{1}}=\\sqrt{2} K_{v} \\tag{10.61}\n$$\n\nA disadvantage of the second-order loop as discussed thus far is that the \\( -3-\\mathrm{dB} \\) bandwidth of the loop is basically dictated by loop gain \\( K_{v} \\) as shown by (10.61). As we will show, the loop gain also sets the lock range, so that with the simple filter used above these two parameters are constrained to be comparable. Situations do arise in phase-locked communications in which a wide lock range is desired for tracking large signal-frequency variations, yet a narrow loop bandwidth is desired for rejecting out-of-band signals. Using a very small \\( \\omega_{1} \\) would accomplish this were it not for the fact that this produces underdamped loop response. By adding a zero to the loop filter, the loop filter pole can be made small while still maintaining good loop dampening.\n\nThe effect of the addition of a zero on the loop response is best seen by examining the open-loop response of the circuit. Shown in Fig. $10.18 a$ is the open-loop response of the circuit with no loop filter. Because of the integration inherent in the loop, the response has a \\( -20-\\mathrm{dB} / \\) decade slope throughout the frequency range and crosses unity gain at \\( K_{v} \\). In Fig. $10.18 b$, a loop filter in which \\( \\omega_{1} \\) is much less than \\( K_{v} \\) has been added, and, as a result, the loop phase shift is very nearly \\( 180^{\\circ} \\) at the crossover frequency. The result is a sharp peak in the closed-loop frequency response at the crossover frequency. By adding a zero in the loop filter at \\( \\omega_{2} \\), as shown in Fig. 10.18c, the loop phase margin can be greatly improved. Note that for this case the loop bandwidth, which is equal to the crossover frequency, is much lower than \\( K_{v} \\). This ability to set loop bandwidth and \\( K_{\\nu} \\) independently is an advantage of this type of loop filter. An R-C circuit that provides the necessary pole and zero in the filter response is shown in Fig. 10.18d. The root locus for this loop filter and the resulting closed-loop response are also shown.\n\nLoop Lock Range. The loop lock range is the range of input frequencies about the center frequency for which the loop maintains lock. In most cases, it is limited by the fact that the phase comparator has a limited phase comparison range; once the phase difference between the input signal and the VCO output reaches some critical value, the phase comparator ceases to behave linearly. The transfer characteristic of a typical analog phase comparator is shown in Fig. 10.12. It is clear from this figure that in order to maintain lock, the phase difference between the VCO output and the incoming signal must be kept between zero and \\( \\pi \\). If the phase difference is equal to either zero or \\( \\pi \\), then the magnitude of the dc voltage at the output of the phase comparator is\n\n$$\nV_{o(\\max )}= \\pm K_{D}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) \\tag{10.62}\n$$\n\nThis dc voltage is amplified by the electrical gain \\( A \\), and the result is applied to the VCO input, producing a frequency shift away from the free-running center frequency of\n\n$$\n\\Delta \\omega_{\\mathrm{osc}}=K_{D} A K_{O}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)=\\left(\\frac{K_{v} \\pi}{2}\\right) \\tag{10.63}\n$$\n\nIf the input frequency is now shifted away from the free-running frequency, more voltage will have to be applied to the VCO in order for the VCO frequency to shift accordingly. However, the phase detector can produce no more dc output voltage to shift the VCO frequency further, so the loop will lose lock. The lock range \\( \\omega_{L} \\) is then given by\n\n$$\n\\omega_{L}=K_{v} \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\tag{10.64}\n$$\n\nThis is the frequency range on either side of the free-running frequency for which the loop will track input frequency variations. It is a parameter that depends only on the dc gain in the loop and is independent of the properties of the loop filter. Other types of phase detectors can give larger linear ranges of phase-comparator operation.\n\nThe capture range is the range of input frequencies for which the initially unlocked loop will lock on an input signal when initially in an unlocked condition and is always less than the lock range. When the input frequency is swept through a range around the center frequency, the output voltage as a function of input frequency displays a hysteresis effect, as shown in Fig. 10.19. As discussed earlier, the capture range is difficult to predict analytically. As a very rough rule of thumb, the approximate capture range can be estimated using the following procedure"

The integration within the loop ensures the VCO's phase tracks the incoming signal's phase over time.\n\nThis inherent integration in the phase-locked loop is symbolized by the \\( 1 / s \\) block in Fig. 10.15. For practical reasons, the VCO is designed such that its frequency is non-zero when the input voltage \\( V_o \\) is zero, with the relationship between the VCO's output frequency \\( \\omega_{osc} \\) and \\( V_o \\) given by \\( \\omega_{osc} = \\omega_{o} + K_{O} V_{o} \\), where \\( \\omega_{o} \\) is the free-running frequency at \\( V_o = 0 \\).\n\nThe system in Fig. 10.15 represents a classical linear feedback control system, and its closed-loop transfer function is provided by equations (10.46) and (10.47). The analysis often focuses on the loop's response to frequency variations at the input, treating frequency as the input variable rather than phase.\n\nIn the case of a first-order loop without a loop filter (i.e., \\( F(s) = 1 \\)), the loop exhibits a first-order, low-pass transfer characteristic, as shown in equations (10.51) and (10.52). The loop bandwidth \\( K_{v} \\) is a critical parameter, representing the effective bandwidth for the modulating signal that the PLL demodulates.\n\nThe root locus and frequency response plots in Figure 10.16a and b illustrate the loop's behavior, while Figure 10.16b provides a time-domain response example.\n\nFor second-order loops, a common configuration uses a single-pole, low-pass filter as the loop filter \\( F(s) \\), as in equation (10.53). The root locus and closed-loop frequency response for this configuration are shown in Figure 10.17. The addition of a zero to the loop filter, as in Figure 10.18c and d, allows for independent setting of loop bandwidth and \\( K_{v} \\), improving stability and control.\n\nThe loop lock range \\( \\omega_{L} \\) and capture range are essential parameters defined by the phase comparator's operational range and the loop's ability to acquire and maintain lock, as depicted in Figure 10.19 and explained by equations (10.62) through (10.68)."

    "text": "When the loop is in a locked state, there is a direct proportionality between the phase detector's output voltage and the phase discrepancy between the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) and the incoming signal. This linear relationship allows the loop to be analyzed using standard linear feedback control theory. A block diagram depicting the system in this locked state can be found in Fig. 10.15. The phase comparator's gain is expressed as \\( K_{D} \\frac{\\text{V}}{\\text{rad}} \\) per radian of phase difference, the loop filter's transfer function is denoted by \\( F(s) \\), and any amplification in the forward path is represented by \\( A \\). The VCO's gain is given by \\( K_{o} \\frac{\\text{rad}}{\\text{s}} \\) per volt.\n\nWhen a steady input voltage is supplied to the VCO's control terminal, the VCO's output frequency remains constant. However, the phase comparator is highly responsive to the phase discrepancy between the VCO's output and the incoming signal. The phase of the VCO's output is actually the time integral of the VCO's output frequency, as indicated by the equations:\n\n$$\n\\omega_{\\mathrm{osc}}(t)=\\frac{d \\phi_{\\mathrm{osc}}(t)}{d t} \\tag{10.44}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\phi_{\\mathrm{osc}}(t)=\\left.\\phi_{\\mathrm{osc}}\\right|_{t=0}+\\int_{0}^{t} \\omega_{\\mathrm{osc}}(t) d t \\tag{10.45}\n$$\n\nThe block diagram in Fig. 10.15 illustrates a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) system, which is employed to synchronize the phase of the VCO's output with that of the incoming signal. The system's components and their interactions are as follows:\n\n1. **Main Components:**\n   - **Phase Detector:** This element compares the phases of the incoming signal, \\( \\phi_i \\), and the VCO's output, \\( \\phi_{osc} \\), generating a phase error signal, \\( \\phi_\\epsilon \\), that represents the phase difference.\n   - **Gain Block (\\( K_D \\) V/rad):** This block amplifies the phase error signal \\( \\phi_\\epsilon \\) by a factor of \\( K_D \\), converting it into a voltage.\n   - **Filter (\\( F(s) \\)):** The filter smooths the error signal, contributing to loop stability and defining the PLL's dynamic behavior.\n   - **Amplifier (\\( A \\)):** This block further amplifies the filtered signal to drive the VCO's control input.\n   - **Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO):** The VCO generates an output frequency \\( \\omega_{osc} \\) that is modulated by the input voltage \\( V_o \\). The relationship is defined as \\( \\omega_{osc} = \\omega_0 + K_O V_o \\), where \\( \\omega_0 \\) is the VCO's free-running frequency and \\( K_O \\) is the VCO's gain.\n   - **Integrator (\\( \\frac{1}{s} \\)):** This block represents the integration of the VCO's output frequency to produce the phase \\( \\phi_{osc} \\).\n\n2. **Flow of Information or Control:**\n   - The incoming phase \\( \\phi_i \\) and the feedback phase \\( \\phi_{osc} \\) are compared in the phase detector, generating a phase error \\( \\phi_\\epsilon \\).\n   - The error signal \\( \\phi_\\epsilon \\) passes through the gain block \\( K_D \\), filter \\( F(s) \\), and amplifier \\( A \\) to produce the control voltage \\( V_o \\) for the VCO.\n   - The VCO adjusts its output frequency \\( \\omega_{osc} \\) based on \\( V_o \\), and this frequency is integrated to update the phase \\( \\phi_{osc} \\).\n   - The updated phase \\( \\phi_{osc} \\) is fed back to the phase detector, completing the control loop.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n   - The phase comparator's gain is denoted as \\( K_D \\) V/rad.\n   - The VCO's gain is labeled as \\( K_O \\) rad/s/V.\n   - The integrator is represented by \\( \\frac{1}{s} \\).\n   - The amplifier's output is denoted as \\( V_o \\).\n\n4. **Overall System Function:**\n   - The primary function of the PLL system is to align the phase of the VCO's output with the phase of the incoming signal \\( \\phi_i \\). This is achieved through a feedback loop that continuously adjusts the VCO's frequency to minimize the phase error \\( \\phi_\\epsilon \\). The integration within the loop ensures that the VCO's phase tracks the incoming signal's phase over time, maintaining synchronization.\n\nThe block diagram in Fig. 10.15 also indicates that an integration process inherently occurs within the phase-locked loop, represented by the \\( \\frac{1}{s} \\) block.\n\nFor practical considerations, the VCO is designed such that when the control voltage \\( V_o \\) is zero, the VCO's frequency is not zero. The relationship between the VCO's output frequency \\( \\omega_{\\text{osc}} \\) and \\( V_o \\) is given by:\n\n$$\n\\omega_{\\mathrm{osc}}=\\omega_{o}+K_{O} V_{o}\n$$\n\nwhere \\( \\omega_{o} \\) is the free-running frequency when \\( V_o = 0 \\).\n\nThe system depicted in Fig. 10.15 is a classical linear feedback control system. The closed-loop transfer function is expressed as:\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{o}}{\\phi_{i}} =\\frac{K_{D} F(s) A}{1+K_{D} F(s) A \\frac{K_{o}}{s}} \\tag{10.46}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{o}}{\\phi_{i}} =\\frac{s K_{D} F(s) A}{s+K_{D} K_{O} A F(s)} \\tag{10.47}\n$$\n\nIn most cases, we are interested in the loop's response to frequency fluctuations at the input, treating the input variable as frequency rather than phase. Given that:\n\n$$\n\\omega_{i}=\\frac{d \\phi_{i}}{d t} \\tag{10.48}\n$$\n\nwe can express the input frequency in the s-domain as:\n\n$$\n\\omega_{i}(s)=s \\phi_{i}(s) \\tag{10.49}\n$$\n\nand the output-to-input frequency transfer function as:\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{o}}{\\omega_{i}}=\\frac{1}{s} \\frac{V_{o}}{\\phi_{i}}=\\frac{K_{D} F(s) A}{s+K_{D} K_{O} A F(s)} \\tag{10.50}\n$$\n\nWe first consider the scenario where the loop filter is entirely absent, resulting in a first-order loop with \\( F(s) = 1 \\). The transfer function for this simplified loop is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{o}}{\\omega_{i}}=\\left(\\frac{K_{v}}{s+K_{v}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{K_{O}}\\right) \\tag{10.51}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nK_{v}=K_{O} K_{D} A \\tag{10.52}\n$$\n\nThus, the loop inherently exhibits a first-order, low-pass transfer characteristic. It is important to note that the input variable in this context is the frequency \\( \\omega_{i} \\) of the incoming signal. The response calculated above is the loop's response to frequency modulation on the incoming carrier signal.\n\nThe constant \\( K_{v} \\) is referred to as the loop bandwidth. If the loop is locked to a carrier signal that varies sinusoidally in frequency with a frequency \\( \\omega_{m} \\), a sinusoidal signal at the frequency \\( \\omega_{m} \\) will be observed at the loop's output. When \\( \\omega_{m} \\) exceeds \\( K_{v} \\), the magnitude of the sinusoid at the output diminishes. Therefore, the loop bandwidth \\( K_{v} \\) represents the effective bandwidth for the modulating signal that the PLL can demodulate. In terms of the loop parameters, \\( K_{v} \\) is the product of the phase detector gain, VCO gain, and any additional electrical gain within the loop. The root locus of this single-pole system as a function of the loop gain \\( K_{v} \\) is depicted in Fig. 10.16a, along with the frequency response and the time-domain response illustrating the loop output voltage's behavior to step changes in input frequency.\n\nThe PLL system's behavior in response to step changes in input frequency is shown in Fig. 10.16b. The parameters for this example are provided, and the output voltage \\( V_o \\) is calculated for constant input signal frequencies of 250 Hz and 1 kHz. Additionally, the output signal \\( V_o(t) \\) is determined for a frequency-modulated input signal.\n\nOperating the loop without a loop filter has practical drawbacks. Since the phase detector acts as a multiplier, it generates a sum frequency component at its output in addition to the difference frequency component. Without a loop filter, this component at twice the carrier frequency would be transmitted directly to the output. Furthermore, all out-of-band interfering signals present at the input would appear at the output, shifted in frequency. Hence, a loop filter is highly desirable in applications where interfering signals are present.\n\nThe most common configuration for integrated circuit PLLs is the second-order loop. In this setup, the loop filter \\( F(s) \\) is typically a single-pole, low-pass filter, usually implemented with a resistor and capacitor. The cutoff frequency of this filter is given by \\( \\omega_1 = \\frac{1}{RC} \\). The root locus and closed-loop response plots for this filter configuration are provided, indicating stability and frequency response characteristics.\n\nBy substituting the loop filter's transfer function into the overall transfer function, we obtain:\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{o}}{\\omega_{i}}=\\frac{1}{K_{O}}\\left(\\frac{1}{1+\\frac{s}{K_{v}}+\\frac{s^{2}}{\\omega_{1} K_{v}}}\\right) \\tag{10.54}\n$$\n\nThe root locus for this feedback system as \\( K_{v} \\) varies is shown in Fig. 10.17, along with the corresponding frequency response. The roots of the transfer function are:\n\n$$\ns=-\\frac{\\omega_{1}}{2}\\left(1 \\pm \\sqrt{1-\\frac{4 K_{v}}{\\omega_{1}}}\\right) \\tag{10.55}\n$$\n\nThe transfer function can also be expressed in terms of the natural frequency \\( \\omega_{n} \\) and damping ratio \\( \\zeta \\) as:\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{o}}{\\omega_{i}}=\\frac{1}{K_{O}}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\frac{s^{2}}{\\omega_{n}^{2}}+\\frac{2 \\zeta}{\\omega_{n}} s+1}\\right) \\tag{10.56}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\omega_{n} =\\sqrt{K_{v} \\omega_{1}}  \\tag{10.57}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\zeta =\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega_{1}}{K_{v}}} \\tag{10.58}\n$$\n\nThe basic factor that determines the loop bandwidth is \\( K_{v} \\), similar to the first-order case. The magnitude \\( \\omega_{1} \\) of the additional pole is then minimized to reduce peaking in the frequency response without compromising stability. This peaking is of concern because it distorts the demodulated FM output and causes the loop to oscillate or exhibit an undamped oscillatory response when disturbed by transients. A good compromise is to use a maximally flat low-pass pole configuration, placing the poles at \\( 45^{\\circ} \\) from the negative real axis. For this response, the damping ratio \\( \\zeta \\) should be equal to \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\). Thus:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}=\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega_{1}}{K_{v}}} \\tag{10.59}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\omega_{1}=2 K_{v} \\tag{10.60}\n$$\n\nThe \\( -3 \\text{dB} \\) frequency of the transfer function \\( \\left(\\frac{V_{o}}{\\omega_{i}}\\right)(j \\omega) \\) is then:\n\n$$\n\\omega_{-3 \\mathrm{~dB}}=\\omega_{n}=\\sqrt{K_{v} \\omega_{1}}=\\sqrt{2} K_{v} \\tag{10.61}\n$$\n\nA disadvantage of the second-order loop, as discussed, is that the \\( -3 \\text{dB} \\) bandwidth is primarily determined by the loop gain \\( K_{v} \\) (Equation 10.61). As we will show, the loop gain also sets the lock range, meaning that with the simple filter used here, these two parameters are inherently linked. In some phase-locked communications systems, a wide lock range is required to track large signal-frequency variations, yet a narrow loop bandwidth is needed to reject out-of-band signals. Using a very small \\( \\omega_{1} \\) would achieve this, but it would result in an underdamped loop response. By adding a zero to the loop filter, the loop filter pole can be made small while still maintaining good loop damping.\n\nThe effect of adding a zero to the loop response is best observed by examining the open-loop response of the circuit. Shown in Fig. 10.18a is the open-loop response of the circuit with no loop filter. Due to the integration inherent in the loop, the response exhibits a \\( -20 \\text{dB/dec} \\) slope across the entire frequency range and crosses unity gain at \\( K_{v} \\). In Fig. 10.18b, a loop filter with \\( \\omega_{1} \\) much smaller than \\( K_{v} \\) has been added, resulting in a phase shift close to \\( 180^{\\circ} \\) at the crossover frequency and a sharp peak in the closed-loop frequency response. By adding a zero in the loop filter at \\( \\omega_{2} \\), as shown in Fig. 10.18c, the loop phase margin can be significantly improved. Note that for this case, the loop bandwidth, which is equal to the crossover frequency, is much lower than \\( K_{v} \\). This ability to set the loop bandwidth and \\( K_{v} \\) independently is an advantage of this type of loop filter. An R-C circuit that provides the necessary pole and zero in the filter response is shown in Fig. 10.18d. The root locus for this loop filter and the resulting closed-loop response are also shown.\n\nThe loop lock range is the range of input frequencies around the center frequency where the loop maintains lock. It is typically limited by the phase comparator's finite phase comparison range. Once the phase difference between the input signal and the VCO output reaches a critical value, the phase comparator ceases to behave linearly. The transfer characteristic of a typical analog phase comparator is shown in Fig. 10.12. It is evident from this figure that to maintain lock, the phase difference between the VCO output and the incoming signal must be kept between zero and \\( \\pi \\). If the phase difference equals either zero or \\( \\pi \\), the magnitude of the dc voltage at the phase comparator's output is:\n\n$$\nV_{o(\\max )}= \\pm K_{D}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) \\tag{10.62}\n$$\n\nThis dc voltage is amplified by the electrical gain \\( A \\), and the result is applied to the VCO input, causing a frequency shift away from the free-running center frequency of:\n\n$$\n\\Delta \\omega_{\\mathrm{osc}}=K_{D} A K_{O}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)=\\left(\\frac{K_{v} \\pi}{2}\\right) \\tag{10.63}\n$$\n\nIf the input frequency is shifted away from the free-running frequency, more voltage will be required to shift the VCO frequency accordingly. However, the phase comparator cannot produce more dc output voltage to shift the VCO frequency further, causing the loop to lose lock. The lock range \\( \\omega_{L} \\) is then given by:\n\n$$\n\\omega_{L}=K_{v} \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\tag{10.64}\n$$\n\nThis is the frequency range on either side of the free-running frequency where the loop will track input frequency variations. It is a parameter that depends solely on the dc gain within the loop and is independent of the loop filter's properties. Other types of phase detectors can provide larger linear ranges of phase-comparator operation.\n\nThe capture range is the range of input frequencies for which an initially unlocked loop will lock onto an input signal when initially in an unlocked state, and it is always less than the lock range. When the input frequency is swept through a range around the center frequency, the output voltage as a function of input frequency displays a hysteresis effect, as shown in Fig. 10.19. As previously discussed, the capture range is difficult to predict analytically. As a rough estimate, the approximate capture range can be determined using the following procedure: Refer to Fig. 10.13 and assume that the loop is opened at the loop-amplifier output and that a signal with a frequency not equal to the free-running VCO frequency is applied at the input of the PLL. The sinusoidal difference frequency component that appears at the phase detector's output has the value:\n\n$$\nV_{p}(t)=\\frac{\\pi}{2} K_{D} \\cos \\left(\\omega_{i}-\\omega_{\\mathrm{osc}}\\right) t \\tag{10.65}\n$$\n\nwhere \\( \\omega_{i} \\) is the input signal frequency and \\( \\omega_{\\text{osc}} \\) is the VCO's free-running frequency. This component passes through the loop filter, and the output from the loop amplifier resulting from this component is:\n\n$$\nV_{o}(t)=\\frac{\\pi}{2} K_{D} A\\left|F\\left[j\\left(\\omega_{i}-\\omega_{\\mathrm{osc}}\\right)\\right]\\right| \\cos \\left[\\left(\\omega_{i}-\\omega_{\\mathrm{osc}}\\right) t+\\phi\\right] \\tag{10.66}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\phi=\\angle"

    "text": "PLLs are extensively utilized in systems primarily because their components are well-suited for monolithic integration, allowing entire PLL systems to be fabricated on a single chip. We will now delve into the design specifics of each PLL component.\n\nThe Phase Detector for monolithic PLLs typically uses the Gilbert multiplier configuration, as depicted in Fig. 10.4. When two input signals, with amplitudes sufficient to induce limiting in the emitter-coupled pairs that comprise the circuit, are applied, the output will include a DC component expressed by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {average }}=-I_{E E} R_{C}\\left(1-\\frac{2 \\phi}{\\pi}\\right) \\tag{10.69}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\phi$ represents the phase difference between the input signals. A notable characteristic of this phase detector's performance is that if the amplitude of the signal applied at $V_{\\mathrm{in} 2}$ is significantly smaller than the thermal voltage $V_{T}$, the circuit functions as a balanced modulator. Consequently, the DC component of the output depends on the amplitude of the lower-level input. The resulting output waveform is a sinusoid multiplied by a synchronous square wave, as illustrated in Fig. 10.20.

At elevated operating frequencies, the parasitic capacitances of the devices lead to feedthrough of the carrier frequency, introducing an erroneous component in the output at the center frequency. However, this component is effectively removed by the loop filter and does not significantly impair loop performance. Typically, the VCO is the limiting factor in the operating frequency range.\n\nThe Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO) dictates the operating frequency range, FM distortion, center-frequency drift, and center-frequency supply-voltage sensitivity. Integrated-circuit VCOs often take the form of R-C multivibrators, where the charging current in the capacitor is altered in response to the control input. Initially, we consider the emitter-coupled multivibrator, as shown in Fig. 10.21a, which is representative of those employed in this context. To calculate the period, we first assume that $Q_{1}$ is off and $Q_{2}$ is on, resulting in the circuit appearing as depicted in Fig. 10.21b. Assuming that current $I$ is substantial enough for the voltage drop $I R$ to activate diode $Q_{6}$, the base of $Q_{4}$ sits one diode drop below $V_{C C}$, the emitter is two diode drops below $V_{C C}$, and the base of $Q_{1}$ is two diode drops below $V_{C C}$. Neglecting the base current of $Q_{3}$, its base is at $V_{C C}$ and its emitter is one diode drop below $V_{C C}$. Hence, the emitter of $Q_{2}$ is two diode drops below $V_{C C}$. Since $Q_{1}$ is off, current $I_{1}$ charges the capacitor, causing the emitter of $Q_{1}$ to become more negative. $Q_{1}$ will turn on when the voltage at its emitter equals three diode drops below $V_{C C}$. The resulting collector current in $Q_{1}$ then activates $Q_{5}$. Consequently, the base of $Q_{3}$ shifts negatively by one diode drop, prompting the base of $Q_{2}$ to shift negatively as well. $Q_{2}$ will turn off, causing the base of $Q_{1}$ to shift positively by one diode drop because $Q_{6}$ also turns off. As a result, the emitter-base junction of $Q_{2}$ becomes reverse biased by one diode drop since the voltage on $C$ cannot change instantaneously. Current $I_{1}$ must now charge the capacitor voltage in the negative direction by an amount equal to two diode drops before the circuit will switch back again. Given the circuit's symmetry, the half period is determined by the time required to charge the capacitor and is expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{T}{2}=\\frac{Q}{I_{1}} \\tag{10.72}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $Q=C \\Delta V=2 C V_{B E(\\text { on })}$ denotes the charge on the capacitor. Therefore, the frequency of the oscillator is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nf=\\frac{1}{T}=\\frac{I_{1}}{4 C V_{B E(\\mathrm{on})}} \\tag{10.73}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe various waveforms within the circuit are displayed in Fig. 10.21c. This emitter-coupled configuration is nonsaturating and consists solely of npn transistors. Moreover, the voltage swings within the circuit are minimal. Consequently, the circuit can operate at frequencies up to roughly 1 GHz for standard integrated-circuit transistors. Nevertheless, the usable frequency range is confined to a value lower than this due to the substantial center frequency drift with temperature fluctuations at the higher frequencies. This drift arises because the switching transients themselves constitute a large percentage of the period of the oscillation, and the duration of the switching transients depends on circuit parasitics, circuit resistances, transistor transconductance, and transistor input resistance, all of which are temperature dependent.\n\nAlthough the emitter-coupled configuration is capable of high operating speeds, it exhibits considerable sensitivity of the center frequency to temperature even at low frequencies, since the period is dependent on $V_{B E(\\text { on })}$. Using equation $(10.73)$, we can compute the temperature coefficient of the center frequency as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{1}{\\omega_{\\mathrm{osc}}} \\frac{d \\omega_{\\mathrm{osc}}}{d T}=-\\frac{1}{V_{B E(\\mathrm{on})}} \\frac{d V_{B E(\\mathrm{on})}}{d T}=\\frac{+2 \\mathrm{mV} /{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}}{600 \\mathrm{mV}}=+3300 \\mathrm{ppm} /{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} \\tag{10.74}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis temperature sensitivity of the center frequency can be offset by making current $I_{1}$ temperature dependent in such a way that its impact counteracts the effect of the variation of $V_{B E(\\text { on })}$."

We shall now delve into the design of the individual components of a PLL.\n\nPhase Detector: For monolithic PLL applications, phase detectors typically employ the Gilbert multiplier configuration depicted in Fig. 10.4. As shown in Fig. 10.11, when two signals with sufficient amplitude to induce limiting in the emitter-coupled pairs that comprise the circuit are applied to the inputs, the output will include a DC component expressed by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {average }}=-I_{E E} R_{C}\\left(1-\\frac{2 \\phi}{\\pi}\\right) \\tag{10.69}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\phi$ denotes the phase difference between the input signals. A crucial aspect of this phase detector's performance is that if the amplitude of the signal applied at $V_{\\mathrm{in} 2}$ is much smaller than the thermal voltage $V_{T}$, the circuit functions as a balanced modulator, and the DC component of the output is influenced by the amplitude of the low-level input. Consequently, the output waveform resembles a sinusoid multiplied by a synchronous square wave, as depicted in Fig. 10.20. In the scenario where the small input is negligible compared to $V_{T}$, the DC component in the output, as per Fig. 10.20, becomes\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{\\text {average }} & =\\frac{1}{\\pi} g_{m} R_{C} V_{i}\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\phi}(\\sin \\omega t) d(\\omega t)-\\int_{\\phi}^{\\pi}(\\sin \\omega t) d(\\omega t)\\right]  \\tag{10.70}\\\\\n& =-\\frac{2 g_{m} R_{C} V_{i} \\cos \\phi}{\\pi} \\tag{10.71}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere $R_{C}$ is the collector resistor in the Gilbert multiplier, and $g_{m}$ is the transconductance of the transistors. The phase detector output voltage is thus proportional to the amplitude $V_{i}$ of the incoming signal, and if the signal amplitude fluctuates, the loop gain of the phase-locked loop is affected. Hence, when signal amplitude varies, it is often necessary to precede the phase detector with an amplifier/limiter to circumvent this issue. In FM demodulators, for instance, any amplitude modulation present on the incoming frequency-modulated signal will be demodulated, leading to an erroneous output.\n\nIn PLL applications, the frequency response of the phase detector typically does not constrain the usable operating frequency range of the loop itself. At high operating frequencies, parasitic capacitances of the devices cause a feedthrough of the carrier frequency, introducing an erroneous component in the output at the center frequency.

Consequently, the base of $Q_{4}$ is one diode drop below $V_{C C}$, the emitter is two diode drops below $V_{C C}$, and the base of $Q_{1}$ is two diode drops below $V_{C C}$. If we can disregard the base current of $Q_{3}$, its base is at $V_{C C}$ and its emitter is one diode drop below $V_{C C}$. Since $Q_{1}$ is off, current $I_{1}$ charges the capacitor, causing the emitter of $Q_{1}$ to become more negative. $Q_{1}$ will turn on when the voltage at its emitter equals three diode drops below $V_{C C}$. The resulting collector current in $Q_{1}$ activates $Q_{5}$.

If two signals large enough in amplitude to cause limiting in the emitter-coupled pairs are applied to the inputs, the output will contain a DC component given by:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text {average }}=-I_{E E} R_{C}\\left(1-\\frac{2 \\phi}{\\pi}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\phi$ is the phase difference between the input signals. An important aspect of the performance of this phase detector is that if the amplitude of the applied signal at $V_{\\mathrm{in} 2}$ is small compared to the thermal voltage $V_{T}$, the circuit behaves as a balanced modulator, and the DC component of the output depends on the amplitude of the low-level input. The output waveform is then a sinusoid multiplied by a synchronous square wave. In the limiting case when the small input is small compared to $V_{T}$, the DC component in the output becomes:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text {average }} =\\frac{1}{\\pi} g_{m} R_{C} V_{i}\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\phi}(\\sin \\omega t) d(\\omega t)-\\int_{\\phi}^{\\pi}(\\sin \\omega t) d(\\omega t)\\right]\n$$\n\n$$\nV_{\\text {average }} =-\\frac{2 g_{m} R_{C} V_{i} \\cos \\phi}{\\pi}\n$$\n\nThe phase detector output voltage becomes proportional to the amplitude $V_{i}$ of the incoming signal, and if the signal amplitude varies, then the loop gain of the phase-locked loop changes. Thus, when the signal amplitude varies, it is often necessary to precede the phase detector with an amplifier/limiter to avoid this problem. In FM demodulators, for example, any amplitude modulation appearing on the incoming frequency-modulated signal will be demodulated, producing an erroneous output.\n\nIn PLL applications, the frequency response of the phase detector is usually not the limiting factor in the usable operating frequency range of the loop itself. At high operating frequencies, the parasitic capacitances of the devices result in a feedthrough of the carrier frequency, giving an erroneous component in the output at the center frequency. This component is removed by the loop filter, however, and does not greatly affect loop performance. The VCO is usually the limiting factor in the operating frequency range.\n\nVoltage-Controlled Oscillator: The operating frequency range, FM distortion, center frequency drift, and center-frequency supply-voltage sensitivity are all determined by the performance of the VCO. Integrated-circuit VCOs often are simply R-C multivibrators in which the charging current in the capacitor is varied in response to the control input. We first consider the emitter-coupled multivibrator as shown in Fig. 10.21a, which is typical of those used in this application. We calculate the period by first assuming that $Q_{1}$ is turned off and $Q_{2}$ is turned on. The circuit then appears as shown in Fig. 10.21b. We assume that current $I$ is large so that the voltage drop $I R$ is large enough to turn on diode $Q_{6}$. Thus the base of $Q_{4}$ is one diode drop below $V_{C C}$, the emitter is two diode drops below $V_{C C}$, and the base of $Q_{1}$ is two diode drops below $V_{C C}$. If we can neglect the base current of $Q_{3}$, its base is at $V_{C C}$ and its emitter is one diode drop below $V_{C C}$. Thus the emitter of $Q_{2}$ is two diode drops below $V_{C C}$. Since $Q_{1}$ is off, the current $I_{1}$ is charging the capacitor so that the emitter of $Q_{1}$ is becoming more negative. $Q_{1}$ will turn on when the voltage at its emitter becomes equal to three diode drops below $V_{C C}$. Transistor $Q_{1}$ will then turn on, and the resulting collector current in $Q_{1}$ turns on $Q_{5}$. As a result, the base of $Q_{3}$ moves in the negative direction by one diode drop, causing the base of $Q_{2}$ to move in the negative direction by one diode drop. $Q_{2}$ will turn off, causing the base of $Q_{1}$ to move positive by one diode drop because $Q_{6}$ also turns off. As a result, the emitter-base junction of $Q_{2}$ is reverse biased by one diode drop because the voltage on $C$ cannot change instantaneously. Current $I_{1}$ must now charge the capacitor voltage in the negative direction by an amount equal to two diode drops before the circuit will switch back again. Since the circuit is symmetrical, the half period is given by the time required to charge the capacitor and is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{T}{2}=\\frac{Q}{I_{1}}\n$$\n\nwhere $Q=C \\Delta V=2 C V_{B E(\\text { on })}$ is the charge on the capacitor. The frequency of the oscillator is thus:\n\n$$\nf=\\frac{1}{T}=\\frac{I_{1}}{4 C V_{B E(\\mathrm{on})}}\n$$\n\nThe various waveforms in the circuit are shown in Fig. 10.21c. This emitter-coupled configuration is nonsaturating and contains only npn transistors. Furthermore, the voltage swings within the circuit are small. As a result, the circuit is capable of operating up to approximately 1 GHz for typical integrated-circuit transistors. However, the usable frequency range is limited to a value lower than this because the center frequency drift with temperature variations becomes large at the higher frequencies. This drift occurs because the switching transients themselves become a large percentage of the period of the oscillation, and the duration of the switching transients depends on circuit parasitics, circuit resistances, transistor transconductance, and transistor input resistance, which are all temperature sensitive.\n\nAlthough the emitter-coupled configuration is capable of high operating speed, it displays considerable sensitivity of center frequency to temperature even at low frequencies, since the period is dependent on $V_{B E(\\text { on })}$. Utilizing $(10.73)$ we can calculate the temperature coefficient of the center frequency as:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\omega_{\\mathrm{osc}}} \\frac{d \\omega_{\\mathrm{osc}}}{d T}=-\\frac{1}{V_{B E(\\mathrm{on})}} \\frac{d V_{B E(\\mathrm{on})}}{d T}=\\frac{+2 \\mathrm{mV} /{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}}{600 \\mathrm{mV}}=+3300 \\mathrm{ppm} /{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\n$$\n\nThis temperature sensitivity of center frequency can be compensated by causing current $I_{1}$ to be temperature sensitive in such a way that its effect is equal and opposite to the effect of the variation of $V_{B E(\\text { on })}$."

    "text": "The primary reason for the extensive application of phase-locked loops (PLLs) as system components stems from the fact that the phase-locked loop's components are ideally suited for monolithic construction. As a result, entire PLL systems can be integrated onto a solitary semiconductor chip. We proceed to delve into the design specifics of these individual PLL components.\n\nPhase Detector: For monolithic PLLs, phase detectors typically employ the Gilbert multiplier configuration, as depicted in Figure 10.4. Figure 10.11 illustrates that when signals of adequate amplitude are applied to the two inputs, which are strong enough to induce limiting in the emitter-coupled pairs forming the circuit, the output will incorporate a direct current (dc) component. This is given by:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {average }}=-I_{E E} R_{C}\\left(1-\\frac{2 \\phi}{\\pi}\\right) \\tag{10.69}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\phi$ denotes the phase difference between the input signals. A significant characteristic of this phase detector's performance is that when the amplitude of the signal applied at $V_{\\mathrm{in} 2}$ is notably less than the thermal voltage $V_{T}$, the circuit operates as a balanced modulator. The dc portion of the output then depends on the amplitude of the low-level input. The resulting output waveform is a sinusoid multiplied by a synchronous square wave, as depicted in Figure 10.20. In the limiting scenario where the small input is much smaller than $V_{T}$, the dc component in the output is, as referenced to Figure 10.20:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{\\text {average }} & =\\frac{1}{\\pi} g_{m} R_{C} V_{i}\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\phi}(\\sin \\omega t) d(\\omega t)-\\int_{\\phi}^{\\pi}(\\sin \\omega t) d(\\omega t)\\right]  \\tag{10.70}\\\\\n& =-\\frac{2 g_{m} R_{C} V_{i} \\cos \\phi}{\\pi} \\tag{10.71}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nFigure 10.20\nDescription: The graph represents a time-domain waveform of a sinusoidal function.\n\nAxes Labels and Units:\n- Horizontal axis: Angular frequency multiplied by time (dimensionless).\n- Vertical axis: Input voltage in volts.\n\nOverall Behavior and Trends:\nThe graph illustrates a sinusoidal waveform characterized by a smooth, periodic oscillation starting from zero, rising to a positive peak, descending through zero to a negative peak, and returning to zero, completing a full cycle. The waveform is symmetrical about the horizontal axis, indicating equal positive and negative amplitudes.\n\nKey Features and Technical Details:\n- The sinusoidal function is represented by $V_i \\sin \\omega t$, where $V_i$ is the amplitude of the sine wave.\n- The waveform exhibits periodic behavior, with consistent intervals between peaks and zero crossings.\n- The maximum and minimum points (peaks) correspond to the amplitude $V_i$, representing the highest positive and lowest negative voltages reached.\n- Zero crossings occur at regular intervals, indicating points where the waveform changes polarity.\n\nAnnotations and Specific Data Points:\n- The graph is annotated with the expression $V_i \\sin \\omega t$ along the curve, indicating the mathematical form of the sinusoidal function.\n- No specific numerical values are provided for amplitude or frequency, but the general sinusoidal shape is clearly depicted.\n\nThe role of $R_{C}$ is as the collector resistor in the Gilbert multiplier, while $g_{m}$ represents the transconductance of the transistors. The phase detector output voltage is proportional to the amplitude $V_{i}$ of the incoming signal, and changes in signal amplitude can alter the loop gain of the PLL. Consequently, when the signal amplitude fluctuates, it is often essential to precede the phase detector with an amplifier/limiter to prevent this issue. For instance, in frequency-modulation (FM) demodulators, any amplitude modulation on the incoming frequency-modulated signal can lead to demodulation errors in the output.\n\nIn PLL applications, the frequency response of the phase detector usually is not the critical factor determining the usable operating frequency range of the loop. At high frequencies of operation, parasitic capacitances in the devices can result in feedthrough of the carrier frequency, introducing an erroneous component at the center frequency in the output. This component is eliminated by the loop filter, however, and does not significantly impact loop performance. Typically, the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) acts as the limiting factor in the operating frequency range.\n\nVoltage-Controlled Oscillator: The operating frequency range, frequency-modulation distortion, center-frequency drift, and sensitivity to center-frequency supply voltage are all influenced by the performance of the VCO. Integrated-circuit VCOs often consist of R-C multivibrators where the charging current in the capacitor is adjusted in response to the control input. We initially examine the emitter-coupled multivibrator depicted in Figure 10.21a, which is representative of those commonly used in this application. We calculate the period by assuming $Q_{1}$ is off and $Q_{2}$ is on, leading to the circuit configuration in Figure 10.21b. Assuming current $I$ is sufficiently large, the voltage drop $I R$ is large enough to turn on diode $Q_{6}$. Consequently, the base of $Q_{4}$ is one diode drop below $V_{C C}$, the emitter is two diode drops below $V_{C C}$, and the base of $Q_{1}$ is two diode drops below $V_{C C}$. If we can neglect the base current of $Q_{3}$, its base is at $V_{C C}$ and its emitter is one diode drop below $V_{C C}$. Thus, the emitter of $Q_{2}$ is two diode drops below $V_{C C}$. Since $Q_{1}$ is off, the current $I_{1}$ is charging the capacitor, causing the emitter of $Q_{1}$ to become more negative. $Q_{1}$ will turn on when the voltage at its emitter becomes equal to three diode drops below $V_{C C}$. Transistor $Q_{1}$ will then turn on, and the resulting collector current in $Q_{1}$ turns on $Q_{5}$. As a result, the base of $Q_{3}$ moves in the negative direction by one diode drop, causing the base of $Q_{2}$ to move in the negative direction by one diode drop. $Q_{2}$ will turn off, causing the base of $Q_{1}$ to move positive by one diode drop because $Q_{6}$ also turns off. As a result, the emitter-base junction of $Q_{2}$ is reverse biased by one diode drop because the voltage on $C$ cannot change instantaneously. Current $I_{1}$ must now charge the capacitor voltage in the negative direction by an amount equal to two diode drops before the circuit will switch back again. Since the circuit is symmetrical, the half period is given by the time required to charge the capacitor and is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{T}{2}=\\frac{Q}{I_{1}} \\tag{10.72}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $Q=C \\Delta V=2 C V_{B E(\\text { on })}$ is the charge on the capacitor. The frequency of the oscillator is thus:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nf=\\frac{1}{T}=\\frac{I_{1}}{4 C V_{B E(\\mathrm{on})}} \\tag{10.73}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe various waveforms in the circuit are shown in Figure 10.21c. This emitter-coupled configuration is nonsaturating and contains only npn transistors. Furthermore, the voltage swings within the circuit are small, allowing the circuit to operate up to approximately 1 GHz for typical integrated-circuit transistors. However, the usable frequency range is limited to a value lower than this due to large center-frequency drift with temperature variations at the higher frequencies.

By applying equation (10.73), we can determine the temperature coefficient of the center frequency:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{1}{\\omega_{\\mathrm{osc}}} \\frac{d \\omega_{\\mathrm{osc}}}{d T}=-\\frac{1}{V_{B E(\\mathrm{on})}} \\frac{d V_{B E(\\mathrm{on})}}{d T}=\\frac{+2 \\mathrm{mV} /{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}}{600 \\mathrm{mV}}=+3300 \\mathrm{ppm} /{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} \\tag{10.74}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis temperature sensitivity of the center frequency can be compensated by adjusting the current $I_{1}$ to be temperature sensitive in such a manner that its effect is equal and opposite to the effect of the variation of $V_{B E(\\text { on })}$."

The phase detector output voltage is proportional to the amplitude $V_{i}$ of the incoming signal, and if the signal amplitude varies, the loop gain of the phaselocked loop changes. Consequently, when the signal amplitude varies, it is usually essential to position an amplifier/limiter prior to the phase detector to avert this issue. In FM demodulators, for instance, any amplitude modulation present on the incoming frequency-modulated signal will be demodulated, resulting in an erroneous output.\n\nIn PLL applications, the frequency response of the phase detector typically does not act as the limiting factor within the operational frequency range of the loop itself.

We determine the period by first assuming that $Q_{1}$ is turned off and $Q_{2}$ is turned on. The circuit then assumes the appearance presented in Figure 10.21b. We assume that current $I$ is substantial enough for the voltage drop $I R$ to activate diode $Q_{6}$. Consequently, the base of $Q_{4}$ is one diode drop below $V_{C C}$, the emitter is two diode drops below $V_{C C}$, and the base of $Q_{1}$ is two diode drops below $V_{C C}$. Neglecting the base current of $Q_{3}$, its base is at $V_{C C}$, and its emitter is one diode drop below $V_{C C}$. If we can assume that $Q_{1}$ is off, the current $I_{1}$ is charging the capacitor such that the emitter of $Q_{1}$ becomes more negative. $Q_{1}$ will turn on when the voltage at its emitter becomes equal to three diode drops below $V_{C C}$.

In the limiting condition where the small input is far smaller than \\( V_{T} \\), the dc component in the output transforms into, as shown in Figure 10.20,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{\\text {average }} & =\\frac{1}{\\pi} g_{m} R_{C} V_{i}\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\phi}(\\sin \\omega t) d(\\omega t)-\\int_{\\phi}^{\\pi}(\\sin \\omega t) d(\\omega t)\\right]  \\tag{10.70}\\\\\n& =-\\frac{2 g_{m} R_{C} V_{i} \\cos \\phi}{\\pi} \\tag{10.71}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nFigure 10.20 illustrates the superposition of a sinusoidal function.\n\n1. **Graph Type and Function:**\n   The depicted graph is a time-domain representation of a sinusoidal waveform.\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n   - The horizontal axis is labeled as \\( \\omega t \\), signifying the product of angular frequency and time, which is generally dimensionless.\n   - The vertical axis is labeled as \\( V_{\\text{in2}} \\), indicating the input voltage measured in volts.\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n   The graph illustrates a sinusoidal waveform characterized by smooth, periodic oscillations.

No specific numerical values for amplitude or frequency are provided, but the general sinusoidal shape is clearly delineated.\n\nIn frequency-modulated demodulators, for instance, any amplitude modulation present on the incoming frequency-modulated signal is demodulated, yielding an erroneous output. To circumvent this, it is often essential to precede the phase detector with an amplifier/limiter in PLL applications.\n\nThe frequency response of the phase detector is typically not the constraining factor within the operational frequency range of the PLL loop itself. At elevated operating frequencies, the parasitic capacitances of the devices lead to the feedthrough of the carrier frequency, introducing an erroneous component at the central frequency.

    "text": "The primary rationale for the widespread adoption of phase-locked loops (PLLs) as system components lies in the fact that the components of the phase-locked loop are highly amenable to monolithic integration. A complete PLL system can be fabricated on a single integrated circuit chip. We proceed with a discussion on the design of the individual PLL components.\n\nPhase Detector: Monolithic PLL applications typically employ phase detectors configured as Gilbert multipliers, as depicted in Figure 10.4. As shown in Figure 10.11, when signals of sufficient amplitude to induce limiting in the emitter-coupled pairs that make up the circuit are applied to both inputs, the output contains a direct current (dc) component, expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {average }}=-I_{E E} R_{C}\\left(1-\\frac{2 \\phi}{\\pi}\\right) \\tag{10.69}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\phi$ denotes the phase difference between the input signals. An essential aspect of the phase detector's performance is that if the amplitude of the applied signal at $V_{\\mathrm{in} 2}$ is relatively small in comparison to the thermal voltage $V_{T}$, the circuit operates as a balanced modulator, and the dc component of the output depends on the amplitude of the low-level input. The output waveform is then a sinusoid multiplied by a synchronous square wave, as illustrated in Figure 10.20. In the limiting case where the small input is small compared to $V_{T}$, the dc component in the output is as follows, referring to Figure 10.20:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{\\text {average }} & =\\frac{1}{\\pi} g_{m} R_{C} V_{i}\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\phi}(\\sin \\omega t) d(\\omega t)-\\int_{\\phi}^{\\pi}(\\sin \\omega t) d(\\omega t)\\right]  \\tag{10.70}\\\\\n& =-\\frac{2 g_{m} R_{C} V_{i} \\cos \\phi}{\\pi} \\tag{10.71}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\n[Image: Figure 10.20]\n[Description: Type of Graph and Function: A time-domain waveform graph depicting a sinusoidal function.]\n\n[Image: Figure 10.20 Sinusoid multiplied by a synchronous square wave]\n[Description: The graph in Figure 10.20 illustrates two waveforms plotted over time (\\( \\omega t \\)). The top waveform is a synchronous square wave, labeled \\( V_{in1} \\), and the bottom waveform is a sinusoidal wave, labeled \\( V_o \\). Both waveforms are plotted against the same time axis, \\( \\omega t \\).]\n\n[Image: Figure 10.20 Sinusoid multiplied by a synchronous square wave]\n[Description: The graph in Figure 10.20 shows two waveforms plotted against time (\\( \\omega t \\)). The top waveform is a synchronous square wave, labeled \\( V_{in1} \\), and the bottom waveform is a sinusoidal wave, labeled \\( V_o \\). Both waveforms share the same time axis, \\( \\omega t \\).]\n\nThe collector resistor \\( R_{C} \\) in the Gilbert multiplier and the transconductance \\( g_{m} \\) of the transistors play a role in determining the output voltage. The phase detector output voltage is proportional to the amplitude \\( V_{i} \\) of the incoming signal, and if the signal amplitude varies, the loop gain of the phase-locked loop is also affected. Consequently, when signal amplitude variations occur, it is often necessary to incorporate an amplifier/limiter before the phase detector to prevent this issue. For example, in FM demodulators, any amplitude modulation present on the incoming frequency-modulated signal can be demodulated, resulting in erroneous output.\n\nIn PLL applications, the frequency response of the phase detector is generally not the limiting factor within the usable operating frequency range of the loop. At high operating frequencies, parasitic capacitances within the devices cause a feedthrough of the carrier frequency, introducing an erroneous component in the output at the center frequency. This component is eliminated by the loop filter, however, and does not significantly impact loop performance. The voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) is often the limiting factor in the operating frequency range.\n\nVoltage-Controlled Oscillator: The operational frequency range, frequency modulation distortion, center-frequency drift, and center-frequency supply-voltage sensitivity are all determined by the performance of the VCO. Integrated-circuit VCOs are often simple R-C multivibrators, where the charging current in the capacitor is adjusted in response to the control input. We initially consider the emitter-coupled multivibrator illustrated in Figure 10.21a, which is representative of those commonly used in this application. We calculate the period by first assuming that \\( Q_{1} \\) is turned off and \\( Q_{2} \\) is turned on. The circuit then appears as in Figure 10.21b. We assume that current \\( I \\) is sufficiently large such that the voltage drop \\( I R \\) is large enough to turn on diode \\( Q_{6} \\). Thus, the base of \\( Q_{4} \\) is one diode drop below \\( V_{C C} \\), the emitter is two diode drops below \\( V_{C C} \\), and the base of \\( Q_{1} \\) is two diode drops below \\( V_{C C} \\). If we can neglect the base current of \\( Q_{3} \\), its base is at \\( V_{C C} \\), and its emitter is one diode drop below \\( V_{C C} \\). Thus, the emitter of \\( Q_{2} \\) is two diode drops below \\( V_{C C} \\).\n\nSince \\( Q_{1} \\) is off, the current \\( I_{1} \\) is charging the capacitor so that the emitter of \\( Q_{1} \\) is becoming more negative. \\( Q_{1} \\) will turn on when the voltage at its emitter becomes equal to three diode drops below \\( V_{C C} \\). Transistor \\( Q_{1} \\) will then turn on, and the resulting collector current in \\( Q_{1} \\) turns on \\( Q_{5} \\). As a result, the base of \\( Q_{3} \\) moves in the negative direction by one diode drop, causing the base of \\( Q_{2} \\) to move in the negative direction by one diode drop. \\( Q_{2} \\) will turn off, causing the base of \\( Q_{1} \\) to move positive by one diode drop because \\( Q_{6} \\) also turns off. As a result, the emitter-base junction of \\( Q_{2} \\) is reverse biased by one diode drop because the voltage on \\( C \\) cannot change instantaneously. Current \\( I_{1} \\) must now charge the capacitor voltage in the negative direction by an amount equal to two diode drops before the circuit will switch back again. Since the circuit is symmetrical, the half period is given by the time required to charge the capacitor and is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{T}{2}=\\frac{Q}{I_{1}} \\tag{10.72}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere \\( Q=C \\Delta V=2 C V_{B E(\\text { on })} \\) is the charge on the capacitor. The frequency of the oscillator is thus\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nf=\\frac{1}{T}=\\frac{I_{1}}{4 C V_{B E(\\mathrm{on})}} \\tag{10.73}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe various waveforms within the circuit are shown in Figure 10.21c. This emitter-coupled configuration is nonsaturating and contains only npn transistors. Furthermore, the voltage swings within the circuit are small. As a result, the circuit is capable of operating up to approximately 1 GHz for typical integrated-circuit transistors. However, the usable frequency range is limited to a value lower than this because the center frequency drift with temperature variations becomes large at higher frequencies. This drift occurs because the switching transients themselves become a large percentage of the period of the oscillation, and the duration of the switching transients depends on circuit parasitics, circuit resistances, transistor transconductance, and transistor input resistance, which are all temperature sensitive.\n\nAlthough the emitter-coupled configuration is capable of high operating speeds, it displays considerable sensitivity of center frequency to temperature even at low frequencies, since the period is dependent on \\( V_{B E(\\text { on })} \\). Using Equation 10.73, we can calculate the temperature coefficient of the center frequency as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{1}{\\omega_{\\mathrm{osc}}} \\frac{d \\omega_{\\mathrm{osc}}}{d T}=-\\frac{1}{V_{B E(\\mathrm{on})}} \\frac{d V_{B E(\\mathrm{on})}}{d T}=\\frac{+2 \\mathrm{mV} /{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}}{600 \\mathrm{mV}}=+3300 \\mathrm{ppm} /{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} \\tag{10.74}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis temperature sensitivity of the center frequency can be compensated by adjusting current \\( I_{1} \\) to be temperature sensitive in such a way that its effect is equal and opposite to the effect of the variation of \\( V_{B E(\\text { on })} \\)."
