# 11. Noise in Integrated Circuits

## 11.1 Introduction

This chapter deals with the effects of electrical noise in integrated circuits. The noise phenomena considered here are caused by the small current and voltage fluctuations that are generated within the devices themselves, and we specifically exclude extraneous pickup of human-made signals that can also be a problem in high-gain circuits. The existence of noise is basically due to the fact that electrical charge is not continuous but is carried in discrete amounts equal to the electron charge, and thus noise is associated with fundamental processes in the integrated-circuit devices.

The study of noise is important because it represents a lower limit to the size of electrical signal that can be amplified by a circuit without significant deterioration in signal quality. Noise also results in an upper limit to the useful gain of an amplifier, because if the gain is increased without limit, the output stage of the circuit will eventually begin to limit (that is, a transistor will leave the active region) on the amplified noise from the input stages.

In this chapter the various sources of electronic noise are considered, and the equivalent circuits of common devices including noise generators are described. Methods of circuit analysis with noise generators as inputs are illustrated, and the noise analysis of complex circuits such as op amps is performed. Methods of computer analysis of noise are examined, and, finally, some common methods of specifying circuit noise performance are described.

## 11.2 Sources of Noise

### 11.2.1 Shot Noise ${ }^{1,2,3,4}$

Shot noise is always associated with a direct-current flow and is present in diodes, MOS transistors, and bipolar transistors. The origin of shot noise can be seen by considering the diode of Fig. 11.1 $a$ and the carrier concentrations in the device in the forward-bias region as shown in Fig. 11.1b. As explained in Chapter 1, an electric field $\mathscr{E}$ exists in the depletion region and a voltage $\left(\psi_{0}-V\right)$ exists between the $p$-type and the $n$-type regions, where $\psi_{0}$ is the built-in potential and $V$ is the forward bias on the diode. The forward current of the diode $I$ is composed of holes from the $p$ region and electrons from the $n$ region, which have sufficient energy to overcome the potential barrier at the junction. Once the carriers have crossed the junction, they diffuse away as minority carriers.

The passage of each carrier across the junction, which can be modeled as a random event, is dependent on the carrier having sufficient energy and a velocity directed toward the junction. Thus external current $I$, which appears to be a steady current, is, in fact, composed of

a large number of random independent current pulses. If the current is examined on a sensitive oscilloscope, the trace appears as in Fig. 11.2, where $I_{D}$ is the average current.

The fluctuation in $I$ is termed shot noise and is generally specified in terms of its meansquare variation about the average value. This is written as $\overline{i^{2}}$, where

$$
\begin{align*}
\overline{i^{2}} & =\overline{\left(I-I_{D}\right)^{2}} \\
& =\lim _{T \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{T} \int_{0}^{T}\left(I-I_{D}\right)^{2} d t \tag{11.1}
\end{align*}
$$

It can be shown that if a current $I$ is composed of a series of random independent pulses with average value $I_{D}$, then the resulting noise current has a mean-square value

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overline{i^{2}}=2 q I_{D} \Delta f \tag{11.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $q$ is the electronic charge $\left(1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C}\right)$ and $\Delta f$ is the bandwidth in hertz. This equation shows that the noise current has a mean-square value that is directly proportional to the bandwidth $\Delta f$ (in hertz) of the measurement. Thus a noise-current spectral density $i^{2} / \Delta f$ (with units square amperes per hertz) can be defined that is constant as a function of frequency. Noise with such a spectrum is often called white noise. Since noise is a purely random signal, the instantaneous value of the waveform cannot be predicted at any time. The only information available for use in circuit calculations concerns the mean square value of the signal given by (11.2). Bandwidth $\Delta f$ in (11.2) is determined by the circuit in which the noise source is acting.

Equation 11.2 is valid until the frequency becomes comparable to $1 / \tau$, where $\tau$ is the carrier transit time through the depletion region. For most practical electronic devices, $\tau$ is extremely
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_9972cfe7f689622347f7g-038.jpg?height=494&width=891&top_left_y=204&top_left_x=270)

small and (11.2) is accurate well into the gigahertz region. A sketch of noise-current spectral density versus frequency for a diode is shown in Fig. 11.3 assuming that the passage of each charge carrier across the depletion region produces a square pulse of current with width $\tau$.

#### EXAMPLE

Calculate the shot noise in a diode current of 1 mA in a bandwidth of 1 MHz . Using (11.2) we have

$$
\overline{i^{2}}=2 \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \times 10^{-3} \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~A}^{2}=3.2 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{~A}^{2}
$$

and thus

$$
i=1.8 \times 10^{-8} \mathrm{~A} \mathrm{rms}
$$

- where $i$ represents the root-mean-square (rms) value of the noise current.

The effect of shot noise can be represented in the low-frequency, small-signal equivalent circuit of the diode by inclusion of a current generator shunting the diode, as shown in Fig. 11.4. Since this noise signal has random phase and is defined solely in terms of its meansquare value, it also has no polarity. Thus the arrow in the current source in Fig. 11.2 has no significance and is included only to identify the generator as a current source. This practice is followed in this chapter where we deal only with noise generators having random phase.

The noise-current signal produced by the shot noise mechanism has an amplitude that varies randomly with time and that can only be specified by a probability-density function. It can be shown that the amplitude distribution of shot noise is Gaussian and the probabilitydensity function $p(I)$ of the diode current is plotted versus current in Fig. 11.5 (not to scale). The probability that the diode current lies between values $I$ and $(I+d I)$ at any time is given by $p(I) d I$. If $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution, then the diode current

amplitude lies between limits $I_{D} \pm \sigma$ for 68 percent of the time. By definition, variance $\sigma^{2}$ is the mean-square value of $\left(I-I_{D}\right)$ and thus, from (11.1),

$$
\sigma^{2}=\overline{i^{2}}
$$

and

$$
\begin{equation*}
\sigma=\sqrt{2 q I_{D} \Delta f} \tag{11.3}
\end{equation*}
$$

using (11.2). Note that, theoretically, the noise amplitude can have positive or negative values approaching infinity. However, the probability falls off very quickly as amplitude increases and an effective limit to the noise amplitude is $\pm 3 \sigma$. The noise signal is within these limits for 99.7 percent of the time. A brief description of the Gaussian distribution is given in Appendix A.3.1 in Chapter 3.

It is important to note that the distribution of noise in frequency as shown in Fig. 11.3 is due to the random nature of the hole and electron transitions across the $p n$ junction. Consider the situation if all the carriers made transitions with uniform time separation. Since each carrier has a charge of $1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C}$, a 1-mA current would then consist of current pulses every $1.6 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{~s}$. The Fourier analysis of such a waveform would give the spectrum of Fig. 11.6, which shows an average or dc value $I_{D}$ and harmonics at multiples of $1 / \Delta t$, where $\Delta t$ is the period of the waveform and equals $1.6 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{~s}$. Thus the first harmonic is at $6 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{GHz}$, which is far beyond the useful frequency of the device. There would be no noise produced in the normal frequency range of operation.

Figure 11.7 Alternative representations of thermal noise.

### 11.2.2 Thermal Noise ${ }^{\mathbf{1 , 3 , 5}}$

Thermal noise is generated by a completely different mechanism from shot noise. In conventional resistors it is due to the random thermal motion of the electrons and is unaffected by the presence or absence of direct current, since typical electron drift velocities in a conductor are much less than electron thermal velocities. Since this source of noise is due to the thermal motion of electrons, we expect that it is related to absolute temperature $T$. In fact thermal noise is directly proportional to $T$ (unlike shot noise, which is independent of $T$ ) and, as $T$ approaches zero, thermal noise also approaches zero.

In a resistor $R$, thermal noise can be shown to be represented by a series voltage generator $\overline{v^{2}}$ as shown in Fig. 11.7a, or by a shunt current generator $\overline{i^{2}}$ as in Fig. 11.7b. These representations are equivalent and

$$
\begin{align*}
& \overline{v^{2}}=4 k T R \Delta f  \tag{11.4}\\
& \overline{i^{2}}=4 k T \frac{1}{R} \Delta f \tag{11.5}
\end{align*}
$$

where $k$ is Boltzmann's constant. At room temperature $4 k T=1.66 \times 10^{-20} \mathrm{~V}$-C. Equations 11.4 and 11.5 show that the noise spectral density is again independent of frequency and, for thermal noise, this is true up to $10^{13} \mathrm{~Hz}$. Thus thermal noise is another source of white noise. Note that the Norton equivalent of (11.5) can be derived from (11.4) as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overline{i^{2}}=\frac{\overline{v^{2}}}{R^{2}} \tag{11.6}
\end{equation*}
$$

A useful number to remember for thermal noise is that at room temperature $\left(300^{\circ} \mathrm{K}\right)$, the thermal noise spectral density in a $1-\mathrm{k} \Omega$ resistor is $\overline{v^{2}} / \Delta f \simeq 16 \times 10^{-18} \mathrm{~V}^{2} / \mathrm{Hz}$. This can be written in rms form as $v \simeq 4 \mathrm{nV} / \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ where the form $\mathrm{nV} / \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ is used to emphasize that the rms noise voltage varies as the square root of the bandwidth. Another useful equivalence is that the thermal noise-current generator of a $1-\mathrm{k} \Omega$ resistor at room temperature is the same as that of $50 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ of direct current exhibiting shot noise.

Thermal noise as described above is a fundamental physical phenomenon and is present in any linear passive resistor. This includes conventional resistors and the radiation resistance of antennas, loudspeakers, and microphones. In the case of loudspeakers and microphones, the source of noise is the thermal motion of the air molecules. In the case of antennas, the source of noise is the black-body radiation of the object at which the antenna is directed. In all cases, (11.4) and (11.5) give the mean-square value of the noise.

The amplitude distribution of thermal noise is again Gaussian. Since both shot and thermal noise each have a flat frequency spectrum and a Gaussian amplitude distribution, they are indistinguishable once they are introduced into a circuit. The waveform of shot and thermal noise combined with a sinewave of equal power is shown in Fig. 11.21.

### 11.2.3 Flicker Noise ${ }^{6,7,8}$ (1/f Noise)

This is a type of noise found in all active devices, as well as in some discrete passive elements such as carbon resistors. The origins of flicker noise are varied, but it is caused mainly by traps associated with contamination and crystal defects. These traps capture and release carriers in a random fashion and the time constants associated with the process give rise to a noise signal with energy concentrated at low frequencies.

Flicker noise, which is always associated with a flow of direct current, displays a spectral density of the form

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overline{i^{2}}=K_{1} \frac{I^{a}}{f^{b}} \Delta f \tag{11.7}
\end{equation*}
$$

where

```
$\Delta f=$ small bandwidth at frequency $f$
$I=$ direct current
$K_{1}=$ constant for a particular device
$a=$ constant in the range 0.5 to 2
$b=$ constant of about unity
```

If $b=1$ in (11.7), the noise spectral density has a $1 / f$ frequency dependence (hence the alternative name $1 / f$ noise), as shown in Fig. 11.8. It is apparent that flicker noise is most significant at low frequencies, although in devices exhibiting high flicker noise levels, this noise source may dominate the device noise at frequencies well into the megahertz range.

It was noted above that flicker noise only exists in association with a direct current. Thus, in the case of carbon resistors, no flicker noise is present until a direct current is passed through the resistor (however, thermal noise always exists in the resistor and is unaffected by any direct current as long as the temperature remains constant). Consequently, carbon resistors can be used if required as external elements in low-noise, low-frequency integrated circuits as long as they carry no direct current. If the external resistors for such circuits must carry direct current, however, metal film resistors that have no flicker noise should be used.

In earlier sections of this chapter, we saw that shot and thermal noise signals have welldefined mean-square values that can be expressed in terms of current flow, resistance, and a
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_9972cfe7f689622347f7g-041.jpg?height=496&width=823&top_left_y=1782&top_left_x=265)

Figure 11.8 Flicker noise spectral density versus frequency.
number of well-known physical constants. By contrast, the mean-square value of a flicker noise signal as given by (11.7) contains an unknown constant $K_{1}$. This constant not only varies by orders of magnitude from one device type to the next, but it can also vary widely for different transistors or integrated circuits from the same process wafer. This is due to the dependence of flicker noise on contamination and crystal imperfections, which are factors that can vary randomly even on the same silicon wafer. However, experiments have shown that if a typical value of $K_{1}$ is determined from measurements on a number of devices from a given process, then this value can be used to predict average or typical flicker noise performance for integrated circuits from that process. ${ }^{9}$

The final characteristic of flicker noise that is of interest is its amplitude distribution, which is often non-Gaussian, as measurements have shown.

### 11.2.4 Burst Noise ${ }^{7}$ (Popcorn Noise)

This is another type of low-frequency noise found in some integrated circuits and discrete transistors. The source of this noise is not fully understood, although it has been shown to be related to the presence of heavy-metal ion contamination. Gold-doped devices show very high levels of burst noise.

Burst noise is so named because an oscilloscope trace of this type of noise shows bursts of noise on a number (two or more) of discrete levels, as illustrated in Fig. 11.9a. The repetition rate of the noise pulses is usually in the audio frequency range (a few kilohertz or less) and produces a popping sound when played through a loudspeaker. This has led to the name popcorn noise for this phenomenon.

Figure 11.10 Spectral density of combined multiple burst noise sources and flicker noise.

The spectral density of burst noise can be shown to be of the form

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overline{i^{2}}=K_{2} \frac{I^{c}}{1+\left(\frac{f}{f_{c}}\right)^{2}} \Delta f \tag{11.8}
\end{equation*}
$$

where
$K_{2}=$ constant for a particular device
$I=$ direct current
$c=$ constant in the range 0.5 to 2
$f_{c}=$ particular frequency for a given noise process
This spectrum is plotted in Fig. $11.9 b$ and illustrates the typical hump that is characteristic of burst noise. At higher frequencies the noise spectrum falls as $1 / f^{2}$.

Burst noise processes often occur with multiple time constants, and this gives rise to multiple humps in the spectrum. Also, flicker noise is invariably present as well so that the composite low-frequency noise spectrum often appears as in Fig. 11.10. As with flicker noise, factor $K_{2}$ for burst noise varies considerably and must be determined experimentally. The amplitude distribution of the noise is also non-Gaussian.

### 11.2.5 Avalanche Noise ${ }^{10}$

This is a form of noise produced by Zener or avalanche breakdown in a pn junction. In avalanche breakdown, holes and electrons in the depletion region of a reverse-biased pn junction acquire sufficient energy to create hole-electron pairs by colliding with silicon atoms. This process is cumulative, resulting in the production of a random series of large noise spikes. The noise is always associated with a direct-current flow, and the noise produced is much greater than shot noise in the same current, as given by (11.2). This is because a single carrier can start an avalanching process that results in the production of a current burst containing many carriers moving together. The total noise is the sum of a number of random bursts of this type.

The most common situation where avalanche noise is a problem occurs when Zener diodes are used in the circuit. These devices display avalanche noise and are generally avoided in low-noise circuits. If Zener diodes are present, the noise representation of Fig. 11.11 can be used, where the noise is represented by a series voltage generator $v^{2}$. The dc voltage $V_{z}$ is the breakdown voltage of the diode, and the series resistance $R$ is typically 10 to $100 \Omega$. The
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_9972cfe7f689622347f7g-044.jpg?height=513&width=1229&top_left_y=175&top_left_x=253)
magnitude of $\overline{v^{2}}$ is difficult to predict as it depends on the device structure and the uniformity of the silicon crystal, but a typical measured value is $\overline{v^{2}} / \Delta f \simeq 10^{-14} \mathrm{~V}^{2} / \mathrm{Hz}$ at a dc Zener current of 0.5 mA . Note that this is equivalent to the thermal noise voltage in a $600-\mathrm{k} \Omega$ resistor and completely overwhelms thermal noise in $R$. The spectral density of the noise is approximately flat, but the amplitude distribution is generally non-Gaussian.

## 11.3 Noise Models of Integrated-Circuit Components

In the above sections, the various physical sources of noise in electronic circuits were described. In this section, these sources of noise are brought together to form the small-signal equivalent circuits including noise for diodes and for bipolar and MOS transistors.

### 11.3.1 Junction Diode

The equivalent circuit for a forward-biased junction diode was considered briefly in the consideration of shot noise. The basic equivalent circuit of Fig. 11.4 can be made complete by adding series resistance $r_{s}$ as shown in Fig. 11.12. Since $r_{s}$ is a physical resistor due to the resistivity of the silicon, it exhibits thermal noise. Experimentally it has been found that any flicker noise present can be represented by a current generator in shunt with $r_{d}$, and can be
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_9972cfe7f689622347f7g-044.jpg?height=746&width=668&top_left_y=1583&top_left_x=259)

conveniently combined with the shot-noise generator as indicated by (11.10) to give

$$
\begin{align*}
& \overline{v_{s}^{2}}=4 k T r_{s} \Delta f  \tag{11.9}\\
& \overline{i^{2}}=2 q I_{D} \Delta f+K \frac{I_{D}^{a}}{f} \Delta f \tag{11.10}
\end{align*}
$$

### 11.3.2 Bipolar Transistor ${ }^{11}$

In a bipolar transistor in the forward-active region, minority carriers diffuse and drift across the base region to be collected at the collector-base junction. Minority carriers entering the collector-base depletion region are accelerated by the field existing there and swept across this region to the collector. The time of arrival at the collector-base junction of the diffusing (or drifting) carriers can be modeled as a random process, and thus the transistor collector current consists of a series of random current pulses. Consequently, collector current $I_{C}$ shows full shot noise as given by (11.2), and this is represented by a shot noise current generator $\bar{i}_{c}^{2}$ from collector to emitter as shown in the equivalent circuit of Fig. 11.13.

Base current $I_{B}$ in a transistor is due to recombination in the base and base-emitter depletion regions and also to carrier injection from the base into the emitter. All of these are independent random processes, and thus $I_{B}$ also shows full shot noise. This is represented by shot noise current generator $\overline{i_{b}^{2}}$ in Fig. 11.13.

Transistor base resistor $r_{b}$ is a physical resistor and thus has thermal noise. Collector series resistor $r_{c}$ also shows thermal noise, but since this is in series with the high-impedance collector node, this noise is negligible and is usually not included in the model. Note that resistors $r_{\pi}$ and $r_{o}$ in the model are fictitious resistors that are used for modeling purposes only, and they do not exhibit thermal noise.

Flicker noise and burst noise in a bipolar transistor have been found experimentally to be represented by current generators across the internal base-emitter junction. These are conveniently combined with the shot noise generator in $\overline{i_{b}^{2}}$. Avalanche noise in bipolar transistors is found to be negligible if $V_{C E}$ is kept at least 5 V below the breakdown voltage $B V_{C E O}$, and this source of noise will be neglected in subsequent calculations.

The full small-signal equivalent circuit including noise for the bipolar transistor is shown in Fig. 11.13. Since they arise from separate, independent physical mechanisms, all the noise sources are independent of each other and have mean-square values:

$$
\begin{align*}
& \overline{v_{b}^{2}}=4 k T r_{b} \Delta f  \tag{11.11}\\
& \overline{i_{c}^{2}}=2 q I_{C} \Delta f \tag{11.12}
\end{align*}
$$

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overline{i_{b}^{2}}=\underbrace{2 q I_{B} \Delta f}_{\text {Shot noise }}+\underbrace{K_{1} \frac{I_{B}^{a}}{f} \Delta f}_{\text {Flicker noise }}+K_{2} \frac{I_{B}^{c}}{\underbrace{1+\left(\frac{f}{f_{c}}\right)^{2}}_{\text {Burst noise }}} \Delta f \tag{11.13}
\end{equation*}
$$

Figure 11.14 Spectral density of the base-current noise generator in a bipolar transistor.

This equivalent circuit is valid for both $n p n$ and $p n p$ transistors. For $p n p$ devices, the magnitudes of $I_{B}$ and $I_{C}$ are used in the above equations.

The base-current noise spectrum can be plotted using (11.13), and this has been done in Fig. 11.14, where burst noise has been neglected for simplicity. The shot noise and flicker noise asymptotes meet at a frequency $f_{a}$, which is called the flicker noise corner frequency. In some transistors using careful processing, $f_{a}$ can be as low as 100 Hz . In other transistors, $f_{a}$ can be as high as 10 MHz .

### 11.3.3 MOS Transistor ${ }^{12}$

The structure of MOS transistors was described in Chapter 1. We showed there that the resistive channel under the gate is modulated by the gate-source voltage so that the drain current is controlled by the gate-source voltage. Since the channel material is resistive, it exhibits thermal noise, which is a major source of noise in MOS transistors. This noise source can be represented by a noise-current generator $\overline{i_{d}^{2}}$ from drain to source in the small-signal equivalent circuit of Fig. 11.15.

Another source of noise in MOS transistors is flicker noise. Because MOS transistors conduct current near the surface of the silicon where surface states act as traps that capture and release current carriers, their flicker noise component can be large. Flicker noise in the MOS transistor is also found experimentally to be represented by a drain-source current
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_9972cfe7f689622347f7g-046.jpg?height=491&width=969&top_left_y=1816&top_left_x=275)

Figure 11.15

generator, and the flicker and thermal noise can be lumped into one noise generator $\overline{i_{d}^{2}}$ in Fig. 11.15 with

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overline{i_{d}^{2}}=\underbrace{4 k T\left(\frac{2}{3} g_{m}\right) \Delta f}_{\text {Thermal noise }}+\underbrace{K \frac{I_{D}^{a}}{f} \Delta f}_{\text {Flicker noise }} \tag{11.14}
\end{equation*}
$$

where
$I_{D}=$ drain bias current
$K=$ constant for a given device
$a=$ constant between 0.5 and 2
$g_{m}=$ device transconductance at the operating point
This equation is valid for long-channel devices. For channel lengths less than $1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$, thermal noise 2 to 5 times larger than given by the first term in (11.14) has been measured. ${ }^{13}$ This increase in thermal noise may be attributed to hot electrons in short-channel devices.

Another source of noise in the MOS transistor is shot noise generated by the gate leakage current. This noise can be represented by $\overline{i_{g}^{2}}$ in Fig. 11.15, with

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overline{i_{g}^{2}}=2 q I_{G} \Delta f \tag{11.15}
\end{equation*}
$$

This noise current is usually very small since the dc gate current $I_{G}$ is typically less than $10^{-15}$ A. The noise terms in (11.14) and (11.15) are all independent of each other.

There is one other component of noise that is usually insignificant at low frequencies but important in very high-frequency MOS circuits, such as radio-frequency amplifiers, for example. At an arbitrary point in the channel, the gate-to-channel voltage has a random component due to fluctuations along the channel caused by thermal noise. These voltage variations generate a noisy ac gate current $i_{g}$ due to the capacitance between the gate and channel. The mean-squared value of this gate current for a long-channel device in the active region is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overline{i_{g}^{2}}=\frac{16}{15} k T \omega^{2} C_{g s}^{2} \Delta f \tag{11.16}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $C_{g s}=(2 / 3) C_{o x} W L$. The gate-current noise in (11.16) is correlated with the thermalnoise term in (11.14) because both noise currents stem from thermal fluctuations in the channel. The magnitude of the correlation between these currents is $0.39 .{ }^{12}$ For channel lengths less than $1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$, this component of gate-current noise may be larger than given by (11.16) if thermal noise associated with the channel increases due to hot electrons as noted above. ${ }^{14}$ The total gate-current noise is the sum of the terms in (11.15) and (11.16).

### 11.3.4 Resistors

Monolithic and thin-film resistors display thermal noise as given by (11.4) and (11.5), and the circuit representation of this is shown in Fig. 11.7. As mentioned in Section 11.2.3, discrete carbon resistors also display flicker noise, and this should be considered if such resistors are used as external components to the integrated circuit.

### 11.3.5 Capacitors and Inductors

Capacitors are common elements in integrated circuits, either as unwanted parasitics or as elements introduced for a specific purpose. Inductors are sometimes realized on the silicon die in integrated high-frequency communication circuits. There are no sources of noise in
ideal capacitors or inductors. In practice, real components have parasitic resistance that does display noise as given by the thermal noise formulas of (11.4) and (11.5). In the case of integrated-circuit capacitors, the parasitic resistance usually consists of a small value in series with the capacitor. Parasitic resistance in inductors can be modeled by either series or shunt elements.

## 11.4 Circuit Noise Calculations ${ }^{15,16}$

The device equivalent circuits including noise that were derived in Section 11.3 can be used for the calculation of circuit noise performance. First, however, methods of circuit calculation with noise generators as sources must be established, and attention is now given to this problem.

Consider a noise current source with mean-square value

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overline{i^{2}}=S(f) \Delta f \tag{11.17}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $S(f)$ is the noise spectral density. The value of $S(f)$ is plotted versus frequency in Fig. 11.16 $a$ for an arbitrary noise generator. In a small bandwidth $\Delta f$, the mean-square value of the noise current is given by (11.17), and the rms values can be written as

$$
\begin{equation*}
i=\sqrt{S(f) \Delta f} \tag{11.18}
\end{equation*}
$$

The noise current in bandwidth $\Delta f$ can be represented approximately ${ }^{15}$ by a sinusoidal current generator with rms value $i$ as shown in Fig. 11.16b. If the noise current in bandwidth $\Delta f$ is now applied as an input signal to a circuit, its effect can be calculated by substituting the sinusoidal generator and performing circuit analysis in the usual fashion. When the circuit response to the sinusoid is calculated, the mean-square value of the output sinusoid gives the mean-square value of the output noise in bandwidth $\Delta f$. Thus network noise calculations reduce to familiar sinusoidal circuit-analysis calculations. The only difference occurs when multiple noise sources are applied, as is usually the case in practical circuits. Each noise source is then represented by a separate sinusoidal generator, and the output contribution of each one is separately calculated. The total output noise in bandwidth $\Delta f$ is calculated as a mean-square value by adding the individual mean-square contributions from each output sinusoid. This

Figure 11.17Circuit for the calculation of the total noise $\overline{v_{T}^{2}}$ produced by two resistors in series.
depends, however, on the original noise sources being independent, as will be shown below. This requirement is usually satisfied if the equivalent noise circuits derived in previous sections are used, as all the noise sources except the induced gate noise in (11.16) arise from separate mechanisms and are thus independent.

For example, consider two resistors $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ connected in series as shown in Fig. 11.17. Resistors $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ have respective noise generators

$$
\begin{align*}
& \overline{v_{1}^{2}}=4 k T R_{1} \Delta f  \tag{11.19a}\\
& \overline{v_{2}^{2}}=4 k T R_{2} \Delta f \tag{11.19b}
\end{align*}
$$

In order to calculate the mean-square noise voltage $\overline{v_{T}^{2}}$ produced by the two resistors in series, let $v_{T}(t)$ be the instantaneous value of the total noise voltage and $v_{1}(t)$ and $v_{2}(t)$ the instantaneous values of the individual generators. Then

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{T}(t)=v_{1}(t)+v_{2}(t) \tag{11.20}
\end{equation*}
$$

and thus

$$
\begin{align*}
\overline{v_{T}(t)^{2}} & =\overline{\left[v_{1}(t)+v_{2}(t)\right]^{2}} \\
& =\overline{v_{1}(t)^{2}}+\overline{v_{2}(t)^{2}}+\overline{2 v_{1}(t) v_{2}(t)} \tag{11.21}
\end{align*}
$$

Now, since noise generators $v_{1}(t)$ and $v_{2}(t)$ arise from separate resistors, they must be independent. Thus the average value of their product $\overline{v_{1}(t) v_{2}(t)}$ will be zero and (11.21) becomes

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overline{v_{T}^{2}}=\overline{v_{1}^{2}}+\overline{v_{2}^{2}} \tag{11.22}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus the mean-square value of the sum of a number of independent noise generators is the sum of the individual mean-square values. Substituting (11.19a) and (11.19b) in (11.22) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overline{v_{T}^{2}}=4 k T\left(R_{1}+R_{2}\right) \Delta f \tag{11.23}
\end{equation*}
$$

Equation 11.23 is just the value that would be predicted for thermal noise in a resistor $\left(R_{1}+R_{2}\right)$ using (11.4), and thus the results are consistent. These results are also consistent with the representation of the noise generators by independent sinusoids as described earlier. It is easily shown that when two or more such generators are connected in series, the mean-square value of the total voltage is equal to the sum of the individual mean-square values.

In the above calculation, two noise voltage sources were considered connected in series. It can be similarly shown that an analogous result is true for independent noise current sources connected in parallel. The mean-square value of the combination is the sum of the individual mean-square values. This result was assumed in the modeling of Section 11.3 where, for example, three independent noise-current generators (shot, flicker, and burst) were combined into a single base-emitter noise source for a bipolar transistor.

### 11.4.1 Bipolar Transistor Noise Performance

As an example of the manipulation of noise generators in circuit calculations, consider the noise performance of the simple transistor stage with the ac schematic shown in Fig. 11.18a. The small-signal equivalent circuit including noise is shown in Fig. 11.18b. (It should be pointed out that, for noise calculations, the equivalent circuit analyzed must be the actual circuit configuration used. That is, Fig. $11.18 a$ cannot be used as a half-circuit representation of a differential pair for the purposes of noise calculation because noise sources in each half of a differential pair affect the total output noise.)

In the equivalent circuit of Fig. 11.18b, the external input signal $v_{i}$ has been ignored so that output signal $v_{o}$ is due to noise generators only. $C_{\mu}$ is assumed small and is neglected. Output resistance $r_{o}$ is also neglected. The transistor noise generators are as described previously and in addition

$$
\begin{align*}
& \overline{v_{s}^{2}}=4 k T R_{S} \Delta f  \tag{11.24}\\
& \overline{i_{l}^{2}}=4 k T \frac{1}{R_{L}} \Delta f \tag{11.25}
\end{align*}
$$

The total output noise can be calculated by considering each noise source in turn and performing the calculation as if each noise source were a sinusoid with rms value equal to that of the noise source being considered. Consider first the noise generator $v_{s}$ due to $R_{S}$. Then

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{1}=\frac{Z}{Z+r_{b}+R_{S}} v_{s} \tag{11.26}
\end{equation*}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_9972cfe7f689622347f7g-050.jpg?height=698&width=906&top_left_y=1482&top_left_x=618)

where

$$
\begin{equation*}
Z=r_{\pi} \| \frac{1}{j \omega C_{\pi}} \tag{11.27}
\end{equation*}
$$

The output noise voltage due to $v_{s}$ is

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{o 1}=-g_{m} R_{L} v_{1} \tag{11.28}
\end{equation*}
$$

Use of (11.26) in (11.28) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{o 1}=-g_{m} R_{L} \frac{Z}{Z+r_{b}+R_{S}} v_{s} \tag{11.29}
\end{equation*}
$$

The phase information contained in (11.29) is irrelevant because the noise signal has random phase and the only quantity of interest is the mean-square value of the output voltage produced by $v_{s}$. From (11.29) this is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overline{v_{o 1}^{2}}=g_{m}^{2} R_{L}^{2} \frac{|Z|^{2}}{\left|Z+r_{b}+R_{S}\right|^{2}} \overline{v_{s}^{2}} \tag{11.30}
\end{equation*}
$$

By similar calculations it is readily shown that the noise voltage produced at the output by $\overline{v_{b}^{2}}$ and $\overline{i_{b}^{2}}$ is

$$
\begin{align*}
& \overline{v_{o 2}^{2}}=g_{m}^{2} R_{L}^{2} \frac{|Z|^{2}}{\left|Z+r_{b}+R_{S}\right|^{2}} \overline{v_{b}^{2}}  \tag{11.31}\\
& \overline{v_{o 3}^{2}}=g_{m}^{2} R_{L}^{2} \frac{\left(R_{S}+r_{b}\right)^{2}|Z|^{2}}{\left|Z+r_{b}+R_{S}\right|^{2}} i_{b}^{2} \tag{11.32}
\end{align*}
$$

Noise at the output due to $\overline{i_{l}^{2}}$ and $\overline{i_{c}^{2}}$ is

$$
\begin{align*}
& \overline{v_{o 4}^{2}}=\overline{i_{l}^{2}} R_{L}^{2}  \tag{11.33}\\
& \overline{v_{o 5}^{2}}=\overline{i_{c}^{2}} R_{L}^{2} \tag{11.34}
\end{align*}
$$

Since all five noise generators are independent, the total output noise is

$$
\begin{align*}
\overline{v_{o}^{2}}= & \sum_{n=1}^{5} \overline{v_{o n}^{2}}  \tag{11.35}\\
= & g_{m}^{2} R_{L}^{2} \frac{|Z|^{2}}{\left|Z+r_{b}+R_{S}\right|^{2}}\left[\overline{v_{s}^{2}}+\overline{v_{b}^{2}}+\left(R_{S}+r_{b}\right)^{2} \overline{i_{b}^{2}}\right]  \tag{11.36}\\
& \left.+R_{L}^{2} \overline{\left(\overline{i_{l}^{2}}\right.}+\overline{i_{c}^{2}}\right)
\end{align*}
$$

Substituting expressions for the noise generators we obtain

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\overline{v_{o}^{2}}}{\Delta f}= & g_{m}^{2} R_{L}^{2} \frac{|Z|^{2}}{\left|Z+r_{b}+R_{S}\right|^{2}}\left[4 k T\left(R_{S}+r_{b}\right)+\left(R_{S}+r_{b}\right)^{2} 2 q I_{B}\right] \\
& +R_{L}^{2}\left(4 k T \frac{1}{R_{L}}+2 q I_{C}\right) \tag{11.37}
\end{align*}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_9972cfe7f689622347f7g-052.jpg?height=530&width=1165&top_left_y=198&top_left_x=339)

Figure 11.19 Noise voltage spectrum at the output of the circuit of Fig. 11.18.
where flicker noise has been assumed small and neglected. Substituting for $Z$ from (11.27) in (11.37) we find

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\overline{v_{o}^{2}}}{\Delta f}= & g_{m}^{2} R_{L}^{2} \frac{r_{\pi}^{2}}{\left(r_{\pi}+R_{S}+r_{b}\right)^{2}} \frac{1}{1+\left(\frac{f}{f_{1}}\right)^{2}}\left[4 k T\left(R_{S}+r_{b}\right)+\left(R_{S}+r_{b}\right)^{2} 2 q I_{B}\right] \\
& +R_{L}^{2}\left(4 k T \frac{1}{R_{L}}+2 q I_{C}\right) \tag{11.38}
\end{align*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{equation*}
f_{1}=\frac{1}{2 \pi\left[r_{\pi} \|\left(R_{S}+r_{b}\right)\right] C_{\pi}} \tag{11.39}
\end{equation*}
$$

The output noise-voltage spectral density represented by (11.38) has a frequencydependent part and a constant part. The frequency dependence arises because the gain of the stage begins to fall above frequency $f_{1}$, and noise due to generators $\overline{v_{s}^{2}}, \overline{v_{b}^{2}}$, and $\overline{i_{b}^{2}}$, which appears amplified in the output, also begins to fall. The constant term in (11.38) is due to noise generators $\overline{i_{l}^{2}}$ and $\overline{i_{c}^{2}}$. Note that this noise contribution would also be frequency dependent if the effect of $C_{\mu}$ had not been neglected. The noise-voltage spectral density represented by (11.38) has the form shown in Fig. 11.19.

#### EXAMPLE

In order to give an appreciation of the numbers involved, specific values will now be assigned to the parameters of (11.38), and the various terms in the equation will be evaluated. Assume that

$$
\begin{array}{lrr}
I_{C}=100 \mu \mathrm{~A} & \beta=100 & r_{b}=200 \Omega \\
R_{S}=500 \Omega & C_{\pi}=10 \mathrm{pF} & \\
R_{L}=5 \mathrm{k} \Omega & &
\end{array}
$$

Substituting these values in (11.38) and using $4 k T=1.66 \times 10^{-20} \mathrm{~V}$-C gives

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\overline{v_{o}^{2}}}{\Delta f} & =\left[5.82 \times 10^{-18} \frac{1}{1+\left(\frac{f}{f_{1}}\right)^{2}}(700+9.4)+1.66 \times 10^{-20}(5000+48,080)\right] \mathrm{V}^{2} / \mathrm{Hz} \\
& =\left[\frac{4.13 \times 10^{-15}}{1+\left(\frac{f}{f_{1}}\right)^{2}}+0.88 \times 10^{-15}\right] \mathrm{V}^{2} / \mathrm{Hz} \tag{11.40}
\end{align*}
$$

Equation 11.39 gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
f_{1}=23.3 \mathrm{MHz} \tag{11.41}
\end{equation*}
$$

Equation 11.40 shows the output noise-voltage spectral density is $5.0 \times 10^{-15} \mathrm{~V}^{2} / \mathrm{Hz}$ at low frequencies, and it approaches $0.88 \times 10^{-15} \mathrm{~V}^{2} / \mathrm{Hz}$ at high frequencies. The major contributor to the output noise in this case is the source resistance $R_{S}$, followed by the base resistance of the transistor. The noise spectrum given by (11.40) is plotted in Fig. 11.19.

#### EXAMPLE

Suppose the amplifier in the above example is followed by later stages that limit the bandwidth to a sharp cutoff at 1 MHz . Since the noise spectrum as shown in Fig. 11.19 does not begin to fall significantly until $f_{1}=23.3 \mathrm{MHz}$, the noise spectrum may be assumed constant at $5.0 \times 10^{-15} \mathrm{~V}^{2} / \mathrm{Hz}$ over the bandwidth 0 to 1 MHz . Thus the total noise voltage at the output of the circuit of Fig. 11.18a in a 1-MHz bandwidth is

$$
\overline{v_{o T}^{2}}=5.0 \times 10^{-15} \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~V}^{2}=5.0 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{~V}^{2}
$$

and thus

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{o T}=71 \mu \mathrm{~V} \mathrm{rms} \tag{11.42}
\end{equation*}
$$

Now suppose that the amplifier of Fig. $11.18 a$ is not followed by later stages that limit the bandwidth but is fed directly to a wideband detector (this could be an oscilloscope or a voltmeter). In order to find the total output noise voltage in this case, the contribution from each frequency increment $\Delta f$ must be summed at the output. This reduces to integration across the bandwidth of the detector of the noise-voltage spectral-density curve of Fig. 11.19. For example, if the detector had a 0 to $50-\mathrm{MHz}$ bandwidth with a sharp cutoff, then the total output noise would be

$$
\begin{align*}
\overline{v_{o T}^{2}} & =\sum_{f=0}^{50 \times 10^{6}} S_{o}(f) \Delta f \\
& =\int_{0}^{50 \times 10^{6}} S_{o}(f) d f \tag{11.43}
\end{align*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{equation*}
S_{o}(f)=\frac{\overline{v_{o}^{2}}}{\Delta f} \tag{11.44}
\end{equation*}
$$

is the noise spectral density defined by (11.40). In practice, the exact evaluation of such integrals is often difficult and approximate methods are often used. Note that if the integration of (11.43) is done graphically, the noise spectral density versus frequency must be plotted on linear scales.

### 11.4.2 Equivalent Input Noise and the Minimum Detectable Signal

In the previous section, the output noise produced by the circuit of Fig. 11.18 was calculated. The significance of the noise performance of a circuit is, however, the limitation it places on the smallest input signals the circuit can handle before the noise degrades the quality of the output signal. For this reason, the noise performance is usually expressed in terms of an equivalent input noise signal, which gives the same output noise as the circuit under consideration. In this way, the equivalent input noise can be compared directly with incoming signals and the effect of the noise on those signals is easily determined. For this purpose, the circuit of Fig. 11.18 can be represented as shown in Fig. 11.20, where $\overline{v_{i N}^{2}}$ is an input noise-voltage generator that produces the same output noise as all of the original noise generators. All other sources of noise in Fig. 11.20 are considered removed. Using the same equivalent circuit as in Fig. $11.18 b$, we obtain, for the output noise from Fig. 11.20,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overline{v_{o}^{2}}=g_{m}^{2} R_{L}^{2} \frac{|Z|^{2}}{\left|Z+r_{b}+R_{S}\right|^{2}} \overline{v_{i N}^{2}} \tag{11.45}
\end{equation*}
$$

If this noise expression is equated to $\overline{v_{o}^{2}}$ from (11.37), the equivalent input noise voltage for the circuit can be calculated as

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\overline{v_{i N}^{2}}}{\Delta f} & 4 k T\left(R_{S}+r_{b}\right)+\left(R_{S}+r_{b}\right)^{2} 2 q I_{B} \\
& +\frac{1}{g_{m}^{2} R_{L}^{2}} \frac{\left|Z+r_{b}+R_{S}\right|^{2}}{|Z|^{2}} R_{L}^{2}\left(4 k T \frac{1}{R_{L}}+2 q I_{C}\right) \tag{11.46}
\end{align*}
$$

Note that the noise-voltage spectral density given by (11.46) rises at high frequencies because of the variation of $|Z|$ with frequency. This is due to the fact that as the gain of the device falls with frequency, output noise generators $\overline{i_{c}^{2}}$ and $\overline{i_{l}^{2}}$ have a larger effect when referred back to the input.

Figure 11.20 Representation of circuit noise performance by an equivalent input noise voltage.

#### EXAMPLE

Calculate the total input noise voltage $\overline{v_{i N T}^{2}}$ for the circuit of Fig. 11.18 in a bandwidth of 0 to 1 MHz .

This could be calculated using (11.46), derived above. Alternatively, since the total output noise voltage $v_{o T}^{2}$ has already been calculated, this can be used to calculate $\overline{v_{i N T}^{2}}$ (in a $1-\mathrm{MHz}$ bandwidth) by dividing by the circuit voltage gain squared. If $A_{v}$ is the low-frequency, small-signal voltage gain of Fig. 11.18, then

$$
A_{v}=\frac{r_{\pi}}{r_{b}+r_{\pi}+R_{S}} g_{m} R_{L}
$$

Use of the previously specified data for this circuit gives

$$
A_{v}=\frac{26,000}{200+26,000+500} \frac{5000}{260}=18.7
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_9972cfe7f689622347f7g-055.jpg?height=55&width=1305&top_left_y=784&top_left_x=257) $\overline{v_{i N T}^{2}}$ as

$$
\overline{v_{i N T}^{2}}=\frac{\overline{v_{o T}^{2}}}{A_{v}^{2}}=\frac{5 \times 10^{-9}}{18.7^{2}} \mathrm{~V}^{2}=14.3 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{~V}^{2}
$$

Thus we have

$$
v_{i N T}=3.78 \mu \mathrm{~V} \mathrm{rms}
$$

The above example shows that in a bandwidth of 0 to 1 MHz , the noise in the circuit appears to come from a $3.78-\mu \mathrm{V}$ rms noise-voltage source in series with the input. This noise voltage can be used to estimate the smallest signal that the circuit can effectively amplify, sometimes called the minimum detectable signal (MDS). This depends strongly on the nature of the signal and the application. If no special filtering or coding techniques are used, the MDS
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_9972cfe7f689622347f7g-055.jpg?height=714&width=1101&top_left_y=1447&top_left_x=371)

Figure 11.21 Output voltage waveform of the circuit of Fig. 11.18 with a $3.78-\mu \mathrm{V} \mathrm{rms}$ sinewave applied at the input. The circuit bandwidth is limited to 1 MHz , which gives an equivalent input noise voltage of $3.78 \mu \mathrm{~V} \mathrm{rms}$.
can be taken as equal to the equivalent input noise voltage in the passband of the amplifier. Thus, in this case

$$
\mathrm{MDS}=3.78 \mu \mathrm{~V} \mathrm{rms}
$$

If a sinewave of magnitude $3.78 \mu \mathrm{~V}$ rms were applied to this circuit, and the output in a 1-MHz bandwidth examined on an oscilloscope, the sine wave would be barely detectable in the noise, as shown in Fig. 11.21. The noise waveform in this figure is typical of that produced by shot and thermal noise.

## 11.5 Equivalent Input Noise Generators ${ }^{17}$

In the previous section, the equivalent input noise voltage for a particular configuration was calculated. This gave rise to an expression for an equivalent input noise-voltage generator that was dependent on the source resistance $R_{S}$, as well as the transistor parameters. This method is now extended to a more general and more useful representation in which the noise performance of any two-port network is represented by two equivalent input noise generators. The situation is shown in Fig. 11.22, where a two-port network containing noise generators is represented by the same network with internal noise sources removed (the noiseless network) and with a noise voltage $\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$ and current generator $\overline{i_{i}^{2}}$ connected at the input. It can be shown that this representation is valid for any source impedance, provided that correlation between the two noise generators is considered. That is, the two noise generators are not independent in general because they are both dependent on the same set of original noise sources.

The inclusion of correlation in the noise representation results in a considerable increase in the complexity of the calculations, and if correlation is important, it is often easier to return to the original network with internal noise sources to perform the calculations. However, in a larger number of practical circuits, the correlation is small and may be neglected. In addition, if either equivalent input generator $\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$ or $\overline{i_{i}^{2}}$ dominates, the correlation may be neglected in any case. The use of this method of representation is then extremely useful, as will become apparent.

The need for both an equivalent input noise voltage generator and an equivalent input noise current generator to represent the noise performance of the circuit for any source resistance can be appreciated as follows. Consider the extreme case of source resistance $R_{S}$ equal to zero or infinity. If $R_{S}=0, \overline{i_{i}^{2}}$ in Fig. 11.22 is shorted out, and since the original circuit will still show output noise in general, we need an equivalent input noise voltage $\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$ to represent this behavior. Similarly, if $R_{S} \rightarrow \infty, \overline{v_{i}^{2}}$ in Fig. 11.22 cannot produce output noise and $\overline{\bar{i}_{i}^{2}}$ represents the noise performance of the original noisy network. For finite values of $R_{S}$, both $\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$ and $\overline{i_{i}^{2}}$ contribute to the equivalent input noise of the circuit.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_9972cfe7f689622347f7g-056.jpg?height=219&width=1129&top_left_y=1974&top_left_x=357)

Figure 11.22 Representation of noise in a two-port network by equivalent input voltage and current generators.

The values of the equivalent input generators of Fig. 11.22 are readily determined. This is done by first short-circuiting the input of both circuits and equating the output noise in each case to calculate $\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$. The value of $\overline{i_{i}^{2}}$ is found by open-circuiting the input of each circuit and equating the output noise in each case. This will now be done for the bipolar transistor and the MOS transistor.

### 11.5.1 Bipolar Transistor Noise Generators

The equivalent input noise generators for a bipolar transistor can be calculated from the equivalent circuit of Fig. 11.23a. The output noise is calculated with a short-circuited load, and $C_{\mu}$ is neglected. This will be justified later. The circuit of Fig. $11.23 a$ is to be equivalent to that of Fig. $11.23 b$ in that each circuit should give the same output noise for any source impedance.

The value of $\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$ can be calculated by short-circuiting the input of each circuit and equating the output noise $i_{o}$. We use rms noise quantities in the calculations, but make no attempt to preserve the signs of the noise quantities as the noise generators are all independent and have random phase. The polarity of the noise generators does not affect the answer. Short-circuiting the inputs of both circuits in Fig. 11.23, assuming that $r_{b}$ is small $\left(\ll r_{\pi}\right)$ and equating $i_{o}$, we obtain

$$
\begin{equation*}
g_{m} v_{b}+i_{c}=g_{m} v_{i} \tag{11.47}
\end{equation*}
$$

which gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{i}=v_{b}+\frac{i_{c}}{g_{m}} \tag{11.48}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since $r_{b}$ is small, the effect of $\overline{i_{b}^{2}}$ is neglected in this calculation.

Figure 11.23 (a) Bipolar transistor small-signal equivalent circuit with noise generators. (b) Representation of the noise performance of $(a)$ by equivalent input generators.

Using the fact that $v_{b}$ and $i_{c}$ are independent, we obtain, from (11.48),

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overline{v_{i}^{2}}=\overline{v_{b}^{2}}+\frac{\overline{i_{c}^{2}}}{g_{m}^{2}} \tag{11.49}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substituting in (11.49) for $\overline{v_{b}^{2}}$ and $\overline{i_{c}^{2}}$ from (11.11) and (11.12) gives

$$
\overline{v_{i}^{2}}=4 k \operatorname{Tr}_{b} \Delta f+\frac{2 q I_{C} \Delta f}{g_{m}^{2}}
$$

and thus

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\overline{v_{i}^{2}}}{\Delta f}=4 k T\left(r_{b}+\frac{1}{2 g_{m}}\right) \tag{11.50}
\end{equation*}
$$

The equivalent input noise-voltage spectral density of a bipolar transistor thus appears to come from a resistor $R_{\text {eq }}$ such that

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\overline{v_{i}^{2}}}{\Delta f}=4 k T R_{\mathrm{eq}} \tag{11.51}
\end{equation*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{\mathrm{eq}}=r_{b}+\frac{1}{2 g_{m}} \tag{11.52}
\end{equation*}
$$

and this is called the equivalent input noise resistance. Of this fictitious resistance, portion $r_{b}$ is, in fact, a physical resistor in series with the input, whereas portion $1 / 2 g_{m}$ represents the effect of collector current shot noise referred back to the input. Equations 11.50 and 11.52 are extremely useful approximations, although the assumption that $r_{b} \ll r_{\pi}$ may not be valid at high collector bias currents, and the calculation should be repeated without restrictions in those circumstances.

Equation 11.50 allows easy comparison of the relative importance of noise from $r_{b}$ and $I_{C}$ in contributing to $\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$. For example, if $I_{C}=1 \mu \mathrm{~A}$, then $1 / 2 g_{m}=13 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ and this will dominate typical $r_{b}$ values of about $100 \Omega$. Alternately, if $I_{C}=10 \mathrm{~mA}$, then $1 / 2 g_{m}=1.3 \Omega$ and noise from $r_{b}$ will totally dominate $\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$. Since $\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$ is the important noise generator for low source impedance (since $\overline{i_{i}^{2}}$ then tends to be shorted), it is apparent that good noise performance from a low source impedance requires minimization of $R_{\mathrm{eq}}$. This is achieved by designing the transistor to have a low $r_{b}$ and running the device at a large collector bias current to reduce $1 / 2 g_{m}$. Finally, it should be noted from (11.50) that the equivalent input noise-voltage spectral density of a bipolar transistor is independent of frequency.

In order to calculate the equivalent input noise current generator $\overline{i_{i}^{2}}$, the inputs of both circuits in Fig. 11.23 are open-circuited and output noise currents $i_{o}$ are equated. Using rms noise quantities, we obtain

$$
\begin{equation*}
\beta(j \omega) i_{i}=i_{c}+\beta(j \omega) i_{b} \tag{11.53}
\end{equation*}
$$

which gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
i_{i}=i_{b}+\frac{i_{c}}{\beta(j \omega)} \tag{11.54}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since $i_{b}$ and $i_{c}$ are independent generators, we obtain, from (11.54),

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overline{i_{i}^{2}}=\overline{i_{b}^{2}}+\frac{\overline{i_{c}^{2}}}{|\beta(j \omega)|^{2}} \tag{11.55}
\end{equation*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{equation*}
\beta(j \omega)=\frac{\beta_{0}}{1+j \frac{\omega}{\omega_{\beta}}} \tag{11.56}
\end{equation*}
$$

and $\beta_{0}$ is the low-frequency, small-signal current gain. [See (1.122) and (1.126)].
Substituting in (11.55) for $\overline{i_{b}^{2}}$ and $\overline{i_{c}^{2}}$ from (11.13) and (11.12) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\overline{i_{i}^{2}}}{\Delta f}=2 q\left[I_{B}+K_{1}^{\prime} \frac{I_{B}^{a}}{f}+\frac{I_{C}}{|\beta(j \omega)|^{2}}\right] \tag{11.57}
\end{equation*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{equation*}
K_{1}^{\prime}=\frac{K_{1}}{2 q} \tag{11.57a}
\end{equation*}
$$

and the burst noise term has been omitted for simplicity. The last term in parentheses in (11.57) is due to collector current noise referred to the input. At low frequencies this becomes $I_{C} / \beta_{0}^{2}$ and is negligible compared with $I_{B}$ for typical $\beta_{0}$ values. When this is true, $\overline{i_{i}^{2}}$ and $\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$ do not contain common noise sources and are totally independent. At high frequencies, however, the last term in (11.57) increases and can become dominant, and correlation between $\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$ and $\overline{i_{i}^{2}}$ may then be important since both contain a contribution from $\overline{i_{c}^{2}}$.

The equivalent input noise current spectral density given by (11.57) appears to come from a current $I_{\text {eq }}$ showing full shot noise, such that

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\overline{i_{i}^{2}}}{\Delta f}=2 q I_{\mathrm{eq}} \tag{11.58}
\end{equation*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{\mathrm{eq}}=I_{B}+K_{1}^{\prime} \frac{I_{B}^{a}}{f}+\frac{I_{C}}{|\beta(j \omega)|^{2}} \tag{11.59}
\end{equation*}
$$

and this is called the equivalent input shot noise current. This is a fictitious current composed of the base current of the device plus a term representing flicker noise and one representing collector-current noise transformed to the input. It is apparent from (11.59) that $I_{\text {eq }}$ is minimized by utilizing low bias currents in the transistor, and also using high- $\beta$ transistors. Since $\overline{i_{i}^{2}}$ is the dominant equivalent input noise generator in circuits where the transistor is fed from a high source impedance, low bias currents and high $\beta$ are obviously required for good noise performance under these conditions. Note that the requirement for low bias currents to minimize $\overline{i_{i}^{2}}$ conflicts with the requirement for high bias current to minimize $\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$.

Spectral density $\overline{i_{i}^{2}} / \Delta f$ of the equivalent input noise current generator can be plotted as a function of frequency using (11.57). This is shown in Fig. 11.24 for typical transistor parameters. In this case, the spectral density is frequency dependent at both low and high frequencies, the low-frequency rise being due to flicker noise and the high-frequency rise being due to collector-current noise referred to the input. This input-referred noise rises at high frequencies because the transistor current gain begins to fall, and this is the reason for degradation in transistor noise performance observed at high frequencies.

Frequency $f_{b}$ in Fig. 11.24 is the point where the high-frequency noise asymptote intersects the midband asymptote. This can be calculated from (11.57) as follows:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\beta(j f)=\frac{\beta_{0}}{1+j \frac{f}{f_{T}} \beta_{0}} \tag{11.60}
\end{equation*}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_9972cfe7f689622347f7g-060.jpg?height=714&width=1077&top_left_y=212&top_left_x=378)

Figure 11.24 Equivalent input noise current spectral density of a bipolar transistor with $I_{C}=100 \mu \mathrm{~A}, \beta_{0}=\beta_{F}=100, f_{T}=500 \mathrm{MHz}$. Typical flicker noise is included.
where $\beta_{0}$ is the low-frequency, small-signal current gain. Thus the collector current noise term in (11.57) is

$$
\begin{equation*}
2 q \frac{I_{C}}{|\beta(j f)|^{2}}=2 q \frac{I_{C}}{\beta_{0}^{2}}\left(1+\frac{f^{2}}{f_{T}^{2}} \beta_{0}^{2}\right) \simeq 2 q I_{C} \frac{f^{2}}{f_{T}^{2}} \tag{11.61}
\end{equation*}
$$

at high frequencies. Equation 11.61 shows that the equivalent input noise current spectrum rises as $f^{2}$ at high frequencies. Frequency $f_{b}$ can be calculated by equating (11.61) to the midband noise, which is $2 q\left[I_{B}+\left(I_{C} / \beta_{0}^{2}\right)\right]$. For typical values of $\beta_{0}$, this is approximately $2 q I_{B}$, and equating this quantity to (11.61) we obtain

$$
2 q I_{B}=2 q I_{C} \frac{f_{b}^{2}}{f_{T}^{2}}
$$

and thus

$$
\begin{equation*}
f_{b}=f_{T} \sqrt{\frac{I_{B}}{I_{C}}} \tag{11.62}
\end{equation*}
$$

The large-signal (or dc) current gain is defined as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\beta_{F}=\frac{I_{C}}{I_{B}} \tag{11.63}
\end{equation*}
$$

and thus (11.62) becomes

$$
\begin{equation*}
f_{b}=\frac{f_{T}}{\sqrt{\beta_{F}}} \tag{11.64}
\end{equation*}
$$

Using the data given in Fig. 11.24, we obtain $f_{b}=50 \mathrm{MHz}$ for that example.
Once the above input noise generators have been calculated, the transistor noise performance with any source impedance is readily calculated. For example, consider the simple circuit of Fig. $11.25 a$ with a source resistance $R_{S}$. The noise performance of this circuit can be
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_9972cfe7f689622347f7g-061.jpg?height=312&width=648&top_left_y=197&top_left_x=333)

Figure 11.25 Representation of circuit noise by a single equivalent input noise voltage generator. (a) Original circuit. (b) Equivalent representation.
represented by the total equivalent noise voltage $\overline{v_{i N}^{2}}$ in series with the input of the circuit as shown in Fig. 11.25b. Neglecting noise in $R_{L}$ (this will be discussed later), and equating the total noise voltage at the base of the transistor in Figs. $11.25 a$ and $11.25 b$, we obtain

$$
v_{i N}=v_{s}+v_{i}+i_{i} R_{S}
$$

If correlation between $v_{i}$ and $i_{i}$ is neglected this equation gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overline{v_{i N}^{2}}=\overline{v_{s}^{2}}+\overline{v_{i}^{2}}+\overline{i_{i}^{2}} R_{S}^{2} \tag{11.65}
\end{equation*}
$$

Using (11.50) and (11.57) in (11.65) and neglecting flicker noise, we find

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\overline{v_{i N}^{2}}}{\Delta f}=4 k T R_{S}+4 k T\left(r_{b}+\frac{1}{2 g_{m}}\right)+R_{S}^{2} 2 q\left[I_{B}+\frac{I_{C}}{|\beta(j f)|^{2}}\right] \tag{11.66}
\end{equation*}
$$

Equation 11.66 is similar to (11.46) if $r_{b}$ is small, as has been assumed.

#### EXAMPLE

Using data from the example in Section 11.4.1, calculate the total input noise voltage for the circuit of Fig. 11.25a in a bandwidth 0 to 1 MHz neglecting flicker noise and using (11.66). At low frequencies, (11.66) becomes

$$
\begin{aligned}
\overline{\frac{v_{i N}^{2}}{\Delta f}} & =4 k T\left(R_{S}+r_{b}+\frac{1}{2 g_{m}}\right)+R_{S}^{2} 2 q I_{B} \\
& =\left[1.66 \times 10^{-20}(500+200+130)+500^{2} \times 3.2 \times 10^{-19} \times 10^{-6}\right] \mathrm{V}^{2} / \mathrm{Hz} \\
& =(13.8+0.08) \times 10^{-18} \mathrm{~V}^{2} / \mathrm{Hz} \\
& =13.9 \times 10^{-18} \mathrm{~V}^{2} / \mathrm{Hz}
\end{aligned}
$$

The total input noise in a 1-MHz bandwidth is

$$
\begin{aligned}
\overline{v_{i N T}^{2}} & =13.9 \times 10^{-18} \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~V}^{2} \\
& =13.9 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{~V}^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

and thus

$$
v_{i N T}=3.73 \mu \mathrm{~V} \mathrm{rms}
$$

This is almost identical to the answer obtained in Section 11.4.1. However, the method described above has the advantage that once the equivalent input generators are known for any particular device, the answer can be written down almost by inspection and requires much less labor.

Also, the relative contributions of the various noise generators are more easily seen. In this case, for example, the equivalent input noise current is obviously a negligible factor.

### 11.5.2 MOS Transistor Noise Generators

The equivalent input noise generators for a MOS field-effect transistor (MOSFET) can be calculated from the equivalent circuit of Fig. 11.26a. This circuit is to be made equivalent to that of Fig. 11.26b. The output noise in each case is calculated with a short-circuit load and $C_{g d}$ is neglected.

If the input of each circuit in Fig. 11.26 is short-circuited and resulting output noise currents $i_{o}$ are equated, we obtain

$$
i_{d}=g_{m} v_{i}
$$

and thus

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overline{v_{i}^{2}}=\frac{\overline{i_{d}^{2}}}{g_{m}^{2}} \tag{11.67}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substituting $\overline{i_{d}^{2}}$ from (11.14) in (11.67) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\overline{v_{i}^{2}}}{\Delta f}=4 k T \frac{2}{3} \frac{1}{g_{m}}+K \frac{I_{D}^{a}}{g_{m}^{2} f} \tag{11.68a}
\end{equation*}
$$

The equivalent input noise resistance $R_{\text {eq }}$ of the MOS transistor is defined as

$$
\frac{\overline{v_{i}^{2}}}{\Delta f}=4 k T R_{\mathrm{eq}}
$$

where

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{\mathrm{eq}}=\frac{2}{3} \frac{1}{g_{m}}+K^{\prime} \frac{I_{D}^{a}}{g_{m}^{2} f} \tag{11.68b}
\end{equation*}
$$

and

$$
K^{\prime}=\frac{K}{4 k T}
$$

At frequencies above the flicker noise region, $R_{\mathrm{eq}}=(2 / 3)\left(1 / g_{m}\right)$. For $g_{m}=1 \mathrm{~mA} / \mathrm{V}$, this gives $R_{\mathrm{eq}}=667 \Omega$, which is significantly higher than for a bipolar transistor at a comparable bias current (about 1 mA ). The equivalent input noise-voltage spectral density for a typical MOS transistor is plotted versus frequency in Fig. 11.27. Unlike the bipolar transistor, the equivalent input noise-voltage generator for a MOS transistor contains flicker noise, and it is not uncommon for the flicker noise to extend well into the megahertz region.

In MOS field-effect transistors, the presence of electron energy states at the $\mathrm{Si}^{-} \mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ interface tends to result in an input-referred flicker noise component that is larger than the thermal noise component for frequencies below 1 to 10 kHz for most bias conditions and device geometries. Thus, an accurate representation of the input-referred flicker noise component in MOS transistors is important for the optimization of the noise performance of MOS analog circuits.

The physical mechanisms giving rise to $1 / f$ noise in MOS transistors have received extensive study. ${ }^{18}$ The exact dependence of the magnitude of the input-referred flicker noise on transistor bias conditions and device geometry is dependent on the details of the process that is used to fabricate the device. In most cases, the magnitude of the input-referred flicker noise component is approximately independent of bias current and voltage and is inversely proportional to the active gate area of the transistor. The latter occurs because as the transistor is made larger, a larger number of surface states are present under the gate, so that an averaging effect occurs that reduces the overall noise. It is also observed that the input-referred flicker noise is an inverse function of the gate-oxide capacitance per unit area. This is physically reasonable since the surface states can be thought of as a time-varying component of the surfacestate charge $Q_{s s}$. From (1.139) this produces a time-varying component in the threshold voltage that is inversely proportional to $C_{o x}$. For a MOS transistor, then, the equivalent input-referred voltage noise can often be written as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\overline{v_{i}^{2}}}{\Delta f}=4 k T \frac{2}{3} \frac{1}{g_{m}}+\frac{K_{f}}{W L C_{o x} f} \tag{11.69}
\end{equation*}
$$

A typical value for $K_{f}$ is $3 \times 10^{-24} \mathrm{~V}^{2}-\mathrm{F}$, or $3 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{~V}^{2}-\mathrm{pF}$.

The equivalent input noise-current generator $i_{i}^{2}$ for the MOSFET can be calculated by open-circuiting the input of each circuit in Fig. 11.26 and equating the output noise. This gives

$$
i_{i} \frac{g_{m}}{j \omega C_{g s}}=i_{g} \frac{g_{m}}{j \omega C_{g s}}+i_{d}
$$

and thus

$$
\begin{equation*}
i_{i}=i_{g}+\frac{j \omega C_{g s}}{g_{m}} i_{d} \tag{11.70}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since $i_{g}$ and $i_{d}$ represent independent generators, (11.70) can be written as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overline{i_{i}^{2}}=\overline{i_{g}^{2}}+\frac{\omega^{2} C_{g s}^{2}}{g_{m}^{2}} \overline{i_{d}^{2}} \tag{11.71}
\end{equation*}
$$

Ignoring (11.16) and substituting (11.14) and (11.15) in (11.17) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\overline{i_{i}^{2}}}{\Delta f}=2 q I_{G}+\frac{\omega^{2} C_{g s}^{2}}{g_{m}^{2}}\left(4 k T \frac{2}{3} g_{m}+K \frac{I_{D}^{a}}{f}\right) \tag{11.72}
\end{equation*}
$$

In (11.72) the ac current gain of the MOS transistor can be identified as

$$
\begin{equation*}
A_{I}=\frac{g_{m}}{\omega C_{g s}} \tag{11.73}
\end{equation*}
$$

and thus the noise generators at the output are divided by $A_{I}^{2}$ when referred back to the input. At low frequencies the input noise-current generator is determined by the gate leakage current $I_{G}$, which is very small ( $10^{-15}$ A or less). For this reason, MOS transistors have noise performance that is much superior to bipolar transistors when the driving source impedance is large. Under these circumstances the input noise-current generator is dominant and is much smaller for a MOS transistor than for a bipolar transistor. It should be emphasized, however, that the input noise-voltage generator of a bipolar transistor in (11.50) is typically smaller than that of a MOS transistor in (11.68a) because the bipolar transistor has a larger $g_{m}$ for a given bias current. Thus for low source impedances, a bipolar transistor often has noise performance superior to that of a MOS transistor.

## 11.6 Effect of Feedback on Noise Performance

The representation of circuit noise performance with two equivalent input noise generators is extremely useful in the consideration of the effect of feedback on noise performance. This will be illustrated by considering first the effect of ideal feedback on the noise performance of an amplifier. Practical aspects of feedback and noise performance will then be considered.

### 11.6.1 Effect of Ideal Feedback on Noise Performance

In Fig. 11.28a a series-shunt feedback amplifier is shown where the feedback network is ideal in that the signal feedback to the input is a pure voltage source and the feedback network is unilateral. Noise in the basic amplifier is represented by equivalent input generators $\overline{v_{i a}^{2}}$ and $\overline{i_{i a}^{2}}$. The noise performance of the overall circuit is represented by equivalent input generators $\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$ and $\overline{i_{i}^{2}}$ as shown in Fig. 11.28b. The value of $\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$ can be found by short-circuiting the input of each circuit and equating the output signal. However, since the output of the feedback network has a zero impedance, the current generators in each circuit are then short-circuited and the
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_9972cfe7f689622347f7g-065.jpg?height=440&width=1256&top_left_y=192&top_left_x=286)

Figure 11.28 (a) Series-shunt feedback amplifier with noise generators. (b) Equivalent representation of (a) with two input noise generators.
two circuits are identical only if

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overline{v_{i}^{2}}=\overline{v_{i a}^{2}} \tag{11.74}
\end{equation*}
$$

If the input terminals of each circuit are open-circuited, both voltage generators have a floating terminal and thus no effect on the circuit, and for equal output it is necessary that

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overline{i_{i}^{2}}=\overline{i_{i a}^{2}} \tag{11.75}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus, for the case of ideal feedback, the equivalent input noise generators can be moved unchanged outside the feedback loop and the feedback has no effect on the circuit noise performance. Since the feedback reduces the circuit gain, the output noise is reduced by the feedback, but desired signals are reduced by the same amount and the signal-to-noise ratio will be unchanged. The above result is easily shown for all four possible feedback configurations described in Chapter 8.

### 11.6.2 Effect of Practical Feedback on Noise Performance

The idealized series-shunt feedback circuit considered in the previous section is usually realized in practice as shown in Fig. 11.29a. The feedback circuit is a resistive divider consisting of $R_{E}$ and $R_{F}$. If the noise of the basic amplifier is represented by equivalent input noise generators $\overline{i_{i a}^{2}}$ and $\overline{v_{i a}^{2}}$ and the thermal noise generators in $R_{F}$ and $R_{E}$ are included, the circuit is as shown in Fig. 11.29b. The noise performance of the circuit is to be represented by two equivalent input generators $\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$ and $\overline{i_{i}^{2}}$, as shown in Fig. 11.29c.

In order to calculate $\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$, consider the inputs of the circuits of Fig. $11.29 b$ and $11.29 c$ short-circuited, and equate the output noise. It is readily shown that

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{i}=v_{i a}+i_{i a} R+\frac{R_{F}}{R_{F}+R_{E}} v_{e}+\frac{R_{E}}{R_{F}+R_{E}} v_{f} \tag{11.76}
\end{equation*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{equation*}
R=R_{F} \| R_{E} \tag{11.77}
\end{equation*}
$$

Assuming that all noise sources in (11.76) are independent, we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overline{v_{i}^{2}}=\overline{v_{i a}^{2}}+\overline{i_{i a}^{2}} R^{2}+4 k T R \Delta f \tag{11.78}
\end{equation*}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_9972cfe7f689622347f7g-066.jpg?height=940&width=1183&top_left_y=192&top_left_x=330)

Figure 11.29 (a) Series-shunt feedback circuit. (b) Series-shunt feedback circuit including noise generators. (c) Equivalent representation of (b) with two input noise generators.
where the following substitutions have been made:

$$
\begin{align*}
& \overline{v_{e}^{2}}=4 k T R_{E} \Delta f  \tag{11.79}\\
& \overline{v_{f}^{2}}=4 k T R_{F} \Delta f \tag{11.80}
\end{align*}
$$

Equation 11.78 shows that in this practical case, the equivalent input noise voltage of the overall amplifier contains the input noise voltage of the basic amplifier plus two other terms. The second term in (11.78) is usually negligible, but the third term represents thermal noise in $R=R_{E} \| R_{F}$ and is often significant.

The equivalent input noise current $\overline{i_{i}^{2}}$ is calculated by open-circuiting both inputs and equating output noise. It is apparent that

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overline{i_{i}^{2}} \simeq \overline{i_{i a}^{2}} \tag{11.81}
\end{equation*}
$$

since noise in the feedback resistors is no longer amplified, but appears only in shunt with the output. Thus the equivalent input noise current is unaffected by the application of feedback. The above results are true in general for series feedback at the input. For single-stage series feedback, the above equations are valid with $R_{F} \rightarrow \infty$ and $R=R_{E}$.

If the basic amplifier in Fig. 8.29 is an op amp, the calculation is slightly modified. This is due to the fact (shown in Section 11.8 and Fig. 11.39) that an op amp must be considered a three-port device for noise representation. However, if the circuit of Fig. 11.39 is used as the basic amplifier in the above calculation, expressions very similar to (11.78) and (11.81) are obtained.

Consider now the case of shunt feedback at the input, and as an example consider the shunt-shunt feedback circuit of Fig. 11.30a. This is shown in Fig. 11.30b with noise sources

$v_{i a}^{2}$ and $i_{i a}^{2}$ of the basic amplifier, and noise source $i_{f}^{2}$ due to $R_{F}$. These noise sources are referred back to the input to give $\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$ and $\overline{i_{i}^{2}}$ as shown in Fig. 11.30c.

Open-circuiting the inputs of Fig. $11.30 b$ and $11.30 c$, and equating output noise, we calculate

$$
\begin{equation*}
i_{i}=i_{i a}+\frac{v_{i a}}{R_{F}}+i_{f} \tag{11.82}
\end{equation*}
$$

Assuming that all noise sources in (11.82) are independent, we find

Thus the equivalent input noise current with shunt feedback applied consists of the input noise current of the basic amplifier together with a term representing thermal noise in the feedback resistor. The second term in (11.83) is usually negligible. These results are true in general for shunt feedback at the input. A general rule for calculating the equivalent input noise contribution due to thermal noise in the feedback resistors is to follow the two-port methods described in Chapter 8 for calculating feedback-circuit loading on the basic amplifier. Once the shunt or series resistors representing feedback loading at the input have been determined, these same resistors may be used to calculate the thermal noise contribution at the input due to the feedback resistors.

If the inputs of the circuits of Fig. $11.30 b$ and $11.30 c$ are short-circuited, and the output noise is equated, it follows that

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overline{v_{i}^{2}} \simeq \overline{v_{i a}^{2}} \tag{11.84}
\end{equation*}
$$

Equations 11.83 and 11.84 are true in general for shunt feedback at the input. They apply directly when the basic amplifier of Fig. 11.30 is an op amp, since one input terminal of the basic amplifier is grounded and the op amp becomes a two-port device.

The above results allow justification of some assumptions made earlier. For example, in the calculation of the equivalent input noise generators for a bipolar transistor in Section 11.5.1, collector-base capacitance $C_{\mu}$ was ignored. This capacitance represents single-stage shunt feedback and thus does not significantly affect the equivalent input noise generators of a transistor, even if the Miller effect is dominant. Note that there is no thermal noise contribution from the capacitor as there was from $R_{F}$ in Fig. 11.30. Also, the second term in (11.83) becomes $\overline{v_{i a}^{2}} /\left|Z_{F}\right|^{2}$ where $Z_{F}$ is the impedance of $C_{\mu}$. Since $\left|Z_{F}\right|$ is quite large at all frequencies of interest, this term is negligible.

#### EXAMPLE

As an example of calculations involving noise in feedback amplifiers, consider the wideband current-feedback pair whose ac schematic is shown in Fig. 11.31. The circuit is fed from a current source and the frequency response $\left|\left(i_{o} / i_{i}\right)(j \omega)\right|$ is flat with frequency to 100 MHz , where it falls rapidly. We calculate the minimum input signal $i_{s}$ required for an output signal-to-noise ratio greater than 20 dB . Data are as follows: $\beta_{1}=\beta_{2}=100, f_{T 1}=300 \mathrm{MHz}, I_{C 1}=$ $0.5 \mathrm{~mA}, I_{C 2}=1 \mathrm{~mA}, f_{T 2}=500 \mathrm{MHz}, r_{b 1}=r_{b 2}=100 \Omega$. Flicker noise is neglected.

The methods developed above allow the equivalent input noise generators for this circuit to be written down by inspection. A preliminary check shows that the noise due to the 20-k $\Omega$ interstage resistor and the base current noise of $Q_{2}$ are negligible. Using the rule stated in Section 11.2.2, we find that the $20-\mathrm{k} \Omega$ resistor contributes an equivalent noise current of $2.5 \mu \mathrm{~A}$. The base current of $Q_{2}$ is $10 \mu \mathrm{~A}$. Both of these can be neglected when compared to the $500 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ collector current of $Q_{1}$. Thus the input noise generators of the whole circuit are those of $Q_{1}$ moved outside the feedback loop, together with the noise contributed by the feedback resistors.

Using the methods of Chapter 8, we can derive the basic amplifier including feedback loading and noise sources for the circuit of Fig. 11.31 as shown in Fig. 11.32. The equivalent input noise-current generator for the overall circuit can be calculated from Fig. 11.32 or by using (11.83) with $R_{F}=5.5 \mathrm{k} \Omega$. Since the circuit is assumed to be driven from a current

source, the equivalent input noise voltage is not important. From (11.83)

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overline{i_{i}^{2}}=\overline{i_{i a}^{2}}+\frac{\overline{v_{i a}^{2}}}{(5500)^{2}}+4 k T \frac{1}{5500} \Delta f \tag{11.85}
\end{equation*}
$$

Using (11.57) and neglecting flicker noise, we have for $\overline{i_{i a}^{2}}$

$$
\overline{i_{i a}^{2}}=2 q\left(I_{B}+\frac{I_{C}}{|\beta(j f)|^{2}}\right) \Delta f
$$

and thus

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\overline{i_{i a}^{2}}}{\Delta f}=2 q\left(5+\frac{500}{|\beta|^{2}}\right) \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~A}^{2} / \mathrm{Hz} \tag{11.86}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substitution of (11.86) in (11.85) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\overline{i_{i}^{2}}}{\Delta f}=2 q\left(5+\frac{500}{|\beta|^{2}}\right) \times 10^{-6}+\frac{\overline{v_{i a}^{2}}}{(5500)^{2} \Delta f}+2 q(9.1) \times 10^{-6} \tag{11.87}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the noise in the $5.5-\mathrm{k} \Omega$ resistor has been expressed in terms of the equivalent noise current of $9.1 \mu \mathrm{~A}$.

Use of (11.50) gives

$$
\frac{\overline{v_{i a}^{2}}}{\Delta f}=4 k T\left(r_{b 1}+\frac{1}{2 g_{m}}\right)=4 k T(126)
$$

Division of this equation by $(5500)^{2}$ gives

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\overline{v_{i a}^{2}}}{(5500)^{2} \Delta f} & =4 k T \frac{1}{240,000}  \tag{11.88}\\
& =2 q(0.2) \times 10^{-6} \tag{11.89}
\end{align*}
$$

Thus the term involving $\overline{v_{i a}^{2}}$ in (11.87) is seen to be equivalent to thermal noise in a $240-\mathrm{k} \Omega$ resistor using (11.88), and this can be expressed as noise in $0.2 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ of equivalent noise current, as shown in (11.89). This term is negligible in this example, as is usually the case.

Combining all these terms we can express (11.87) as

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\overline{i_{i}^{2}}}{\Delta f} & =2 q\left(5+\frac{500}{|\beta|^{2}}+0.2+9.1\right) \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~A}^{2} / \mathrm{Hz} \\
& =2 q\left(14.3+\frac{500}{|\beta|^{2}}\right) \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~A}^{2} / \mathrm{Hz} \tag{11.90}
\end{align*}
$$

Equation 11.90 shows that the equivalent input noise-current spectral density rises at high frequencies (as $|\beta|$ falls) as expected for a transistor. In a single transistor without feedback, the equivalent input noise current also rises with frequency, but because the transistor gain falls with frequency, the output noise spectrum of a transistor without feedback always falls as frequency rises (see Section 11.4.1). However, in this case, the negative feedback holds the gain constant with frequency, and thus the output noise spectrum of this circuit will rise as frequency increases, until the amplifier band edge is reached. This is illustrated in Fig. 11.33, where the input noise-current spectrum, the amplifier frequency response squared, and the output noise-current spectrum (product of the first two) are shown. The current gain of the circuit is $A_{I} \simeq 11$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_9972cfe7f689622347f7g-070.jpg?height=1197&width=935&top_left_y=208&top_left_x=268)

Figure 11.33 Noise performance of the circuit of Fig. 11.32. (a) Equivalent input noise spectrum. (b) Frequency response squared.
(c) Output noise spectrum.

The total output noise from the circuit $\overline{i_{o T}^{2}}$ is obtained by integrating the output noise spectral density, which is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\overline{i_{o}^{2}}}{\Delta f}=A_{I}^{2} \frac{\overline{i_{i}^{2}}}{\Delta f} \tag{11.91}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus

$$
\begin{align*}
\overline{i_{o T}^{2}} & =\int_{0}^{B} A_{I}^{2} \frac{\overline{i_{i}^{2}}}{\Delta f} d f \\
& =A_{I}^{2} \int_{0}^{B} 2 q\left(14.3+\frac{500}{|\beta(j f)|^{2}}\right) \times 10^{-6} d f \tag{11.92}
\end{align*}
$$

where (11.90) has been used and $A_{I}^{2}$ is assumed constant up to $B=10^{8} \mathrm{~Hz}$ as specified earlier. The current gain is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\beta(j f)=\frac{\beta_{0}}{1+j \frac{\beta_{0} f}{f_{T 1}}} \tag{11.93}
\end{equation*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{|\beta(j f)|^{2}}=\frac{1}{\beta_{0}^{2}}\left(1+\frac{\beta_{0}^{2} f^{2}}{f_{T 1}^{2}}\right) \tag{11.94}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substitution of (11.94) in (11.92) gives

$$
\begin{align*}
\overline{i_{o T}^{2}} & =A_{I}^{2} 2 q \times 10^{-6} \int_{0}^{B}\left[14.3+\frac{500}{\beta_{0}^{2}}\left(1+\frac{\beta_{0}^{2} f^{2}}{f_{T 1}^{2}}\right)\right] d f  \tag{11.95}\\
& =A_{I}^{2} 2 q \times 10^{-6}\left[14.3 f+\frac{500}{\beta_{0}^{2}} f+\frac{500}{f_{T 1}^{2}} \frac{f^{3}}{3}\right]_{0}^{B} \tag{11.96}
\end{align*}
$$

Using $\beta_{0}=100$ and $B=100 \mathrm{MHz}=f_{T 1} / 3$ gives

$$
\begin{align*}
& \overline{i_{o T}^{2}}=A_{I}^{2} \times 2 q \times 10^{-6}(14.3 B+18.6 B)  \tag{11.97}\\
& \overline{i_{o T}^{2}}=A_{I}^{2} \times 1.05 \times 10^{-15} \mathrm{~A}^{2} \tag{11.98}
\end{align*}
$$

The equivalent input noise current is

$$
\overline{i_{i T}^{2}}=\frac{\overline{i_{o T}^{2}}}{\overline{A_{I}^{2}}}=1.05 \times 10^{-15} \mathrm{~A}^{2}
$$

and from this

$$
\begin{equation*}
i_{i T}=32.4 \mathrm{nArms} \tag{11.99}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus the equivalent input noise current is 32.4 nA rms and (11.97) shows that the frequencydependent part of the equivalent input noise is dominant. For a $20-\mathrm{dB}$ signal-to-noise ratio, input signal current $i_{s}$ must be greater than $0.32 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ rms.

## 11.7 Noise Performance of Other Transistor Configurations

Transistor configurations other than the common-emitter and common-source stages considered so far are often used in integrated-circuit design. The noise performance of other important configurations will now be considered. To avoid repetition, the discussion will be directed toward bipolar devices only. However, all the results carry over directly to FET circuits.

### 11.7.1 Common-Base Stage Noise Performance

The common-base stage is sometimes used as a low-input-impedance current amplifier. A common-base stage is shown in Fig. $11.34 a$ and the small-signal equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. $11.34 b$ together with the equivalent input noise generators derived for a common-emitter stage. Since these noise generators represent the noise performance of the transistor in any connection, Fig. $11.34 b$ is a valid representation of common-base noise performance. In Fig. $11.34 c$ the noise performance of the common-base stage is represented in the standard fashion with equivalent input noise generators $\overline{v_{i B}^{2}}$ and $\overline{i_{i B}^{2}}$. These can be related to the common-emitter input generators by alternately short circuiting and open circuiting the circuits of Fig. 11.34b and $11.34 c$ and equating output noise. It then follows that

$$
\begin{align*}
& \overline{i_{i B}^{2}}=\overline{i_{i}^{2}}  \tag{11.100}\\
& \overline{v_{i B}^{2}}=\overline{v_{i}^{2}} \tag{11.101}
\end{align*}
$$

Figure 11.34 (a) Common-base transistor configuration. (b) Common-base equivalent circuit with noise generators. (c) Common-base equivalent circuit with input noise generators.

Thus the equivalent input noise generators of common-emitter and common-base connections are the same and the noise performance of the two configurations is identical, even though their input impedances differ greatly.

Although the noise performances of common-emitter and common-base stages are nominally identical (for the same device parameters), there is one characteristic of the common-base stage that makes it generally unsuitable for use as a low-noise input stage. This is due to the fact that its current gain $\alpha \simeq 1$, and thus any noise current at the output of the common-base stage is referred directly back to the input without reduction. Thus a $10-\mathrm{k} \Omega$ load resistor that has an equivalent noise current of $5 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ produces this amount of equivalent noise current at the input. In many circuits this would be the dominant source of input current noise. The equivalent input noise currents of following stages are also referred back unchanged to the input of the common-base stage. This problem can be overcome in discrete common-base circuits by use

of a transformer that gives current gain at the output of the common-base stage. This option is not available in integrated-circuit design unless resort is made to external components.

### 11.7.2 Emitter-Follower Noise Performance

Consider the emitter follower shown in Fig. 11.35. The noise performance of this circuit can be calculated using the results of previous sections. The circuit can be viewed as a series-feedback stage and the equivalent input noise generators of the transistor can be moved unchanged back to the input of the complete circuit. Thus, if noise in $z_{L}$ is neglected, the emitter follower has the same equivalent input noise generators as the common-emitter and common-base stages. However, since the emitter follower has unity voltage gain, the equivalent input noise voltage of the following stage is transformed unchanged to the input, thus degrading the noise performance of the circuit. Noise due to $z_{L}$ must also be included, but since the follower output is taken at the emitter, which is a low impedance point, the noise due to $z_{L}$ is greatly attenuated compared with its effect on a series-feedback stage.

### 11.7.3 Differential-Pair Noise Performance

The differential pair is the basic building block of linear integrated circuits and, as such, its noise performance is of considerable importance. A bipolar differential pair is shown in Fig. $11.36 a$, and the base of each device is generally independently accessible, as shown. Thus this circuit cannot in general be represented as a two-port, and its noise performance cannot be represented in the usual fashion by two input noise generators. However, the techniques developed previously can be used to derive an equivalent noise representation of the circuit that employs two noise generators at each input. This is illustrated in Fig. 11.36b, and a simpler version of this circuit, which employs only three noise generators, is shown in Fig. 11.36c.

The noise representation of Fig. $11.36 b$ can be derived by considering noise due to each device separately. Consider first noise in $Q_{1}$, which can be represented by input noise generators $\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$ and $\overline{i_{i}^{2}}$ as shown in Fig. 11.37a. These noise generators are those for a single transistor as given by (11.50) and (11.57). Transistor $Q_{2}$ is initially assumed noiseless and the impedance seen looking in its emitter is $z_{E 2}$. Note that $z_{E 2}$ will be a function of the impedance connected from the base of $Q_{2}$ to ground. As described in previous sections, the noise generators of Fig. $11.37 a$ can be moved unchanged to the input of the circuit (independent of $z_{E 2}$ ) as shown in Fig. 11.37b. This representation can then be used to calculate the output noise produced by $Q_{1}$ in the differential pair for any impedances connected from the base of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ to ground.

Now consider noise due to $Q_{2}$. In similar fashion this can be represented by noise generators $\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$ and $\overline{i_{i}^{2}}$, as shown in Fig. 11.37c. In this case $Q_{1}$ is assumed noiseless and $z_{E 1}$ is the
impedance seen looking in at the emitter of $Q_{1}$. If $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ are identical, the equivalent input noise generators of Fig. $11.37 b$ and $11.37 c$ are identical. However, since they are produced by different transistors, the noise generators of Fig. $11.37 b$ and $11.37 c$ are independent. The total noise performance of the differential pair including noise due to both $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ can thus be represented as shown in Fig. 11.36b, and this representation is valid for any source resistance connected to either input terminal. Noise generators $\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$ and $\overline{i_{i}^{2}}$ are basically those due to each transistor alone. If noise due to $R_{L}$ or following stages is significant, it should be referred back symmetrically to the appropriate input. In practice, current source $I_{E E}$ will also contain noise, and this can be included in the representation. However, if the circuit is perfectly balanced, the current-source noise represents a common-mode signal and will produce no differential output.

The noise representation of Fig. $11.36 b$ can be simplified somewhat if the common-mode rejection of the circuit is high. In this case, one of the noise-voltage generators can be moved to the other side of the circuit, as shown in Fig. 11.36c. This can be justified if equal noisevoltage generators are added in series with each input and these generators are chosen such that the noise voltage at the base of $Q_{2}$ is canceled. This leaves two independent noise-voltage generators in series with the base of $Q_{1}$, and these can be represented as a single noise-voltage generator of value $\overline{2 v_{i}^{2}}$. Thus for the circuit of Fig. $11.36 c$ we can write

$$
\begin{gather*}
\overline{v_{d p}^{2}}=2 \overline{v_{i}^{2}}  \tag{11.102}\\
\overline{i_{d p}^{2}}=\overline{i_{i}^{2}} \tag{11.103}
\end{gather*}
$$

where $\overline{v_{d p}^{2}}$ and $\overline{i_{d p}^{2}}$ are the equivalent input noise generators of the differential pair.
The differential pair is often operated with the base of $Q_{2}$ grounded, and in this case the noise-current generator at the base of $Q_{2}$ is short circuited. The noise performance of the circuit is then represented by the two noise generators connected to the base of $Q_{1}$ in Fig. 11.36c. In this case the equivalent input noise-current generator of the differential pair is simply that due to one transistor alone, whereas the equivalent input noise-voltage generator has a meansquare value twice that of either transistor. Thus from a low source impedance, a differential pair has an equivalent input noise voltage 3 dB higher than a common-emitter stage with the same collector current as the devices in the pair.

## 11.8 Noise in Operational Amplifiers

Integrated-circuit amplifiers designed for low-noise operation generally use a simple commonemitter or common-source differential-pair input stage with resistive loads. Since the input stage has both current and voltage gain, the noise of following stages is generally not significant, and the resistive loads make only a small noise contribution. The noise analysis of such circuits is quite straightforward using the techniques described in this chapter. However, circuits of this type (the 725 op amp is an example) are inefficient in terms of optimizing important op amp parameters such as gain and bandwidth. To improve the gain, active loads can be used as in the first stage of the NE5234 op amp. However, by their very nature, active loads amplify their own internal noise and cause considerable degradation of circuit noise performance. To illustrate these points and show the compromises involved in the design of general-purpose circuits, an approximate noise analysis of the NE5234 will now be made. ${ }^{19}$

A simplified schematic of the input stage of the NE5234 is shown in Fig. 11.38a. The common-mode input voltage, $V_{I C}$, is assumed to be low enough that the npn input pair $Q_{1}-Q_{2}$ in Fig. 6.36 is off and can be ignored here. The differential output current is $i_{o}$. Components $Q_{13}$ and $R_{13}$ of the active load generate noise and contribute to the output noise at $i_{o}$. Since transistor $Q_{9}$ presents a high impedance to the active load, the noise due to the active load can be calculated from the isolated portion of the circuit shown in Fig. 11.38b. Noise due to $Q_{13}$ and $R_{13}$ is represented by equivalent input noise generators $\overline{v_{i 13}^{2}}$ and $\overline{i_{i 13}^{2}}$. The impedance looking back into the Bias ${ }_{1}$ output of the bias circuit is small and ignored. Therefore, $\overline{\dot{i}_{i 13}^{2}}$ may be neglected. Also, noise generated in the bias circuit may be ignored because it couples into $Q_{13}$ and $Q_{14}$ equally and does not affect the differential output current $i_{o}$ with perfect matching. Start with (11.78). Using (11.50) for $\overline{v_{i a}^{2}}$ and neglecting the $\overline{i_{i a}^{2}}$ term as well as flicker
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_9972cfe7f689622347f7g-077.jpg?height=854&width=1347&top_left_y=203&top_left_x=243)

Figure 11.38 (a) Simplified schematic of the NE5234 op amp input stage with $V_{I C} \ll 0.8 \mathrm{~V}$. (b) ac schematic (including noise) of $Q_{13}$ and $R_{13}$.
noise gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overline{\frac{v_{i 13}^{2}}{\Delta f}}=4 k T\left(r_{b 13}+\frac{1}{2 g_{m 13}}+R_{13}\right) \tag{11.104}
\end{equation*}
$$

This noise generator can be evaluated as follows. The dc collector current in $Q_{13}$ is approximately $6 \mu \mathrm{~A}$, giving $1 / 2 g_{m 13}=2.17 \mathrm{k} \Omega$. Also, $R_{13}=33 \mathrm{k} \Omega$, and a typical value of $r_{b}$ for pnp transistors is $200 \Omega$. Thus (11.104) becomes

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overline{\frac{v_{i 13}^{2}}{\Delta f}}=4 k T(35,000) \tag{11.105}
\end{equation*}
$$

This noise generator produces a noise output $i_{o A}$ where

$$
\begin{equation*}
i_{o A} \simeq \frac{1}{\frac{1}{g_{m 13}}+R_{13}} v_{i 13} \simeq \frac{v_{i 13}}{37,000} \tag{11.106}
\end{equation*}
$$

Using (11.105) in (11.106) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\overline{i_{O A}^{2}}}{\Delta f}=4 k T \frac{35,000}{37,000^{2}} \tag{11.107}
\end{equation*}
$$

A similar analysis done to find $\overline{v_{i 9}^{2}}$, the noise due to $Q_{9}$ and $R_{9}$ in series with the base of $Q_{9}$, gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\overline{v_{i 9}^{2}}}{\Delta f}=4 k T\left(r_{b 9}+\frac{1}{2 g_{m 9}}+R_{9}\right) \tag{11.108}
\end{equation*}
$$

The dc collector current in $Q_{9}$ is approximately $6 \mu \mathrm{~A}$, giving $1 / 2 g_{m 9}=2.17 \mathrm{k} \Omega$. Also, $R_{9}=$ $22 \mathrm{k} \Omega$, and a typical value of $r_{b}$ for $n p n$ transistors is $400 \Omega$. Thus (11.108) becomes

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\overline{v_{i 9}^{2}}}{\Delta f}=4 k T(25,000) \tag{11.109}
\end{equation*}
$$

This noise generator produces a noise output $i_{o B}$ where

$$
\begin{equation*}
i_{o B} \simeq \frac{1}{\frac{1}{g_{m 9}}+R_{9}} v_{i 9} \simeq \frac{v_{i 9}}{26,000} \tag{11.110}
\end{equation*}
$$

Using (11.109) in (11.110) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\overline{i_{o B}^{2}}}{\Delta f}=4 k T \frac{25,000}{26,000^{2}} \tag{11.111}
\end{equation*}
$$

The total mean-square noise current in the output at node 9 due to the active loads is $\overline{i_{o A}^{2}}+\overline{i_{o B}^{2}}$. Components $Q_{14}, R_{14}, Q_{10}$, and $R_{10}$ generate an equal mean-square noise current in the output at node 10. Although Fig. 11.38a shows that the deterministic current $i_{o}$ flows out of node 9 and into node 10, the polarities of the noise currents are not known, and the mean-square noise contributions add because the noise sources are uncorrelated with each other. Therefore, the total mean-square output current density stemming from the active loads attached to both nodes 9 and 10 is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\overline{i_{o A B}^{2}}}{\Delta f}=2\left(\frac{\overline{i_{o A}^{2}}}{\Delta f}+\frac{\overline{i_{o B}^{2}}}{\Delta f}\right) \tag{11.112}
\end{equation*}
$$

This result can be referred back to the input of the complete circuit of Fig. 11.38a in the standard manner. Consider the contribution to the equivalent input noise voltage. A voltage applied at the input of the full circuit of Fig. 11.38a gives

$$
\frac{i_{o}}{v_{i d}}=G_{m 1}
$$

where $G_{m 1}=97 \mu \mathrm{~A} / \mathrm{V}$ from (6.186). Therefore,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overline{i_{o}^{2}}=G_{m 1}^{2} \overline{v_{i d}^{2}} \tag{11.113}
\end{equation*}
$$

Equating output noise current in (11.112) and (11.113), we obtain an equivalent input noise voltage due to the active loads as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\overline{v_{i A B}^{2}}}{\Delta f}=4 k T\left[2\left(\frac{35,000}{37,000^{2}}+\frac{25,000}{26,000^{2}}\right)\right]\left(\frac{1}{97 \times 10^{-6}}\right)^{2}=4 k T(13,000) \tag{11.114}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus the active load causes a contribution of $13 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ to the equivalent input noise resistance of the NE5234 op amp. Finally, the results of Section 11.7.3 show that the equivalent input noise voltage squared of the differential pair $Q_{3}-Q_{4}$ is just the sum of the values from each half of the circuit. This gives an input noise-voltage contribution due to $Q_{3}-Q_{4}$ of

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\overline{v_{i C}^{2}}}{\Delta f}=4 k T\left(\frac{1}{2 g_{m 3}}+\frac{1}{2 g_{m 4}}+r_{b 3}+r_{b 4}\right) \tag{11.115}
\end{equation*}
$$

Assuming a collector bias current of $3 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ for each device, and $r_{b}=200 \Omega$ in (11.115), we calculate

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\overline{v_{i C}^{2}}}{\Delta f}=4 k T(9,000) \tag{11.116}
\end{equation*}
$$

Figure 11.39 Complete op amp noise representation.

For the total input noise voltage of the NE5234, combining (11.114) and (11.116) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\overline{v_{i}^{2}}}{\Delta f}=\frac{\overline{v_{i A B}^{2}}}{\Delta f}+\frac{\overline{v_{i C}^{2}}}{\Delta f}=4 k T(22,000) \tag{11.117}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus the input noise voltage of the NE5234 is represented by an equivalent input noise resistance of $22 \mathrm{k} \Omega$. This is a large value and is close to the measured and computer-calculated result. Note that the active load is the main contributor to the noise. The magnitude of the noise voltage can be appreciated by noting that if this op amp is fed from a $1-\mathrm{k} \Omega$ source resistance for example, the circuit adds twenty-two times as much noise power as is contributed by the source resistance itself.

The calculations above concerned the equivalent input noise voltage of the NE5234. A similar calculation performed to determine the equivalent input noise current shows that it is dominated by the base current of the input device. The current gain of the input differential pair is sufficient to ensure that following stage noise, including noise in the active loads, gives a negligible contribution to input current noise. Since the circuit is differential, the complete noise representation consists of the equivalent input noise voltage calculated above plus two equivalent input noise-current generators as shown in Fig. 11.39. This follows from the discussion of differential-pair noise performance in Section 11.7.3. The equivalent input noise-current generators are (neglecting flicker noise)

$$
\frac{\overline{i_{i}^{2}}}{\Delta f} \simeq 2 q I_{B}
$$

where $I_{B}$ is the base current of $Q_{1}$ or $Q_{2}$ in Fig. 11.38a. With $\beta_{F(p n p)}=10$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\overline{i_{i}^{2}}}{\Delta f} \simeq 2 q\left(0.3 \times 10^{-6}\right) \tag{11.118}
\end{equation*}
$$

Increasing $\beta_{F}$ reduces the input mean-square current noise. When $V_{I C} \gg 0.8 \mathrm{~V}$, the input stage of the NE5234 turns off $Q_{3}{ }^{-} Q_{4}$ and turns on $Q_{1-} Q_{2}$ with the same collector bias currents as assumed above. Therefore, the input mean-square current density depends on $V_{I C}$ unless $\beta_{F(n p n)}=\beta_{F(p n p)}$.

Consider the case of the CMOS input stage shown in Fig. 11.40. If the noise in each MOS transistor is represented as shown by its equivalent input noise voltage generator, the equivalent input noise voltage of the circuit $\frac{1}{v_{\mathrm{eq} T}^{2}}$ can be calculated by equating the output current noise
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_9972cfe7f689622347f7g-080.jpg?height=1992&width=1011&top_left_y=205&top_left_x=438)

\end{equation*}
$$

where it has been assumed that $g_{m 1}=g_{m 2}$ and that $g_{m 3}=g_{m 4}$. Thus, the input transistors contribute to the input noise directly while the contribution of the loads is reduced by the square of the ratio of their transconductance to that of the input transistors. The significance of this in the design can be further appreciated by considering the input-referred $1 / f$ noise and the input-referred thermal noise separately.

The dependence of the $1 / f$ portion of the device equivalent input noise-voltage spectrum on device geometry and bias conditions was considered earlier. Considerable discrepancy exists in the published data on $1 / f$ noise, indicating that it arises from a mechanism that is strongly affected by details of device fabrication. The most widely accepted model for $1 / f$ noise is that, for a given device, the gate-referred equivalent mean-square voltage noise is approximately independent of bias conditions in saturation and is inversely proportional to the gate capacitance of the device. The following analytical results are based on this model, but it should be emphasized that the actual dependence must be verified for each process technology and device type. Thus we let

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overline{v_{\mathrm{eq}}^{2}}=\frac{K_{f} \Delta f}{C_{o x} W L f} \tag{11.120}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the parameter $K_{f}$ is the flicker-noise coefficient. Utilizing this assumption, and using (11.119), we obtain for the equivalent input $1 / f$ noise generator for the circuit of Fig. 11.40a

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overline{v_{1 / f}^{2}}=\frac{2 K_{p}}{f W_{1} L_{1} C_{o x}}\left(1+\frac{K_{n} \mu_{n} L_{1}^{2}}{K_{p} \mu_{p} L_{3}^{2}}\right) \Delta f \tag{11.121}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $K_{n}$ and $K_{p}$ are the flicker noise coefficients for the $n$-channel and $p$-channel devices, respectively. Depending on processing details, these may be comparable or different by a factor of two or more. Note that the first term in (11.121) is the equivalent input noise of the input transistors alone, and the term in parentheses is the increase in noise over and above this value due to the loads. The second term shows that the load contribution can be made small by simply making the channel lengths of the loads longer than those of the input transistors by a factor of about two or more. The input transistors can then be made wide enough to achieve the desired performance. It is interesting to note that changing the width of the channel in the loads does not effect the $1 / f$ noise performance.

The thermal noise performance of the circuit of Fig. 11.40a can be calculated as follows. As discussed in Section 11.5.2, the input-referred thermal noise of a MOS transistor is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overline{v_{\mathrm{eq}}^{2}}=4 k T\left(\frac{2}{3 g_{m}}\right) \Delta f \tag{11.122}
\end{equation*}
$$

Utilizing the same approach as for the flicker noise, we obtain for the equivalent input thermal noise of the circuit of Fig. 11.40a

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overline{v_{\mathrm{Th}}^{2}}=4 k T \frac{4}{3 \sqrt{2 \mu_{p} C_{o x}(W / L)_{1} I_{D}}}\left(1+\sqrt{\frac{\mu_{n}(W / L)_{3}}{\mu_{p}(W / L)_{1}}}\right) \Delta f \tag{11.123}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $I_{D}$ is the bias current in each device. Again, the first term represents the thermal noise from the input transistors and the term in parentheses represents the fractional increase in noise due to the loads. The term in parentheses will be small if the $W / L$ ratios are chosen so that the
transconductance of the input devices is much larger than that of the loads. If this condition is satisfied, then the input noise is simply determined by the transconductance of the input transistors.

## 11.9 Noise Bandwidth

In the noise analysis performed thus far, the circuits considered were generally assumed to have simple gain-frequency characteristics with abrupt band edges as shown in Fig. 11.33b. The calculation of total circuit noise then reduced to an integration of the noise spectral density across this band. In practice, many circuits do not have such ideal gain-frequency characteristics, and the calculation of total circuit noise can be much more complex in those cases. However, if the equivalent input noise spectral density of a circuit is constant and independent of frequency (i.e., if the noise is white), we can simplify the calculations using the concept of noise bandwidth described below.

Consider an amplifier as shown in Fig. 11.41, and assume it is fed from a low source impedance so that the equivalent input noise voltage $\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$ determines the noise performance. Assume initially that the spectral density $\overline{v_{i}^{2}} / \Delta f=S_{i}(f)=S_{i 0}$ of the input noise voltage is flat as shown in Fig. 11.42a. Further assume that the magnitude squared of the voltage gain $\left|A_{v}(\mathrm{jf})\right|^{2}$ of the circuit is as shown in Fig. 11.42b. The output noise-voltage spectral density $S_{o}(f)=\overline{v_{o}^{2}} / \Delta f$ is the product of the input noise-voltage spectral density and the square of the voltage gain and is shown in Fig. 11.42c. The total output noise voltage is obtained by summing the contribution from $S_{o}(f)$ in each frequency increment $\Delta f$ between zero and infinity to give

$$
\begin{align*}
\overline{v_{o T}^{2}} & =\sum_{f=0}^{\infty} S_{o}(f) \Delta f=\int_{0}^{\infty} S_{o}(f) d f=\int_{0}^{\infty}\left|A_{v}(j f)^{2}\right| S_{i 0} d f \\
& =S_{i 0} \int_{0}^{\infty}\left|A_{v}(j f)\right|^{2} d f \tag{11.124}
\end{align*}
$$

The evaluation of the integral of (11.124) is often difficult except for very simple transfer functions. However, if the problem is transformed into a normalized form, the integrals of common circuit functions can be evaluated and tabulated for use in noise calculations. For this purpose, consider a transfer function as shown in Fig. 11.43 with the same low-frequency value $A_{v 0}$ as the original circuit but with an abrupt band edge at a frequency $f_{N}$. Frequency $f_{N}$ is chosen to give the same total output noise voltage as the original circuit when the same input noise voltage is applied. Thus

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overline{v_{o T}^{2}}=S_{i 0} A_{v 0}^{2} f_{N} \tag{11.125}
\end{equation*}
$$

If (11.124) and (11.125) are equated, we obtain

$$
\begin{equation*}
f_{N}=\frac{1}{A_{v 0}^{2}} \int_{0}^{\infty}\left|A_{v}(j f)\right|^{2} d f \tag{11.126}
\end{equation*}
$$

Figure 11.43 Transfer function of a circuit giving the same output noise as a circuit with a transfer function as specified in Fig. 11.42b.
where $f_{N}$ is the equivalent noise bandwidth of the circuit. Although derived for the case of a voltage transfer function, this result can be used for any type of transfer function. Note that the integration of (11.126) can be performed numerically if measured data for the circuit transfer function is available.

Once the noise bandwidth is evaluated using (11.126), the total output noise of the circuit is readily calculated using (11.125). The advantage of the form of (11.126) is that the circuit gain is normalized to its low-frequency value and thus the calculation of $f_{N}$ concerns only the frequency response of the circuit. This can be done in a general way so that whole classes of circuits are covered by one calculation. For example, consider an amplifier with a single-pole frequency response given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
A_{\nu}(j f)=\frac{A_{v 0}}{1+j \frac{f}{f_{1}}} \tag{11.127}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $f_{1}$ is the $-3-\mathrm{dB}$ frequency. The noise bandwidth of this circuit can be calculated from (11.126) as

$$
\begin{equation*}
f_{N}=\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{d f}{1+\left(\frac{f}{f_{1}}\right)^{2}}=\frac{\pi}{2} f_{1}=1.57 f_{1} \tag{11.128}
\end{equation*}
$$

This gives the noise bandwidth of any single-pole circuit and shows that it is larger than the $-3-\mathrm{dB}$ bandwidth by a factor of 1.57 . Thus a circuit with the transfer function of (11.127) produces noise as if it had an abrupt band edge at a frequency $1.57 f_{1}$.

As the steepness of the transfer function fall-off with frequency becomes greater, the noise bandwidth approaches the $-3-\mathrm{dB}$ bandwidth. For example, a two-pole transfer function with complex poles at $45^{\circ}$ to the negative real axis has a noise bandwidth only 11 percent greater than the $-3-\mathrm{dB}$ bandwidth.

#### EXAMPLE

As an example of noise bandwidth calculations, suppose a NE5234 op amp is used in a feedback configuration with a low-frequency gain of $A_{\nu 0}=100$ and it is desired to calculate the total output noise $v_{O T}$ from the circuit with a zero source impedance and neglecting flicker noise. If the unity-gain bandwidth of the op amp is 2.7 MHz , then the transfer function in a gain of 100 configuration will have a -3-dB frequency of 27 kHz with a single-pole response. From (11.128) the noise bandwidth is

$$
\begin{equation*}
f_{N}=1.57 \times 27 \mathrm{kHz}=42 \mathrm{kHz} \tag{11.129}
\end{equation*}
$$

Assuming that the circuit is fed from a zero source impedance, and using the previously calculated value of $22 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ as the equivalent input noise resistance, we can calculate the lowfrequency input noise voltage spectral density of the NE5234 as

$$
\begin{equation*}
S_{i 0}=\frac{\overline{v_{i}^{2}}}{\Delta f}=4 k T(22,000)=3.7 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{~V}^{2} / \mathrm{Hz} \tag{11.130}
\end{equation*}
$$

Using $A_{v 0}=100$ together with substitution of (11.129) and (11.130) in (11.125) gives, for the total output noise voltage,

$$
\overline{v_{o T}^{2}}=3.7 \times 10^{-16} \times(100)^{2} \times 42 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~V}^{2}=1.6 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{~V}^{2}
$$

- $\quad$ and thus $v_{O T}=390 \mu \mathrm{~V}$ rms.

The calculations of noise bandwidth considered above were based on the assumption of a flat input noise spectrum. This is often true in practice and the concept of noise bandwidth is useful in those cases, but there are also many examples where the input noise spectrum varies
with frequency. In these cases, the total output noise voltage is given by

$$
\begin{align*}
\overline{v_{o T}^{2}} & =\int_{0}^{\infty} S_{o}(f) d f  \tag{11.131}\\
& =\int_{0}^{\infty}\left|A_{v}(j f)\right|^{2} S_{i}(f) d f \tag{11.132}
\end{align*}
$$

where $A_{v}(j f)$ is the voltage gain of the circuit and $S_{i}(f)$ is the input noise-voltage spectral density. If the circuit has a voltage gain $A_{v S}$ at the frequency of the applied input signal, then the total equivalent input noise voltage becomes

$$
\begin{align*}
\overline{v_{i T}^{2}} & =\frac{1}{A_{v S}^{2}} \int_{0}^{\infty}\left|A_{v}(j f)\right|^{2} S_{i}(f) d f  \tag{11.133}\\
& =\int_{0}^{\infty}\left|\frac{A_{v}(j f)}{A_{v S}}\right|^{2} S_{i}(f) d f \tag{11.134}
\end{align*}
$$

Equation 11.134 shows that, in general, the total equivalent input noise voltage of a circuit is obtained by integrating the product of the input noise-voltage spectrum and the normalized voltage gain function.

One last topic that should be mentioned in this section is the problem that occurs in calculating the flicker noise in direct-coupled amplifiers. Consider an amplifier with an input noise spectral density as shown in Fig. 11.44a and a voltage gain that extends down to dc and up to $f_{1}=10 \mathrm{kHz}$ with an abrupt cutoff, as shown in Fig. 11.44b. Then, using (11.134), we
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_9972cfe7f689622347f7g-085.jpg?height=479&width=913&top_left_y=1295&top_left_x=259)

(b)

Figure 11.44 (a) Input noise-voltage spectral density for a circuit. (b) Circuit transfer function squared.
can calculate the total equivalent input noise voltage as

$$
\begin{align*}
\overline{v_{i T}^{2}} & =\int_{0}^{f_{1}} S_{i}(f) d f \\
& =\int_{0}^{f_{1}}\left(1+\frac{1000}{f}\right) \times 10^{-16} d f \\
& =10^{-16}[f+1000 \ln f]_{0}^{f_{1}} \tag{11.135}
\end{align*}
$$

Evaluating (11.135) produces a problem since $\overline{v_{i T}^{2}}$ is infinite when a lower limit of zero is used on the integration. This suggests infinite power in the $1 / f$ noise signal. In practice, measurements of $1 / f$ noise spectra show a continued $1 / f$ dependence to as low a frequency as is measured (cycles per day or less). This problem can be resolved only by noting that $1 / f$ noise eventually becomes indistinguishable from thermal drift and that the lower limit of the integration must be specified by the period of observation. For example, taking a lower limit to the integration of $f_{2}=1$ cycle/day, we have $f_{2}=1.16 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~Hz}$. Changing the limit in (11.135) we find

$$
\begin{align*}
\overline{v_{i T}^{2}} & =10^{-16}[f+1000 \ln f]_{f_{2}}^{f_{1}} \\
& =10^{-16}\left[\left(f_{1}-f_{2}\right)+1000 \ln \frac{f_{1}}{f_{2}}\right] \tag{11.136}
\end{align*}
$$

Using $f_{1}=10 \mathrm{kHz}$ and $f_{2}=1.16 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~Hz}$ in (11.136) gives

$$
\begin{aligned}
\overline{v_{i T}^{2}} & =10^{-16}(10,000+20,600) \\
& =3.06 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{~V}^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

and thus

$$
v_{i T}=1.75 \mu \mathrm{~V} \mathrm{rms}
$$

If the lower limit of integration is changed to 1 cycle/year $=3.2 \times 10^{-8} \mathrm{~Hz}$, then (11.136) becomes

$$
\begin{aligned}
\overline{v_{i T}^{2}} & =10^{-16}(10,000+26,500) \\
& =3.65 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{~V}^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

and thus

$$
v_{i T}=1.9 \mu \mathrm{~V} \mathrm{rms}
$$

The noise voltage changes very slowly as $f_{2}$ is reduced further because of the $\ln$ function in (11.136).

### 11.10 Noise Figure and Noise Temperature

### 11.10.1 Noise Figure

The most general method of specifying the noise performance of circuits is by specifying input noise generators as described above. However, a number of specialized methods of specifying noise performance have been developed that are convenient in particular situations. Two of these methods are now described.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_9972cfe7f689622347f7g-087.jpg?height=216&width=702&top_left_y=196&top_left_x=262)

Figure 11.45 Signal and noise power at the input and output of a circuit.

The noise figure $(F)$ is a commonly used method of specifying the noise performance of a circuit or a device. Its disadvantage is that it is limited to situations where the source impedance is resistive, and this precludes its use in many applications where noise performance is important. However, it is widely used as a measure of noise performance in communication systems where the source impedance is often resistive.

The definition of the noise figure of a circuit is

$$
\begin{equation*}
F=\frac{\text { input } S / N \text { ratio }}{\text { output } S / N \text { ratio }} \tag{11.137}
\end{equation*}
$$

and $F$ is usually expressed in decibels. The utility of the noise-figure concept is apparent from the definition, as it gives a direct measure of the signal-to-noise $(S / N)$ ratio degradation that is caused by the circuit. For example, if the $S / N$ ratio at the input to a circuit is 50 dB , and the circuit noise figure is 5 dB , then the $S / N$ ratio at the output of the circuit is 45 dB .

Consider a circuit as shown in Fig. 11.45, where $S$ represents signal power and $N$ represents noise power. The input noise power $N_{i}$ is always taken as the noise in the source resistance. The output noise power $N_{o}$ is the total output noise including the circuit contribution and noise transmitted from the source resistance. From (11.137) the noise figure is

$$
\begin{equation*}
F=\frac{S_{i}}{N_{i}} \frac{N_{o}}{S_{o}} \tag{11.138}
\end{equation*}
$$

For an ideal noiseless amplifier, all output noise comes from the source resistance at the input, and thus if $G$ is the circuit power gain, then the output signal $S_{o}$ and the output noise $N_{o}$ are given by

$$
\begin{align*}
& S_{o}=G S_{i}  \tag{11.139}\\
& N_{o}=G N_{i} \tag{11.140}
\end{align*}
$$

Substituting (11.139) and (11.140) in (11.138) gives $F=1$ or 0 dB in this case.
A useful alternative definition of $F$ may be derived from (11.138) as follows:

$$
\begin{equation*}
F=\frac{S_{i}}{N_{i}} \frac{N_{o}}{S_{o}}=\frac{N_{o}}{G N_{i}} \tag{11.141}
\end{equation*}
$$

Equation 11.141 can be written as

$$
\begin{equation*}
F=\frac{\text { total output noise }}{\text { that part of the output noise due to the source resistance }} \tag{11.142}
\end{equation*}
$$

Note that since $F$ is specified by a power ratio, the value in decibels is given by $10 \log _{10}$ (numerical ratio).

The calculations of the previous sections have shown that the noise parameters of most circuits vary with frequency, and thus the bandwidth must be specified when the noise figure of a circuit is calculated. The noise figure is often specified for a small bandwidth $\Delta f$ at a frequency $f$ where $\Delta f \ll f$. This is called the spot noise figure and applies to tuned amplifiers and also to broadband amplifiers that may be followed by frequency-selective circuits. For broadband amplifiers whose output is utilized over a wide bandwidth, an average noise figure is often

specified. This requires calculation of the total output noise over the frequency band of interest using the methods described in previous sections.

In many cases, the most convenient way to calculate noise figure is to return to the original equivalent circuit of the device with its basic noise generators to perform the calculation. However, some insight into the effect of circuit parameters on the noise figure can be obtained by using the equivalent input noise generator representation of Fig. 11.46. In this figure, a circuit with input impedance $z_{i}$ and voltage gain $G=v_{o} / v_{x}$ is fed from a source resistance $R_{S}$ and drives a load $R_{L}$. The source resistance shows thermal noise $\overline{i_{s}^{2}}$, and the noise of the circuit itself is represented by $\overline{i_{i}^{2}}$ and $\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$, assumed uncorrelated. The noise at the input terminals due to $\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$ and $\overline{i_{i}^{2}}$ is

$$
v_{x A}=v_{i} \frac{z_{i}}{z_{i}+R_{S}}+i_{i} \frac{R_{S} z_{i}}{R_{S}+z_{i}}
$$

and thus

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overline{v_{x A}^{2}}=\overline{v_{i}^{2}} \frac{\left|z_{i}\right|^{2}}{\left|z_{i}+R_{S}\right|^{2}}+\overline{i_{i}^{2}} \frac{\left|R_{S} z_{i}\right|^{2}}{\left|R_{S}+z_{i}\right|^{2}} \tag{11.143}
\end{equation*}
$$

The noise power in $R_{L}$ produced by $\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$ and $\overline{i_{i}^{2}}$ is

$$
\begin{equation*}
N_{o A}=\frac{|G|^{2}}{R_{L}} \overline{v_{x A}^{2}}=\frac{|G|^{2}}{R_{L}}\left(\overline{v_{i}^{2}} \frac{\left|z_{i}\right|^{2}}{\left|z_{i}+R_{S}\right|^{2}}+\overline{i_{i}^{2}} \frac{\left|R_{S} z_{i}\right|^{2}}{\left|R_{S}+z_{i}\right|^{2}}\right) \tag{11.144}
\end{equation*}
$$

The noise power in $R_{L}$ produced by source resistance noise generator $\overline{i_{s}^{2}}$ is

$$
\begin{equation*}
N_{o B}=\frac{|G|^{2}}{R_{L}} \frac{\left|R_{S} z_{i}\right|^{2}}{\left|R_{S}+z_{i}\right|^{2}} \overline{i_{s}^{2}} \tag{11.145}
\end{equation*}
$$

The noise in the source resistance in a narrow bandwidth $\Delta f$ is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overline{i_{s}^{2}}=4 k T \frac{1}{R_{S}} \Delta f \tag{11.146}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substituting (11.146) in (11.145) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
N_{o B}=\frac{|G|^{2}}{R_{L}} \frac{\left|R_{S} z_{i}\right|^{2}}{\left|R_{S}+z_{i}\right|^{2}} 4 k T \frac{1}{R_{S}} \Delta f \tag{11.147}
\end{equation*}
$$

Using the definition of noise figure in (11.142) and substituting from (11.147) and (11.144), we find

$$
\begin{align*}
F & =\frac{N_{o A}+N_{o B}}{N_{o B}} \\
& =1+\frac{N_{o A}}{N_{o B}}  \tag{11.148}\\
& =1+\frac{\overline{v_{i}^{2}}}{4 k T R_{S} \Delta f}+\frac{\overline{i_{i}^{2}}}{4 k T \frac{1}{R_{S}} \Delta f} \tag{11.149}
\end{align*}
$$

Equation 11.149 gives the circuit spot noise figure assuming negligible correlation between $\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$ and $\overline{i_{i}^{2}}$. Note that $F$ is independent of all circuit parameters $\left(G, z_{i}, R_{L}\right)$ except the source resistance $R_{S}$ and the equivalent input noise generators.

It is apparent from (11.149) that $F$ has a minimum as $R_{S}$ varies. For very low values of $R_{S}$, the $\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$ generator is dominant, whereas for large $R_{S}$ the $\overline{i_{i}^{2}}$ generator is most important. By differentiating (11.149) with respect to $R_{S}$, we can calculate the value of $R_{S}$ giving minimum $F$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{S(\mathrm{opt})}^{2}=\frac{\overline{v_{i}^{2}}}{\overline{\overline{i_{i}^{2}}}} \tag{11.150}
\end{equation*}
$$

This result is true in general, even if correlation is significant. A graph of $F$ in decibels versus $R_{S}$ is shown in Fig. 11.47.

The existence of a minimum in $F$ as $R_{S}$ is varied is one reason for the widespread use of transformers at the input of low-noise tuned amplifiers. This technique allows the source impedance to be transformed to the value that simultaneously gives the lowest noise figure and causes minimal loss in the circuit.

For example, consider the noise figure of a bipolar transistor at low-to-moderate frequencies, where both flicker noise and high-frequency effects are neglected. From (11.50) and (11.57),

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \overline{v_{i}^{2}}=4 k T\left(r_{b}+\frac{1}{2 g_{m}}\right) \Delta f \\
& \overline{i_{i}^{2}}=2 q I_{B} \Delta f=2 q \frac{I_{C}}{\beta_{F}} \Delta f
\end{aligned}
$$

Figure 11.47 Variation in noise figure $F$ with source resistance $R_{S}$.

Substitution of these values in (11.150) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{S(\mathrm{opt})}=\frac{\sqrt{\beta_{F}}}{g_{m}} \sqrt{1+2 g_{m} r_{b}} \tag{11.151}
\end{equation*}
$$

At this value of $R_{S}$, the noise figure is given by (11.149) as

$$
\begin{equation*}
F_{\mathrm{opt}} \simeq 1+\frac{1}{\sqrt{\beta_{F}}} \sqrt{1+2 g_{m} r_{b}} \tag{11.152}
\end{equation*}
$$

At a collector current of $I_{C}=1 \mathrm{~mA}$, and with $\beta_{F}=100$ and $r_{b}=50 \Omega$, (11.151) gives $R_{S(\mathrm{opt})}=572 \Omega$ and $F_{\text {opt }}=1.22$. In decibels the value is $10 \log _{10} 1.22=0.9 \mathrm{~dB}$. Note that $F_{\text {opt }}$ decreases as $\beta_{F}$ increases and as $r_{b}$ and $g_{m}$ decrease. However, increasing $\beta_{F}$ and decreasing $g_{m}$ result in an increasing value of $R_{S(\mathrm{opt})}$, and this may prove difficult to realize in practice.

As another example, consider the MOSFET at low frequencies. Neglecting flicker noise, we can calculate the equivalent input generators from Section 11.5.2 as

$$
\begin{align*}
& \overline{v_{i}^{2}} \simeq 4 k T \frac{2}{3} \frac{1}{g_{m}} \Delta f  \tag{11.153}\\
& \overline{i_{i}^{2}} \simeq 0 \tag{11.154}
\end{align*}
$$

Using these values in (11.149) and (11.150), we find that $R_{S(\mathrm{opt})} \rightarrow \infty$ and $F_{\mathrm{opt}} \rightarrow 0 \mathrm{~dB}$. Thus the MOS transistor has excellent noise performance from a high source resistance. However, if the source resistance is low (kilohms or less) and transformers cannot be used, the noise figure for the MOS transistor may be worse than for a bipolar transistor. For source resistances of the order of megohms or higher, the MOS transistor usually has significantly lower noise figure than a bipolar transistor.

### 11.10.2 Noise Temperature

Noise temperature is an alternative noise representation and is closely related to noise figure. The noise temperature $T_{n}$ of a circuit is defined as the temperature at which the source resistance $R_{S}$ must be held so that the noise output from the circuit due to $R_{S}$ equals the noise output due to the circuit itself. If these conditions are applied to the circuit of Fig. 11.46, the output noise $N_{O A}$ due to the circuit itself is unchanged but the output noise due to the source resistance becomes

$$
\begin{equation*}
N_{o B}^{\prime}=\frac{|G|^{2}}{R_{L}} \frac{\left|R_{S} z_{i}\right|^{2}}{\left|R_{S}+z_{i}\right|^{2}} 4 k T_{n} \frac{1}{R_{S}} \Delta f \tag{11.155}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substituting for $N_{o B}$ from (11.147) in (11.155), we obtain

$$
\begin{equation*}
N_{o B}^{\prime}=N_{o B} \frac{T_{n}}{T} \tag{11.156}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $T$ is the circuit temperature at which the noise performance is specified (usually taken as $290^{\circ} \mathrm{K}$ ). Substituting (11.156) in (11.148) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{T_{n}}{T}=(F-1) \tag{11.157}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $F$ is specified as a ratio and is not in decibels.
Thus noise temperature and noise figure are directly related. The main application of noise temperature provides a convenient expanded measure of noise performance near $F=1$ for very-low-noise amplifiers. A noise figure of $F=2(3 \mathrm{~dB})$ corresponds to $T_{n}=290^{\circ} \mathrm{K}$ and $F=1.1(0.4 \mathrm{~dB})$ corresponds to $T_{n}=29^{\circ} \mathrm{K}$.
