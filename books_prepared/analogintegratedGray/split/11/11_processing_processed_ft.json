These pulses fluctuate between positive and negative amplitudes, creating a pattern that resembles a square wave with added noise. The noise amplitude remains relatively consistent within each burst, but the transitions between levels are characterized by abrupt changes, highlighting the burst nature of the noise. The overall behavior of the graph shows periodic bursts of noise, which are typical of burst noise phenomena. The repetition rate of these noise pulses is likely within the audio frequency range, leading to the characteristic popping sound when played through a speaker.

This is because the input noise-voltage generator of a bipolar transistor is typically smaller than that of a MOS transistor due to the bipolar transistor having a larger transconductance \\( g_{m} \\) for a given bias current. The equation (11.50) for bipolar transistors shows a smaller noise voltage compared to equation (11.68a) for MOS transistors. However, at high source impedances, MOS transistors exhibit better noise performance. This is because the input noise-current generator, which dominates at high impedances, is much smaller for MOS transistors (typically \\( 10^{-15} \\) A or less due to very small gate leakage current \\( I_{G} \\)) compared to bipolar transistors. Thus, the choice between MOS and bipolar transistors for noise-critical applications depends on the source impedance."
