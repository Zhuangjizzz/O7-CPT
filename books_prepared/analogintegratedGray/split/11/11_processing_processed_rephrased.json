    "text": "Shot noise is invariably linked to direct-current flow and is present in diodes, MOS transistors, and bipolar transistors. Its origin can be understood by examining the diode in Fig. 11.1(a) and the carrier concentrations within the device in the forward-bias region, as depicted in Fig. 11.1(b). As detailed in Chapter 1, an electric field $\\mathscr{E}$ exists in the depletion region, and a voltage $\\left(\\psi_{0}-V\\right)$ is present between the $p$-type and $n$-type regions, where $\\psi_{0}$ is the built-in potential and $V$ is the forward bias on the diode. The diode's forward current $I$ consists of holes from the $p$ region and electrons from the $n$ region, which possess sufficient energy to surmount the potential barrier at the junction. Once these carriers cross the junction, they diffuse away as minority carriers.\n\nThe passage of each carrier across the junction, which can be modeled as a random event, depends on the carrier having adequate energy and a velocity directed toward the junction. Thus, the external current $I$, which appears steady, is actually composed of numerous random, independent current pulses. When examined on a sensitive oscilloscope, the trace resembles Fig. 11.2, where $I_{D}$ is the average current.\n\nThe fluctuations in $I$ are termed shot noise and are typically expressed in terms of their mean-square variation around the average value, denoted as $\\overline{i^{2}}$, where\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\overline{i^{2}} & =\\overline{\\left(I-I_{D}\\right)^{2}} \\\\\n& =\\lim _{T \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T}\\left(I-I_{D}\\right)^{2} d t \\tag{11.1}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIt can be demonstrated that if a current $I$ consists of a series of random, independent pulses with an average value $I_{D}$, the resulting noise current has a mean-square value of\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\overline{i^{2}}=2 q I_{D} \\Delta f \\tag{11.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $q$ is the electronic charge $\\left(1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}\\right)$ and $\\Delta f$ is the bandwidth in hertz. This equation indicates that the noise current's mean-square value is directly proportional to the measurement bandwidth $\\Delta f$ (in hertz). Consequently, a noise-current spectral density $i^{2} / \\Delta f$ (with units of square amperes per hertz) can be defined, which remains constant as a function of frequency. Noise with such a spectrum is often referred to as white noise. Since noise is a purely random signal, the instantaneous value of the waveform cannot be predicted at any time. The only available information for circuit calculations is the mean-square value of the signal, as given by (11.2). The bandwidth $\\Delta f$ in (11.2) is determined by the circuit in which the noise source operates.\n\nEquation 11.2 remains valid until the frequency becomes comparable to $1 / \\tau$, where $\\tau$ is the carrier transit time through the depletion region. For most practical electronic devices, $\\tau$ is extremely small, and (11.2) is accurate well into the gigahertz region. A plot of noise-current spectral density versus frequency for a diode is shown in Fig. 11.3, assuming each charge carrier's passage across the depletion region generates a square pulse of current with width $\\tau$.\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nTo calculate the shot noise in a diode current of 1 mA over a bandwidth of 1 MHz, using (11.2), we have\n\n$$\n\\overline{i^{2}}=2 \\times 1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\times 10^{-3} \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{~A}^{2}=3.2 \\times 10^{-16} \\mathrm{~A}^{2}\n$$\n\nand thus\n\n$$\ni=1.8 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{~A} \\mathrm{rms}\n$$\n\n- where $i$ represents the root-mean-square (rms) value of the noise current.\n\nThe impact of shot noise can be represented in the low-frequency, small-signal equivalent circuit of the diode by including a current generator shunting the diode, as illustrated in Fig. 11.4. Since this noise signal has a random phase and is defined solely by its mean-square value, it has no polarity. Thus, the arrow in the current source in Fig. 11.2 is meaningless and is included only to identify the generator as a current source. This practice is adhered to in this chapter when dealing with noise generators having random phases.\n\nThe noise-current signal generated by the shot noise mechanism has an amplitude that varies randomly over time and can only be specified by a probability-density function. It can be shown that the amplitude distribution of shot noise is Gaussian, and the probability-density function $p(I)$ of the diode current is plotted against current in Fig. 11.5 (not to scale). The probability that the diode current lies between $I$ and $(I+d I)$ at any time is given by $p(I) d I$. If $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution, then the diode current amplitude lies between $I_{D} \\pm \\sigma$ for 68 percent of the time. By definition, the variance $\\sigma^{2}$ is the mean-square value of $\\left(I-I_{D}\\right)$, and thus, from (11.1),\n\n$$\n\\sigma^{2}=\\overline{i^{2}}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\sigma=\\sqrt{2 q I_{D} \\Delta f} \\tag{11.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nusing (11.2). Note that, theoretically, the noise amplitude can have positive or negative values approaching infinity. However, the probability decreases rapidly as the amplitude increases, and an effective limit to the noise amplitude is $\\pm 3 \\sigma$. The noise signal remains within these limits for 99.7 percent of the time. A brief description of the Gaussian distribution is provided in Appendix A.3.1 in Chapter 3.\n\nIt is crucial to note that the frequency distribution of noise, as shown in Fig. 11.3, results from the random nature of hole and electron transitions across the $p n$ junction. Consider a scenario where all carriers make transitions with uniform time separation. Since each carrier has a charge of $1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$, a 1-mA current would consist of current pulses every $1.6 \\times 10^{-16} \\mathrm{~s}$. The Fourier analysis of such a waveform would yield the spectrum in Fig. 11.6, which displays an average or dc value $I_{D}$ and harmonics at multiples of $1 / \\Delta t$, where $\\Delta t$ is the period of the waveform and equals $1.6 \\times 10^{-16} \\mathrm{~s}$. Thus, the first harmonic is at $6 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{GHz}$, far beyond the useful frequency range of the device. Consequently, no noise would be produced in the normal frequency range of operation."

The bandwidth $\\Delta f$ in (11.2) is determined by the circuit in which the noise source operates.\n\nEquation 11.2 remains valid until the frequency becomes comparable to $1 / \\tau$, where $\\tau$ is the carrier transit time through the depletion region. For most practical electronic devices, $\\tau$ is extremely small, and (11.2) is accurate well into the gigahertz region. A sketch of the noise-current spectral density versus frequency for a diode is shown in Fig. 11.3, assuming each charge carrier's passage across the depletion region produces a square current pulse with width $\\tau$.\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nTo calculate the shot noise in a diode current of 1 mA over a bandwidth of 1 MHz, using (11.2), we get\n\n$$\n\\overline{i^{2}}=2 \\times 1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\times 10^{-3} \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{~A}^{2}=3.2 \\times 10^{-16} \\mathrm{~A}^{2}\n$$\n\nand thus\n\n$$\ni=1.8 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{~A} \\mathrm{rms}\n$$\n\n- where $i$ represents the root-mean-square (rms) value of the noise current.\n\nThe effect of shot noise can be represented in the low-frequency, small-signal equivalent circuit of the diode by including a current generator shunting the diode, as shown in Fig. 11.4. Since this noise signal has a random phase and is defined solely by its mean-square value, it has no polarity. Thus, the arrow in the current source in Fig. 11.2 is insignificant and is included only to identify the generator as a current source. This practice is followed in this chapter when dealing with noise generators having random phases.\n\nThe noise-current signal generated by the shot noise mechanism has an amplitude that varies randomly with time and can only be specified by a probability-density function. It can be shown that the amplitude distribution of shot noise is Gaussian, and the probability-density function $p(I)$ of the diode current is plotted against current in Fig. 11.5 (not to scale). The probability that the diode current lies between $I$ and $(I+d I)$ at any time is given by $p(I) d I$. If $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution, then the diode current amplitude lies between $I_{D} \\pm \\sigma$ for 68 percent of the time. By definition, the variance $\\sigma^{2}$ is the mean-square value of $\\left(I-I_{D}\\right)$, and thus, from (11.1),\n\n$$\n\\sigma^{2}=\\overline{i^{2}}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\sigma=\\sqrt{2 q I_{D} \\Delta f} \\tag{11.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nusing (11.2). Note that, theoretically, the noise amplitude can have positive or negative values approaching infinity. However, the probability decreases rapidly with increasing amplitude, and an effective limit to the noise amplitude is $\\pm 3 \\sigma$. The noise signal remains within these limits for 99.7 percent of the time. A brief description of the Gaussian distribution is provided in Appendix A.3.1 in Chapter 3.\n\nIt is important to note that the frequency distribution of noise, as shown in Fig. 11.3, results from the random nature of hole and electron transitions across the $p n$ junction. Consider if all carriers made transitions with uniform time separation. Each carrier has a charge of $1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$, so a 1-mA current would consist of current pulses every $1.6 \\times 10^{-16} \\mathrm{~s}$. The Fourier analysis of such a waveform would yield the spectrum shown in Fig. 11.6, which displays an average or dc value $I_{D}$ and harmonics at multiples of $1 / \\Delta t$, where $\\Delta t$ is the period of the waveform and equals $1.6 \\times 10^{-16} \\mathrm{~s}$. Thus, the first harmonic is at $6 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{GHz}$, far beyond the useful frequency range of the device. Consequently, no noise would be produced in the normal frequency range of operation."

The Fourier analysis of such a waveform would yield the spectrum of Fig. 11.6, which shows an average or dc value $I_{D}$ and harmonics at multiples of $1 / \\Delta t$, where $\\Delta t$ is the period of the waveform and equals $1.6 \\times 10^{-16} \\mathrm{~s}$. Thus, the first harmonic is at $6 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{GHz}$, far beyond the useful frequency range of the device. Consequently, no noise would be produced in the normal frequency range of operation."

    "text": "This form of noise is present in all active devices and certain discrete passive components like carbon resistors. The causes of flicker noise are diverse, primarily stemming from traps linked to contamination and crystal defects. These traps randomly capture and release carriers, leading to a noise signal with energy predominantly at low frequencies due to the associated time constants.\n\nFlicker noise, which accompanies direct current flow, exhibits a spectral density described by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\overline{i^{2}}=K_{1} \\frac{I^{a}}{f^{b}} \\Delta f \\tag{11.7}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n```\n$\\Delta f=$ narrow bandwidth at frequency $f$\n$I=$ direct current\n$K_{1}=$ device-specific constant\n$a=$ constant ranging from 0.5 to 2\n$b=$ constant approximately equal to 1\n```\n\nWhen $b=1$ in equation (11.7), the noise spectral density exhibits a $1 / f$ frequency dependence, hence the name $1 / f$ noise, as depicted in Fig. 11.8. It is evident that flicker noise is most pronounced at low frequencies, although in devices with high flicker noise levels, this noise can dominate even at frequencies extending into the megahertz range.\n\nAs previously mentioned, flicker noise is only present with direct current. Thus, in carbon resistors, flicker noise does not appear unless a direct current flows through them (thermal noise, however, is always present and unaffected by direct current as long as the temperature remains stable). Therefore, carbon resistors can be used in low-noise, low-frequency integrated circuits as external elements, provided they do not carry direct current. If these external resistors must conduct direct current, metal film resistors, which do not exhibit flicker noise, should be employed.\n\nEarlier in this chapter, we established that shot and thermal noise signals have well-defined mean-square values expressible in terms of current, resistance, and known physical constants. In contrast, the mean-square value of a flicker noise signal, as per equation (11.7), includes the unknown constant $K_{1}$. This constant not only varies significantly across different device types but also widely among individual transistors or integrated circuits from the same process wafer. This variability is due to the dependence of flicker noise on contamination and crystal imperfections, which can randomly differ even within the same silicon wafer. However, experiments have demonstrated that a typical $K_{1}$ value derived from measurements on multiple devices from a specific process can predict the average or typical flicker noise performance for integrated circuits from that process. ${ }^{9}$\n\nAnother notable aspect of flicker noise is its amplitude distribution, which often deviates from a Gaussian profile, as empirical data has shown.\n\n---\n\n**Figure 11.8 Flicker Noise Spectral Density Versus Frequency:**\n\n1. **Graph Type and Function:**\n   - This is a log-log plot, typically used to illustrate power-law relationships like flicker noise, which is inversely proportional to frequency.\n\n2. **Axes and Units:**\n   - The x-axis represents frequency \\( f \\) on a logarithmic scale.\n   - The y-axis depicts the flicker noise spectral density \\( \\frac{\\bar{i}^2}{\\Delta f} \\) on a logarithmic scale.\n\n3. **Behavior and Trends:**\n   - The plot shows a straight line with a negative slope, reflecting the inverse relationship between noise spectral density and frequency, consistent with the \\( \\frac{1}{f} \\) behavior of flicker noise.\n\n4. **Key Features:**\n   - The line follows a \\( \\frac{1}{f} \\) trend, indicating that noise power decreases with increasing frequency.\n   - No specific markers or annotations denote cutoff frequencies or other critical points, emphasizing the general trend.\n\n5. **Annotations:**\n   - The graph is labeled with \\( \\frac{1}{f} \\) to highlight the inverse frequency relationship.\n   - No numerical values or specific markers are provided, focusing on qualitative behavior rather than quantitative data."

This frequency is crucial as it signifies the start of the spectral density's decline.\n- Beyond \\( f_c \\), the spectral density drops sharply, adhering to a \\( 1/f^2 \\) slope, typical of burst noise with a Lorentzian spectrum.\n- A dashed line on the graph indicates the asymptotic behavior of the spectral density following the \\( 1/f^2 \\) trend.\n\n**Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- The cutoff frequency \\( f_c \\) is explicitly indicated on the graph.\n- No specific numerical values are provided for \\( f_c \\) or spectral density levels, but the graph effectively illustrates the general trend and behavior of burst noise relative to frequency.\n\nFigure 11.9 (a) Typical burst noise waveform. (b) Burst noise spectral density versus frequency.\nimage_name:Figure 11.9 (b)\ndescription:**Type of Graph and Function:**\nThis log-log plot shows the spectral density of burst noise as a function of frequency, depicting how noise power varies with frequency in electronic devices.\n\n**Axes Labels and Units:**\n- The horizontal axis measures frequency \\( f \\) on a logarithmic scale.\n- The vertical axis represents the normalized spectral density \\( \\overline{i^2} / \\Delta f \\) also on a logarithmic scale.\n\n**Overall Behavior and Trends:**\nThe graph reveals a decreasing trend in spectral density with increasing frequency. Initially, the curve drops steeply, indicating high spectral density at low frequencies. As the frequency rises, the curve displays \"Burst noise humps,\" signifying temporary increases in spectral density before resuming its downward trend. At higher frequencies, the curve asymptotically follows a \\( 1/f^2 \\) behavior, indicating a significant drop in spectral density.\n\n**Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The curve starts high on the vertical axis, reflecting high spectral density at low frequencies.\n- \"Burst noise humps\" indicate regions of heightened noise activity, possibly due to specific burst noise events.\n- The asymptotic behavior at high frequencies follows the \\( 1/f^2 \\) trend, characteristic of certain noise types like flicker noise.\n\n**Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- Annotations mark the presence of \"Burst noise humps.\"\n- A note at the graph's right end highlights the asymptotic \\( \\propto 1/f^2 \\) behavior, emphasizing the spectral density decrease with increasing frequency.\n\nFigure 11.10 Spectral density of combined multiple burst noise sources and flicker noise.\n\nThe spectral density of burst noise can be expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\overline{i^{2}}=K_{2} \\frac{I^{c}}{1+\\left(\\frac{f}{f_{c}}\\right)^{2}} \\Delta f \\tag{11.8}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$K_{2}=$ constant specific to a device\n$I=$ direct current\n$c=$ constant ranging from 0.5 to 2\n$f_{c}=$ specific frequency for a given noise process\nThis spectrum is depicted in Fig. $11.9 b$ and showcases the typical hump characteristic of burst noise. At higher frequencies, the noise spectrum decreases as $1 / f^{2}$.\n\nBurst noise processes often involve multiple time constants, resulting in multiple humps in the spectrum. Additionally, flicker noise is always present, leading to a composite low-frequency noise spectrum as seen in Fig. 11.10. Like flicker noise, the factor $K_{2}$ for burst noise varies significantly and must be determined experimentally. The noise amplitude distribution is also non-Gaussian."

    "text": "In a bipolar transistor operating in the forward-active region, minority carriers diffuse and drift through the base region to be collected at the collector-base junction. When these carriers enter the collector-base depletion region, they are accelerated by the existing electric field and swept across to the collector. The arrival time of these diffusing or drifting carriers at the collector-base junction can be modeled as a random process, resulting in the transistor's collector current consisting of a series of random current pulses. Consequently, the collector current $I_{C}$ exhibits full shot noise, as described by equation (11.2), represented by a shot noise current generator $\\bar{i}_{c}^{2}$ from the collector to the emitter in the equivalent circuit depicted in Fig. 11.13.\n\nThe base current $I_{B}$ in a transistor arises from recombination in the base and base-emitter depletion regions, as well as from carrier injection from the base into the emitter.

This condition is typically met if the equivalent noise circuits from previous sections are employed, as all noise sources except the induced gate noise in (11.16) originate from distinct mechanisms and are thus independent.\n\nFor instance, consider two resistors $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ connected in series, as depicted in Fig. 11.17. Resistors $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ have respective noise generators\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& \\overline{v_{1}^{2}}=4 k T R_{1} \\Delta f  \\tag{11.19a}\\\\\n& \\overline{v_{2}^{2}}=4 k T R_{2} \\Delta f \\tag{11.19b}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nTo calculate the mean-square noise voltage $\\overline{v_{T}^{2}}$ produced by these two resistors in series, let $v_{T}(t)$ be the instantaneous total noise voltage, and $v_{1}(t)$ and $v_{2}(t)$ be the instantaneous values of the individual generators. Then\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{T}(t)=v_{1}(t)+v_{2}(t) \\tag{11.20}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand hence\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\overline{v_{T}(t)^{2}} & =\\overline{\\left[v_{1}(t)+v_{2}(t)\\right]^{2}} \\\\\n& =\\overline{v_{1}(t)^{2}}+\\overline{v_{2}(t)^{2}}+\\overline{2 v_{1}(t) v_{2}(t)} \\tag{11.21}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSince the noise generators $v_{1}(t)$ and $v_{2}(t)$ originate from different resistors, they are independent. Therefore, the average value of their product $\\overline{v_{1}(t) v_{2}(t)}$ is zero, and (11.21) simplifies to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\overline{v_{T}^{2}}=\\overline{v_{1}^{2}}+\\overline{v_{2}^{2}} \\tag{11.22}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, the mean-square value of the sum of independent noise generators is the sum of their individual mean-square values. Substituting (11.19a) and (11.19b) into (11.22) yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\overline{v_{T}^{2}}=4 k T\\left(R_{1}+R_{2}\\right) \\Delta f \\tag{11.23}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation 11.23 matches the predicted value for thermal noise in a resistor $\\left(R_{1}+R_{2}\\right)$ using (11.4), ensuring consistency. These results align with the representation of noise generators by independent sinusoids, as previously described. It can be easily shown that when two or more such generators are connected in series, the mean-square value of the total voltage equals the sum of the individual mean-square values.\n\nIn the preceding calculation, two noise voltage sources in series were considered. An analogous result holds for independent noise current sources connected in parallel. The mean-square value of the combination is the sum of the individual mean-square values. This principle was assumed in the modeling of Section 11.3, where, for example, three independent noise-current generators (shot, flicker, and burst) were combined into a single base-emitter noise source for a bipolar transistor."

This condition is typically met if the equivalent noise circuits from previous sections are used, as all noise sources except the induced gate noise in (11.16) originate from different mechanisms and are thus independent.\n\nFor instance, consider two resistors $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ connected in series, as shown in Fig. 11.17. These resistors have respective noise generators\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& \\overline{v_{1}^{2}}=4 k T R_{1} \\Delta f  \\tag{11.19a}\\\\\n& \\overline{v_{2}^{2}}=4 k T R_{2} \\Delta f \\tag{11.19b}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nTo calculate the mean-square noise voltage $\\overline{v_{T}^{2}}$ produced by these two resistors in series, let $v_{T}(t)$ be the instantaneous total noise voltage, and $v_{1}(t)$ and $v_{2}(t)$ the instantaneous values of the individual generators. Then\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{T}(t)=v_{1}(t)+v_{2}(t) \\tag{11.20}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand hence\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\overline{v_{T}(t)^{2}} & =\\overline{\\left[v_{1}(t)+v_{2}(t)\\right]^{2}} \\\\\n& =\\overline{v_{1}(t)^{2}}+\\overline{v_{2}(t)^{2}}+\\overline{2 v_{1}(t) v_{2}(t)} \\tag{11.21}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSince the noise generators $v_{1}(t)$ and $v_{2}(t)$ are from separate resistors, they are independent. Thus, the average value of their product $\\overline{v_{1}(t) v_{2}(t)}$ is zero, and (11.21) simplifies to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\overline{v_{T}^{2}}=\\overline{v_{1}^{2}}+\\overline{v_{2}^{2}} \\tag{11.22}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nTherefore, the mean-square value of the sum of independent noise generators is the sum of their individual mean-square values. Substituting (11.19a) and (11.19b) into (11.22) yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\overline{v_{T}^{2}}=4 k T\\left(R_{1}+R_{2}\\right) \\Delta f \\tag{11.23}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation 11.23 matches the predicted value for thermal noise in a resistor $\\left(R_{1}+R_{2}\\right)$ using (11.4), ensuring consistency. These results align with the representation of noise generators by independent sinusoids, as previously described. It is straightforward to show that when multiple such generators are connected in series, the mean-square value of the total voltage equals the sum of the individual mean-square values.\n\nIn the preceding calculation, two noise voltage sources in series were considered. An analogous result holds for independent noise current sources in parallel, where the mean-square value of the combination is the sum of the individual mean-square values. This principle was assumed in the modeling of Section 11.3, where, for example, three independent noise-current generators (shot, flicker, and burst) were combined into a single base-emitter noise source for a bipolar transistor."

The primary contributor to the output noise in this case is the source resistance \\( R_S \\), followed by the transistor's base resistance. The noise spectrum given by (11.40) is depicted in Fig. 11.19.\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nSuppose the amplifier in the preceding example is followed by stages that limit the bandwidth to a sharp cutoff at 1 MHz. Since the noise spectrum, as shown in Fig. 11.19, does not significantly decline until \\( f_1 = 23.3 \\mathrm{MHz} \\), the noise spectrum can be assumed constant at \\( 5.0 \\times 10^{-15} \\mathrm{~V}^2/\\mathrm{Hz} \\) over the bandwidth from 0 to 1 MHz. Thus, the total noise voltage at the output of the circuit in Fig. 11.18a in a 1-MHz bandwidth is\n\n\\[\n\\overline{v_{oT}^2} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-15} \\times 10^6 \\mathrm{~V}^2 = 5.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{~V}^2\n\\]\n\nand hence\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{oT} = 71 \\mu \\mathrm{V} \\mathrm{rms} \\tag{11.42}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\n\nNow, assume the amplifier in Fig. 11.18a is not followed by stages that limit the bandwidth but is instead fed directly to a wideband detector (such as an oscilloscope or voltmeter). To determine the total output noise voltage in this scenario, the contribution from each frequency increment \\( \\Delta f \\) must be summed at the output. This involves integrating the noise-voltage spectral-density curve of Fig. 11.19 across the detector's bandwidth. For instance, if the detector has a bandwidth from 0 to 50 MHz with a sharp cutoff, the total output noise would be\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\overline{v_{oT}^2} & = \\sum_{f=0}^{50 \\times 10^6} S_o(f) \\Delta f \\\\\n& = \\int_{0}^{50 \\times 10^6} S_o(f) \\, df \\tag{11.43}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\nS_o(f) = \\frac{\\overline{v_o^2}}{\\Delta f} \\tag{11.44}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\n\nis the noise spectral density defined by (11.40). In practice, the precise evaluation of such integrals is often challenging, and approximate methods are frequently employed. Note that if the integration of (11.43) is performed graphically, the noise spectral density versus frequency must be plotted on linear scales."

To determine the total output noise voltage in this case, the contribution from each frequency increment \\( \\Delta f \\) must be summed at the output. This involves integrating across the detector's bandwidth of the noise-voltage spectral-density curve in Fig. 11.19. For instance, if the detector has a 0 to 50-MHz bandwidth with a sharp cutoff, the total output noise would be\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\overline{v_{o T}^{2}} & =\\sum_{f=0}^{50 \\times 10^{6}} S_{o}(f) \\Delta f \\\\\n& =\\int_{0}^{50 \\times 10^{6}} S_{o}(f) d f \\tag{11.43}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\nS_{o}(f)=\\frac{\\overline{v_{o}^{2}}}{\\Delta f} \\tag{11.44}\n\\]\n\nis the noise spectral density defined by (11.40).

Substituting for \\( Z \\) from (11.27) in (11.37), we find\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\overline{v_{o}^{2}}}{\\Delta f}= & g_{m}^{2} R_{L}^{2} \\frac{r_{\\pi}^{2}}{\\left(r_{\\pi}+R_{S}+r_{b}\\right)^{2}} \\frac{1}{1+\\left(\\frac{f}{f_{1}}\\right)^{2}}\\left[4 k T\\left(R_{S}+r_{b}\\right)+\\left(R_{S}+r_{b}\\right)^{2} 2 q I_{B}\\right] \\\\\n& +R_{L}^{2}\\left(4 k T \\frac{1}{R_{L}}+2 q I_{C}\\right) \\tag{11.38}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nf_{1}=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi\\left[r_{\\pi} \\|\\left(R_{S}+r_{b}\\right)\\right] C_{\\pi}} \\tag{11.39}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe output noise-voltage spectral density represented by (11.38) includes a frequency-dependent part and a constant part. The frequency dependence arises because the gain of the stage decreases above frequency \\( f_1 \\), causing the amplified noise from generators \\( \\overline{v_{s}^{2}}, \\overline{v_{b}^{2}} \\), and \\( \\overline{i_{b}^{2}} \\) to also decrease. The constant term in (11.38) is due to noise generators \\( \\overline{i_{l}^{2}} \\) and \\( \\overline{i_{c}^{2}} \\). Note that this noise contribution would also be frequency-dependent if the effect of \\( C_{\\mu} \\) had not been neglected. The noise-voltage spectral density represented by (11.38) matches the form shown in Fig. 11.19.\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nTo provide insight into the numerical aspects, specific values will now be assigned to the parameters in (11.38), and the various terms in the equation will be evaluated. Assume:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{lrr}\nI_{C}=100 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} & \\beta=100 & r_{b}=200 \\Omega \\\\\nR_{S}=500 \\Omega & C_{\\pi}=10 \\mathrm{pF} & \\\\\nR_{L}=5 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega & &\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nSubstituting these values into (11.38) and using \\( 4 k T=1.66 \\times 10^{-20} \\mathrm{~V} \\)-C gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\overline{v_{o}^{2}}}{\\Delta f} & =\\left[5.82 \\times 10^{-18} \\frac{1}{1+\\left(\\frac{f}{f_{1}}\\right)^{2}}(700+9.4)+1.66 \\times 10^{-20}(5000+48,080)\\right] \\mathrm{V}^{2} / \\mathrm{Hz} \\\\\n& =\\left[\\frac{4.13 \\times 10^{-15}}{1+\\left(\\frac{f}{f_{1}}\\right)^{2}}+0.88 \\times 10^{-15}\\right] \\mathrm{V}^{2} / \\mathrm{Hz} \\tag{11.40}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nEquation 11.39 yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nf_{1}=23.3 \\mathrm{MHz} \\tag{11.41}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation 11.40 indicates that the output noise-voltage spectral density is \\( 5.0 \\times 10^{-15} \\mathrm{~V}^2 / \\mathrm{Hz} \\) at low frequencies and approaches \\( 0.88 \\times 10^{-15} \\mathrm{~V}^2 / \\mathrm{Hz} \\) at high frequencies. The primary contributor to the output noise in this case is the source resistance \\( R_S \\), followed by the transistor's base resistance. The noise spectrum described by (11.40) is plotted in Fig. 11.19.\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nSuppose the amplifier in the previous example is followed by stages that limit the bandwidth to a sharp cutoff at 1 MHz. Since the noise spectrum in Fig. 11.19 does not begin to fall significantly until \\( f_1=23.3 \\mathrm{MHz} \\), the noise spectrum can be assumed constant at \\( 5.0 \\times 10^{-15} \\mathrm{~V}^2 / \\mathrm{Hz} \\) over the bandwidth from 0 to 1 MHz. Thus, the total noise voltage at the output of the circuit in Fig. 11.18a within a 1-MHz bandwidth is\n\n$$\n\\overline{v_{o T}^{2}}=5.0 \\times 10^{-15} \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{~V}^{2}=5.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{~V}^{2}\n$$\n\nand hence\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{o T}=71 \\mu \\mathrm{~V} \\mathrm{rms} \\tag{11.42}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nNow, consider the scenario where the amplifier in Fig. 11.18a is not followed by stages that limit the bandwidth but is instead fed directly to a wideband detector (such as an oscilloscope or voltmeter). To find the total output noise voltage in this case, the contribution from each frequency increment \\( \\Delta f \\) must be summed at the output. This involves integrating the noise-voltage spectral-density curve of Fig. 11.19 across the detector's bandwidth. For instance, if the detector has a bandwidth of 0 to 50 MHz with a sharp cutoff, the total output noise would be\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\overline{v_{o T}^{2}} & =\\sum_{f=0}^{50 \\times 10^{6}} S_{o}(f) \\Delta f \\\\\n& =\\int_{0}^{50 \\times 10^{6}} S_{o}(f) d f \\tag{11.43}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nS_{o}(f)=\\frac{\\overline{v_{o}^{2}}}{\\Delta f} \\tag{11.44}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nis the noise spectral density defined by (11.40). In practice, the exact evaluation of such integrals is often challenging, and approximate methods are frequently used. Note that if the integration of (11.43) is performed graphically, the noise spectral density versus frequency must be plotted on linear scales."

    "text": "The calculation of a bipolar transistor's equivalent input noise generators is derived from the circuit depicted in Fig. 11.23a. The output noise is determined with a short-circuited load, and $C_{\\mu}$ is disregarded, with a rationale to follow. The circuit in Fig. $11.23 a$ must be equivalent to Fig. $11.23 b$ in the sense that both should yield the same output noise for any given source impedance.\n\nThe squared value of $\\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$ can be computed by short-circuiting the input of each circuit and setting the output noise currents $i_{o}$ equal. We employ root mean square (rms) noise quantities in the computation, disregarding the preservation of the noise quantities' signs because the noise generators are independent and have random phases. The noise generators' polarity does not influence the result. Short-circuiting the inputs of both circuits in Fig. 11.23 and assuming $r_{b}$ is small ($\\ll r_{\\pi}$), and setting $i_{o}$ equal, we derive\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ng_{m} v_{b}+i_{c}=g_{m} v_{i} \\tag{11.47}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nyielding\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{i}=v_{b}+\\frac{i_{c}}{g_{m}} \\tag{11.48}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAs $r_{b}$ is small, the impact of $\\overline{i_{b}^{2}}$ is disregarded in this calculation.\n\nThe equivalent circuit of a bipolar transistor includes noise generators, encompassing resistors, capacitors, voltage sources, and current sources. These components model the noise behavior, with nodes labeled X1, X2, X3, and V1 representing various connection points in the circuit.\n\nFig. 11.23b represents the noise performance equivalent of a bipolar transistor small-signal model. It includes voltage and current noise sources, resistors, and capacitors that model the transistor's behavior.\n\nUsing the independence of $v_{b}$ and $i_{c}$, we obtain from (11.48),\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\overline{v_{i}^{2}}=\\overline{v_{b}^{2}}+\\frac{\\overline{i_{c}^{2}}}{g_{m}^{2}} \\tag{11.49}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSubstituting $\\overline{v_{b}^{2}}$ and $\\overline{i_{c}^{2}}$ from (11.11) and (11.12) into (11.49) yields\n\n$$\n\\overline{v_{i}^{2}}=4 k \\operatorname{Tr}_{b} \\Delta f+\\frac{2 q I_{C} \\Delta f}{g_{m}^{2}}\n$$\n\nand thus\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\overline{v_{i}^{2}}}{\\Delta f}=4 k T\\left(r_{b}+\\frac{1}{2 g_{m}}\\right) \\tag{11.50}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe equivalent input noise-voltage spectral density of a bipolar transistor is therefore derived from a resistor $R_{\\text {eq }}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\overline{v_{i}^{2}}}{\\Delta f}=4 k T R_{\\mathrm{eq}} \\tag{11.51}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{\\mathrm{eq}}=r_{b}+\\frac{1}{2 g_{m}} \\tag{11.52}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis is known as the equivalent input noise resistance. Of this theoretical resistance, $ portion $r_{b}$ corresponds an physical resistor in series with the input, whereas the portion $1 / 2 g_{m}$ represents the impact of collector current shot noise referred back to the input. Equations 11.50 and 11.52 serve as useful approximations, although the assumption that $r_{b} \\ll r_{\\pi}$ may not hold at high collector bias currents, necessitating a recalculation without such constraints.\n\nEquation 11.50 facilitates a straightforward comparison of the relative significance of noise from $r_{b}$ and $I_{C}$ in contributing to $\\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$. For instance, if $I_{C}=1 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$, then $1 / 2 g_{m}=13 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$ and will dominate typical $r_{b}$ values of around $100 \\Omega$. Conversely, if $I_{C}=10 \\mathrm{~mA}$, then $1 / 2 g_{m}=1.3 \\Omega$ and noise from $r_{b}$ will predominantly influence $\\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$. Since $\\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$ is the crucial noise generator for low source impedance (as $\\overline{i_{i}^{2}}$ tends to be shorted), minimizing $R_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ is essential for optimal noise performance from a low source impedance. This is achieved by designing the transistor to have a low $r_{b}$ and operating the device at a substantial collector bias current to reduce $1 / 2 g_{m}$. Lastly, it should be noted from (11.50) that the equivalent input noise-voltage spectral density of a bipolar transistor is independent of frequency.\n\nTo calculate the equivalent input noise current generator $\\overline{i_{i}^{2}}$, the inputs of both circuits in Fig. 11.23 are open-circuited, and the output noise currents $i_{o}$ are set equal. Employing rms noise quantities, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\beta(j \\omega) i_{i}=i_{c}+\\beta(j \\omega) i_{b} \\tag{11.53}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nyielding\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{i}=i_{b}+\\frac{i_{c}}{\\beta(j \\omega)} \\tag{11.54}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince $i_{b}$ and $i_{c}$ are independent generators, from (11.54) we derive\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\overline{i_{i}^{2}}=\\overline{i_{b}^{2}}+\\frac{\\overline{i_{c}^{2}}}{|\\beta(j \\omega)|^{2}} \\tag{11.55}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\beta(j \\omega)=\\frac{\\beta_{0}}{1+j \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{\\beta}}} \\tag{11.56}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand $\\beta_{0}$ denotes the low-frequency, small-signal current gain. Substituting $\\overline{i_{b}^{2}}$ and $\\overline{i_{c}^{2}}$ from (11.13) and (11.12) into (11.55) yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\overline{i_{i}^{2}}}{\\Delta f}=2 q\\left[I_{B}+K_{1}^{\\prime} \\frac{I_{B}^{a}}{f}+\\frac{I_{C}}{|\\beta(j \\omega)|^{2}}\\right] \\tag{11.57}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nK_{1}^{\\prime}=\\frac{K_{1}}{2 q} \\tag{11.57a}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand the burst noise term is omitted for simplicity. The last term in parentheses in (11.57) represents the effect of collector current noise referred to the input. At low frequencies, this term becomes $I_{C} / \\beta_{0}^{2}$ and is negligible compared with $I_{B}$ for typical $\\beta_{0}$ values. Under these circumstances, $\\overline{i_{i}^{2}}$ and $\\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$ do not share common noise sources and remain independent. However, at high frequencies, the last term in (11.57) increases and can become predominant, potentially leading to correlation between $\\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$ and $\\overline{i_{i}^{2}}$ since both incorporate a contribution from $\\overline{i_{c}^{2}}$.\n\nThe equivalent input noise current spectral density given by (11.57) is sourced from a current $I_{\\text {eq }}$ exhibiting full shot noise, such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\overline{i_{i}^{2}}}{\\Delta f}=2 q I_{\\mathrm{eq}} \\tag{11.58}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{\\mathrm{eq}}=I_{B}+K_{1}^{\\prime} \\frac{I_{B}^{a}}{f}+\\frac{I_{C}}{|\\beta(j \\omega)|^{2}} \\tag{11.59}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis is known as the equivalent input shot noise current. It is a theoretical current composed of the device's base current, a term representing flicker noise, and one representing collector-current noise referred to the input. It is evident from (11.59) that $I_{\\text {eq }}$ is minimized by employing low bias currents in the transistor and using high-$\\beta$ transistors. Given that $\\overline{i_{i}^{2}}$ is the dominant equivalent input noise generator in circuits where the transistor is driven by a high source impedance, low bias currents and high $\\beta$ are essential for optimal noise performance under these conditions. Note that the requirement for low bias currents to minimize $\\overline{i_{i}^{2}}$ contradicts the need for high bias current to minimize $\\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$.\n\nThe spectral density $\\overline{i_{i}^{2}} / \\Delta f$ of the equivalent input noise current generator can be plotted against frequency using (11.57). This is depicted in Fig. 11.24 for typical transistor parameters. In this instance, the spectral density is frequency-dependent at both low and high frequencies, with the low-frequency increase due to flicker noise and the high-frequency increase due to collector-current noise referred to the input. This input-referred noise increases at high frequencies because the transistor current gain begins to decline, explaining the observed degradation in transistor noise performance at high frequencies.\n\nThe frequency $f_{b}$ in Fig. 11.24 marks the intersection of the high-frequency noise asymptote with the midband asymptote. This can be calculated from (11.57) as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\beta(j f)=\\frac{\\beta_{0}}{1+j \\frac{f}{f_{T}} \\beta_{0}} \\tag{11.60}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe graph in Figure 11.24 illustrates the equivalent input noise current spectral density of a bipolar transistor. The y-axis represents the noise current spectral density $\\frac{\\overline{i_i^2}}{\\Delta f}$ in units of $A^2/Hz$, and the x-axis represents frequency $f$ in hertz (Hz), on a logarithmic scale.\n\nThe overall behavior and trends are as follows:\n- **Low-Frequency Region:** The graph exhibits a decreasing trend due to $1/f$ flicker noise behavior.\n- **Midband Region:** The graph reaches a minimum point, indicating the midband region where the noise is relatively constant and at its lowest level.\n- **High-Frequency Region:** Beyond the midband region, the graph rises again, showing $f^2$ behavior corresponding to the increase in noise due to the fall in transistor current gain at high frequencies.\n\nKey features and technical details include:\n- **Intersection Points:** The graph features two significant intersection points:\n  - $f_a$, where flicker noise intersects the midband noise level.\n  - $f_b = 50$ MHz, where high-frequency $f^2$ noise intersects the midband level.\n- **Annotations:** The graph is annotated with noise behaviors $1/f$ and $f^2$ to indicate regions of flicker noise and high-frequency noise, respectively.\n\nAnnotations and specific data points include:\n- Noise levels are marked at approximately $3 \\times 10^{-23}$, $3 \\times 10^{-24}$, and $3 \\times 10^{-25}$ $A^2/Hz$ on the y-axis.\n- Frequency $f$ is marked at intervals from $10^1$ to $10^{10}$ Hz, showing a wide range of frequencies on the logarithmic scale.\n\nThe graph effectively illustrates the behavior of noise in a bipolar transistor across different frequency ranges, highlighting the transition from flicker noise to midband noise, and then to high-frequency noise.\n\nFigure 11.24 depicts the equivalent input noise current spectral density of a bipolar transistor with $I_{C}=100 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}, \\beta_{0}=\\beta_{F}=100, f_{T}=500 \\mathrm{MHz}$. Typical flicker noise is included.\n\nAt high frequencies, the collector current noise term in (11.57) is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n2 q \\frac{I_{C}}{|\\beta(j f)|^{2}}=2 q \\frac{I_{C}}{\\beta_{0}^{2}}\\left(1+\\frac{f^{2}}{f_{T}^{2}} \\beta_{0}^{2}\\right) \\simeq 2 q I_{C} \\frac{f^{2}}{f_{T}^{2}} \\tag{11.61}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation 11.61 demonstrates that the equivalent input noise current spectrum increases as $f^2$ at high frequencies. The frequency $f_{b}$ can be calculated by setting (11.61) equal to the midband noise, which is $2 q\\left[I_{B}+\\left(I_{C} / \\beta_{0}^{2}\\right)\\right]$. For typical $\\beta_{0}$ values, this is approximately $2 q I_{B}$, and setting this quantity equal to (11.61) yields\n\n$$\n2 q I_{B}=2 q I_{C} \\frac{f_{b}^{2}}{f_{T}^{2}}\n$$\n\nand thus\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nf_{b}=f_{T} \\sqrt{\\frac{I_{B}}{I_{C}}} \\tag{11.62}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe large-signal (or dc) current gain is defined as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\beta_{F}=\\frac{I_{C}}{I_{B}} \\tag{11.63}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand thus (11.62) becomes\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nf_{b}=\\frac{f_{T}}{\\sqrt{\\beta_{F}}} \\tag{11.64}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nUsing the data provided in Fig. 11.24, we obtain $f_{b}=50 \\mathrm{MHz}$ for that example.\n\nOnce the equivalent input noise generators have been calculated, the transistor noise performance with any source impedance can be easily determined. For instance, consider the simple circuit of Fig. $11.25 a$ with a source resistance $R_{S}$. The noise performance of this circuit can be represented by the total equivalent noise voltage $\\overline{v_{i N}^{2}}$ in series with the circuit input, as shown in Fig. 11.25b. Neglecting noise in $R_{L}$ (to be discussed later) and setting the total noise voltage at the transistor base in Figs. $11.25 a$ and $11.25 b$ equal, we obtain\n\n$$\nv_{i N}=v_{s}+v_{i}+i_{i} R_{S}\n$$\n\nAssuming no correlation between $v_{i}$ and $i_{i}$, this equation yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\overline{v_{i N}^{2}}=\\overline{v_{s}^{2}}+\\overline{v_{i}^{2}}+\\overline{i_{i}^{2}} R_{S}^{2} \\tag{11.65}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nUsing (11.50) and (11.57) in (11.65) and neglecting flicker noise, we find\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\overline{v_{i N}^{2}}}{\\Delta f}=4 k T R_{S}+4 k T\\left(r_{b}+\\frac{1}{2 g_{m}}\\right)+R_{S}^{2} 2 q\\left[I_{B}+\\frac{I_{C}}{|\\beta(j f)|^{2}}\\right] \\tag{11.66}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation 11.66 is similar to (11.46) if $r_{b}$ is small, as has been assumed."

The last term in parentheses in (11.57) accounts for the collector current noise referred to the input. At low frequencies, this term becomes \\( I_{C} / \\beta_{0}^{2} \\) and is negligible compared to \\( I_{B} \\) for typical \\( \\beta_{0} \\) values. In this scenario, \\( \\overline{i_{i}^{2}} \\) and \\( \\overline{v_{i}^{2}} \\) are independent of common noise sources.

This fictitious current comprises the base current of the device along with terms representing flicker noise and the collector current noise referred to the input. Equation 11.59 suggests that \\( I_{\\text {eq }} \\) is minimized by employing low bias currents and high-\\( \\beta \\) transistors. Since \\( \\overline{i_{i}^{2}} \\) is the primary equivalent input noise generator in circuits fed from a high source impedance, low bias currents and high-\\( \\beta \\) are essential for optimal noise performance under these conditions. Notably, the need for low bias currents to minimize \\( \\overline{i_{i}^{2}} \\) contradicts the requirement for high bias current to minimize \\( \\overline{v_{i}^{2}} \\).\n\nThe spectral density \\( \\overline{i_{i}^{2}} / \\Delta f \\) of the equivalent input noise current generator can be plotted as a function of frequency using (11.57). This is depicted in Fig. 11.24 for typical transistor parameters, revealing frequency-dependent behavior at both low and high frequencies due to flicker noise and collector current noise referred to the input, respectively. The input-referred noise increases at high frequencies due to the transistor current gain decline, explaining the observed degradation in transistor noise performance.\n\nFrequency \\( f_{b} \\) in Fig. 11.24 marks the intersection of the high-frequency noise asymptote with the midband asymptote.

The graph exhibits a low-frequency decreasing trend due to flicker noise, a midband minimum, and a high-frequency rise due to the transistor current gain fall.\n\nUsing the provided data, we calculate \\( f_{b}=50 \\mathrm{MHz} \\) for the given example. Once the input noise generators are determined, the noise performance of the transistor with any source impedance can be easily calculated. For instance, consider the circuit in Fig. 11.25a with a source resistance \\( R_{S} \\). The noise performance can be represented by the total equivalent noise voltage \\( \\overline{v_{i N}^{2}} \\) in series with the input, as shown in Fig. 11.25b. Neglecting noise in \\( R_{L} \\) (to be discussed later) and equating the total noise voltage at the base of the transistor in Figs. 11.25a and 11.25b, we obtain\n\n$$\nv_{i N}=v_{s}+v_{i}+i_{i} R_{S}\n$$\n\nAssuming no correlation between \\( v_{i} \\) and \\( i_{i} \\), this equation yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\overline{v_{i N}^{2}}=\\overline{v_{s}^{2}}+\\overline{v_{i}^{2}}+\\overline{i_{i}^{2}} R_{S}^{2} \\tag{11.65}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nUsing (11.50) and (11.57) in (11.65) and neglecting flicker noise, we find\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\overline{v_{i N}^{2}}}{\\Delta f}=4 k T R_{S}+4 k T\\left(r_{b}+\\frac{1}{2 g_{m}}\\right)+R_{S}^{2} 2 q\\left[I_{B}+\\frac{I_{C}}{|\\beta(j f)|^{2}}\\right] \\tag{11.66}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation 11.66 resembles (11.46) if \\( r_{b} \\) is small, as assumed. The relative contributions of the noise generators are more apparent, and once the equivalent input generators are known for a device, the noise performance can be quickly assessed. For example, in the given scenario, the equivalent input noise current is a negligible factor."

Under these conditions, $\\overline{i_{i}^{2}}$ and $\\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$ do not share common noise sources and are entirely independent. However, at high frequencies, the last term in (11.57) increases and can become dominant, leading to potential correlation between $\\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$ and $\\overline{i_{i}^{2}}$ since both include a contribution from $\\overline{i_{c}^{2}}$.\n\nThe equivalent input noise current spectral density given by (11.57) seems to arise from a current $I_{\\text {eq }}$ exhibiting full shot noise, such that\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\overline{i_{i}^{2}}}{\\Delta f}=2 q I_{\\mathrm{eq}} \\tag{11.58}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{eq}}=I_{B}+K_{1}^{\\prime} \\frac{I_{B}^{a}}{f}+\\frac{I_{C}}{|\\beta(j \\omega)|^{2}} \\tag{11.59}\n$$\n\nThis is termed the equivalent input shot noise current. It is a theoretical current consisting of the base current of the device, a term representing flicker noise, and another representing the collector current noise referred to the input. It is evident from (11.59) that minimizing $I_{\\text {eq }}$ requires the use of low bias currents in the transistor and high-$\\beta$ transistors. Since $\\overline{i_{i}^{2}}$ is the primary equivalent input noise generator in circuits where the transistor is driven by a high source impedance, low bias currents and high $\\beta$ are essential for optimal noise performance under these conditions. Note that the need for low bias currents to minimize $\\overline{i_{i}^{2}}$ contradicts the requirement for high bias currents to minimize $\\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$.\n\nThe spectral density $\\overline{i_{i}^{2}} / \\Delta f$ of the equivalent input noise current generator can be plotted against frequency using (11.57). This is demonstrated in Fig. 11.24 for typical transistor parameters. In this case, the spectral density is frequency-dependent at both low and high frequencies, with the low-frequency rise due to flicker noise and the high-frequency rise due to the collector current noise referred to the input. The input-referred noise increases at high frequencies because the transistor current gain begins to decrease, which is the reason for the observed degradation in transistor noise performance at high frequencies.\n\nFrequency $f_{b}$ in Fig. 11.24 is where the high-frequency noise asymptote intersects the midband asymptote. This can be calculated from (11.57) as follows:\n\n$$\n\\beta(j f)=\\frac{\\beta_{0}}{1+j \\frac{f}{f_{T}} \\beta_{0}} \\tag{11.60}\n$$\n\nFigure 11.24 depicts the equivalent input noise current spectral density of a bipolar transistor. The y-axis represents the noise current spectral density $\\frac{\\overline{i_i^2}}{\\Delta f}$ in units of $A^2/Hz$, and the x-axis represents frequency $f$ in hertz (Hz), on a logarithmic scale.\n\nOverall Behavior and Trends:\n- **Low-Frequency Region:** At low frequencies, the graph shows a decreasing trend, characterized by a $\\frac{1}{f}$ flicker noise behavior. This is evident from the initial downward slope on the left side of the graph.\n- **Midband Region:** As the frequency increases, the graph reaches a minimum point, indicating the midband region where the noise is relatively constant and at its lowest level.\n- **High-Frequency Region:** Beyond this midband region, the graph begins to rise again, showing an $f^2$ behavior, which corresponds to the increase in noise due to the fall in transistor current gain at high frequencies.\n\nKey Features and Technical Details:\n- **Intersection Points:** The graph includes two significant intersection points:\n  - $f_a$, where the flicker noise $\\frac{1}{f}$ intersects the midband noise level.\n  - $f_b = 50$ MHz, where the high-frequency $f^2$ noise intersects the midband level.\n- **Annotations:** The graph is annotated with the noise behaviors $\\frac{1}{f}$ and $f^2$ to indicate the regions of flicker noise and high-frequency noise, respectively.\n\nAnnotations and Specific Data Points:\n- The noise level is marked at approximately $3 \\times 10^{-23}$, $3 \\times 10^{-24}$, and $3 \\times 10^{-25}$ $A^2/Hz$ on the y-axis.\n- The frequency $f$ is marked at intervals from $10^1$ to $10^{10}$ Hz, showing a wide range of frequencies on the logarithmic scale.\n\nThis graph effectively illustrates the behavior of noise in a bipolar transistor across different frequency ranges, highlighting the transition from flicker noise to midband noise, and then to high-frequency noise.\n\nFigure 11.24 shows the equivalent input noise current spectral density of a bipolar transistor with $I_{C}=100 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}, \\beta_{0}=\\beta_{F}=100, f_{T}=500 \\mathrm{MHz}$. Typical flicker noise is included, where $\\beta_{0}$ is the small-signal current gain at low frequencies. Hence, the collector current noise term in (11.57) is\n\n$$\n2 q \\frac{I_{C}}{|\\beta(j f)|^{2}}=2 q \\frac{I_{C}}{\\beta_{0}^{2}}\\left(1+\\frac{f^{2}}{f_{T}^{2}} \\beta_{0}^{2}\\right) \\simeq 2 q I_{C} \\frac{f^{2}}{f_{T}^{2}} \\tag{11.61}\n$$\n\nat high frequencies. Equation 11.61 shows that the equivalent input noise current spectrum rises as $f^{2}$ at high frequencies. Frequency $f_{b}$ can be calculated by equating (11.61) to the midband noise, which is $2 q\\left[I_{B}+\\left(I_{C} / \\beta_{0}^{2}\\right)\\right]$. For typical values of $\\beta_{0}$, this is approximately $2 q I_{B}$, and equating this quantity to (11.61) we obtain\n\n$$\n2 q I_{B}=2 q I_{C} \\frac{f_{b}^{2}}{f_{T}^{2}}\n$$\n\nand thus\n\n$$\nf_{b}=f_{T} \\sqrt{\\frac{I_{B}}{I_{C}}} \\tag{11.62}\n$$\n\nThe large-signal (or dc) current gain is defined as\n\n$$\n\\beta_{F}=\\frac{I_{C}}{I_{B}} \\tag{11.63}\n$$\n\nand thus (11.62) becomes\n\n$$\nf_{b}=\\frac{f_{T}}{\\sqrt{\\beta_{F}}} \\tag{11.64}\n$$\n\nUsing the data provided in Fig. 11.24, we find $f_{b}=50 \\mathrm{MHz}$ for that example.\n\nOnce the input noise generators have been calculated, the noise performance of the transistor with any source impedance can be readily determined.

The input-referred noise increases at high frequencies as the transistor current gain decreases, explaining the observed degradation in transistor noise performance at high frequencies.\n\nFrequency $f_{b}$ in Fig. 11.24 marks the intersection of the high-frequency noise asymptote with the midband asymptote. This can be calculated from (11.57) as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\beta(j f)=\\frac{\\beta_{0}}{1+j \\frac{f}{f_{T}} \\beta_{0}} \\tag{11.60}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe graph in Figure 11.24 illustrates the equivalent input noise current spectral density of a bipolar transistor, where the y-axis represents the noise current spectral density $\\frac{\\overline{i_i^2}}{\\Delta f}$ in units of $A^2/Hz$, and the x-axis represents frequency $f$ in hertz (Hz) on a logarithmic scale.\n\nAt low frequencies, the graph exhibits a decreasing trend due to flicker noise, reaching a minimum in the midband region where noise is relatively constant and at its lowest level. Beyond this, the graph rises again, showing an $f^2$ behavior due to the increase in noise from the fall in transistor current gain at high frequencies.\n\nThe graph includes two significant intersection points: $f_a$, where flicker noise intersects the midband noise level, and $f_b = 50$ MHz, where high-frequency noise intersects the midband level. The graph is annotated with the noise behaviors $\\frac{1}{f}$ and $f^2$ to indicate the regions of flicker noise and high-frequency noise, respectively.\n\nThe noise level is marked at approximately $3 \\times 10^{-23}$, $3 \\times 10^{-24}$, and $3 \\times 10^{-25}$ $A^2/Hz$ on the y-axis, while the frequency $f$ is marked at intervals from $10^1$ to $10^{10}$ Hz, showing a wide range of frequencies on the logarithmic scale.\n\nThis graph effectively illustrates the noise behavior of a bipolar transistor across different frequency ranges, highlighting the transition from flicker noise to midband noise, and then to high-frequency noise.\n\nUsing the data given in Fig. 11.24, we obtain $f_{b}=50 \\mathrm{MHz}$ for that example.\n\nOnce the input noise generators have been calculated, the transistor noise performance with any source impedance can be readily determined. For instance, consider the simple circuit of Fig. $11.25a$ with a source resistance $R_{S}$. The noise performance of this circuit can be represented by the total equivalent noise voltage $\\overline{v_{i N}^{2}}$ in series with the input of the circuit as shown in Fig. 11.25b. Neglecting noise in $R_{L}$ (to be discussed later) and equating the total noise voltage at the base of the transistor in Figs. $11.25a$ and $11.25b$, we obtain:\n\n$$\nv_{i N}=v_{s}+v_{i}+i_{i} R_{S}\n$$\n\nAssuming no correlation between $v_{i}$ and $i_{i}$, this equation gives:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\overline{v_{i N}^{2}}=\\overline{v_{s}^{2}}+\\overline{v_{i}^{2}}+\\overline{i_{i}^{2}} R_{S}^{2} \\tag{11.65}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nUsing (11.50) and (11.57) in (11.65) and neglecting flicker noise, we find:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\overline{v_{i N}^{2}}}{\\Delta f}=4 k T R_{S}+4 k T\\left(r_{b}+\\frac{1}{2 g_{m}}\\right)+R_{S}^{2} 2 q\\left[I_{B}+\\frac{I_{C}}{|\\beta(j f)|^{2}}\\right] \\tag{11.66}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation 11.66 is similar to (11.46) if $r_{b}$ is small, as assumed.\n\nUsing data from the example in Section 11.4.1, calculate the total input noise voltage for the circuit of Fig. 11.25a in a bandwidth of 0 to 1 MHz, neglecting flicker noise and using (11.66). At low frequencies, (11.66) simplifies to:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\overline{\\frac{v_{i N}^{2}}{\\Delta f}} & =4 k T\\left(R_{S}+r_{b}+\\frac{1}{2 g_{m}}\\right)+R_{S}^{2} 2 q I_{B} \\\\\n& =\\left[1.66 \\times 10^{-20}(500+200+130)+500^{2} \\times 3.2 \\times 10^{-19} \\times 10^{-6}\\right] \\mathrm{V}^{2} / \\mathrm{Hz} \\\\\n& =(13.8+0.08) \\times 10^{-18} \\mathrm{~V}^{2} / \\mathrm{Hz} \\\\\n& =13.9 \\times 10^{-18} \\mathrm{~V}^{2} / \\mathrm{Hz}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe total input noise in a 1-MHz bandwidth is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\overline{v_{i N T}^{2}} & =13.9 \\times 10^{-18} \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{~V}^{2} \\\\\n& =13.9 \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{~V}^{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand thus:\n\n$$\nv_{i N T}=3.73 \\mu \\mathrm{~V} \\mathrm{rms}\n$$\n\nThis is nearly identical to the result obtained in Section 11.4.1. However, the method described above has the advantage that once the equivalent input generators are known for a specific device, the answer can be quickly derived with minimal effort.\n\nAdditionally\nThe calculation of the input noise generators for a bipolar transistor can be derived from the equivalent circuit depicted in Fig. 11.23a. The output noise is computed with a short-circuited load, while the effect of $C_{\\mu}$ is ignored, with justification to follow. The circuit of Fig. $11.23a$ must correspond to that of Fig. $11.23b$ such that both circuits yield identical output noise regardless of the source impedance.\n\nTo determine the value of $\\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$, we short-circuit the input of each circuit and set the output noise currents $i_{o}$ equal. The calculations employ root mean square (rms) noise quantities without concern for the noise quantity signs, since the noise generators are independent and exhibit random phases. Short-circuiting the inputs of the circuits in Fig. 11.23,假定$r_{b}$较小（$\\ll r_{\\pi}$），and setting $i_{o}$ equal, we obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ng_{m} v_{b}+i_{c}=g_{m} v_{i} \\tag{11.47}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nyielding\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{i}=v_{b}+\\frac{i_{c}}{g_{m}} \\tag{11.48}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAs $r_{b}$ is small, the impact of $\\overline{i_{b}^{2}}$ is disregarded in this computation.\n\nThe small-signal equivalent circuit of a bipolar transistor includes noise generators and comprises resistors, capacitors, voltage sources, and current sources to model the noise characteristics.

The calculation of output noise is performed with a short-circuited load, while the effect of \\( C_{\\mu} \\) is disregarded, an assumption that will be validated subsequently. The objective is to ensure that the circuit in Fig. 11.23a and that in Fig. 11.23b produce identical output noise regardless of the source impedance.\n\nTo find the value of \\( \\overline{v_{i}^{2}} \\), the input of each circuit is short-circuited, and the output noise currents \\( i_{o} \\) are equated. The calculations employ root mean square (rms) noise values, without concern for preserving the signs of the noise quantities, given their independence and random phases.

Nodes X1, X2, X3, and V1 denote different connection points in the circuit. Image (b) represents the noise performance equivalent of a bipolar transistor small-signal model, including voltage and current noise sources, resistors, and capacitors.\n\nFigures 11.23(a) and 11.23(b) illustrate the small-signal equivalent circuit with noise generators and the representation of noise performance by equivalent input generators, respectively.\n\nConsidering \\( v_{b} \\) and \\( i_{c} \\) as independent, equation (11.48) yields:\n\n\\[\n\\overline{v_{i}^{2}} = \\overline{v_{b}^{2}} + \\frac{\\overline{i_{c}^{2}}}{g_{m}^{2}} \\tag{11.49}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( \\overline{v_{b}^{2}} \\) and \\( \\overline{i_{c}^{2}} \\) from equations (11.11) and (11.12) into (11.49) results in:\n\n\\[\n\\overline{v_{i}^{2}} = 4 k T r_{b} \\Delta f + \\frac{2 q I_{C} \\Delta f}{g_{m}^{2}}\n\\]\n\ntherefore:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\overline{v_{i}^{2}}}{\\Delta f} = 4 k T \\left(r_{b} + \\frac{1}{2 g_{m}}\\right) \\tag{11.50}\n\\]\n\nThus, the equivalent input noise-voltage spectral density of a bipolar transistor appears to stem from a resistor \\( R_{\\text{eq}} \\) such that:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\overline{v_{i}^{2}}}{\\Delta f} = 4 k T R_{\\mathrm{eq}} \\tag{11.51}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n\\[\nR_{\\mathrm{eq}} = r_{b} + \\frac{1}{2 g_{m}} \\tag{11.52}\n\\]\n\nThis is termed the equivalent input noise resistance. The portion \\( r_{b} \\) is a physical resistor in series with the input, whereas \\( \\frac{1}{2 g_{m}} \\) signifies the influence of collector current shot noise referenced back to the input. Equations 11.50 and 11.52 are useful approximations, although the assumption \\( r_{b} \\ll r_{\\pi} \\) may not hold at high collector bias currents, necessitating a recalculation without this constraint.\n\nEquation 11.50 facilitates a straightforward comparison of the relative significance of noise from \\( r_{b} \\) and \\( I_{C} \\) in contributing to \\( \\overline{v_{i}^{2}} \\). For instance, if \\( I_{C} = 1 \\mu \\text{A} \\), then \\( \\frac{1}{2 g_{m}} = 13 \\text{k}\\Omega \\) and will predominantly influence typical \\( r_{b} \\) values around \\( 100 \\Omega \\). Conversely, if \\( I_{C} = 10 \\text{mA} \\), then \\( \\frac{1}{2 g_{m}} = 1.3 \\Omega \\), and noise from \\( r_{b} \\) will largely dominate \\( \\overline{v_{i}^{2}} \\). Given that \\( \\overline{v_{i}^{2}} \\) is the primary noise generator for low source impedance (since \\( \\overline{i_{i}^{2}} \\) tends to be shunted), minimizing \\( R_{\\mathrm{eq}} \\) is essential for optimal noise performance at low source impedance. This is achieved by designing the transistor with a low \\( r_{b} \\) and operating it at a high collector bias current to reduce \\( \\frac{1}{2 g_{m}} \\). Additionally, equation 11.50 reveals that the equivalent input noise-voltage spectral density of a bipolar transistor is frequency-independent.\n\nTo calculate the equivalent input noise current generator \\( \\overline{i_{i}^{2}} \\), the inputs of both circuits in Fig. 11.23 are open-circuited, and the output noise currents \\( i_{o} \\) are equated. Employing rms noise quantities yields:\n\n\\[\n\\beta(j \\omega) i_{i} = i_{c} + \\beta(j \\omega) i_{b} \\tag{11.53}\n\\]\n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\ni_{i} = i_{b} + \\frac{i_{c}}{\\beta(j \\omega)} \\tag{11.54}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( i_{b} \\) and \\( i_{c} \\) are independent generators, equation (11.54) leads to:\n\n\\[\n\\overline{i_{i}^{2}} = \\overline{i_{b}^{2}} + \\frac{\\overline{i_{c}^{2}}}{|\\beta(j \\omega)|^{2}} \\tag{11.55}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n\\[\n\\beta(j \\omega) = \\frac{\\beta_{0}}{1 + j \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{\\beta}}} \\tag{11.56}\n\\]\n\nand \\( \\beta_{0} \\) is the low-frequency, small-signal current gain. Substituting \\( \\overline{i_{b}^{2}} \\) and \\( \\overline{i_{c}^{2}} \\) from equations (11.13) and (11.12) into (11.55) gives:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\overline{i_{i}^{2}}}{\\Delta f} = 2 q \\left[I_{B} + K_{1}^{\\prime} \\frac{I_{B}^{a}}{f} + \\frac{I_{C}}{|\\beta(j \\omega)|^{2}}\\right] \\tag{11.57}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n\\[\nK_{1}^{\\prime} = \\frac{K_{1}}{2 q} \\tag{11.57a}\n\\]\n\nand the burst noise term has been omitted for simplicity. The last term in parentheses in (11.57) represents the collector current noise referred to the input. At low frequencies, this becomes \\( I_{C} / \\beta_{0}^{2} \\) and is negligible compared to \\( I_{B} \\) for typical \\( \\beta_{0} \\) values. Under these conditions, \\( \\overline{i_{i}^{2}} \\) and \\( \\overline{v_{i}^{2}} \\) lack common noise sources and are completely independent. However, at high frequencies, the last term in (11.57) grows and can become dominant, making the correlation between \\( \\overline{v_{i}^{2}} \\) and \\( \\overline{i_{i}^{2}} \\) significant since both include contributions from \\( \\overline{i_{c}^{2}} \\).\n\nThe equivalent input noise current spectral density given by (11.57) seems to originate from a current \\( I_{\\text{eq}} \\) exhibiting full shot noise, such that:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\overline{i_{i}^{2}}}{\\Delta f} = 2 q I_{\\mathrm{eq}} \\tag{11.58}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n\\[\nI_{\\mathrm{eq}} = I_{B} + K_{1}^{\\prime} \\frac{I_{B}^{a}}{f} + \\frac{I_{C}}{|\\beta(j \\omega)|^{2}} \\tag{11.59}\n\\]\n\nThis is referred to as the equivalent input shot noise current. This hypothetical current comprises the base current of the device plus terms signifying flicker noise and collector-current noise transformed to the input. It is evident from (11.59) that \\( I_{\\text{eq}} \\) is minimized by using low bias currents in the transistor and high-\\( \\beta \\) transistors. Since \\( \\overline{i_{i}^{2}} \\) is the predominant equivalent input noise generator in circuits where the transistor is driven by a high source impedance, low bias currents and high \\( \\beta \\) are crucial for optimal noise performance under these circumstances. Notably, the requirement for low bias currents to minimize \\( \\overline{i_{i}^{2}} \\) contradicts the need for high bias current to minimize \\( \\overline{v_{i}^{2}} \\).\n\nThe spectral density \\( \\overline{i_{i}^{2}} / \\Delta f \\) of the equivalent input noise current generator can be plotted against frequency using (11.57). This is illustrated in Fig. 11.24 for typical transistor parameters. In this case, the spectral density is frequency-dependent at both low and high frequencies, with the low-frequency rise attributed to flicker noise and the high-frequency rise due to collector-current noise referred to the input. The input-referred noise increases at high frequencies because the transistor current gain starts to decline, accounting for the observed degradation in transistor noise performance at high frequencies.\n\nFrequency \\( f_{b} \\) in Fig. 11.24 marks the intersection of the high-frequency noise asymptote with the midband asymptote. This can be calculated from (11.57) as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\beta(j f) = \\frac{\\beta_{0}}{1 + j \\frac{f}{f_{T}} \\beta_{0}} \\tag{11.60}\n\\]\n\nThe graph in Figure 11.24 depicts the equivalent input noise current spectral density of a bipolar transistor. The y-axis represents the noise current spectral density \\( \\frac{\\overline{i_i^2}}{\\Delta f} \\) in units of \\( A^2/Hz \\), and the x-axis represents frequency \\( f \\) in hertz (Hz), on a logarithmic scale.\n\nThe overall behavior and trends are as follows:\n\n- **Low-Frequency Region:** At low frequencies, the graph shows a decreasing trend, indicative of \\( \\frac{1}{f} \\) flicker noise behavior. This is seen in the initial downward slope on the left side of the graph.\n- **Midband Region:** As the frequency increases, the graph reaches a minimum point, indicating the midband region where the noise is relatively constant and at its lowest level.\n- **High-Frequency Region:** Beyond the midband region, the graph starts to rise again, displaying \\( f^2 \\) behavior, which corresponds to the increase in noise due to the decrease in transistor current gain at high frequencies.\n\nKey features and technical details include:\n\n- **Intersection Points:** The graph includes two significant intersection points:\n  - \\( f_a \\), where the flicker noise \\( \\frac{1}{f} \\) intersects the midband noise level.\n  - \\( f_b = 50 \\) MHz, where the high-frequency \\( f^2 \\) noise intersects the midband level.\n- **Annotations:** The graph is annotated with the noise behaviors \\( \\frac{1}{f} \\) and \\( f^2 \\) to denote the regions of flicker noise and high-frequency noise, respectively.\n\nAnnotations and specific data points include:\n\n- The noise level is indicated at approximately \\( 3 \\times 10^{-23} \\), \\( 3 \\times 10^{-24} \\), and \\( 3 \\times 10^{-25} \\) \\( A^2/Hz \\) on the y-axis.\n- The frequency \\( f \\) is marked at intervals from \\( 10^1 \\) to \\( 10^{10} \\) Hz, showing a wide range of frequencies on the logarithmic scale.\n\nThis graph effectively illustrates the noise behavior of a bipolar transistor across different frequency ranges, highlighting the transition from flicker noise to midband noise, and then to high-frequency noise.\n\nFigure 11.24 represents the equivalent input noise current spectral density of a bipolar transistor with \\( I_{C} = 100 \\mu \\text{A}, \\beta_{0} = \\beta_{F} = 100, f_{T} = 500 \\text{MHz} \\). Typical flicker noise is included.\n\nUsing the data given in Fig. 11.24, \\( f_{b} = 50 \\text{MHz} \\) is obtained for that example.\n\nOnce the input noise generators have been calculated, the noise performance of the transistor with any source impedance can be easily determined. For instance, consider the simple circuit of Fig. 11.25a with a source resistance \\( R_{S} \\). The noise performance of this circuit can be represented by the total equivalent noise voltage \\( \\overline{v_{i N}^{2}} \\) in series with the circuit's input, as shown in Fig. 11.25b. Neglecting noise in \\( R_{L} \\) (to be discussed later) and equating the total noise voltage at the transistor's base in Figs. 11.25a and 11.25b, we obtain:\n\n\\[\nv_{i N} = v_{s} + v_{i} + i_{i} R_{S}\n\\]\n\nAssuming no correlation between \\( v_{i} \\) and \\( i_{i} \\), this equation yields:\n\n\\[\n\\overline{v_{i N}^{2}} = \\overline{v_{s}^{2}} + \\overline{v_{i}^{2}} + \\overline{i_{i}^{2}} R_{S}^{2} \\tag{11.65}\n\\]\n\nUsing equations (11.50) and (11.57) in (11.65) and disregarding flicker noise, we find:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\overline{v_{i N}^{2}}}{\\Delta f} = 4 k T R_{S} + 4 k T \\left(r_{b} + \\frac{1}{2 g_{m}}\\right) + R_{S}^{2} 2 q \\left[I_{B} + \\frac{I_{C}}{|\\beta(j f)|^{2}}\\right] \\tag{11.66}\n\\]\n\nEquation 11.66 resembles (11.46) if \\( r_{b} \\) is small, as assumed.\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nUsing data from the example in Section 11.4.1, calculate the total input noise voltage for the circuit of Fig. 11.25a within a bandwidth of 0 to 1 MHz, neglecting flicker noise, and using equation (11.66). At low frequencies, equation (11.66) simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\overline{\\frac{v_{i N}^{2}}{\\Delta f}} = 4 k T \\left(R_{S} + r_{b} + \\frac{1}{2 g_{m}}\\right) + R_{S}^{2} 2 q I_{B}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\left[1.66 \\times 10^{-20}(500 + 200 + 130) + 500^{2} \\times 3.2 \\times 10^{-19} \\times 10^{-6}\\right] \\text{V}^{2}/\\text{Hz}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= (13.8 + 0.08) \\times 10^{-18} \\text{V}^{2}/\\text{Hz}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 13.9 \\times 10^{-18} \\text{V}^{2}/\\text{Hz}\n\\]\n\nThe total input noise in a 1-MHz bandwidth is:\n\n\\[\n\\overline{v_{i N T}^{2}} = 13.9 \\times 10^{-18} \\times 10^{6} \\text{V}^{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 13.9 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{V}^{2}\n\\]\n\nand thus:\n\n\\[\nv_{i N T} = 3.73 \\mu \\text{V rms}\n\\]\n\nThis result is almost identical to that obtained in Section 11.4.1. However, the method described above has the advantage that once the equivalent input generators are known for a particular device, the answer can be quickly ascertained with minimal effort.\n\nAdditionally, the relative contributions of various noise generators are more apparent. In this case, the equivalent input noise current is clearly a negligible factor."

The equivalent input noise-voltage spectral density for a typical MOS transistor is plotted against frequency in Fig. 11.27. Unlike bipolar transistors, the MOS transistor's equivalent input noise-voltage generator includes flicker noise, which often extends into the megahertz range.\n\nIn MOS field-effect transistors, the presence of electron energy states at the $\\mathrm{Si}^{-} \\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ interface typically results in an input-referred flicker noise component that exceeds the thermal noise component for frequencies below 1 to 10 kHz under most bias conditions and device geometries. Therefore, accurately representing the input-referred flicker noise component in MOS transistors is crucial for optimizing the noise performance of MOS analog circuits.\n\nThe physical mechanisms causing $1 / f$ noise in MOS transistors have been extensively studied. The exact magnitude of the input-referred flicker noise depends on the transistor's bias conditions and device geometry, influenced by the fabrication process details. Generally, the magnitude of the input-referred flicker noise component is roughly independent of bias current and voltage but inversely proportional to the active gate area of the transistor. This is because a larger transistor has more surface states under the gate, leading to an averaging effect that reduces overall noise. The input-referred flicker noise is also inversely related to the gate-oxide capacitance per unit area, as surface states can be viewed as a time-varying component of the surface-state charge $Q_{s s}$. From (1.139), this produces a time-varying component in the threshold voltage inversely proportional to $C_{o x}$. For a MOS transistor, the equivalent input-referred voltage noise can often be expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\overline{v_{i}^{2}}}{\\Delta f}=4 k T \\frac{2}{3} \\frac{1}{g_{m}}+\\frac{K_{f}}{W L C_{o x} f} \\tag{11.69}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nA typical value for $K_{f}$ is $3 \\times 10^{-24} \\mathrm{~V}^{2}-\\mathrm{F}$, or $3 \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{~V}^{2}-\\mathrm{pF}$.\n\nThe equivalent input noise-current generator $i_{i}^{2}$ for the MOSFET can be determined by open-circuiting the input of each circuit in Fig. 11.26 and equating the output noise, resulting in\n\n$$\ni_{i} \\frac{g_{m}}{j \\omega C_{g s}}=i_{g} \\frac{g_{m}}{j \\omega C_{g s}}+i_{d}\n$$\n\nwhich simplifies to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{i}=i_{g}+\\frac{j \\omega C_{g s}}{g_{m}} i_{d} \\tag{11.70}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince $i_{g}$ and $i_{d}$ are independent generators, (11.70) can be rewritten as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\overline{i_{i}^{2}}=\\overline{i_{g}^{2}}+\\frac{\\omega^{2} C_{g s}^{2}}{g_{m}^{2}} \\overline{i_{d}^{2}} \\tag{11.71}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIgnoring (11.16) and substituting (11.14) and (11.15) into (11.17) yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\overline{i_{i}^{2}}}{\\Delta f}=2 q I_{G}+\\frac{\\omega^{2} C_{g s}^{2}}{g_{m}^{2}}\\left(4 k T \\frac{2}{3} g_{m}+K \\frac{I_{D}^{a}}{f}\\right) \\tag{11.72}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn (11.72), the ac current gain of the MOS transistor is identified as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nA_{I}=\\frac{g_{m}}{\\omega C_{g s}} \\tag{11.73}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, the noise generators at the output are divided by $A_{I}^{2}$ when referred back to the input. At low frequencies, the input noise-current generator is determined by the gate leakage current $I_{G}$, which is very small ( $10^{-15}$ A or less). Consequently, MOS transistors exhibit superior noise performance compared to bipolar transistors when the driving source impedance is large. Under these conditions, the input noise-current generator is dominant and much smaller for a MOS transistor than for a bipolar transistor. However, it is important to note that the input noise-voltage generator of a bipolar transistor in (11.50) is typically smaller than that of a MOS transistor in (11.68a) due to the bipolar transistor's larger $g_{m}$ for a given bias current. Therefore, for low source impedances, a bipolar transistor often has superior noise performance compared to a MOS transistor."

Additionally, the input-referred flicker noise is inversely related to the gate-oxide capacitance per unit area, which is physically reasonable as surface states can be viewed as a time-varying component of the surface-state charge $Q_{s s}$.

For a MOS transistor, the equivalent input-referred voltage noise can often be expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\overline{v_{i}^{2}}}{\\Delta f}=4 k T \\frac{2}{3} \\frac{1}{g_{m}}+\\frac{K_{f}}{W L C_{o x} f} \\tag{11.69}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nA typical value for $K_{f}$ is $3 \\times 10^{-24} \\mathrm{~V}^{2}-\\mathrm{F}$, or $3 \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{~V}^{2}-\\mathrm{pF}$.\n\nThe equivalent input noise-current generator $i_{i}^{2}$ for the MOSFET can be determined by open-circuiting the input of each circuit in Fig. 11.26 and equating the output noise, yielding\n\n$$\ni_{i} \\frac{g_{m}}{j \\omega C_{g s}}=i_{g} \\frac{g_{m}}{j \\omega C_{g s}}+i_{d}\n$$\n\nthus\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{i}=i_{g}+\\frac{j \\omega C_{g s}}{g_{m}} i_{d} \\tag{11.70}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince $i_{g}$ and $i_{d}$ are independent generators, (11.70) can be rewritten as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\overline{i_{i}^{2}}=\\overline{i_{g}^{2}}+\\frac{\\omega^{2} C_{g s}^{2}}{g_{m}^{2}} \\overline{i_{d}^{2}} \\tag{11.71}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIgnoring (11.16) and substituting (11.14) and (11.15) into (11.17) results in\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\overline{i_{i}^{2}}}{\\Delta f}=2 q I_{G}+\\frac{\\omega^{2} C_{g s}^{2}}{g_{m}^{2}}\\left(4 k T \\frac{2}{3} g_{m}+K \\frac{I_{D}^{a}}{f}\\right) \\tag{11.72}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn (11.72), the ac current gain of the MOS transistor is identified as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nA_{I}=\\frac{g_{m}}{\\omega C_{g s}} \\tag{11.73}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, the noise generators at the output are divided by $A_{I}^{2}$ when referred back to the input. At low frequencies, the input noise-current generator is dominated by the gate leakage current $I_{G}$, which is very small ( $10^{-15}$ A or less). Consequently, MOS transistors exhibit superior noise performance compared to bipolar transistors when the driving source impedance is large, as the input noise-current generator is smaller for MOS transistors. However, it should be noted that the input noise-voltage generator of a bipolar transistor in (11.50) is typically smaller than that of a MOS transistor in (11.68a) due to the bipolar transistor's larger $g_{m}$ for a given bias current. Therefore, for low source impedances, bipolar transistors often have better noise performance than MOS transistors."

For $g_{m}=1 \\mathrm{~mA} / \\mathrm{V}$, this results in $R_{\\mathrm{eq}}=667 \\Omega$, which is notably higher than that for a bipolar transistor at a similar bias current (approximately 1 mA). The equivalent input noise-voltage spectral density for a typical MOS transistor is plotted against frequency in Fig. 11.27. Unlike bipolar transistors, the equivalent input noise-voltage generator for a MOS transistor includes flicker noise, which often extends into the megahertz range.\n\nIn MOS field-effect transistors, the presence of electron energy states at the $\\mathrm{Si}^{-} \\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ interface tends to produce an input-referred flicker noise component that exceeds the thermal noise component for frequencies below 1 to 10 kHz under most bias conditions and device geometries. Therefore, accurately representing the input-referred flicker noise component in MOS transistors is crucial for optimizing the noise performance of MOS analog circuits.\n\nThe physical mechanisms underlying $1 / f$ noise in MOS transistors have been extensively studied. ${ }^{18}$ The precise dependence of the input-referred flicker noise magnitude on transistor bias conditions and device geometry varies with the fabrication process details. Generally, the magnitude of the input-referred flicker noise component is roughly independent of bias current and voltage but inversely proportional to the active gate area of the transistor. This occurs because a larger transistor has more surface states under the gate, leading to an averaging effect that reduces overall noise. Additionally, the input-referred flicker noise is inversely related to the gate-oxide capacitance per unit area, which is physically reasonable since surface states can be viewed as a time-varying component of the surface-state charge $Q_{s s}$. From (1.139), this results in a time-varying component of the threshold voltage inversely proportional to $C_{o x}$. For a MOS transistor, the equivalent input-referred voltage noise can often be expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\overline{v_{i}^{2}}}{\\Delta f}=4 k T \\frac{2}{3} \\frac{1}{g_{m}}+\\frac{K_{f}}{W L C_{o x} f} \\tag{11.69}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nA typical value for $K_{f}$ is $3 \\times 10^{-24} \\mathrm{~V}^{2}-\\mathrm{F}$, or $3 \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{~V}^{2}-\\mathrm{pF}$.\n\nThe equivalent input noise-current generator $i_{i}^{2}$ for the MOSFET can be determined by open-circuiting the input of each circuit in Fig. 11.26 and equating the output noise. This yields\n\n$$\ni_{i} \\frac{g_{m}}{j \\omega C_{g s}}=i_{g} \\frac{g_{m}}{j \\omega C_{g s}}+i_{d}\n$$\n\nresulting in\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{i}=i_{g}+\\frac{j \\omega C_{g s}}{g_{m}} i_{d} \\tag{11.70}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince $i_{g}$ and $i_{d}$ are independent generators, (11.70) can be rewritten as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\overline{i_{i}^{2}}=\\overline{i_{g}^{2}}+\\frac{\\omega^{2} C_{g s}^{2}}{g_{m}^{2}} \\overline{i_{d}^{2}} \\tag{11.71}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIgnoring (11.16) and substituting (11.14) and (11.15) into (11.17) gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\overline{i_{i}^{2}}}{\\Delta f}=2 q I_{G}+\\frac{\\omega^{2} C_{g s}^{2}}{g_{m}^{2}}\\left(4 k T \\frac{2}{3} g_{m}+K \\frac{I_{D}^{a}}{f}\\right) \\tag{11.72}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn (11.72), the ac current gain of the MOS transistor is identified as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nA_{I}=\\frac{g_{m}}{\\omega C_{g s}} \\tag{11.73}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, the noise generators at the output are divided by $A_{I}^{2}$ when referred back to the input. At low frequencies, the input noise-current generator is determined by the gate leakage current $I_{G}$, which is very small ( $10^{-15}$ A or less). Consequently, MOS transistors exhibit superior noise performance compared to bipolar transistors when the driving source impedance is large. Under these conditions, the input noise-current generator is dominant and significantly smaller for a MOS transistor than for a bipolar transistor. However, it is important to note that the input noise-voltage generator of a bipolar transistor in (11.50) is typically smaller than that of a MOS transistor in (11.68a) due to the bipolar transistor's larger $g_{m}$ for a given bias current. Therefore, for low source impedances, a bipolar transistor often demonstrates superior noise performance compared to a MOS transistor."

    "text": "The practical implementation of the series-shunt feedback circuit discussed earlier typically takes the form depicted in Fig. 11.29a. This feedback circuit comprises a resistive divider made up of $R_{E}$ and $R_{F}$. When the noise characteristics of the fundamental amplifier are modeled by input noise generators $\\overline{i_{i a}^{2}}$ and $\\overline{v_{i a}^{2}}$, and the thermal noise from $R_{F}$ and $R_{E}$ is accounted for, the circuit configuration aligns with Fig. 11.29b. The noise behavior of this circuit can be described using two equivalent input generators $\\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$ and $\\overline{i_{i}^{2}}$, as illustrated in Fig. 11.29c.\n\nTo determine $\\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$, the inputs of the circuits in Figs. $11.29 b$ and $11.29 c$ are short-circuited, and the output noise is equated. It can be demonstrated that:\n\n$$\nv_{i}=v_{i a}+i_{i a} R+\\frac{R_{F}}{R_{F}+R_{E}} v_{e}+\\frac{R_{E}}{R_{F}+R_{E}} v_{f}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nR=R_{F} \\| R_{E}\n$$\n\nPresuming that all noise sources in the equation are independent, we obtain:\n\n$$\n\\overline{v_{i}^{2}}=\\overline{v_{i a}^{2}}+\\overline{i_{i a}^{2}} R^{2}+4 k T R \\Delta f\n$$\n\nIn this practical scenario, the equivalent input noise voltage of the entire amplifier encompasses the input noise voltage of the basic amplifier along with two additional terms. The second term is often negligible, whereas the third term, representing thermal noise in $R=R_{E} \\| R_{F}$, is frequently significant.\n\nThe equivalent input noise current $\\overline{i_{i}^{2}}$ is derived by open-circuiting the inputs and setting the output noise equal. It becomes evident that:\n\n$$\n\\overline{i_{i}^{2}} \\simeq \\overline{i_{i a}^{2}}\n$$\n\nThis indicates that the noise from the feedback resistors is not amplified and only appears in parallel with the output. Consequently, the equivalent input noise current remains unaffected by the feedback. These findings generally apply to series feedback at the input. For single-stage series feedback, these equations hold when $R_{F} \\rightarrow \\infty$ and $R=R_{E}$.\n\nIf the basic amplifier in Fig. 8.29 is an operational amplifier, the computation is slightly adjusted. This adjustment is necessary because an operational amplifier must be regarded as a three-port device for noise representation purposes. Nevertheless, if the circuit of Fig. 11.39 serves as the basic amplifier in the aforementioned calculation, equations analogous to (11.78) and (11.81) are derived.\n\nTurning to the instance of shunt feedback at the input, we can examine the shunt-shunt feedback circuit depicted in Fig. 11.30a. This configuration is shown in Fig. 11.30b, incorporating noise sources $v_{i a}^{2}$ and $i_{i a}^{2}$ from the basic amplifier, as well as the noise source $i_{f}^{2}$ originating from $R_{F}$. These noise sources are referred back to the input, yielding $\\overline{v_{i}^{2}}$ and $\\overline{i_{i}^{2}}$ as demonstrated in Fig. 11.30c.\n\nBy open-circuiting the inputs of Figs. $11.30 b$ and $11.30 c$ and setting the output noise equal, we derive:\n\n$$\ni_{i}=i_{i a}+\\frac{v_{i a}}{R_{F}}+i_{f}\n$$\n\nAssuming independence of all noise sources in the equation, we find that the equivalent input noise current with shunt feedback applied includes the input noise current of the basic amplifier and a term representing thermal noise in the feedback resistor. The second term is typically negligible. These conclusions generally hold for shunt feedback at the input. A general guideline for calculating the equivalent input noise contribution due to thermal noise in the feedback resistors is to apply the two-port methods outlined in Chapter 8 for determining feedback-circuit loading on the basic amplifier. Once the shunt or series resistors signifying feedback loading at the input are identified, these same resistors may be utilized to calculate the thermal noise contribution at the input resulting from the feedback resistors.\n\nWhen the inputs of the circuits in Figs. $11.30 b$ and $11.30 c$ are short-circuited, and the output noise is equated, it follows that:\n\n$$\n\\overline{v_{i}^{2}} \\simeq \\overline{v_{i a}^{2}}\n$$\n\nEquations (11.83) and (11.84) generally apply to shunt feedback at the input. They are directly applicable when the basic amplifier in Fig. 11.30 is an operational amplifier, since one input terminal of the basic amplifier is grounded, rendering the operational amplifier a two-port device.\n\nThe aforementioned findings validate certain assumptions made previously. For instance, in the calculation of the equivalent input noise generators for a bipolar transistor in Section 11.5.1, the collector-base capacitance $C_{\\mu}$ was disregarded. This capacitance signifies single-stage shunt feedback and thus does not substantially impact the equivalent input noise generators of a transistor, even if the Miller effect is predominant. It is noteworthy that there is no thermal noise contribution from the capacitor, unlike from $R_{F}$ in Fig. 11.30. Moreover, the second term in (11.83) transforms to $\\overline{v_{i a}^{2}} /\\left|Z_{F}\\right|^{2}$, where $Z_{F}$ is the impedance of $C_{\\mu}$. Since $\\left|Z_{F}\\right|$ is substantial at all frequencies of interest, this term is negligible.\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nAs an illustrative example involving noise calculations in feedback amplifiers, consider the wideband current-feedback pair whose ac schematic is shown in Fig. 11.31. The circuit is powered by a current source, and the frequency response $\\left|\\left(i_{o} / i_{i}\\right)(j \\omega)\\right|$ is flat up to 100 MHz, where it steeply declines. We aim to calculate the minimum input signal $i_{s}$ necessary for an output signal-to-noise ratio exceeding 20 dB. The provided data are as follows: $\\beta_{1}=\\beta_{2}=100, f_{T 1}=300 \\mathrm{MHz}, I_{C 1}=$ $0.5 \\mathrm{~mA}, I_{C 2}=1 \\mathrm{~mA}, f_{T 2}=500 \\mathrm{MHz}, r_{b 1}=r_{b 2}=100 \\Omega$. Flicker noise is disregarded.\n\nThe methodologies established earlier enable the equivalent input noise generators for this circuit to be promptly ascertained. A preliminary assessment reveals that the noise generated by the 20-k $\\Omega$ interstage resistor and the base current noise of $Q_{2}$ are insignificant. Applying the rule stated in Section 11.2.2, we deduce that the $20-\\mathrm{k} \\Omega$ resistor contributes an equivalent noise current of $2.5 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$. The base current of $Q_{2}$ amounts to $10 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$. Both of these contributions are negligible in comparison to the $500 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$ collector current of $Q_{1}$. Therefore, the input noise generators of the entire circuit are those of $Q_{1}$, positioned outside the feedback loop, along with the noise generated by the feedback resistors.\n\nEmploying the techniques outlined in Chapter 8, we can deduce the basic amplifier incorporating feedback loading and noise sources for the circuit of Fig. 11.31, as depicted in Fig. 11.32. The equivalent input noise-current generator for the complete circuit can be computed from Fig. 11.32 or by utilizing (11.83) with $R_{F}=5.5 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$. Given that the circuit is assumed to be driven by a current source, the equivalent input noise voltage is inconsequential. From (11.83), we have:\n\n$$\n\\overline{i_{i}^{2}}=\\overline{i_{i a}^{2}}+\\frac{\\overline{v_{i a}^{2}}}{(5500)^{2}}+4 k T \\frac{1}{5500} \\Delta f\n$$\n\nUtilizing (11.57) and neglecting flicker noise, we derive for $\\overline{i_{i a}^{2}}$:\n\n$$\n\\overline{i_{i a}^{2}}=2 q\\left(I_{B}+\\frac{I_{C}}{|\\beta(j f)|^{2}}\\right) \\Delta f\n$$\n\nand hence:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\overline{i_{i a}^{2}}}{\\Delta f}=2 q\\left(5+\\frac{500}{|\\beta|^{2}}\\right) \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{~A}^{2} / \\mathrm{Hz}\n$$\n\nSubstituting (11.86) into (11.85) yields:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\overline{i_{i}^{2}}}{\\Delta f}=2 q\\left(5+\\frac{500}{|\\beta|^{2}}\\right) \\times 10^{-6}+\\frac{\\overline{v_{i a}^{2}}}{(5500)^{2} \\Delta f}+2 q(9.1) \\times 10^{-6}\n$$\n\nHere, the noise from the $5.5-\\mathrm{k} \\Omega$ resistor has been expressed in terms of an equivalent noise current of $9.1 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$.\n\nApplying (11.50) results in:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\overline{v_{i a}^{2}}}{\\Delta f}=4 k T\\left(r_{b 1}+\\frac{1}{2 g_{m}}\\right)=4 k T(126)\n$$\n\nDividing this equation by $(5500)^{2}$ gives:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\overline{v_{i a}^{2}}}{(5500)^{2} \\Delta f} =4 k T \\frac{1}{240,000}\n$$\n\n$$\n=2 q(0.2) \\times 10^{-6}\n$$\n\nTherefore, the term involving $\\overline{v_{i a}^{2}}$ in (11.87) is found to be equivalent to thermal noise in a $240-\\mathrm{k} \\Omega$ resistor, as shown in (11.88), and this can be expressed as noise in $0.2 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$ of equivalent noise current, as demonstrated in (11.89). This term is negligible in this example, as is typically the case.\n\nCombining all these terms allows us to express (11.87) as:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\overline{i_{i}^{2}}}{\\Delta f} =2 q\\left(5+\\frac{500}{|\\beta|^{2}}+0.2+9.1\\right) \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{~A}^{2} / \\mathrm{Hz}\n$$\n\n$$\n=2 q\\left(14.3+\\frac{500}{|\\beta|^{2}}\\right) \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{~A}^{2} / \\mathrm{Hz}\n$$\n\nEquation (11.90) illustrates that the equivalent input noise-current spectral density increases at high frequencies (as $|\\beta|$ diminishes) as anticipated for a transistor. In a single transistor without feedback, the equivalent input noise current also escalates with frequency. However, since the transistor gain diminishes with frequency, the output noise spectrum of a transistor without feedback consistently decreases as frequency rises (refer to Section 11.4.1). In contrast, in this case, the negative feedback sustains the gain constant across frequencies, and thus the output noise spectrum of this circuit will rise as frequency increases, until the amplifier's band edge is attained. This is depicted in Fig. 11.33, where the input noise-current spectrum, the amplifier frequency response squared, and the output noise-current spectrum (product of the first two) are presented. The current gain of the circuit is $A_{I} \\simeq 11$.\n\nThe total output noise from the circuit $\\overline{i_{o T}^{2}}$ is determined by integrating the output noise spectral density, which is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\overline{i_{o}^{2}}}{\\Delta f}=A_{I}^{2} \\frac{\\overline{i_{i}^{2}}}{\\Delta f}\n$$\n\nTherefore:\n\n$$\n\\overline{i_{o T}^{2}} =\\int_{0}^{B} A_{I}^{2} \\frac{\\overline{i_{i}^{2}}}{\\Delta f} d f\n$$\n\n$$\n=A_{I}^{2} \\int_{0}^{B} 2 q\\left(14.3+\\frac{500}{|\\beta(j f)|^{2}}\\right) \\times 10^{-6} d f\n$$\n\nwhere (11.90) has been used and $A_{I}^{2}$ is presumed constant up to $B=10^{8} \\mathrm{~Hz}$ as previously specified. The current gain is:\n\n$$\n\\beta(j f)=\\frac{\\beta_{0}}{1+j \\frac{\\beta_{0} f}{f_{T 1}}}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{|\\beta(j f)|^{2}}=\\frac{1}{\\beta_{0}^{2}}\\left(1+\\frac{\\beta_{0}^{2} f^{2}}{f_{T 1}^{2}}\\right)\n$$\n\nSubstituting (11.94) into (11.92) leads to:\n\n$$\n\\overline{i_{o T}^{2}} =A_{I}^{2} 2 q \\times 10^{-6} \\int_{0}^{B}\\left[14.3+\\frac{500}{\\beta_{0}^{2}}\\left(1+\\frac{\\beta_{0}^{2} f^{2}}{f_{T 1}^{2}}\\right)\\right] d f\n$$\n\n$$\n=A_{I}^{2} 2 q \\times 10^{-6}\\left[14.3 f+\\frac{500}{\\beta_{0}^{2}} f+\\frac{500}{f_{T 1}^{2}} \\frac{f^{3}}{3}\\right]_{0}^{B}\n$$\n\nUsing $\\beta_{0}=100$ and $B=100 \\mathrm{MHz}=f_{T 1} / 3$ results in:\n\n$$\n\\overline{i_{o T}^{2}}=A_{I}^{2} \\times 2 q \\times 10^{-6}(14.3 B+18.6 B)\n$$\n\n$$\n\\overline{i_{o T}^{2}}=A_{I}^{2} \\times 1.05 \\times 10^{-15} \\mathrm{~A}^{2}\n$$\n\nThe equivalent input noise current is:\n\n$$\n\\overline{i_{i T}^{2}}=\\frac{\\overline{i_{o T}^{2}}}{\\overline{A_{I}^{2}}}=1.05 \\times 10^{-15} \\mathrm{~A}^{2}\n$$\n\nand from this:\n\n$$\ni_{i T}=32.4 \\mathrm{nArms}\n$$\n\nConsequently, the equivalent input noise current is 32.4 nA rms, and (11.97) indicates that the frequency-dependent portion of the equivalent input noise is predominant. For a $20-\\mathrm{dB}$ signal-to-noise ratio, the input signal current $i_{s}$ must surpass $0.32 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$ rms."

Using the rule stated in Section 11.2.2, the 20-kΩ resistor contributes an equivalent noise current of 2.5 μA, and the base current of \\( Q_{2} \\) is 10 μA. Both are negligible compared to the 500 μA collector current of \\( Q_{1} \\). Thus, the input noise generators of the entire circuit are those of \\( Q_{1} \\) outside the feedback loop, along with the noise contributed by the feedback resistors.\n\nUsing the methods of Chapter 8, the basic amplifier including feedback loading and noise sources for the circuit of Fig. 11.31 is derived as shown in Fig. 11.32. The equivalent input noise-current generator for the overall circuit can be calculated from Fig. 11.32 or by using (11.83) with \\( R_{F} = 5.5 \\) kΩ. Since the circuit is driven from a current source, the equivalent input noise voltage is not significant. From (11.83):\n\n$$\n\\overline{i_{i}^{2}} = \\overline{i_{i a}^{2}} + \\frac{\\overline{v_{i a}^{2}}}{(5500)^{2}} + 4 k T \\frac{1}{5500} \\Delta f \\tag{11.85}\n$$\n\nUsing (11.57) and neglecting flicker noise, \\( \\overline{i_{i a}^{2}} \\) is:\n\n$$\n\\overline{i_{i a}^{2}} = 2 q\\left(I_{B} + \\frac{I_{C}}{|\\beta(j f)|^{2}}\\right) \\Delta f\n$$\n\nand thus:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\overline{i_{i a}^{2}}}{\\Delta f} = 2 q\\left(5 + \\frac{500}{|\\beta|^{2}}\\right) \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{~A}^{2} / \\mathrm{Hz} \\tag{11.86}\n$$\n\nSubstituting (11.86) into (11.85) gives:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\overline{i_{i}^{2}}}{\\Delta f} = 2 q\\left(5 + \\frac{500}{|\\beta|^{2}}\\right) \\times 10^{-6} + \\frac{\\overline{v_{i a}^{2}}}{(5500)^{2} \\Delta f} + 2 q(9.1) \\times 10^{-6} \\tag{11.87}\n$$\n\nwhere the noise in the 5.5-kΩ resistor has been expressed in terms of the equivalent noise current of 9.1 μA.\n\nUsing (11.50) gives:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\overline{v_{i a}^{2}}}{\\Delta f} = 4 k T\\left(r_{b 1} + \\frac{1}{2 g_{m}}\\right) = 4 k T(126)\n$$\n\nDivision of this equation by \\( (5500)^{2} \\) gives:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\overline{v_{i a}^{2}}}{(5500)^{2} \\Delta f} = 4 k T \\frac{1}{240,000} \\tag{11.88}\n$$\n\n$$\n= 2 q(0.2) \\times 10^{-6} \\tag{11.89}\n$$\n\nThus, the term involving \\( \\overline{v_{i a}^{2}} \\) in (11.87) is seen to be equivalent to thermal noise in a 240-kΩ resistor using (11.88), and this can be expressed as noise in 0.2 μA of equivalent noise current, as shown in (11.89). This term is negligible in this example, as is usually the case.\n\nCombining all these terms, (11.87) can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\overline{i_{i}^{2}}}{\\Delta f} = 2 q\\left(5 + \\frac{500}{|\\beta|^{2}} + 0.2 + 9.1\\right) \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{~A}^{2} / \\mathrm{Hz} \\tag{11.90}\n$$\n\nEquation 11.90 shows that the equivalent input noise-current spectral density increases at high frequencies (as \\( |\\beta| \\) falls), as expected for a transistor. In a single transistor without feedback, the equivalent input noise current also rises with frequency, but because the transistor gain falls with frequency, the output noise spectrum of a transistor without feedback always falls as frequency rises (see Section 11.4.1). However, in this case, the negative feedback holds the gain constant with frequency, and thus the output noise spectrum of this circuit will rise as frequency increases, until the amplifier band edge is reached. This is illustrated in Fig. 11.33, where the input noise-current spectrum, the amplifier frequency response squared, and the output noise-current spectrum (product of the first two) are shown. The current gain of the circuit is \\( A_{I} \\simeq 11 \\).\n\nThe total output noise from the circuit \\( \\overline{i_{o T}^{2}} \\) is obtained by integrating the output noise spectral density, which is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\overline{i_{o}^{2}}}{\\Delta f} = A_{I}^{2} \\frac{\\overline{i_{i}^{2}}}{\\Delta f} \\tag{11.91}\n$$\n\nThus:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\overline{i_{o T}^{2}} &= \\int_{0}^{B} A_{I}^{2} \\frac{\\overline{i_{i}^{2}}}{\\Delta f} d f \\\\\n&= A_{I}^{2} \\int_{0}^{B} 2 q\\left(14.3 + \\frac{500}{|\\beta(j f)|^{2}}\\right) \\times 10^{-6} d f \\tag{11.92}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere (11.90) has been used and \\( A_{I}^{2} \\) is assumed constant up to \\( B = 10^{8} \\) Hz as specified earlier. The current gain is:\n\n$$\n\\beta(j f) = \\frac{\\beta_{0}}{1 + j \\frac{\\beta_{0} f}{f_{T 1}}} \\tag{11.93}\n$$\n\nand:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{|\\beta(j f)|^{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\beta_{0}^{2}}\\left(1 + \\frac{\\beta_{0}^{2} f^{2}}{f_{T 1}^{2}}\\right) \\tag{11.94}\n$$\n\nSubstituting (11.94) in (11.92) gives:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\overline{i_{o T}^{2}} &= A_{I}^{2} 2 q \\times 10^{-6} \\int_{0}^{B}\\left[14.3 + \\frac{500}{\\beta_{0}^{2}}\\left(1 + \\frac{\\beta_{0}^{2} f^{2}}{f_{T 1}^{2}}\\right)\\right] d f \\tag{11.95} \\\\\n&= A_{I}^{2} 2 q \\times 10^{-6}\\left[14.3 f + \\frac{500}{\\beta_{0}^{2}} f + \\frac{500}{f_{T 1}^{2}} \\frac{f^{3}}{3}\\right]_{0}^{B} \\tag{11.96}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nUsing \\( \\beta_{0} = 100 \\) and \\( B = 100 \\) MHz = \\( f_{T 1} / 3 \\) gives:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\overline{i_{o T}^{2}} &= A_{I}^{2} \\times 2 q \\times 10^{-6}(14.3 B + 18.6 B) \\tag{11.97} \\\\\n&= A_{I}^{2} \\times 1.05 \\times 10^{-15} \\mathrm{~A}^{2} \\tag{11.98}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe equivalent input noise current is:\n\n$$\n\\overline{i_{i T}^{2}} = \\frac{\\overline{i_{o T}^{2}}}{\\overline{A_{I}^{2}}} = 1.05 \\times 10^{-15} \\mathrm{~A}^{2}\n$$\n\nand from this:\n\n$$\ni_{i T} = 32.4 \\mathrm{nArms} \\tag{11.99}\n$$\n\nThus, the equivalent input noise current is 32.4 nA rms, and (11.97) shows that the frequency-dependent part of the equivalent input noise is dominant. For a 20-dB signal-to-noise ratio, the input signal current \\( i_{s} \\) must be greater than 0.32 μA rms."
