The differential mode (DM) half-circuit is depicted in Fig. 12.11b, where nodes intersecting the axis of symmetry are connected to AC ground. This setup allows the differential gain to be accurately set by the DM feedback loop, as given by the equation $\\frac{v_{o d}}{v_{s d}} = -\\frac{R_{3}}{R_{1}}$.
