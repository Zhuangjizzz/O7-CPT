    "text": "A fully differential feedback amplifier is depicted in Fig. 12.1 $a$. It contrasts with the single-ended feedback amplifier in Fig. $12.1 b$ in two key aspects. The operational amplifier has two outputs, and two identical resistive networks provide feedback. Among various fully differential op-amp configurations, the simple amplifier in Fig. 12.2 is used for illustrative purposes. It comprises a differential pair $M_{1}-M_{2}$, active loads $M_{3}$ and $M_{4}$, and a tail current source $M_{5}$.\n\nFully differential op amps offer a greater output voltage swing than their single-ended counterparts, which is crucial when the power-supply voltage is low. The enhanced output voltage swing of a fully differential op amp can be understood by examining the two feedback circuits in Fig. 12.1. Assuming each op-amp output, $V_{o 1}, V_{o 2}$, or $V_{o}$, can swing from $V_{\\max }$ to $V_{\\min }$, the single-ended-output circuit in Fig. 12.1b can achieve a peak-to-peak output voltage of $V_{\\max }-V_{\\min }$. In the fully differential circuit in Fig. 12.1a, if $V_{o 1}$ swings to $V_{\\max }$ and $V_{o 2}$ to $V_{\\min }$, the peak differential output is $V_{\\max }-V_{\\min }$. Consequently, the peak-to-peak differential output is $2\\left(V_{\\max }-V_{\\min }\\right)$. Thus, the output swing of a fully differential op amp is twice that of a similar single-ended op amp.\n\nThis increased output swing can lead to a higher signal-to-noise ratio. Excluding noise from the op amp and feedback resistor $R_{3}$, the thermal noise associated with the $R_{1}$ input resistors is the primary noise source. In the single-ended circuit in Fig. 12.1b, the output noise power due to resistor $R_{1}$ is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\overline{v_{o N}^{2}}(\\text { s.e. })=\\left(\\frac{R_{3}}{R_{1}}\\right)^{2} 4 k T R_{1}\\left(B W_{N}\\right) \\tag{12.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $B W_{N}$ is the equivalent noise bandwidth of the closed-loop amplifier. In the fully differential amplifier in Fig. 12.1a, the differential output noise power due to the two $R_{1}$ resistors is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\overline{v_{o N}^{2}}(\\text { diff })=2\\left(\\frac{R_{3}}{R_{1}}\\right)^{2} 4 k T R_{1}\\left(B W_{N}\\right) \\tag{12.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nbecause the output noise terms from the two $R_{1}$ resistors are uncorrelated, resulting in a total output noise power that is the sum of their contributions. From (12.1) and (12.2), the output noise power in the fully differential circuit is twice that in the single-ended circuit. Since the peak output signal in the differential circuit is twice that in the single-ended circuit, the maximum output signal power is four times greater. The maximum output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for a maximum sinusoidal output signal with amplitude $V_{\\text {sig(peak })}$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\max }=\\frac{\\text { maximum output signal power }}{\\text { output noise power }}=\\frac{\\frac{V_{\\text {sig(peak })}^{2}}{2}}{\\overline{v_{o N}^{2}}} \\tag{12.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis SNR is twice as large, or 3 dB higher, for the fully differential circuit compared to the single-ended circuit if the same resistance $R_{1}$ is used in both and $R_{1}$ is the dominant noise source.\n\nFully differential circuits are less susceptible to common-mode (CM) noise than their single-ended counterparts, such as noise on the power supplies generated by digital circuits on the same substrate as the analog circuits. To illustrate the reduced sensitivity to CM noise, consider the circuit in Fig. 12.3, which is identical to Fig. $12.1 a$ but includes two capacitors $C_{i p}$ connecting each op-amp input to voltage source $v_{n}$. Here, $C_{i p}$ models parasitic capacitance from the substrate to each op-amp input, and $v_{n}$ models noise on the power-supply voltage connected to the substrate. These capacitors couple equal signals to the op-amp inputs, causing a CM disturbance. If the op amp is perfectly balanced with zero CM gain, this CM noise does not affect the CM output voltage. If the op-amp CM gain is small but nonzero, $v_{n}$ causes a small CM output voltage but does not affect the differential output voltage if the circuit is perfectly balanced. However, capacitive coupling can introduce a nonzero differential-mode (DM) output voltage if the circuit is unbalanced, such as when mismatch between the $C_{i p}$ capacitors causes unequal noise coupling to the op-amp inputs.\n\nEven without capacitive coupling to the substrate in Fig. 12.3, noise on the power supply can couple to the op-amp outputs through the transistors (see Section 6.2.6). In a balanced circuit, such coupling is equal at each op-amp output, altering the CM output but not the DM output.\n\nBalanced circuits do not exhibit even-order nonlinearities in their differential output. The cancellation of even-order nonlinearities can be explained using Fig. 12.1 $a$. Assuming a perfectly balanced but nonlinear circuit, consider inputs $V_{s 1}=V_{a}$ and $V_{s 2}=V_{b}$, resulting in outputs $V_{o 1}=V_{x}$ and $V_{o 2}=V_{y}$. The differential input and output are\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{s d}=V_{a}-V_{b} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad V_{o d}=V_{x}-V_{y} \\tag{12.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSwapping the inputs to $V_{s 1}=V_{b}$ and $V_{s 2}=V_{a}$ results in swapped outputs ($V_{o 1}=V_{y}$ and $V_{o 2}=V_{x}$) due to circuit symmetry. In this case,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{s d}=V_{b}-V_{a}=-\\left(V_{a}-V_{b}\\right) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad V_{o d}=V_{y}-V_{x}=-\\left(V_{x}-V_{y}\\right) \\tag{12.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquations 12.4 and 12.5 show that reversing the polarity of the differential input in a balanced circuit only reverses the polarity of the differential output voltage. Thus, the differential input-output characteristic $f()$ is an odd function, meaning if $V_{o d}=f\\left(V_{i d}\\right)$, then $-V_{o d}=f\\left(-V_{i d}\\right)$. Hence, the differential transfer characteristic of a balanced amplifier shows only odd-order nonlinearities, allowing only odd-order distortion in the differential output for a differential input. Even-order distortion may exist in individual outputs $V_{o 1}$ and $V_{o 2}$ but cancels when they are subtracted to form $V_{o d}$.\n\nIn a balanced, fully differential amplifier, the small-signal differential output voltage is proportional to the small-signal differential input voltage and independent of the CM input voltage, as demonstrated in Section 3.5.4. Similarly, the small-signal CM output voltage is proportional to the small-signal CM input voltage but independent of the differential input voltage."

    "text": "A fully differential feedback amplifier, depicted in Fig. 12.1a, contrasts with the single-ended feedback amplifier in Fig. 12.1b in two key aspects. The operational amplifier (op amp) features two outputs, and two identical resistive networks are employed for feedback. Among various fully differential op-amp configurations, the simplified version in Fig. 12.2 is used for illustrative purposes. This configuration comprises a differential pair $M_{1}-M_{2}$, active loads $M_{3}$ and $M_{4}$, and a tail current source $M_{5}$.\n\nFully differential op amps offer a greater output voltage swing compared to their single-ended counterparts, which is crucial when the power-supply voltage is low. The enhanced output voltage swing of a fully differential op amp can be elucidated using the feedback circuits in Fig. 12.1. Assuming each op-amp output, $V_{o1}, V_{o2}$, or $V_{o}$, can oscillate between $V_{\\max}$ and $V_{\\min}$, the single-ended output circuit in Fig. 12.1b can achieve a peak-to-peak output voltage of $V_{\\max} - V_{\\min}$. In the fully differential circuit in Fig. 12.1a, if $V_{o1}$ reaches $V_{\\max}$ while $V_{o2}$ drops to $V_{\\min}$, the peak differential output is $V_{\\max} - V_{\\min}$, resulting in a peak-to-peak differential output of $2(V_{\\max} - V_{\\min})$. Consequently, the output swing of a fully differential op amp is twice that of a similar single-ended op amp.\n\nThis increased output swing can lead to a higher signal-to-noise ratio. Excluding noise from the op amp and feedback resistor $R_{3}$, the thermal noise associated with the $R_{1}$ input resistors emerges as the primary noise source. In the single-ended circuit of Fig. 12.1b, the output noise power due to resistor $R_{1}$ is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\overline{v_{o N}^{2}}(\\text { s.e. })=\\left(\\frac{R_{3}}{R_{1}}\\right)^{2} 4 k T R_{1}\\left(B W_{N}\\right) \\tag{12.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $B W_{N}$ represents the equivalent noise bandwidth of the closed-loop amplifier.

From equations (12.1) and (12.2), the output noise power in the fully differential circuit is twice that in the single-ended circuit. Given that the peak output signal in the differential circuit is twice that in the single-ended circuit, the maximum output signal power is four times greater. The maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for a maximum sinusoidal output signal with amplitude $V_{\\text {sig(peak})}$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\max }=\\frac{\\text { maximum output signal power }}{\\text { output noise power }}=\\frac{\\frac{V_{\\text {sig(peak})}^{2}}{2}}{\\overline{v_{o N}^{2}}} \\tag{12.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis SNR is twice as high, or 3 dB greater, for the fully differential circuit compared to the single-ended circuit if the same resistance $R_{1}$ is used in both and $R_{1}$ is the dominant noise source.\n\nFully differential circuits are less vulnerable to common-mode (CM) noise, such as power-supply noise generated by digital circuits on the same substrate as the analog circuits. To illustrate this reduced sensitivity, consider the circuit in Fig. 12.3, which is identical to Fig. 12.1a but includes two capacitors $C_{i p}$ connecting each op-amp input to a noise voltage source $v_{n}$. These capacitors model parasitic capacitance from the substrate to the op-amp inputs, with $v_{n}$ representing noise on the power-supply voltage linked to the substrate. The capacitors couple equal signals to the op-amp inputs, causing a CM disturbance. If the op amp is perfectly balanced with zero CM gain, this CM noise does not affect the CM output voltage. If the CM gain is nonzero but small, $v_{n}$ induces a minor CM output voltage but does not impact the differential output voltage if the circuit is perfectly balanced. However, capacitive coupling can introduce a nonzero differential-mode (DM) output voltage if the circuit is unbalanced, such as when mismatch between the $C_{i p}$ capacitors causes unequal noise coupling at the op-amp inputs.\n\nEven without substrate capacitive coupling, as shown in Fig. 12.3, power-supply noise can couple to the op-amp outputs through the transistors (refer to Section 6.2.6). In a balanced circuit, such coupling is uniform at each op-amp output, altering the CM output but not the DM output.\n\nBalanced circuits eliminate even-order nonlinearities from the differential output. This cancellation can be explained using Fig. 12.1a. Assuming a perfectly balanced but nonlinear circuit, consider inputs $V_{s 1}=V_{a}$ and $V_{s 2}=V_{b}$, resulting in outputs $V_{o 1}=V_{x}$ and $V_{o 2}=V_{y}$. The differential input and output are\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{s d}=V_{a}-V_{b} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad V_{o d}=V_{x}-V_{y} \\tag{12.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSwapping the inputs ($V_{s 1}=V_{b}$ and $V_{s 2}=V_{a}$) results in swapped outputs ($V_{o 1}=V_{y}$ and $V_{o 2}=V_{x}$) due to circuit symmetry. In this case,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{s d}=V_{b}-V_{a}=-\\left(V_{a}-V_{b}\\right) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad V_{o d}=V_{y}-V_{x}=-\\left(V_{x}-V_{y}\\right) \\tag{12.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquations 12.4 and 12.5 demonstrate that reversing the differential input polarity in a balanced circuit only reverses the differential output polarity. Thus, the differential input-output characteristic $f()$ is an odd function, meaning if $V_{o d}=f\\left(V_{i d}\\right)$, then $-V_{o d}=f\\left(-V_{i d}\\right)$. Consequently, the differential transfer characteristic of a balanced amplifier exhibits only odd-order nonlinearities, allowing only odd-order distortion in the differential output for a differential input. Even-order distortion may exist in individual outputs $V_{o 1}$ and $V_{o 2}$ but cancels out when forming $V_{o d}$.\n\nIn a balanced, fully differential amplifier, the small-signal differential output voltage is proportional to the small-signal differential input voltage, independent of the CM input voltage, as demonstrated in Section 3.5.4.

In the single-ended circuit in Fig. 12.1b, the output noise power due to resistor \\(R_{1}\\) is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\overline{v_{o N}^{2}}(\\text { s.e. })=\\left(\\frac{R_{3}}{R_{1}}\\right)^{2} 4 k T R_{1}\\left(B W_{N}\\right) \\tag{12.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere \\(B W_{N}\\) is the equivalent noise bandwidth of the closed-loop amplifier. In the fully differential amplifier in Fig. 12.1a, the differential output noise power due to the two \\(R_{1}\\) resistors is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\overline{v_{o N}^{2}}(\\text { diff })=2\\left(\\frac{R_{3}}{R_{1}}\\right)^{2} 4 k T R_{1}\\left(B W_{N}\\right) \\tag{12.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nsince the output noise terms from the two \\(R_{1}\\) resistors are uncorrelated, their contributions sum to give the total output noise power. From equations (12.1) and (12.2), the output noise power in the fully differential circuit is twice that in the single-ended circuit. However, since the peak output signal in the differential circuit is twice that in the single-ended circuit, the maximum output signal power is four times greater. The maximum output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for a maximum sinusoidal output signal with amplitude \\(V_{\\text {sig(peak})}\\) is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\max }=\\frac{\\text { maximum output signal power }}{\\text { output noise power }}=\\frac{\\frac{V_{\\text {sig(peak})}^{2}}{2}}{\\overline{v_{o N}^{2}}} \\tag{12.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis SNR is twice as large, or 3 dB higher, for the fully differential circuit compared to the single-ended circuit if the same resistance \\(R_{1}\\) is used in both and \\(R_{1}\\) is the dominant noise source.\n\nFully differential circuits are less susceptible to common-mode (CM) noise than single-ended circuits, such as noise on the power supplies generated by digital circuits integrated on the same substrate as the analog circuits. To illustrate the reduced sensitivity to CM noise, consider the circuit in Fig. 12.3, which is identical to Fig. 12.1a but includes two capacitors \\(C_{i p}\\) connecting each op-amp input to a noise voltage source \\(v_{n}\\). Here, \\(C_{i p}\\) models parasitic capacitance from the substrate to each op-amp input, and \\(v_{n}\\) models noise on the power-supply voltage connected to the substrate. These capacitors couple equal signals to the op-amp inputs, causing a CM disturbance. If the op amp is perfectly balanced with zero CM gain, this CM noise does not affect the CM output voltage. If the CM gain is nonzero but small, \\(v_{n}\\) causes a small CM output voltage but does not affect the differential output voltage if the circuit is perfectly balanced. However, capacitive coupling can introduce a nonzero differential-mode (DM) output voltage if the circuit is unbalanced, such as when \\(C_{i p}\\) capacitors are mismatched, causing unequal coupled noise at the op-amp inputs.\n\nEven without capacitive coupling, noise on the power supply can couple to the op-amp outputs through the transistors (see Section 6.2.6). In a balanced circuit, such coupling is equal at each op-amp output, altering the CM output but not the DM output.\n\nBalanced circuits do not exhibit even-order nonlinearities in the differential output. This cancellation can be explained using Fig. 12.1a. Assuming a perfectly balanced but nonlinear circuit, consider inputs \\(V_{s1}=V_{a}\\) and \\(V_{s2}=V_{b}\\), resulting in outputs \\(V_{o1}=V_{x}\\) and \\(V_{o2}=V_{y}\\). The differential input and output are\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{s d}=V_{a}-V_{b} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad V_{o d}=V_{x}-V_{y} \\tag{12.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSwapping the inputs to \\(V_{s1}=V_{b}\\) and \\(V_{s2}=V_{a}\\) results in swapped outputs \\(V_{o1}=V_{y}\\) and \\(V_{o2}=V_{x}\\) due to symmetry. In this case,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{s d}=V_{b}-V_{a}=-\\left(V_{a}-V_{b}\\right) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad V_{o d}=V_{y}-V_{x}=-\\left(V_{x}-V_{y}\\right) \\tag{12.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquations 12.4 and 12.5 show that changing the polarity of the differential input in a balanced circuit only changes the polarity of the differential output voltage. Thus, the differential input-output characteristic \\(f()\\), is an odd function, meaning if \\(V_{o d}=f\\left(V_{i d}\\right)\\), then \\(-V_{o d}=f\\left(-V_{i d}\\right)\\). Hence, the differential transfer characteristic of a balanced amplifier exhibits only odd-order nonlinearities, allowing only odd-order distortion in the differential output for a differential input. Even-order distortion may exist in individual outputs \\(V_{o1}\\) and \\(V_{o2}\\), but it cancels when they are subtracted to form \\(V_{o d}\\).\n\nIn a balanced, fully differential amplifier, the small-signal differential output voltage is proportional to the small-signal differential input voltage but independent of the CM input voltage, as shown in Section 3.5.4. Similarly, the small-signal CM output voltage is proportional to the small-signal CM input voltage but independent of the differential input voltage."

The DM load \\(Z_{L d}\\) and the CM load \\(Z_{L c}\\) can be found using (12.24) and (12.25) for the load network in Fig. 12.4, and the resulting load elements are:\n\n\\[\nZ_{L d}=Z_{L 2} \\|\\left(2 Z_{L 1}\\right)\n\\]\nand\n\\[\nZ_{L c}=Z_{L 1}\n\\]\n\nThe DM and CM loads are different for the following reason. The axis of symmetry in Fig. 12.4 passes through the middle of \\(Z_{L 2}\\). For purely DM signals, points along the axis of symmetry are ac grounds. Therefore, the load for the DM half-circuit is half of \\(Z_{L 2}\\) in parallel with \\(Z_{L 1}\\). However, points along the axis of symmetry are open circuits for purely CM signals. Therefore, \\(Z_{L 2}\\) does not affect the load in the CM half-circuit.\n\nThese amplifier models can be used to model any balanced, fully differential amplifier, including an op amp. If the model is simplified to just the dependent sources (assuming infinite input impedance and zero output impedance), the equations that describe the model reduce to:\n\n\\[\nv_{o d}=v_{o 1}-v_{o 2}=a_{d m} v_{i d}\n\\]\nand\n\\[\nv_{o c}=\\frac{v_{o 1}+v_{o 2}}{2}=a_{c m} v_{i c}\n\\]\n\nIn an ideal, fully differential op amp, \\(a_{c m}=0\\) and \\(a_{d m} \\rightarrow-\\infty\\).

A simple small-signal model for a balanced, fully differential op amp that is based on (12.28) and (12.29) is shown in Fig. 12.10.

    "text": "In Figure 12.2, the operational amplifier's optimal operating point positions transistors $M_{1}-M_{5}$ within the active region and configures the direct current (DC) common-mode output voltage, $V_{O C}$, to the value that maximizes the output swing while keeping all transistors in the active region. However, as detailed in Section 4.3.5.1, $V_{O C}$ is highly susceptible to discrepancies and component variations, making the circuit's bias stability less than ideal. (Section 4.3.5.1 explains the circuit in Figure 4.24a, which includes Figure 12.2 plus two diode-connected transistors and two ideal current sources that set the DC drain currents.) It is practically unfeasible to set $V_{O C}$ in Figure 12.2 to a desired voltage because $I_{D 5}$ is independent of $\\left|I_{D 3}\\right|+\\left|I_{D 4}\\right|$.\n\nTo achieve a desired $V_{O C}$ that aligns with the common-mode voltage $V_{C M}$, optimizing the bias for all transistors in the active region and maximizing the output voltage swing, it is necessary to adjust either $V_{\\text {BIAS }}$ or $V_{G S 5}$. This adjustment ensures that $I_{D 5}=$ $\\left|I_{D 3}\\right|+\\left|I_{D 4}\\right|$ when $V_{S D 3}=V_{S D 4}=V_{D D}-V_{C M}$, resulting in $V_{O C}=V_{C M}$. Our focus will be on adjusting $V_{G S 5}$. In reality, adjusting $V_{G S 5}$ to enforce $V_{O C}=V_{C M}$ necessitates the employment of feedback mechanisms. Additional circuitry is incorporated to create a negative feedback loop that adjusts $V_{G S 5}$ to achieve $V_{O C}=V_{C M}$. Figure 12.12 illustrates a block diagram of this feedback loop, known as the common-mode feedback (CMFB) loop. The added components are referred to as the CM-sense blocks. One such block, the CM detector, determines the CM output voltage, $V_{o c}=\\left(V_{o 1}+V_{o 2}\\right) / 2$. This voltage is then subtracted from the desired $V_{C M}$, and the resultant difference is amplified by a factor of $a_{c m s}$. A DC voltage $V_{C S B I A S}$ is subsequently added, yielding $V_{c m s}$, where\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{c m s}=a_{c m s}\\left(V_{o c}-V_{C M}\\right)+V_{C S B I A S} \\tag{12.31}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n$V_{c m s}$ drives an additional op-amp input designated as CMC (for common-mode control). The CMC input is selected such that modifying $V_{c m c}$ alters $V_{o c}$ without affecting $V_{o d}$, provided the circuit remains perfectly balanced. (In Figure 12.12, $V_{c m s}$ and $V_{c m c}$ are equal. The term $V_{c m c}$ is used when referencing the CMC input of the op amp, while $V_{c m s}$ refers to the output of the CM-sense circuit.) For the op amp in Figure 12.2, the CMC input is the gate of $M_{5}$. If the gain within this CMFB loop is substantial, the negative feedback ensures that $V_{o c} \\approx V_{C M}$ and maintains $V_{c m c}$ at a relatively constant level with $V_{c m c} \\approx V_{C S B I A S}$. Transistor $M_{5}$ provides the tail current for the pair $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$. The bias voltage $V_{C S B I A S}$ is introduced to establish the nominal DC component of $V_{c m c}$ that satisfies $\\left|I_{D 3}\\right|+\\left|I_{D 4}\\right|=I_{D 5}$ when $V_{o c}=V_{C M}$.\n\nThe small-signal gain from $V_{c m c}$ to $V_{o c}$ is usually significantly greater than one. For the op amp in Figure 12.2, this gain is substantial due to the common-source configuration of $M_{5}$ with a significant load resistance at the op-amp output. (This gain will be calculated in the following example.) Frequently, the gain from $V_{c m c}$ to $V_{o c}$ is substantial enough to furnish all the necessary gain within the CMFB loop. Thus, the CM-sense amplifier $a_{c m s}$ can have a relatively low gain, and as a consequence, a broad bandwidth. Given that the CM-sense amplifier is part of the CMFB loop, a wide bandwidth for this amplifier simplifies the frequency compensation of the CMFB loop. If $V_{o c}=V_{C M}$ in Figure 12.12, $V_{c m c}=V_{C S B I A S}$. In practical applications, the bias voltage $V_{C S B I A S}$ is commonly generated within the CM-sense-amplifier circuit. Therefore, the CM-sense amplifier is designed to output a voltage equal to the nominal bias voltage required at the single-ended CMC input when its differential input voltage is zero. For the op amp in Figure 12.2, this bias voltage is $V_{G S 5}-V_{S S}$. Practical CM-sense amplifiers capable of generating such an output bias voltage will be presented in Section 12.5.\n\nThe simple op-amp model in Figure 12.10 is augmented to include the CM control (CMC) input in Figure 12.13a. The controlled source $a_{c m c}$ models the small-signal voltage gain from this novel input to $v_{o c}$, defined by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\na_{c m c}=\\left.\\frac{v_{o c}}{v_{c m c}}\\right|_{v_{i c}=0} \\tag{12.32}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIncorporating this gain, the equation for the CM output voltage in (12.29) becomes\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{o c}=a_{c m} v_{i c}+a_{c m c} v_{c m c} \\tag{12.33}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nCalculate the three voltage gains in the model in Figure 12.13a for the op amp in Figure 12.2. Utilize the $0.8-\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ CMOS model data in Table 2.3 with $\\left|V_{o v}\\right|=\\left|V_{G S}-V_{t}\\right|=0.2 \\mathrm{~V}$ and $L_{\\text {eff }}=0.8 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ for all devices.

However, as detailed in Section 4.3.5.1, the stability of the bias is compromised due to the high sensitivity of $V_{O C}$ to component mismatches and variations, making the circuit impractical.

Achieving an exact $V_{O C}$ in Fig. 12.2 is unfeasible due to the independent setting of $I_{D 5}$ from $\\left|I_{D 3}\\right|+\\left|I_{D 4}\\right|$.\n\nTo align $V_{O C}$ with a desired direct current voltage $V_{C M}$ that maintains all transistors in the active region and maximizes the output voltage swing, it's necessary to adjust either $V_{\\text {BIAS }}$ or $V_{G S 5}$. This adjustment ensures that $I_{D 5}$ equals $\\left|I_{D 3}\\right|+\\left|I_{D 4}\\right|$ when $V_{S D 3}=V_{S D 4}=V_{D D}-V_{C M}$, thereby setting $V_{O C}$ to $V_{C M}$. Our focus is on adjusting $V_{G S 5}$, a process that requires feedback in real-world applications. A negative feedback loop is incorporated into the circuit to adjust $V_{G S 5}$ and establish $V_{O C}=V_{C M}$. This feedback loop is illustrated in Fig. 12.12 and referred to as the common-mode feedback (CMFB) loop, which includes additional components known as CM-sense blocks. The CM detector, one of the CM-sense blocks, calculates the common-mode output voltage $V_{o c}=\\left(V_{o 1}+V_{o 2}\\right) / 2$. This voltage is then compared with the desired common-mode output voltage $V_{C M}$. The resulting difference $V_{o c}-V_{C M}$ is amplified by an amplifier with a gain of $a_{c m s}$, after which a direct current voltage $V_{C S B I A S}$ is added, yielding $V_{c m s}$ as follows:\n\n$$\nV_{c m s}=a_{c m s}\\left(V_{o c}-V_{C M}\\right)+V_{C S B I A S}\n$$\n\nThe $V_{c m s}$ drives a new operational amplifier input labeled CMC (for common-mode control). The CMC input is configured such that altering $V_{c m c}$ modifies $V_{o c}$ without impacting $V_{o d}$, assuming the circuit is balanced. In Fig. 12.12, $V_{c m s}$ and $V_{c m c}$ are equal; $V_{c m c}$ denotes the CMC input of the operational amplifier, while $V_{c m s}$ refers to the CM-sense circuit output. For the operational amplifier in Fig. 12.2, the CMC input corresponds to the gate of $M_{5}$. With a high gain in the CMFB loop, negative feedback ensures that $V_{o c}$ approximates $V_{C M}$ and $V_{c m c}$ remains relatively constant, with $V_{c m c}$ tending towards $V_{C S B I A S}$. Transistor $M_{5}$ provides the tail current for the pair $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$. The bias voltage $V_{C S B I A S}$ is introduced to establish the nominal direct current component of $V_{c m c}$, setting $\\left|I_{D 3}\\right|+\\left|I_{D 4}\\right|=I_{D 5}$ when $V_{o c}=V_{C M}$.\n\nThe small-signal gain from $V_{c m c}$ to $V_{o c}$ is usually significantly greater than unity. For the operational amplifier in Fig. 12.2, this gain is substantial due to the common-source configuration of $M_{5}$ with a high load resistance at the operational amplifier output. This gain is calculated in the subsequent example. Often, the gain from $V_{c m c}$ to $V_{o c}$ is sufficient to supply the necessary gain for the CMFB loop. Consequently, the CM-sense amplifier $a_{c m s}$ may have a low gain, leading to a wide bandwidth. Since the CM-sense amplifier is part of the CMFB loop, its wide bandwidth simplifies the frequency compensation of the CMFB loop. If $V_{o c}=V_{C M}$ in Fig. 12.12, then $V_{c m c}=V_{C S B I A S}$. In practice, the bias voltage $V_{C S B I A S}$ is typically generated within the CM-sense-amplifier circuit. Thus, the CM-sense amplifier is designed to output the nominal bias voltage required at the single-ended CMC input when its differential input voltage is zero. For the operational amplifier in Fig. 12.2, this bias voltage is $V_{G S 5}-V_{S S}$. Practical CM-sense amplifiers capable of generating such an output bias voltage will be presented in Section 12.5.\n\nThe simple operational amplifier model in Fig. 12.10 is modified to include the CM control (CMC) input in Fig. 12.13a. The controlled source $a_{c m c}$ models the small-signal voltage gain from this new input to $v_{o c}$:\n\n$$\na_{c m c}=\\left.\\frac{v_{o c}}{v_{c m c}}\\right|_{v_{i c}=0}\n$$\n\nIncorporating this gain, the equation for the CM output voltage in (12.29) becomes:\n\n$$\nv_{o c}=a_{c m} v_{i c}+a_{c m c} v_{c m c}\n$$\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nCalculate the three voltage gains in the model in Fig. 12.13a for the operational amplifier in Fig. 12.2 using the $0.8-\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ CMOS model data in Table 2.3 with $\\left|V_{o v}\\right|=\\left|V_{G S}-V_{t}\\right|=0.2 \\mathrm{~V}$ and $L_{\\text {eff }}=0.8 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ for all devices.

Nonetheless, as detailed in Section 4.3.5.1, $V_{O C}$ is highly susceptible to discrepancies and variations in components, making the circuit's bias stability less than ideal. (Section 4.3.5.1 elaborates on the circuit shown in Fig. 4.24a, which is an extension of Fig. 12.2, incorporating two diode-connected transistors and two ideal current sources that determine the DC drain currents.) In reality, it's unfeasible to pinpoint $V_{O C}$ in Fig. 12.2 to a precise voltage since $I_{D 5}$ is adjusted independently of $\\left|I_{D 3}\\right|+\\left|I_{D 4}\\right|$.\n\nTo align $V_{O C}$ with a desired DC voltage $V_{C M}$ that keeps all transistors in the active region and maximizes the output voltage swing, it's necessary to adjust either $V_{\\text {BIAS }}$ or $V_{G S 5}$.

The circuit is augmented with components to establish a negative feedback loop, known as the common-mode feedback (CMFB) loop, which fine-tunes $V_{G S 5}$ to secure $V_{O C}=V_{C M}$. Fig. 12.12 illustrates a block diagram of this feedback loop. The additional components are referred to as the CM-sense blocks. One such block, the CM detector, computes the CM output voltage, $V_{o c}=\\left(V_{o 1}+V_{o 2}\\right) / 2$. This voltage is then subtracted from the desired CM output voltage, $V_{C M}$. The resultant difference, $V_{o c}-V_{C M}$, is amplified by an amplifier with a gain $a_{c m s}$.

The notation $V_{c m c}$ is used when referencing the CMC input of the op amp, whereas $V_{c m s}$ refers to the output of the CM-sense circuit.) For the op amp in Fig. 12.2, the CMC input corresponds to the gate of $M_{5}$.

For instance, in the op amp in Fig. 12.2, this gain magnitude is significant due to being the gain of the common-source $M_{5}$ with a substantial load resistance at the op-amp output. (This gain will be calculated in the subsequent example.) Often, the gain from $V_{c m c}$ to $V_{o c}$ is sufficiently large to furnish all the necessary gain within the CMFB loop. Hence, the CM-sense amplifier $a_{c m s}$ can have a low gain, which in turn offers a wide bandwidth. Given that the CM-sense amplifier is part of the CMFB loop, a wide bandwidth in this amplifier simplifies the frequency compensation of the CMFB loop.

Precisely adjusting $V_{O C}$ to a target voltage in Fig. 12.2 is not feasible in practice, as $I_{D 5}$ is determined independently from the sum of $I_{D 3}$ and $I_{D 4}$.\n\nTo achieve the desired common-mode voltage $V_{C M}$ that biases all transistors in the active region and enhances the output voltage swing, the voltage $V_{\\text {BIAS }}$ or $V_{G S 5}$ must be modified so that $I_{D 5}$ equals the sum of $I_{D 3}$ and $I_{D 4}$ when $V_{S D 3}=V_{S D 4}=V_{D D}-V_{C M}$.

The ideal operating point ensures that $M_{1}-M_{5}$ remain in the active region, thereby maximizing the swing of the op-amp's outputs while maintaining all transistors within the active region. However, as outlined in Section 4.3.5.1, the dc CM output voltage $V_{O C}$ is highly susceptible to mismatches and component variations, rendering the circuit unstable in terms of biasing. (Section 4.3.5.1 delves into the circuit depicted in Figure 4.24a, which is essentially Figure 12.2 augmented with two diode-connected transistors and two ideal current sources that determine the dc drain currents.) It is impractical to pinpoint $V_{O C}$ in Figure 12.2 to a specific voltage due to the independent setting of $I_{D 5}$ from $\\left|I_{D 3}\\right|+\\left|I_{D 4}\\right|$.\n\nTo align $V_{O C}$ with a desired dc voltage $V_{C M}$ that keeps all transistors in the active region and maximizes the output voltage swing, either $V_{\\text {BIAS }}$ or $V_{G S 5}$ must be fine-tuned such that $I_{D 5}=$ $\\left|I_{D 3}\\right|+\\left|I_{D 4}\\right|$ when $V_{S D 3}=V_{S D 4}=V_{D D}-V_{C M}$, thus setting $V_{O C}=V_{C M}$. Our focus will be on adjusting $V_{G S 5}$. This adjustment necessitates the implementation of feedback, specifically a negative feedback loop that modulates $V_{G S 5}$ to achieve $V_{O C}=V_{C M}$. Figure 12.12 illustrates a block diagram of such a feedback loop, known as the common-mode feedback (CMFB) loop. The supplementary blocks are termed CM-sense blocks. The CM detector, one of the CM-sense blocks, computes the CM output voltage, $V_{o c}=\\left(V_{o 1}+V_{o 2}\\right) / 2$. This voltage is then subtracted from the desired CM output voltage, $V_{C M}$. The resultant difference $V_{o c}-V_{C M}$ is amplified by an amplifier with a gain $a_{c m s}$. A dc voltage $V_{C S B I A S}$ is subsequently added, yielding $V_{c m s}$, defined by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{c m s}=a_{c m s}\\left(V_{o c}-V_{C M}\\right)+V_{C S B I A S} \\tag{12.31}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n$V_{c m s}$ propels a new op-amp input labeled CMC (for common-mode control). The CMC input is strategically selected to adjust $V_{c m c}$, thereby altering $V_{o c}$ without impacting $V_{o d}$, provided the circuit remains balanced. (In Figure 12.12, $V_{c m s}$ and $V_{c m c}$ share the same value. $V_{c m c}$ is used when referencing the CMC input of the op amp, whereas $V_{c m s}$ denotes the output of the CM-sense circuit.) For the op amp in Figure 12.2, the CMC input corresponds to the gate of $M_{5}$. A high gain within this CMFB loop ensures that the negative feedback compels $V_{o c} \\approx V_{C M}$ and maintains $V_{c m c}$ at a constant level with $V_{c m c} \\approx V_{C S B I A S}$. Transistor $M_{5}$ furnishes the tail current for the pair $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$. The bias voltage $V_{C S B I A S}$ is introduced to establish the nominal dc component of $V_{c m c}$, which fulfills $\\left|I_{D 3}\\right|+\\left|I_{D 4}\\right|=I_{D 5}$ when $V_{o c}=V_{C M}$.\n\nThe small-signal gain magnitude from $V_{c m c}$ to $V_{o c}$ is generally much greater than one. For instance, in the op amp of Figure 12.2, this gain magnitude is substantial due to the common-source configuration of $M_{5}$, which benefits from a substantial load resistance at the op-amp output. (This gain will be calculated in the subsequent example.) Often, the gain magnitude from $V_{c m c}$ to $V_{o c}$ is sufficiently large to satisfy the CMFB loop's gain requirements. Consequently, the CM-sense amplifier $a_{c m s}$ can possess a lower gain, and as a result, a broader bandwidth. Since the CM-sense amplifier is part of the CMFB loop, a wide bandwidth in this amplifier streamlines the frequency compensation of the CMFB loop. If $V_{o c}=V_{C M}$ in Figure 12.12, $V_{c m c}=V_{C S B I A S}$. In practice, the bias voltage $V_{C S B I A S}$ is commonly generated within the CM-sense-amplifier circuit. Therefore, the CM-sense amplifier is crafted to output the nominal bias voltage required at the single-ended CMC input when its differential input voltage is null. For the op amp in Figure 12.2, this bias voltage is $V_{G S 5}-V_{S S}$. Practical CM-sense amplifiers capable of generating such an output bias voltage will be showcased in Section 12.5.\n\nThe simplified op-amp model depicted in Figure 12.10 is revised to incorporate the CM control (CMC) input, as shown in Figure 12.13a.

However, adding capacitance to the op-amp outputs increases both the CM and DM load capacitances, as indicated by (12.26) and (12.27).

Consequently, the load capacitance needed in (12.43) to ensure adequate phase margin for the CMFB loop might result in a larger DM load capacitance than intended, thereby overcompensating the DM feedback loop.

    "text": "The detection of the CM output voltage can be accomplished by utilizing two resistors of equal value, as depicted in Fig. 12.16a. The voltage measured across these resistors is given by:\n\n$$\nV_{o c}=\\frac{V_{o 1}+V_{o 2}}{2} \\tag{12.48}\n$$\n\nThis voltage is then compared with the desired CM output voltage, $V_{C M}$, through a differencing CM-sense amplifier shown in Fig. 12.16b. This amplifier comprises a source-coupled pair $M_{21}-M_{22}$, diode-connected loads $M_{23}$ and $M_{24}$, and a tail-current source $M_{25}$. The amplifier's output, which drives the CMC input of the op amp, is represented by:\n\n$$\nV_{c m s}=a_{c m s}\\left(V_{o c}-V_{C M}\\right)+V_{C S B I A S} \\tag{12.49}\n$$\n\nWhen $V_{o c}$ equals $V_{C M}$, the output voltage $V_{c m s}$ is equivalent to $V_{C S B I A S}$. In the context of Fig. 12.16b, $V_{C S B I A S}$ equals $V_{G S 23}-V_{S S}$ if $I_{D 23}=I_{D 25} / 2$. The value of $V_{G S 23}$ (or correspondingly, $I_{D 23}$ and $(W / L)_{23}$) is selected such that $I_{D 5}$ matches the designed value of $\\left|I_{D 3}\\right|+\\left|I_{D 4}\\right|$ from Fig. 12.2 when $V_{o c}=V_{C M}$.\n\nThe CMFB system illustrated in Fig. 12.16a employs a resistive divider to sense the common-mode voltage $V_{o c}$ and a CM-sense amplifier to adjust the $V_{C M}$. Two resistors $R_{c s}$ create a voltage divider between $V_{o 1}$ and $V_{o 2}$, yielding $V_{o c}$. The CM Sense Amp takes $V_{c m s}$ as input and outputs $V_{C M}$ to regulate the common-mode voltage.\n\nThe CM-sense amplifier in Fig. 12.16b includes PMOS and NMOS transistors to control the common-mode voltage, with PMOS transistors connected to $V_{D D}$ and NMOS transistors connected to $V_{S S}$. The system modifies the output $V_{C M}$ to maintain a stable common-mode voltage.\n\nThe small-signal voltage gain of the CM-sense amplifier, $a_{c m s}$, is defined in equation (12.50) as:\n\n$$\na_{c m s}=\\left.\\frac{v_{c m s}}{v_{o c}}\\right|_{\\text {CMFB loop open }}=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{g_{m 21}}{g_{m 23}} \\tag{12.50}\n$$\n\nHere, the assumption is made that the CM gain of the CM-sense amplifier is significantly smaller than its DM gain. The multiplication by $1 / 2$ in equation (12.50) occurs because the output is derived from only one side of the differential amplifier.\n\nAn example is provided to determine the value of $V_{C M}$ that maximizes the output swing for the differential op amp in Fig. 12.2, using the CMFB scheme in Fig. 12.16a and designing the CM-sense amplifier in Fig. 12.16b. Given the assumption that the CM-sense resistors $R_{c s}$ are very large and can be disregarded when calculating small-signal voltage gains for the op amp, the example proceeds with the provided data and assumptions, setting $V_{D D}=V_{S S}=2.5 \\mathrm{~V}$ and assuming $V_{i c}=0$. The body effect is ignored.\n\nFor the op amp in Fig. 12.2, with a large DM gain and operating in a DM negative feedback loop, $V_{i d} \\approx 0$. Thus, both op-amp inputs are close to ground, given $V_{i c}=0$. The output $V_{o 1}$ reaches its lower limit when transistor $M_{1}$ enters the triode region, which occurs at $V_{g d 1}=V_{t 1}$. Therefore:\n\n$$\nV_{o 1(\\min )}=-V_{t 1}+V_{i 1} \\approx-V_{t 1}=-0.7 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nThe upper output swing limit occurs when $M_{3}$ enters the triode region:\n\n$$\nV_{o 1(\\max )}=V_{D D}-\\left|V_{o v 3}\\right|=2.5-0.2=2.3 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nTo maximize the output swing, the dc CM output voltage $V_{O C}$ should be set at the midpoint between the swing limits:\n\n$$\nV_{O C}=\\frac{V_{o 1(\\max )}+V_{O 1(\\min )}}{2}=\\frac{2.3+(-0.7)}{2}=0.8 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nThus, $V_{C M}$ is chosen to be 0.8 V. The resulting peak differential output voltage is:\n\n$$\nV_{o d(\\text { peak })}=V_{o 1(\\max )}-V_{o 2(\\min )}=V_{o 1(\\max )}-V_{o 1(\\min )}=2.3-(-0.7)=3.0 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nTo design the CM-sense amplifier in Fig. 12.16b, a value for its low-frequency gain must be selected. In the CMFB loop, the loop gain is $\\left(-a_{c m c}\\right) a_{c m s}$. From the previous example, $a_{c m c}=-196$. By designing for $a_{c m s}=1$, the CMFB loop gain becomes 196, and using equation (12.39), $A_{C M F B}=0.995$. Consequently, $V_{o c}$ closely follows changes in $V_{C M}$. With this gain selection for the CM-sense amplifier in Fig. 12.16b, equation (12.50) yields:\n\n$$\na_{c m s}=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{g_{m 21}}{g_{m 23}}=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\sqrt{2 k_{p}^{\\prime}(W / L)_{21}\\left|I_{D 21}\\right|}}{\\sqrt{2 k_{n}^{\\prime}(W / L)_{23} I_{D 23}}}=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\sqrt{k_{p}^{\\prime}(W / L)_{21}}}{\\sqrt{k_{n}^{\\prime}(W / L)_{23}}}=1 \\tag{12.51}\n$$\n\nThe dc output voltage of the CM-sense amplifier when $V_{o c}=V_{C M}$ should equal the dc voltage required at the CMC op-amp input, which is:\n\n$$\n-V_{S S}+V_{G S 5}=-V_{S S}+V_{t 5}+V_{o v 5}\n$$\n\nThis dc voltage is generated by the CM-sense amplifier if $M_{5}$ and $M_{23}$ have equal overdrive voltages. Assuming that $r_{o} \\rightarrow \\infty$, matching $V_{o v 5}$ and $V_{o v 23}$ necessitates that $M_{5}$ and $M_{23}$ have equal drain-current-to-$W / L$ ratios:\n\n$$\n\\frac{I_{D 5}}{(W / L)_{5}}=\\frac{I_{D 23}}{(W / L)_{23}} \\tag{12.52}\n$$\n\nEquations 12.51 and 12.52 contain three unknowns: $I_{D 23},(W / L)_{23}$, and $(W / L)_{21}$. Therefore, multiple possible solutions exist. One simple solution is $I_{D 23}=I_{D 5}$ and $(W / L)_{23}=(W / L)_{5}$. Then $(W / L)_{21}$ can be determined from equation (12.51). Although this solution is straightforward, it requires the CM-sense amplifier to dissipate as much dc current as the op amp. Equations 12.51 and 12.52 can be solved with $I_{D 23}<I_{D 5}$, which decreases the power dissipation in the CM-sense amplifier. However, the magnitude of the pole associated with the $M_{5}-M_{23}$ current mirror decreases with decreasing $I_{D 23}$. Assuming that all capacitors except the gate-source capacitors for $M_{5}$ and $M_{23}$ are negligible and that $L_{23}$ is fixed, the magnitude of the nondominant pole associated with the current mirror is:\n\n$$\n\\left|p_{n d}\\right|=\\frac{g_{m 23}}{C_{g s 5}+C_{g s 23}}=\\frac{\\frac{2 I_{D 23}}{V_{o v 23}}}{C_{g s 5}+(2 / 3) C_{o x} W_{23} L_{23}} \\tag{12.53}\n$$\n\nSince the small-signal resistance of diode-connected $M_{23}$ is $1 / g_{m 23}$ (assuming that $r_{o 23} \\gg$ $1 / g_{m 23}$), if $I_{D 23}$ is scaled by a factor $x$ (where $x<1$) and $M_{5}$ remains unchanged, $W_{23}$ must also scale by the factor $x$ to satisfy equation (12.52). With this scaling, the pole magnitude in equation (12.53) decreases because the numerator scales by the factor $x$, but the denominator scales by a factor greater than $x$ due to the constant $C_{g 5}$ term in the denominator. This pole appears in the CMFB loop gain. Thus, the phase margin of the CMFB loop decreases as this pole magnitude decreases due to a reduction in $I_{D 23}$.\n\nIt is essential to confirm that the CM input range of the CM-sense amplifier encompasses its CM input voltage, which is $V_{C M}=0.8 \\mathrm{~V}$. The upper limit of the CM input voltage occurs when $M_{25}$ enters the triode region, at which point $\\left|V_{D S 25}\\right|=\\left|V_{o v 25}\\right|$. Therefore, the desired inequality is:\n\n$$\nV_{I C}<V_{D D}-\\left|V_{o v 25}\\right|-\\left|V_{G S 21}\\right|\n$$\n\nThe lower limit of the CM input voltage occurs when $M_{21}$ (or $M_{22}$) enters the triode region (when $V_{G D 21}=V_{t 21}$), hence:\n\n$$\nV_{I C}>-V_{S S}+V_{G S 23}-\\left|V_{t 21}\\right|\n$$\n\nThe applied CM input voltage of 0.8 V lies within these limits, ensuring that all transistors function in the active region as assumed.\n\nIn this CMFB approach, the inputs to the CM-sense amplifier ideally remain constant, simplifying its design. One drawback of this CM-sense circuit is that the $R_{c s}$ resistors and the input capacitance of the CM-sense amplifier introduce a pole in the transfer function of the CM-sense circuit and, consequently, in the CMFB loop. A capacitor $C_{c s}$ can be connected in parallel with each sense resistor to introduce a left-half-plane zero in the CM-sense circuit to mitigate the pole's impact at high frequencies.\n\nAnother disadvantage is that the sense resistor $R_{c s}$ loads the op-amp output in the DM half-circuit, as the node between the resistors acts as a DM ac ground. This loading diminishes the open-loop differential voltage gain unless $R_{c s}$ is significantly larger than the output resistance of the DM half-circuit.\n\nTo prevent this resistive output loading, voltage buffers can be added between the op-amp outputs and the $R_{c s}$ resistors, with source followers serving as buffers in Fig. 12.17. One potential issue is that each source follower introduces a dc offset of $V_{G S}$ between its input and output. To prevent a shift in the CM operating point caused by these offsets, the voltage $V_{C M}$ can be buffered by an identical source follower, ensuring that the op-amp output voltages and $V_{C M}$ experience equal offsets. However, these offsets restrict the op-amp output swing since each source-follower transistor connecting to an op-amp output must remain in the active region throughout the entire output voltage swing.\n\nThe CMFB scheme in Fig. 12.16 can be altered to remove the $M_{23}-M_{5}$ current mirror from the CMFB loop, as shown in Fig. 12.18. This revised CM-sense amplifier directly injects currents to regulate the op-amp CM output. In this configuration, $M_{21}$ from Fig. 12.16b is split into two matched transistors, $M_{21 A}$ and $M_{21 B}$, with each transistor's drain connected to an op-amp output.

This amplifier comprises a source-coupled pair $M_{21}-M_{22}$, diode-connected loads $M_{23}$ and $M_{24}$, and a tail-current source $M_{25}$. The amplifier's output, which drives the CMC input of the operational amplifier, is given by:\n\n$$\nV_{c m s}=a_{c m s}\\left(V_{o c}-V_{C M}\\right)+V_{C S B I A S} \\tag{12.49}\n$$\n\nWhen $V_{o c}=V_{C M}$, then $V_{c m s}=V_{C S B I A S}$. For the circuit in Figure 12.16b, $V_{C S B I A S}$ equals $V_{G S 23}-V_{S S}$ when $I_{D 23}=I_{D 25} / 2$. The value of $V_{G S 23}$ (or, equivalently, $I_{D 23}$ and $(W / L)_{23}$) is selected such that $I_{D 5}$ matches the designed value of $\\left|I_{D 3}\\right|+\\left|I_{D 4}\\right|$ in Figure 12.2 when $V_{o c}=V_{C M}$.\n\nThe CMFB system depicted in Figure 12.16a employs a resistive divider to detect $V_{o c}$ and a CM-sense amplifier to adjust $V_{C M}$. Two resistors $R_{c s}$ form a voltage divider between $V_{o 1}$ and $V_{o 2}$, yielding $V_{o c}$. The CM Sense Amp takes $V_{c m s}$ as input and outputs $V_{C M}$ to regulate the common-mode voltage.\n\nThe CMFB system in Figure 12.16b utilizes PMOS and NMOS transistors to manage the common-mode voltage. The PMOS transistors are connected to $V_{D D}$, and the NMOS transistors are connected to $V_{S S}$. The system adjusts the output $V_{C M}$ to maintain a stable common-mode voltage.\n\nThe small-signal voltage gain of the CM-sense amplifier, $a_{c m s}$, is defined in equation (12.50) as:\n\n$$\na_{c m s}=\\left.\\frac{v_{c m s}}{v_{o c}}\\right|_{\\text {CMFB loop open }}=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{g_{m 21}}{g_{m 23}} \\tag{12.50}\n$$\n\nHere, it is assumed that the CM gain of the CM-sense amplifier is significantly smaller than its DM gain. The factor of $1 / 2$ multiplying $g_{m 21} / g_{m 23}$ in equation (12.50) is due to the output being taken from only one side of the differential amplifier.\n\nThe CMFB scheme in Figure 12.16a and b is used to determine the value of $V_{C M}$ that maximizes the output swing for the differential op amp in Figure 12.2. The CM-sense amplifier in Figure 12.16b is designed with the assumption that the CM-sense resistors $R_{c s}$ are very large and can be neglected when calculating small-signal voltage gains for the op amp. The design assumes $V_{D D}=V_{S S}=2.5 \\mathrm{~V}$ and $V_{i c}=0$, with the body effect ignored.\n\nFor the op amp in Figure 12.2, if the magnitude of its DM gain is large and if the op amp operates in a DM negative feedback loop, $V_{i d} \\approx 0$. Consequently, both op-amp inputs will be close to ground since $V_{i c}=0$; that is, $V_{i 1}=V_{i c}+$ $V_{i d} / 2 \\approx 0$ and $V_{i 2}=V_{i c}-V_{i d} / 2 \\approx 0$. The output $V_{o 1}$ reaches its lower limit when $M_{1}$ enters the triode region, which occurs when $V_{g d 1}=V_{t 1}$; therefore,\n\n$$\nV_{o 1(\\min )}=-V_{t 1}+V_{i 1} \\approx-V_{t 1}=-0.7 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nThe upper output swing limit occurs when $M_{3}$ enters the triode region, and\n\n$$\nV_{o 1(\\max )}=V_{D D}-\\left|V_{o v 3}\\right|=2.5-0.2=2.3 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nTo maximize the output swing, the dc CM output voltage $V_{O C}$ should be halfway between the swing limits:\n\n$$\nV_{O C}=\\frac{V_{o 1(\\max )}+V_{O 1(\\min )}}{2}=\\frac{2.3+(-0.7)}{2}=0.8 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nThus, $V_{C M}$ is chosen to be 0.8 V. The resulting peak differential output voltage is:\n\n$$\nV_{o d(\\text { peak })}=V_{o 1(\\max )}-V_{o 2(\\min )}=V_{o 1(\\max )}-V_{o 1(\\min )}=2.3-(-0.7)=3.0 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nTo design the CM-sense amplifier in Figure 12.16b, a value for its low-frequency gain must be selected. In the CMFB loop, the loop gain is $\\left(-a_{c m c}\\right) a_{c m s}$. From the previous example, $a_{c m c}=-196$. If $a_{c m s}=1$ is designed, the CMFB loop gain is 196, and equation (12.39) gives $A_{C M F B}=0.995$. Hence, $V_{o c}$ closely tracks changes in $V_{C M}$. With this gain choice in the CM-sense amplifier in Figure 12.16b, equation (12.50) yields:\n\n$$\na_{c m s}=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{g_{m 21}}{g_{m 23}}=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\sqrt{2 k_{p}^{\\prime}(W / L)_{21}\\left|I_{D 21}\\right|}}{\\sqrt{2 k_{n}^{\\prime}(W / L)_{23} I_{D 23}}}=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\sqrt{k_{p}^{\\prime}(W / L)_{21}}}{\\sqrt{k_{n}^{\\prime}(W / L)_{23}}}=1 \\tag{12.51}\n$$\n\nThe dc output voltage of the CM-sense amplifier when $V_{o c}=V_{C M}$ should equal the dc voltage required at the CMC op-amp input, which is:\n\n$$\n-V_{S S}+V_{G S 5}=-V_{S S}+V_{t 5}+V_{o v 5}\n$$\n\nThis dc voltage is produced by the CM-sense amplifier if $M_{5}$ and $M_{23}$ have equal overdrive voltages. Assuming that $r_{o} \\rightarrow \\infty$, matching $V_{o v 5}$ and $V_{o v 23}$ requires that $M_{5}$ and $M_{23}$ have equal drain-current-to-$W / L$ ratios:\n\n$$\n\\frac{I_{D 5}}{(W / L)_{5}}=\\frac{I_{D 23}}{(W / L)_{23}} \\tag{12.52}\n$$\n\nIn equations (12.51) and (12.52), there are three unknowns: $I_{D 23},(W / L)_{23}$, and $(W / L)_{21}$. Therefore, many possible solutions exist. [Note that $(W / L)_{5}$ can be determined from $V_{o v 5}=0.2 \\mathrm{~V}$ (by assumption) and $I_{D 5}=200 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$.]\n\nOne simple solution is $I_{D 23}=I_{D 5}$ and $(W / L)_{23}=(W / L)_{5}$. Then $(W / L)_{21}$ can be determined from equation (12.51). While this solution is straightforward, it necessitates as much dc current in the CM-sense amplifier as in the op amp. Equations 12.51 and 12.52 can be solved with $I_{D 23}<I_{D 5}$, which reduces the power dissipation in the CM-sense amplifier. However, the magnitude of the pole associated with the $M_{5}-M_{23}$ current mirror decreases as $I_{D 23}$ decreases. To illustrate this point, all capacitors except the gate-source capacitors for $M_{5}$ and $M_{23}$ are ignored, and $L_{23}$ is assumed to be fixed. Then the magnitude of the nondominant pole associated with the current mirror is:\n\n$$\n\\left|p_{n d}\\right|=\\frac{g_{m 23}}{C_{g s 5}+C_{g s 23}}=\\frac{\\frac{2 I_{D 23}}{V_{o v 23}}}{C_{g s 5}+(2 / 3) C_{o x} W_{23} L_{23}} \\tag{12.53}\n$$\n\nsince the small-signal resistance of diode-connected $M_{23}$ is $1 / g_{m 23}$ (assuming that $r_{o 23} \\gg$ $1 / g_{m 23}$ ). If $I_{D 23}$ is scaled by a factor $x(x<1)$ and if $M_{5}$ is unchanged, $W_{23}$ must also scale by the factor $x$ to satisfy equation (12.52). With this scaling, the pole magnitude in equation (12.53) decreases because the numerator scales by the factor $x$, but the denominator scales by a factor greater than $x$ due to the constant $C_{g 5}$ term in the denominator. This pole appears in the CMFB loop gain. Therefore, the phase margin of the CMFB loop decreases as this pole magnitude decreases due to a decrease in $I_{D 23}$.\n\nFinally, it is essential to confirm that the CM input range of the CM-sense amplifier encompasses its CM input voltage, which is $V_{C M}=0.8 \\mathrm{~V}$. The upper limit of the CM input voltage occurs when $M_{25}$ enters the triode region, when $\\left|V_{D S 25}\\right|=\\left|V_{o v 25}\\right|$; hence, we desire:\n\n$$\nV_{I C}<V_{D D}-\\left|V_{o v 25}\\right|-\\left|V_{G S 21}\\right| =V_{D D}-\\left|V_{o v 25}\\right|-\\left|V_{t p}\\right|-\\left|V_{o v 21}\\right| =2.5-0.2-0.7-0.2=1.4 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nThe lower limit of the CM input voltage occurs when $M_{21}$ (or $M_{22}$) enters the triode region (when $V_{G D 21}=V_{t 21}$); therefore,\n\n$$\nV_{I C}>-V_{S S}+V_{G S 23}-\\left|V_{t 21}\\right| =-V_{S S}+\\left(V_{t n}+V_{o v 23}\\right)-\\left|V_{t p}\\right| =-2.5+(0.7+0.2)-0.7=-2.3 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nThe applied CM input voltage of 0.8 V falls between these limits; hence, all transistors operate in the active region as assumed.\n\nIn this CMFB approach, the inputs to the CM-sense amplifier are ideally constant, simplifying its design. One drawback of this CM-sense circuit is that the $R_{c s}$ resistors and the input capacitance of the CM-sense amplifier introduce a pole in the transfer function of the CM-sense circuit and, consequently, in the CMFB loop. A capacitor $C_{c s}$ can be connected in parallel with each sense resistor to introduce a left-half-plane zero in the CM-sense circuit to mitigate the effect of the pole at high frequencies. (See Problem 12.18.)\n\nAnother drawback of this CM-sense circuit is that the sense resistor $R_{c s}$ loads the op-amp output in the DM half-circuit, since the node between the resistors is a DM ac ground. This loading reduces the open-loop differential voltage gain unless $R_{c s}$ is much larger than the output resistance of the DM half-circuit.\n\nTo prevent this resistive output loading, voltage buffers can be added between the op-amp outputs and the $R_{c s}$ resistors. Source followers are employed as buffers in Figure 12.17. One potential issue is that each source follower introduces a dc offset of $V_{G S}$ between its input and output. To prevent a shift in the CM operating point caused by these offsets, the voltage $V_{C M}$ can be buffered by an identical source follower so that the op-amp output voltages and $V_{C M}$ experience equal offsets. However, these offsets limit the op-amp output swing since each source-follower transistor that connects to an op-amp output must remain in the active region over the entire output voltage swing.\n\nThe CMFB scheme in Figure 12.16 can be modified to remove the $M_{23}-M_{5}$ current mirror from the CMFB loop, as shown in Figure 12.18. This modified CM-sense amplifier directly injects currents to control the op-amp CM output. ${ }^{5}$ Here, $M_{21}$ in Figure 12.16b is split into two matched transistors, $M_{21 A}$ and $M_{21 B}$, and the drain of each transistor connects to an op-amp output. The current injected by $M_{21 A}$ and $M_{21 B}$ into either output is:\n\n$$\nI_{c m s}=\\frac{I_{26}}{4}-\\frac{g_{m 21 A}}{2}\\left(V_{o c}-V_{C M}\\right)\n$$\n\nTransistors $M_{3}-M_{5}$ act as current sources. The CMFB loop will adjust $I_{c m s}$ so that:\n\n$$\n\\left|I_{D 3}\\right|+\\left|I_{D 4}\\right|+2 I_{c m s}=I_{D 5}\n$$\n\nIf $V_{o c}=V_{C M}$, $M_{21 A}$, $M_{21 B}$, and $M_{22}$ yield $2 I_{c m s}=I_{26} / 2$. Hence, $I_{26}$ should be selected so that:\n\n$$\n\\left|I_{D 3}\\right|+\\left|I_{D 4}\\right|+\\frac{I_{26}}{2}=I_{D 5}\n$$\n\nwhen all devices are active.\n\nAn advantage of this approach is that it avoids the pole associated with the $M_{5}-M_{23}$ current mirror in Figures 12.2 and 12.16. However, $M_{21 A}$ and $M_{21 B}$ add resistive and capacitive loading at the op-amp outputs. If an op amp uses cascoded devices, $M_{21 A}$ and $M_{21 B}$ can connect to low-impedance cascode nodes to reduce the impact of this loading."

    "text": "The detection of the common-mode (CM) output voltage can be achieved using two resistors of equal value, as depicted in Figure 12.16a. The voltage measured across these resistors is given by:\n\n$$\nV_{o c}=\\frac{V_{o 1}+V_{o 2}}{2} \\tag{12.48}\n$$\n\nThis voltage is then compared with the target CM output voltage, $V_{C M}$, and the difference is amplified by the CM-sense amplifier in Figure 12.16b. This amplifier comprises a source-coupled pair $M_{21}-M_{22}$, diode-connected loads $M_{23}$ and $M_{24}$, and a tail-current source $M_{25}$. The amplifier's output, which drives the CMC input of the op amp, is expressed as:\n\n$$\nV_{c m s}=a_{c m s}\\left(V_{o c}-V_{C M}\\right)+V_{C S B I A S} \\tag{12.49}\n$$\n\nWhen $V_{o c}$ equals $V_{C M}$, $V_{c m s}$ becomes equal to $V_{C S B I A S}$. Hence, for the circuit in Figure 12.16b, $V_{C S B I A S}$ equals $V_{G S 23}-V_{S S}$ when $I_{D 23}=I_{D 25} / 2$. The value of $V_{G S 23}$ (or equivalently, $I_{D 23}$ and $(W / L)_{23}$) is selected such that $I_{D 5}$ matches the designed value of $\\left|I_{D 3}\\right|+\\left|I_{D 4}\\right|$ in Figure 12.2 when $V_{o c}=V_{C M}$.\n\nThe CM-sense amplifier is a part of a common-mode feedback (CMFB) system, which includes a resistive divider for detecting the common-mode voltage $V_{o c}$ and a CM-sense amplifier to adjust $V_{C M}$. Two resistors, Rcs, form a voltage divider between $V_{o 1}$ and $V_{o 2}$, yielding $V_{o c}$. The CM Sense Amp takes $V_{c m s}$ as input and outputs $V_{C M}$ to regulate the common-mode voltage.\n\nThe amplifier circuit also includes PMOS and NMOS transistors to control the common-mode voltage. The PMOS transistors are connected to the VDD, and the NMOS transistors are connected to the VSS. The system modifies the output $V_{C M}$ to maintain a stable common-mode voltage.\n\nIn equation (12.49), $a_{c m s}$ represents the small-signal voltage gain of the CM-sense amplifier:\n\n$$\na_{c m s}=\\left.\\frac{v_{c m s}}{v_{o c}}\\right|_{\\text {CMFB loop open }}=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{g_{m 21}}{g_{m 23}} \\tag{12.50}\n$$\n\nIt is assumed that the CM gain of the CM-sense amplifier is much smaller than its differential-mode (DM) gain. The factor of $1 / 2$ in equation (12.50) arises because the output is taken from only one side of the differential amplifier.\n\nThe design of the CM-sense amplifier in Figure 12.16b involves selecting a value for its low-frequency gain. The loop gain in the CMFB loop is $\\left(-a_{c m c}\\right) a_{c m s}$. Assuming $a_{c m c}=-196$ and designing for $a_{c m s}=1$, the CMFB loop gain is 196. This ensures that $V_{o c}$ closely tracks changes in $V_{C M}$. With this gain in the CM-sense amplifier, equation (12.50) provides:\n\n$$\na_{c m s}=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{g_{m 21}}{g_{m 23}}=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\sqrt{2 k_{p}^{\\prime}(W / L)_{21}\\left|I_{D 21}\\right|}}{\\sqrt{2 k_{n}^{\\prime}(W / L)_{23} I_{D 23}}}=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\sqrt{k_{p}^{\\prime}(W / L)_{21}}}{\\sqrt{k_{n}^{\\prime}(W / L)_{23}}}=1 \\tag{12.51}\n$$\n\nThe dc output voltage of the CM-sense amplifier when $V_{o c}=V_{C M}$ should match the dc voltage required at the CMC op-amp input. This voltage is produced by the CM-sense amplifier if $M_{5}$ and $M_{23}$ have equal overdrive voltages. Assuming that $r_{o} \\rightarrow \\infty$, matching $V_{o v 5}$ and $V_{o v 23}$ necessitates that $M_{5}$ and $M_{23}$ have equal drain-current-to-$W / L$ ratios:\n\n$$\n\\frac{I_{D 5}}{(W / L)_{5}}=\\frac{I_{D 23}}{(W / L)_{23}} \\tag{12.52}\n$$\n\nEquations 12.51 and 12.52 present three unknowns: $I_{D 23},(W / L)_{23}$, and $(W / L)_{21}$. Numerous solutions are possible. One straightforward solution is $I_{D 23}=I_{D 5}$ and $(W / L)_{23}=(W / L)_{5}$. Then $(W / L)_{21}$ can be determined from equation (12.51). However, this solution consumes as much dc current in the CM-sense amplifier as in the op amp. Equations 12.51 and 12.52 can be solved with $I_{D 23}<I_{D 5}$, reducing the power dissipation in the CM-sense amplifier. Reducing $I_{D 23}$ decreases the magnitude of the pole associated with the $M_{5}-M_{23}$ current mirror. Assuming $L_{23}$ is fixed, the magnitude of the nondominant pole associated with the current mirror is:\n\n$$\n\\left|p_{n d}\\right|=\\frac{g_{m 23}}{C_{g s 5}+C_{g s 23}}=\\frac{\\frac{2 I_{D 23}}{V_{o v 23}}}{C_{g s 5}+(2 / 3) C_{o x} W_{23} L_{23}} \\tag{12.53}\n$$\n\nScaling $I_{D 23}$ by a factor $x(x<1)$ and scaling $W_{23}$ by the same factor to satisfy equation (12.52) reduces the pole magnitude in equation (12.53). This pole affects the CMFB loop gain and thus decreases the phase margin of the CMFB loop as the pole magnitude decreases due to a reduction in $I_{D 23}$.\n\nIt is crucial to ensure that the CM input range of the CM-sense amplifier encompasses its CM input voltage, which is $V_{C M}=0.8 \\mathrm{~V}$. The upper limit of the CM input voltage is determined when $M_{25}$ enters the triode region, while the lower limit is defined when $M_{21}$ (or $M_{22}$) enters the triode region. The applied CM input voltage of 0.8 V falls between these limits, ensuring that all transistors operate in the active region as assumed.\n\nThis CMFB approach simplifies the design of the CM-sense amplifier since its inputs are ideally constant. However, the $R_{c s}$ resistors and the input capacitance of the CM-sense amplifier introduce a pole in the transfer function of the CM-sense circuit and, consequently, in the CMFB loop. A capacitor $C_{c s}$ can be connected in parallel with each sense resistor to introduce a left-half-plane zero in the CM-sense circuit, mitigating the pole's effect at high frequencies.\n\nAnother drawback of this CM-sense circuit is that the sense resistor $R_{c s}$ loads the op-amp output in the DM half-circuit, reducing the open-loop differential voltage gain unless $R_{c s}$ is significantly larger than the output resistance of the DM half-circuit. To prevent this resistive output loading, voltage buffers can be added between the op-amp outputs and the $R_{c s}$ resistors, with source followers serving as buffers in Figure 12.17. Each source follower introduces a dc offset of $V_{G S}$ between its input and output. To avoid shifting the CM operating point due to these offsets, $V_{C M}$ can be buffered by an identical source follower, ensuring that the op-amp output voltages and $V_{C M}$ experience equal offsets. However, these offsets limit the op-amp output swing since each source-follower transistor connecting to an op-amp output must remain in the active region throughout the entire output voltage swing.\n\nThe CMFB scheme in Figure 12.16 can be modified to eliminate the $M_{23}-M_{5}$ current mirror from the CMFB loop, as shown in Figure 12.18. This modified CM-sense amplifier directly injects currents to control the op-amp CM output. Here, $M_{21}$ in Figure 12.16b is split into two matched transistors, $M_{21 A}$ and $M_{21 B}$, with each transistor's drain connecting to an op-amp output. The current injected by $M_{21 A}$ and $M_{21 B}$ into either output is:\n\n$$\nI_{c m s}=\\frac{I_{26}}{4}-\\frac{g_{m 21 A}}{2}\\left(V_{o c}-V_{C M}\\right)\n$$\n\nTransistors $M_{3}-M_{5}$ function as current sources. The CMFB loop adjusts $I_{c m s}$ such that:\n\n$$\n\\left|I_{D 3}\\right|+\\left|I_{D 4}\\right|+2 I_{c m s}=I_{D 5}\n$$\n\nWhen $V_{o c}=V_{C M}$, $M_{21 A}$, $M_{21 B}$, and $M_{22}$ yield $2 I_{c m s}=I_{26} / 2$. Thus, $I_{26}$ should be chosen such that:\n\n$$\n\\left|I_{D 3}\\right|+\\left|I_{D 4}\\right|+\\frac{I_{26}}{2}=I_{D 5}\n$$\n\nwhen all devices are active. This approach avoids the pole associated with the $M_{5}-M_{23}$ current mirror in Figures 12.2 and 12.16. However, $M_{21 A}$ and $M_{21 B}$ add resistive and capacitive loading at the op-amp outputs. If an op amp employs cascoded devices, $M_{21 A}$ and $M_{21 B}$ can connect to low-impedance cascode nodes to minimize the impact of this loading."

The factor of $1 / 2$ multiplying $g_{m 21} / g_{m 23}$ in equation (12.50) reflects that the output is derived from only one side of the differential amplifier.\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nTo find the value of $V_{C M}$ that maximizes the output swing for the differential op amp in Fig. 12.2, we utilize the CMFB scheme in Fig. 12.16a and design the CM-sense amplifier in Fig. 12.16b. Assume that the CM-sense resistors $R_{c s}$ are very large and can be disregarded when calculating small-signal voltage gains for the op amp. Employ the data and assumptions from the penultimate example with $V_{D D}=V_{S S}=2.5 \\mathrm{~V}$ and assume $V_{i c}=0$. Neglect the body effect.\n\nFor the op amp in Fig. 12.2, with a large DM gain and operating in a DM negative feedback loop, $V_{i d} \\approx 0$. Consequently, both op-amp inputs will be near ground, as $V_{i c}=0$; hence, $V_{i 1}=V_{i c}+V_{i d} / 2 \\approx 0$ and $V_{i 2}=V_{i c}-V_{i d} / 2 \\approx 0$. The output $V_{o 1}$ reaches its lower limit when $M_{1}$ enters the triode region, which occurs at $V_{g d 1}=V_{t 1}$; thus,\n\n$$\nV_{o 1(\\min )}=-V_{t 1}+V_{i 1} \\approx-V_{t 1}=-0.7 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nThe upper output swing limit occurs when $M_{3}$ enters the triode region, resulting in:\n\n$$\nV_{o 1(\\max )}=V_{D D}-\\left|V_{o v 3}\\right|=2.5-0.2=2.3 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nTo maximize the output swing, the dc CM output voltage $V_{O C}$ should be midway between the swing limits:\n\n$$\nV_{O C}=\\frac{V_{o 1(\\max )}+V_{O 1(\\min )}}{2}=\\frac{2.3+(-0.7)}{2}=0.8 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nThus, we select $V_{C M}=0.8 \\mathrm{~V}$. The peak differential output voltage is then:\n\n$$\nV_{o d(\\text { peak })}=V_{o 1(\\max )}-V_{o 2(\\min )}=V_{o 1(\\max )}-V_{o 1(\\min )}=2.3-(-0.7)=3.0 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nFor designing the CM-sense amplifier in Fig. 12.16b, we must determine its low-frequency gain. In the CMFB loop, the loop gain is $\\left(-a_{c m c}\\right) a_{c m s}$. From the previous example, $a_{c m c}=-196$. If we design for $a_{c m s}=1$, the CMFB loop gain is 196, and equation (12.39) yields $A_{C M F B}=0.995$. Hence, $V_{o c}$ closely follows changes in $V_{C M}$. With this gain in the CM-sense amplifier in Fig. 12.16b, equation (12.50) gives:\n\n$$\na_{c m s}=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{g_{m 21}}{g_{m 23}}=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\sqrt{2 k_{p}^{\\prime}(W / L)_{21}\\left|I_{D 21}\\right|}}{\\sqrt{2 k_{n}^{\\prime}(W / L)_{23} I_{D 23}}}=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\sqrt{k_{p}^{\\prime}(W / L)_{21}}}{\\sqrt{k_{n}^{\\prime}(W / L)_{23}}}=1 \\tag{12.51}\n$$\n\nThe dc output voltage of the CM-sense amplifier when $V_{o c}=V_{C M}$ should match the dc voltage required at the CMC op-amp input, which is:\n\n$$\n-V_{S S}+V_{G S 5}=-V_{S S}+V_{t 5}+V_{o v 5}\n$$\n\nThis dc voltage is produced by the CM-sense amplifier if $M_{5}$ and $M_{23}$ have equal overdrive voltages. Assuming $r_{o} \\rightarrow \\infty$, matching $V_{o v 5}$ and $V_{o v 23}$ necessitates that $M_{5}$ and $M_{23}$ have equal drain-current-to-$W / L$ ratios:\n\n$$\n\\frac{I_{D 5}}{(W / L)_{5}}=\\frac{I_{D 23}}{(W / L)_{23}} \\tag{12.52}\n$$\n\nIn equations (12.51) and (12.52), there are three unknowns: $I_{D 23},(W / L)_{23}$, and $(W / L)_{21}$. Numerous possible solutions exist. [Note that $(W / L)_{5}$ can be determined from $V_{o v 5}=0.2 \\mathrm{~V}$ (by assumption) and $I_{D 5}=200 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$.]\n\nA straightforward solution is $I_{D 23}=I_{D 5}$ and $(W / L)_{23}=(W / L)_{5}$. Then $(W / L)_{21}$ can be derived from equation (12.51). Although this solution is simple, it necessitates as much dc current in the CM-sense amplifier as in the op amp. Equations 12.51 and 12.52 can be solved with $I_{D 23}<I_{D 5}$, which diminishes the power dissipation in the CM-sense amplifier. However, the magnitude of the pole related to the $M_{5}-M_{23}$ current mirror diminishes as $I_{D 23}$ decreases. To demonstrate this, we will disregard all capacitors except the gate-source capacitors for $M_{5}$ and $M_{23}$ and assume $L_{23}$ is fixed. The magnitude of the nondominant pole associated with the current mirror is then:\n\n$$\n\\left|p_{n d}\\right|=\\frac{g_{m 23}}{C_{g s 5}+C_{g s 23}}=\\frac{\\frac{2 I_{D 23}}{V_{o v 23}}}{C_{g s 5}+(2 / 3) C_{o x} W_{23} L_{23}} \\tag{12.53}\n$$\n\nsince the small-signal resistance of diode-connected $M_{23}$ is $1 / g_{m 23}$ (assuming that $r_{o 23} \\gg$ $1 / g_{m 23}$). If $I_{D 23}$ is scaled by a factor $x(x<1)$ and $M_{5}$ remains unchanged, $W_{23}$ must also scale by the factor $x$ to satisfy equation (12.52). With this scaling, the pole magnitude in equation (12.53) decreases because the numerator scales by the factor $x$, but the denominator scales by a factor greater than $x$ due to the constant $C_{g 5}$ term in the denominator. This pole appears in the CMFB loop gain. Consequently, the phase margin of the CMFB loop decreases as this pole magnitude decreases due to a decrease in $I_{D 23}$.\n\nFinally, we must confirm that the CM input range of the CM-sense amplifier encompasses its CM input voltage, which is $V_{C M}=0.8 \\mathrm{~V}$. The upper limit of the CM input voltage occurs when $M_{25}$ enters the triode region, when $\\left|V_{D S 25}\\right|=\\left|V_{o v 25}\\right|$; hence, we require:\n\n$$\nV_{I C}<V_{D D}-\\left|V_{o v 25}\\right|-\\left|V_{G S 21}\\right| =V_{D D}-\\left|V_{o v 25}\\right|-\\left|V_{t p}\\right|-\\left|V_{o v 21}\\right| =2.5-0.2-0.7-0.2=1.4 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nThe lower limit of the CM input voltage occurs when $M_{21}$ (or $M_{22}$) enters the triode region (when $V_{G D 21}=V_{t 21}$); therefore,\n\n$$\nV_{I C}>-V_{S S}+V_{G S 23}-\\left|V_{t 21}\\right| =-V_{S S}+\\left(V_{t n}+V_{o v 23}\\right)-\\left|V_{t p}\\right| =-2.5+(0.7+0.2)-0.7=-2.3 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nThe applied CM input voltage of 0.8 V lies between these limits; thus, all transistors function in the active region as assumed.\n\nIn this CMFB method, the inputs to the CM-sense amplifier are ideally constant, simplifying its design. One drawback of this CM-sense circuit is that the $R_{c s}$ resistors and the input capacitance of the CM-sense amplifier introduce a pole in the transfer function of the CM-sense circuit and, consequently, in the CMFB loop. A capacitor $C_{c s}$ can be connected in parallel with each sense resistor to introduce a left-half-plane zero in the CM-sense circuit to mitigate the pole's effect at high frequencies. (See Problem 12.18.)\n\nAnother disadvantage of this CM-sense circuit is that the sense resistor $R_{c s}$ loads the op-amp output in the DM half-circuit, since the node between the resistors is a DM ac ground. This loading diminishes the open-loop differential voltage gain unless $R_{c s}$ is much larger than the output resistance of the DM half-circuit.\n\nTo prevent this resistive output loading, voltage buffers can be added between the op-amp outputs and the $R_{c s}$ resistors. Source followers serve as buffers in Fig. 12.17. One potential issue is that each source follower introduces a dc offset of $V_{G S}$ between its input and output. To prevent a shift in the CM operating point caused by these offsets, the voltage $V_{C M}$ can be buffered by an identical source follower so that the op-amp output voltages and $V_{C M}$ experience equal offsets. However, these offsets restrict the op-amp output swing since each source-follower transistor that connects to an op-amp output must remain in the active region throughout the entire output voltage swing.\n\nThe CMFB scheme in Fig. 12.16 can be altered to remove the $M_{23}-M_{5}$ current mirror from the CMFB loop, as shown in Fig. 12.18. This revised CM-sense amplifier directly injects currents to regulate the op-amp CM output. In this configuration, $M_{21}$ in Fig. 12.16b is divided into two matched transistors, $M_{21 A}$ and $M_{21 B}$, with each transistor's drain connected to an op-amp output. The current injected by $M_{21 A}$ and $M_{21 B}$ into either output is:\n\n$$\nI_{c m s}=\\frac{I_{26}}{4}-\\frac{g_{m 21 A}}{2}\\left(V_{o c}-V_{C M}\\right)\n$$\n\nTransistors $M_{3}-M_{5}$ act as current sources. The CMFB loop will adjust $I_{c m s}$ such that:\n\n$$\n\\left|I_{D 3}\\right|+\\left|I_{D 4}\\right|+2 I_{c m s}=I_{D 5}\n$$\n\nIf $V_{o c}=V_{C M}$, $M_{21 A}$, $M_{21 B}$, and $M_{22}$ result in $2 I_{c m s}=I_{26} / 2$. Hence, $I_{26}$ should be selected so that:\n\n$$\n\\left|I_{D 3}\\right|+\\left|I_{D 4}\\right|+\\frac{I_{26}}{2}=I_{D 5}\n$$\n\nwhen all devices are active.\n\nAn advantage of this approach is that it bypasses the pole associated with the $M_{5}-M_{23}$ current mirror in Figs. 12.2 and 12.16. However, $M_{21 A}$ and $M_{21 B}$ introduce resistive and capacitive loading at the op-amp outputs. If an op amp employs cascoded devices, $M_{21 A}$ and $M_{21 B}$ can connect to low-impedance cascode nodes to mitigate the impact of this loading."

This amplifier comprises a source-coupled pair $M_{21}-M_{22}$, diode-connected loads $M_{23}$ and $M_{24}$, and a tail-current source $M_{25}$. The amplifier's output, which drives the CMC input of the op amp, is expressed as:\n\n$$\nV_{c m s}=a_{c m s}\\left(V_{o c}-V_{C M}\\right)+V_{C S B I A S} \\tag{12.49}\n$$\n\nWhen $V_{o c}$ equals $V_{C M}$, the output of the amplifier becomes $V_{C S B I A S}$. In the circuit of Figure 12.16b, $V_{C S B I A S}$ equals $V_{G S 23}-V_{S S}$ when the current $I_{D 23}$ is half of $I_{D 25}$. The value of $V_{G S 23}$ (or equivalently, $I_{D 23}$ and $(W / L)_{23}$) is selected such that $I_{D 5}$ matches the designed value of $\\left|I_{D 3}\\right|+\\left|I_{D 4}\\right|$ in Figure 12.2 when $V_{o c}$ equals $V_{C M}$.\n\nFigure 12.16a illustrates a CMFB system that uses a resistive divider to detect $V_{o c}$ and a CM-sense amplifier to adjust $V_{C M}$. Two resistors, Rcs, form a voltage divider between Vo1 and Vo2, generating $V_{o c}$. The CM Sense Amp receives $V_{c m s}$ as input and outputs $V_{C M}$ to regulate the common-mode voltage.\n\nFigure 12.16b presents a schematic of the CM-sense amplifier, which is compatible with the op amp in Figure 12.2. It utilizes PMOS and NMOS transistors to control the common-mode voltage, with PMOS transistors connected to VDD and NMOS transistors connected to VSS. The system adjusts the output $V_{C M}$ to maintain a stable common-mode voltage.\n\nIn equation (12.49), $a_{c m s}$ represents the small-signal voltage gain of the CM-sense amplifier:\n\n$$\na_{c m s}=\\left.\\frac{v_{c m s}}{v_{o c}}\\right|_{\\text {CMFB loop open }}=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{g_{m 21}}{g_{m 23}} \\tag{12.50}\n$$\n\nHere, it is assumed that the CM gain of the CM-sense amplifier is significantly smaller than its differential-mode (DM) gain. The factor of $1 / 2$ in equation (12.50) arises because the output is taken from only one side of the differential amplifier.\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nTo maximize the output swing of the differential op amp in Figure 12.2, determine the optimal value of $V_{C M}$. Utilize the CMFB scheme in Figure 12.16a and design the CM-sense amplifier in Figure 12.16b. Assume that the CM-sense resistors $R_{c s}$ are very large and can be ignored when calculating small-signal voltage gains for the op amp. Use the data and assumptions from the previous example with $V_{D D}=V_{S S}=2.5 \\mathrm{~V}$. Assume $V_{i c}=0$. Ignore the body effect.\n\nFor the op amp in Figure 12.2, if the magnitude of its DM gain is large and if the op amp operates in a DM negative feedback loop (e.g., as shown in Figure 12.1a), $V_{i d} \\approx 0$. Hence, both op-amp inputs will be close to ground since $V_{i c}=0$; that is, $V_{i 1}=V_{i c}+$ $V_{i d} / 2 \\approx 0$ and $V_{i 2}=V_{i c}-V_{i d} / 2 \\approx 0$. The output $V_{o 1}$ reaches its lower limit when $M_{1}$ enters the triode region, which occurs when $V_{g d 1}=V_{t 1}$; therefore,\n\n$$\nV_{o 1(\\min )}=-V_{t 1}+V_{i 1} \\approx-V_{t 1}=-0.7 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\n(The body effect would increase $V_{t 1}$ and decrease $V_{o 1(\\min )}$.) The upper output swing limit occurs when $M_{3}$ enters the triode region, and\n\n$$\nV_{o 1(\\max )}=V_{D D}-\\left|V_{o v 3}\\right|=2.5-0.2=2.3 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nTo maximize the output swing, the dc CM output voltage $V_{O C}$ should be halfway between the swing limits:\n\n$$\nV_{O C}=\\frac{V_{o 1(\\max )}+V_{O 1(\\min )}}{2}=\\frac{2.3+(-0.7)}{2}=0.8 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nThus, $V_{C M}$ is set to 0.8 V. The resulting peak differential output voltage is\n\n$$\nV_{o d(\\text { peak })}=V_{o 1(\\max )}-V_{o 2(\\min )}=V_{o 1(\\max )}-V_{o 1(\\min )}=2.3-(-0.7)=3.0 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nTo design the CM-sense amplifier in Figure 12.16b, a value for its low-frequency gain must be chosen. In the CMFB loop, the loop gain is $\\left(-a_{c m c}\\right) a_{c m s}$. From the previous example, $a_{c m c}=-196$. If $a_{c m s}=1$ is designed, the CMFB loop gain is 196, and equation (12.39) yields $A_{C M F B}=0.995$. Therefore, $V_{o c}$ closely follows changes in $V_{C M}$. With this gain in the CM-sense amplifier in Figure 12.16b, equation (12.50) gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\na_{c m s}=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{g_{m 21}}{g_{m 23}}=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\sqrt{2 k_{p}^{\\prime}(W / L)_{21}\\left|I_{D 21}\\right|}}{\\sqrt{2 k_{n}^{\\prime}(W / L)_{23} I_{D 23}}}=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\sqrt{k_{p}^{\\prime}(W / L)_{21}}}{\\sqrt{k_{n}^{\\prime}(W / L)_{23}}}=1 \\tag{12.51}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe dc output voltage of the CM-sense amplifier when $V_{o c}=V_{C M}$ should equal the dc voltage required at the CMC op-amp input, which is\n\n$$\n-V_{S S}+V_{G S 5}=-V_{S S}+V_{t 5}+V_{o v 5}\n$$\n\nThis dc voltage is produced by the CM-sense amplifier if $M_{5}$ and $M_{23}$ have equal overdrive voltages. Assuming that $r_{o} \\rightarrow \\infty$, matching $V_{o v 5}$ and $V_{o v 23}$ requires that $M_{5}$ and $M_{23}$ have equal drain-current-to- $W / L$ ratios:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{I_{D 5}}{(W / L)_{5}}=\\frac{I_{D 23}}{(W / L)_{23}} \\tag{12.52}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn equations (12.51) and (12.52), there are three unknowns: $I_{D 23},(W / L)_{23}$, and $(W / L)_{21}$. Hence, multiple possible solutions exist. [Note that $(W / L)_{5}$ can be determined from $V_{o v 5}=0.2 \\mathrm{~V}$ (by assumption) and $I_{D 5}=200 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$.]\n\nA simple solution is $I_{D 23}=I_{D 5}$ and $(W / L)_{23}=(W / L)_{5}$. Then $(W / L)_{21}$ can be determined from equation (12.51). While this solution is straightforward, it necessitates as much dc current in the CM-sense amplifier as in the op amp. Equations (12.51) and (12.52) can be solved with $I_{D 23}<I_{D 5}$, which reduces the power dissipation in the CM-sense amplifier. However, the magnitude of the pole associated with the $M_{5}-M_{23}$ current mirror decreases as $I_{D 23}$ decreases. To illustrate this point, we will ignore all capacitors except the gate-source capacitors for $M_{5}$ and $M_{23}$ and assume $L_{23}$ is fixed. Then the magnitude of the nondominant pole associated with the current mirror is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left|p_{n d}\\right|=\\frac{g_{m 23}}{C_{g s 5}+C_{g s 23}}=\\frac{\\frac{2 I_{D 23}}{V_{o v 23}}}{C_{g s 5}+(2 / 3) C_{o x} W_{23} L_{23}} \\tag{12.53}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nsince the small-signal resistance of diode-connected $M_{23}$ is $1 / g_{m 23}$ (assuming that $r_{o 23} \\gg$ $1 / g_{m 23}$ ). If $I_{D 23}$ is scaled by a factor $x(x<1)$ and if $M_{5}$ is unchanged, $W_{23}$ must also scale by the factor $x$ to satisfy equation (12.52). With this scaling, the pole magnitude in equation (12.53) decreases because the numerator scales by the factor $x$, but the denominator scales by a factor greater than $x$ due to the constant $C_{g 5}$ term in the denominator. This pole appears in the CMFB loop gain. Consequently, the phase margin of the CMFB loop decreases as this pole magnitude decreases due to a decrease in $I_{D 23}$.\n\nFinally, it is essential to verify that the CM input range of the CM-sense amplifier includes its CM input voltage, which is $V_{C M}=0.8 \\mathrm{~V}$. The upper limit of the CM input voltage occurs when $M_{25}$ enters the triode region, when $\\left|V_{D S 25}\\right|=\\left|V_{o v 25}\\right|$; therefore, we want\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nV_{I C}<V_{D D}-\\left|V_{o v 25}\\right|-\\left|V_{G S 21}\\right| & =V_{D D}-\\left|V_{o v 25}\\right|-\\left|V_{t p}\\right|-\\left|V_{o v 21}\\right| \\\\\n& =2.5-0.2-0.7-0.2=1.4 \\mathrm{~V}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe lower limit of the CM input voltage occurs when $M_{21}$ (or $M_{22}$ ) enters the triode region (when $V_{G D 21}=V_{t 21}$ ); hence,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nV_{I C}>-V_{S S}+V_{G S 23}-\\left|V_{t 21}\\right| & =-V_{S S}+\\left(V_{t n}+V_{o v 23}\\right)-\\left|V_{t p}\\right| \\\\\n& =-2.5+(0.7+0.2)-0.7=-2.3 \\mathrm{~V}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe applied CM input voltage of 0.8 V falls between these limits; therefore, all transistors operate in the active region as assumed.\n\nIn this CMFB approach, the inputs to the CM-sense amplifier are ideally constant, simplifying its design. One drawback of this CM-sense circuit is that the $R_{c s}$ resistors and the input capacitance of the CM-sense amplifier introduce a pole in the transfer function of the CM-sense circuit and, consequently, in the CMFB loop. A capacitor $C_{c s}$ can be connected in parallel with each sense resistor to introduce a left-half-plane zero in the CM-sense circuit to mitigate the effect of the pole at high frequencies. (See Problem 12.18.)\n\nAnother disadvantage of this CM-sense circuit is that the sense resistor $R_{c s}$ loads the op-amp output in the DM half-circuit, since the node between the resistors is a DM ac ground. This loading reduces the open-loop differential voltage gain unless $R_{c s}$ is much larger than the output resistance of the DM half-circuit.\n\nTo prevent this resistive output loading, voltage buffers can be added between the op-amp outputs and the $R_{c s}$ resistors. Source followers are used as buffers in Figure 12.17. One potential issue is that each source follower introduces a dc offset of $V_{G S}$ between its input and output. To prevent a shift in the CM operating point caused by these offsets, the voltage $V_{C M}$ can be buffered by an identical source follower so that the op-amp output voltages and $V_{C M}$ experience equal offsets. However, these offsets limit the op-amp output swing since each source-follower transistor that connects to an op-amp output must remain in the active region over the entire output voltage swing.\n\nThe CMFB scheme in Figure 12.16 can be modified to eliminate the $M_{23}-M_{5}$ current mirror from the CMFB loop, as shown in Figure 12.18. This modified CM-sense amplifier directly injects currents to control the op-amp CM output. ${ }^{5}$ Here, $M_{21}$ in Figure 12.16b is split into two matched transistors, $M_{21 A}$ and $M_{21 B}$, and the drain of each transistor connects to an op-amp output.

If an op amp uses cascoded devices, $M_{21 A}$ and $M_{21 B}$ can connect to low-impedance cascode nodes to reduce the impact of this loading."

The maximum output swing is achieved when $M_{3}$ enters the triode region, leading to:\n\n$$\nV_{o 1(\\max )}=V_{D D}-\\left|V_{o v 3}\\right|=2.5-0.2=2.3 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nTo maximize the output swing, the DC CM output voltage $V_{O C}$ should be set at the midpoint between the swing limits:\n\n$$\nV_{O C}=\\frac{V_{o 1(\\max )}+V_{O 1(\\min )}}{2}=\\frac{2.3+(-0.7)}{2}=0.8 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nThus, we select $V_{C M}=0.8 \\mathrm{~V}$. The resulting peak differential output voltage is:\n\n$$\nV_{o d(\\text { peak })}=V_{o 1(\\max )}-V_{o 2(\\min )}=V_{o 1(\\max )}-V_{o 1(\\min )}=2.3-(-0.7)=3.0 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nDesigning the CM-sense amplifier in Fig. 12.16b requires determining its low-frequency gain. In the CMFB loop, the loop gain is $\\left(-a_{c m c}\\right) a_{c m s}$. From the previous example, $a_{c m c}=-196$. If we set $a_{c m s}=1$, the CMFB loop gain becomes 196, and equation (12.39) yields $A_{C M F B}=0.995$. Therefore, $V_{o c}$ closely follows changes in $V_{C M}$. With this gain selection for the CM-sense amplifier in Fig. 12.16b, equation (12.50) gives:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\na_{c m s}=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{g_{m 21}}{g_{m 23}}=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\sqrt{2 k_{p}^{\\prime}(W / L)_{21}\\left|I_{D 21}\\right|}}{\\sqrt{2 k_{n}^{\\prime}(W / L)_{23} I_{D 23}}}=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\sqrt{k_{p}^{\\prime}(W / L)_{21}}}{\\sqrt{k_{n}^{\\prime}(W / L)_{23}}}=1 \\tag{12.51}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe DC output voltage of the CM-sense amplifier when $V_{o c}=V_{C M}$ should match the DC voltage required at the CMC op-amp input, which is:\n\n$$\n-V_{S S}+V_{G S 5}=-V_{S S}+V_{t 5}+V_{o v 5}\n$$\n\nThis DC voltage is generated by the CM-sense amplifier if $M_{5}$ and $M_{23}$ exhibit equal overdrive voltages. Assuming that $r_{o} \\rightarrow \\infty$, matching $V_{o v 5}$ and $V_{o v 23}$ necessitates that $M_{5}$ and $M_{23}$ have equivalent drain-current-to-$W / L$ ratios:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{I_{D 5}}{(W / L)_{5}}=\\frac{I_{D 23}}{(W / L)_{23}} \\tag{12.52}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn equations (12.51) and (12.52), there are three unknowns: $I_{D 23},(W / L)_{23}$, and $(W / L)_{21}$. Consequently, multiple potential solutions exist. [Note that $(W / L)_{5}$ can be derived from $V_{o v 5}=0.2 \\mathrm{~V}$ (by assumption) and $I_{D 5}=200 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$.]\n\nA straightforward solution is $I_{D 23}=I_{D 5}$ and $(W / L)_{23}=(W / L)_{5}$. Then $(W / L)_{21}$ can be ascertained from equation (12.51). Although this solution is simple, it necessitates that the CM-sense amplifier consumes as much DC current as the op amp. Equations 12.51 and 12.52 can be resolved with $I_{D 23}<I_{D 5}$, which diminishes the power dissipation in the CM-sense amplifier. However, the magnitude of the pole related to the $M_{5}-M_{23}$ current mirror diminishes as $I_{D 23}$ decreases. To elucidate this point, we will disregard all capacitors except the gate-source capacitors for $M_{5}$ and $M_{23}$ and assume $L_{23}$ is constant. The magnitude of the nondominant pole linked to the current mirror is then:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left|p_{n d}\\right|=\\frac{g_{m 23}}{C_{g s 5}+C_{g s 23}}=\\frac{\\frac{2 I_{D 23}}{V_{o v 23}}}{C_{g s 5}+(2 / 3) C_{o x} W_{23} L_{23}} \\tag{12.53}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nsince the small-signal resistance of diode-connected $M_{23}$ is $1 / g_{m 23}$ (assuming that $r_{o 23} \\gg$ $1 / g_{m 23}$ ). If $I_{D 23}$ is scaled by a factor $x(x<1)$ and $M_{5}$ remains unchanged, $W_{23}$ must also scale by the factor $x$ to satisfy equation (12.52). With this scaling, the pole magnitude in equation (12.53) decreases because the numerator scales by the factor $x$, but the denominator scales by a factor greater than $x$ due to the constant $C_{g 5}$ term in the denominator. This pole emerges in the CMFB loop gain. Therefore, the phase margin of the CMFB loop diminishes as this pole magnitude decreases due to a reduction in $I_{D 23}$.\n\nUltimately, we must confirm that the CM input range of the CM-sense amplifier encompasses its CM input voltage, which is $V_{C M}=0.8 \\mathrm{~V}$. The upper limit of the CM input voltage is reached when $M_{25}$ enters the triode region, at which point $\\left|V_{D S 25}\\right|=\\left|V_{o v 25}\\right|$; hence, we aim for:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nV_{I C}<V_{D D}-\\left|V_{o v 25}\\right|-\\left|V_{G S 21}\\right| & =V_{D D}-\\left|V_{o v 25}\\right|-\\left|V_{t p}\\right|-\\left|V_{o v 21}\\right| \\\\\n& =2.5-0.2-0.7-0.2=1.4 \\mathrm{~V}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe lower limit of the CM input voltage is reached when $M_{21}$ (or $M_{22}$ ) enters the triode region (at $V_{G D 21}=V_{t 21}$ ); thus:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nV_{I C}>-V_{S S}+V_{G S 23}-\\left|V_{t 21}\\right| & =-V_{S S}+\\left(V_{t n}+V_{o v 23}\\right)-\\left|V_{t p}\\right| \\\\\n& =-2.5+(0.7+0.2)-0.7=-2.3 \\mathrm{~V}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe applied CM input voltage of 0.8 V lies between these limits; hence, all transistors function within the active region as presumed.\n\nIn this CMFB method, the inputs to the CM-sense amplifier ideally remain constant, simplifying its design. One drawback of this CM-sense circuit is that the $R_{c s}$ resistors and the input capacitance of the CM-sense amplifier introduce a pole in the transfer function of the CM-sense circuit and, consequently, in the CMFB loop. A capacitor $C_{c s}$ can be connected in parallel with each sense resistor to introduce a left-half-plane zero in the CM-sense circuit to mitigate the pole's influence at high frequencies. (Refer to Problem 12.18.)\n\nAnother disadvantage of this CM-sense circuit is that the sense resistor $R_{c s}$ loads the op-amp output in the DM half-circuit, as the node between the resistors serves as a DM AC ground. This loading diminishes the open-loop differential voltage gain unless $R_{c s}$ is substantially larger than the output resistance of the DM half-circuit.\n\nTo obviate this resistive output loading, voltage buffers can be inserted between the op-amp outputs and the $R_{c s}$ resistors. Source followers are employed as buffers in Fig. 12.17. One potential issue is that each source follower introduces a DC offset of $V_{G S}$ between its input and output. To prevent a shift in the CM operating point caused by these offsets, the voltage $V_{C M}$ can be buffered by an identical source follower, ensuring that the op-amp output voltages and $V_{C M}$ experience equivalent offsets. However, these offsets constrain the op-amp output swing since each source-follower transistor that connects to an op-amp output must stay within the active region across the entire output voltage swing.\n\nThe CMFB scheme in Fig. 12.16 can be adapted to remove the $M_{23}-M_{5}$ current mirror from the CMFB loop, as depicted in Fig. 12.18. This revised CM-sense amplifier directly injects currents to govern the op-amp CM output. ${ }^{5}$ Here, $M_{21}$ in Fig. $12.16 b$ is divided into two matched transistors, $M_{21 A}$ and $M_{21 B}$, with each transistor's drain connecting to an op-amp output. The current injected by $M_{21 A}$ and $M_{21 B}$ into either output is:\n\n$$\nI_{c m s}=\\frac{I_{26}}{4}-\\frac{g_{m 21 A}}{2}\\left(V_{o c}-V_{C M}\\right)\n$$\n\nTransistors $M_{3}-M_{5}$ act as current sources. The CMFB loop will adjust $I_{c m s}$ such that:\n\n$$\n\\left|I_{D 3}\\right|+\\left|I_{D 4}\\right|+2 I_{c m s}=I_{D 5}\n$$\n\nIf $V_{o c}=V_{C M}$, then $M_{21 A}$, $M_{21 B}$, and $M_{22}$ result in $2 I_{c m s}=I_{26} / 2$. Hence, $I_{26}$ should be chosen such that:\n\n$$\n\\left|I_{D 3}\\right|+\\left|I_{D 4}\\right|+\\frac{I_{26}}{2}=I_{D 5}\n$$\n\nwhen all devices are active. One advantage of this approach is that it eliminates the pole associated with the $M_{5}-M_{23}$ current mirror in Figs. 12.2 and 12.16. However, $M_{21 A}$ and $M_{21 B}$ introduce resistive and capacitive loading at the op-amp outputs. If an op amp employs cascoded devices, $M_{21 A}$ and $M_{21 B}$ can connect to low-impedance cascode nodes to diminish the impact of this loading."

    "text": "A simple method for detecting the CM output voltage involves using two resistors of equal value, as depicted in Fig. 12.16a. The voltage across these resistors is calculated as:\n\n$$\nV_{o c}=\\frac{V_{o 1}+V_{o 2}}{2}\n$$\n\nThis voltage is then subtracted from the desired CM output voltage, $V_{C M}$, and the difference is amplified by the CM-sense amplifier in Fig. 12.16b. This amplifier comprises a source-coupled pair $M_{21}-M_{22}$, diode-connected loads $M_{23}$ and $M_{24}$, and a tail-current source $M_{25}$. The amplifier's output, which drives the CMC input of the op amp, is given by:\n\n$$\nV_{c m s}=a_{c m s}\\left(V_{o c}-V_{C M}\\right)+V_{C S B I A S}\n$$\n\nWhen $V_{o c}=V_{C M}$, $V_{c m s}$ equals $V_{C S B I A S}$. For the circuit in Fig. 12.16b, $V_{C S B I A S}$ is equal to $V_{G S 23}-V_{S S}$ when $I_{D 23}=I_{D 25} / 2$. The value of $V_{G S 23}$ [or, equivalently, $I_{D 23}$ and $(W / L)_{23}$ ] is selected such that $I_{D 5}$ matches the designed value of $\\left|I_{D 3}\\right|+\\left|I_{D 4}\\right|$ in Fig. 12.2 when $V_{o c}=V_{C M}$.\n\nThe CMFB system uses a resistive divider to detect the common-mode voltage $V_{o c}$ and a CM-sense amplifier to adjust $V_{C M}$. Two resistors $R_{c s}$ form a voltage divider between $V_{o 1}$ and $V_{o 2}$, generating $V_{o c}$. The CM Sense Amp takes $V_{c m s}$ as input and outputs $V_{C M}$ to control the common-mode voltage.\n\nThe CMFB system with a CM-sense amplifier employs PMOS and NMOS transistors to regulate the common-mode voltage. The PMOS transistors are connected to $V_{D D}$, and the NMOS transistors are connected to $V_{S S}$. The system adjusts the output $V_{C M}$ to maintain a stable common-mode voltage.\n\nIn equation (12.49), $a_{c m s}$ represents the small-signal voltage gain of the CM-sense amplifier:\n\n$$\na_{c m s}=\\left.\\frac{v_{c m s}}{v_{o c}}\\right|_{\\text {CMFB loop open }}=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{g_{m 21}}{g_{m 23}}\n$$\n\nHere, it is assumed that the CM gain of the CM-sense amplifier is much smaller than its DM gain. The factor of $1 / 2$ multiplies $g_{m 21} / g_{m 23}$ in equation (12.50) because the output is taken from only one side of the differential amplifier.\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nTo maximize the output swing for the differential op amp in Fig. 12.2, determine the value of $V_{C M}$. Use the CMFB scheme in Fig. 12.16a and design the CM-sense amplifier in Fig. 12.16b. Assume that the CM-sense resistors $R_{c s}$ are very large and can be neglected when computing small-signal voltage gains for the op amp. Use the data and assumptions in the previous example with $V_{D D}=V_{S S}=2.5 \\mathrm{~V}$. Assume $V_{i c}=0$. Ignore the body effect.\n\nFor the op amp in Fig. 12.2, if the magnitude of its DM gain is large and if the op amp operates in a DM negative feedback loop, $V_{i d} \\approx 0$. Therefore, both op-amp inputs will be close to ground since $V_{i c}=0$; that is, $V_{i 1}=V_{i c}+$ $V_{i d} / 2 \\approx 0$ and $V_{i 2}=V_{i c}-V_{i d} / 2 \\approx 0$. The output $V_{o 1}$ reaches its lower limit when $M_{1}$ enters the triode region, which occurs when $V_{g d 1}=V_{t 1}$; therefore,\n\n$$\nV_{o 1(\\min )}=-V_{t 1}+V_{i 1} \\approx-V_{t 1}=-0.7 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nThe upper output swing limit occurs when $M_{3}$ enters the triode region, and\n\n$$\nV_{o 1(\\max )}=V_{D D}-\\left|V_{o v 3}\\right|=2.5-0.2=2.3 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nTo maximize the output swing, the dc CM output voltage $V_{O C}$ should be halfway between the swing limits:\n\n$$\nV_{O C}=\\frac{V_{o 1(\\max )}+V_{O 1(\\min )}}{2}=\\frac{2.3+(-0.7)}{2}=0.8 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nTherefore, we choose $V_{C M}=0.8 \\mathrm{~V}$. The resulting peak differential output voltage is\n\n$$\nV_{o d(\\text { peak })}=V_{o 1(\\max )}-V_{o 2(\\min )}=V_{o 1(\\max )}-V_{o 1(\\min )}=2.3-(-0.7)=3.0 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nTo design the CM-sense amplifier in Fig. 12.16b, we must choose a value for its lowfrequency gain. In the CMFB loop, the loop gain is $\\left(-a_{c m c}\\right) a_{c m s}$. From the previous example, $a_{c m c}=-196$. If we design for $a_{c m s}=1$, the CMFB loop gain is 196, and equation (12.39) gives $A_{C M F B}=0.995$. Therefore, $V_{o c}$ closely tracks changes in $V_{C M}$. With this choice of gain in the CM-sense amplifier in Fig. 12.16b, equation (12.50) gives\n\n$$\na_{c m s}=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{g_{m 21}}{g_{m 23}}=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\sqrt{2 k_{p}^{\\prime}(W / L)_{21}\\left|I_{D 21}\\right|}}{\\sqrt{2 k_{n}^{\\prime}(W / L)_{23} I_{D 23}}}=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\sqrt{k_{p}^{\\prime}(W / L)_{21}}}{\\sqrt{k_{n}^{\\prime}(W / L)_{23}}}=1\n$$\n\nThe dc output voltage of the CM-sense amplifier when $V_{o c}=V_{C M}$ should equal the dc voltage needed at the CMC op-amp input, which is\n\n$$\n-V_{S S}+V_{G S 5}=-V_{S S}+V_{t 5}+V_{o v 5}\n$$\n\nThis dc voltage is produced by the CM-sense amplifier if $M_{5}$ and $M_{23}$ have equal overdrive voltages. Assuming that $r_{o} \\rightarrow \\infty$, matching $V_{o v 5}$ and $V_{o v 23}$ requires that $M_{5}$ and $M_{23}$ have\nequal drain-current-to- $W / L$ ratios:\n\n$$\n\\frac{I_{D 5}}{(W / L)_{5}}=\\frac{I_{D 23}}{(W / L)_{23}}\n$$\n\nIn equations (12.51) and (12.52), there are three unknowns: $I_{D 23},(W / L)_{23}$, and $(W / L)_{21}$. Therefore, many possible solutions exist. [Note that $(W / L)_{5}$ can be determined from $V_{o v 5}=0.2 \\mathrm{~V}$ (by assumption) and $I_{D 5}=200 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$.]\n\nOne simple solution is $I_{D 23}=I_{D 5}$ and $(W / L)_{23}=(W / L)_{5}$. Then $(W / L)_{21}$ can be determined from equation (12.51). While this solution is simple, it requires as much dc current in the CM -sense amplifier as in the op amp. Equations (12.51) and (12.52) can be solved with $I_{D 23}<I_{D 5}$, which reduces the power dissipation in the CM-sense amplifier. However, the magnitude of the pole associated with the $M_{5}-M_{23}$ current mirror decreases as $I_{D 23}$ decreases. To illustrate this point, we will ignore all capacitors except the gate-source capacitors for $M_{5}$ and $M_{23}$ and assume $L_{23}$ is fixed. Then the magnitude of the nondominant pole associated with the current mirror is\n\n$$\n\\left|p_{n d}\\right|=\\frac{g_{m 23}}{C_{g s 5}+C_{g s 23}}=\\frac{\\frac{2 I_{D 23}}{V_{o v 23}}}{C_{g s 5}+(2 / 3) C_{o x} W_{23} L_{23}}\n$$\n\nsince the small-signal resistance of diode-connected $M_{23}$ is $1 / g_{m 23}$ (assuming that $r_{o 23} \\gg$ $1 / g_{m 23}$ ). If $I_{D 23}$ is scaled by a factor $x(x<1)$ and if $M_{5}$ is unchanged, $W_{23}$ must also scale by the factor $x$ to satisfy equation (12.52). With this scaling, the pole magnitude in equation (12.53) decreases because the numerator scales by the factor $x$, but the denominator scales by a factor greater than $x$ due to the constant $C_{g 5}$ term in the denominator. This pole appears in the CMFB loop gain. Therefore, the phase margin of the CMFB loop decreases as this pole magnitude decreases due to a decrease in $I_{D 23}$.\n\nFinally, we must verify that the CM input range of the CM-sense amplifier includes its CM input voltage, which is $V_{C M}=0.8 \\mathrm{~V}$. The upper limit of the CM input voltage occurs when $M_{25}$ enters the triode region, when $\\left|V_{D S 25}\\right|=\\left|V_{o v 25}\\right|$; therefore, we want\n\n$$\nV_{I C}<V_{D D}-\\left|V_{o v 25}\\right|-\\left|V_{G S 21}\\right|\n$$\n\nThe lower limit of the CM input voltage occurs when $M_{21}$ (or $M_{22}$ ) enters the triode region (when $V_{G D 21}=V_{t 21}$ ); hence,\n\n$$\nV_{I C}>-V_{S S}+V_{G S 23}-\\left|V_{t 21}\\right|\n$$\n\nThe applied CM input voltage of 0.8 V falls between these limits; therefore, all transistors operate in the active region as assumed.\n\nIn this CMFB approach, the inputs to the CM-sense amplifier are ideally constant, which simplifies its design. One disadvantage of this CM -sense circuit is that the $R_{c s}$ resistors and the input capacitance of the CM-sense amplifier introduce a pole in the transfer function of the CM-sense circuit and therefore in the CMFB loop. A capacitor $C_{c s}$ can be connected in parallel with each sense resistor to introduce a left-half-plane zero in the CM-sense circuit to reduce the effect of the pole at high frequencies.\n\nAnother disadvantage of this CM-sense circuit is that the sense resistor $R_{c s}$ loads the op-amp output in the DM half-circuit, since the node between the resistors is a DM ac ground. This loading reduces the open-loop differential voltage gain unless $R_{c s}$ is much larger than the output resistance of the DM half-circuit.\n\nTo avoid this resistive output loading, voltage buffers can be added between the op-amp outputs and the $R_{c s}$ resistors. Source followers are used as buffers in Fig. 12.17. One potential problem is that each source follower introduces a dc offset of $V_{G S}$ between its input and output. To avoid a shift in the CM operating point caused by these offsets, voltage $V_{C M}$ can be buffered by an identical source follower so that the op-amp output voltages and $V_{C M}$ experience equal offsets. However, these offsets limit the op-amp output swing since each source-follower transistor that connects to an op-amp output must remain in the active region over the entire output voltage swing.\n\nThe CMFB scheme in Fig. 12.16 can be modified to eliminate the $M_{23}-M_{5}$ current mirror from the CMFB loop, as shown in Fig. 12.18. This modified CM-sense amplifier directly injects currents to control the op-amp CM output. Here, $M_{21}$ in Fig. $12.16 b$ is split into two matched transistors, $M_{21 A}$ and $M_{21 B}$, and the drain of each transistor connects to an op-amp output. The current injected by $M_{21 A}$ and $M_{21 B}$ into either output is\n\n$$\nI_{c m s}=\\frac{I_{26}}{4}-\\frac{g_{m 21 A}}{2}\\left(V_{o c}-V_{C M}\\right)\n$$\n\nTransistors $M_{3}-M_{5}$ act as current sources. The CMFB loop will adjust $I_{c m s}$ so that\n\n$$\n\\left|I_{D 3}\\right|+\\left|I_{D 4}\\right|+2 I_{c m s}=I_{D 5}\n$$\n\nIf $V_{o c}=V_{C M}, M_{21 A}, M_{21 B}$, and $M_{22}$ give $2 I_{c m s}=I_{26} / 2$. Therefore, $I_{26}$ should be chosen so that\n\n$$\n\\left|I_{D 3}\\right|+\\left|I_{D 4}\\right|+\\frac{I_{26}}{2}=I_{D 5}\n$$\n\nwhen all devices are active.\n\nAn advantage of this approach is that it avoids the pole associated with the $M_{5}-M_{23}$ current mirror in Figs. 12.2 and 12.16. However, $M_{21 A}$ and $M_{21 B}$ add resistive and capacitive loading at the op-amp outputs. If an op amp uses cascoded devices, $M_{21 A}$ and $M_{21 B}$ can connect to low-impedance cascode nodes to reduce the impact of this loading."

    "text": "A CMFB configuration utilizing solely transistors is illustrated in a simplified manner in Fig. 12.19. Here, $M_{21}-M_{24}$ are matched. The source-coupled pairs $M_{21}-M_{22}$ and $M_{23}-M_{24}$ collectively detect the CM output voltage and produce an output proportional to the difference between $V_{o c}$ and $V_{C M}$. To demonstrate this, initially assume that the differential inputs to these source-coupled pairs, which are $V_{o 1}-V_{C M}$ and $V_{o 2}-V_{C M}$, are sufficiently small to permit small-signal analysis.

This final expression indicates that the current through $M_{25}$ comprises a dc term $I_{20}$ plus a term proportional to $V_{o c}-V_{C M}$. The current $I_{d 25}$ is mirrored by $M_{5}$ in Fig. 12.2 to generate the tail current in the op amp, which regulates the CM output voltage.\n\nThe dc output of the CM-sense circuit should supply the dc voltage needed at the CMC input to achieve $V_{o c}=V_{C M}$.

[See the text associated with (12.53).] This method does not resistively load the op-amp outputs, but the source-coupled pairs $M_{21}-M_{24}$ capacitively load them.\n\nThe preceding analysis of this CM-sense circuit assumed that $M_{21}-M_{24}$ always operate in the active region and that voltages $V_{o 1}-V_{C M}$ and $V_{o 2}-V_{C M}$ could be treated as small-signal inputs. Even if these voltages increase, the CMFB loop continues to function as long as $M_{21}-M_{24}$ remain on. However, the small-signal analysis is invalid if the transistors exit the active region. If the op-amp outputs become large enough to turn off any of $M_{21}-M_{24}$ during part of the output swing, the CMFB loop will not function correctly during that portion. The requirement that $M_{21}-M_{24}$ stay on throughout the entire output swing imposes a limit on the op amp's output swing. The input voltage range for both transistors in a differential pair to remain on is related to their gate overdrive voltage. [See (3.161).] Therefore, to keep $M_{21}-M_{24}$ on for large $V_{o 1}$ and $V_{o 2}$, they need substantial overdrives. Conversely, the method using resistors to detect the CM output voltage does not impose such an output-swing limit since the CM-sense amplifier is driven by $V_{o c}$, which is ideally constant, rather than $V_{o 1}$ and $V_{o 2}$, which include CM and DM components.\n\nEquation 12.56 suggests that this CM-sense circuit is nearly ideal, producing an output current with a constant term plus a term proportional to $V_{o c}-V_{C M}$. This result is based on linear small-signal analysis. However, the inputs to the differential pairs in the CM-sense circuit can include large signals due to the op-amp DM output voltage being large.

To interpret (12.61), first consider the case when $V_{o c}=V_{C M}$. Then (12.61) indicates that the CM-sense output current is constant with $I_{c m s}=I_{20}$. While $I_{c m s}$ is constant, (12.59) and (12.60) show that $I_{d 22}$ and $I_{d 23}$ are not constant if $V_{o d}$ is nonzero and time-varying, and $I_{d 22}$ and $I_{d 23}$ are nonlinear functions of $V_{o d}$ (see the plot in Fig. 3.51). However, the variation in $I_{d 22}$ due to nonzero $V_{o d}$ is equal and opposite to the variation in $I_{d 23}$ due to $V_{o d}$; thus, these variations cancel when summed to form $I_{c m s}$. Next, consider the case when $V_{o c} \\neq V_{C M}$. $V_{o c}$ may not equal $V_{C M}$ due to device mismatch, finite gain in the CMFB loop, or the presence of an ac component in $V_{o c}$. Equation 12.61 shows that $I_{c m s}$ has terms that include $V_{o d}^{2}$, affecting $I_{c m s}$ when $V_{o c} \\neq V_{C M}$. Therefore, even with perfectly matched transistors, this CM sensor does not behave like an ideal CM sensor as described by (12.49). The terms involving $V_{o d}^{2}$ arise from the (square-law) nonlinearity of the $M_{21}-M_{22}$ and $M_{23}-M_{24}$ differential pairs converting $V_{o 1}-V_{C M}$ and $V_{o 2}-V_{C M}$ into currents. The dependence of $I_{c m s}$ on $V_{o d}^{2}$ can cause a shift in the dc CM output voltage. Moreover, if $V_{o d}$ is not constant, this dependence can introduce an ac component in $V_{o c}$."

While $I_{c m s}$ is constant, (12.59) and (12.60) show that $I_{d 22}$ and $I_{d 23}$ are not constant if $V_{o d}$ is nonzero and time-varying, and $I_{d 22}$ and $I_{d 23}$ are nonlinear functions of $V_{o d}$. However, the variation in $I_{d 22}$ due to nonzero $V_{o d}$ is equal and opposite to the variation in $I_{d 23}$, thus canceling out when summed to form $I_{c m s}$. Next, consider $V_{o c} \\neq V_{C M}$. $V_{o c}$ may not equal $V_{C M}$ due to device mismatch, finite gain in the CMFB loop, or an ac component in $V_{o c}$. Equation 12.61 shows that $I_{c m s}$ includes terms with $V_{o d}^{2}$ affecting $I_{c m s}$ when $V_{o c} \\neq V_{C M}$. Thus, even with perfectly matched transistors, this CM sensor does not act like an ideal CM sensor as described by (12.49). The $V_{o d}^{2}$ terms arise from the nonlinearity of the $M_{21}-M_{22}$ and $M_{23}-M_{24}$ differential pairs converting $V_{o 1}-V_{C M}$ and $V_{o 2}-V_{C M}$ into currents. The dependence of $I_{c m s}$ on $V_{o d}^{2}$ can cause a shift in the dc CM output voltage. Additionally, if $V_{o d}$ is not constant, this dependence can introduce an ac component in $V_{o c}$."

The requirement for $M_{21}-M_{24}$ to remain on throughout the entire output swing imposes a limit on the op amp's output swing. The input voltage range for both transistors in a differential pair to stay on is related to their gate overdrive voltage.

A similar analysis for this pair yields:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n-I_{d 23} \\approx & \\frac{I_{20}}{2}+\\frac{k_{p}^{\\prime}}{4}\\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)_{23}\\left(\\frac{V_{o d}}{2}+V_{o c}-V_{C M}\\right) \\sqrt{4 V_{o v 23}^{2}-\\left(V_{o d} / 2\\right)^{2}} \\\\\n& \\times\\left[1-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\left(V_{o c}-V_{C M}\\right) V_{o d}}{4 V_{o v 23}^{2}-\\left(V_{o d} / 2\\right)^{2}}\\right)-\\frac{1}{8}\\left(\\frac{\\left(V_{o c}-V_{C M}\\right) V_{o d}}{4 V_{o v 23}^{2}-\\left(V_{o d} / 2\\right)^{2}}\\right)^{2}+\\cdots\\right] \\tag{12.60}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSubstituting (12.59) and (12.60) in (12.58) with $V_{\\text {ov } 22}=V_{\\text {ov23 }}$ and $(W / L)_{22}=(W / L)_{23}$ results in:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{c m s}=I_{d 25} \\approx & I_{20}+\\frac{k_{p}^{\\prime}}{2}\\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)_{23}\\left(V_{o c}-V_{C M}\\right) \\sqrt{4 V_{o v 23}^{2}-\\left(V_{o d} / 2\\right)^{2}} \\\\\n& \\times\\left[1-\\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{V_{o d}^{2}}{4 V_{o v 23}^{2}-\\left(V_{o d} / 2\\right)^{2}}\\right)-\\frac{1}{8}\\left(\\frac{\\left(V_{o c}-V_{C M}\\right) V_{o d}}{4 V_{o v 23}^{2}-\\left(V_{o d} / 2\\right)^{2}}\\right)^{2}+\\cdots\\right] \\tag{12.61}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIf $\\left|V_{o d} / 2\\right| \\ll\\left|2 V_{o v 23}\\right|$, this equation simplifies to (12.56). To interpret (12.61), first consider the case when $V_{o c}=V_{C M}$. Then (12.61) indicates that the CM-sense output current is constant with $I_{c m s}=I_{20}$. While $I_{c m s}$ is constant, (12.59) and (12.60) show that $I_{d 22}$ and $I_{d 23}$ are not constant if $V_{o d}$ is nonzero and time-varying, and $I_{d 22}$ and $I_{d 23}$ are nonlinear functions of $V_{o d}$ (see the plot in Fig. 3.51). However, the variation in $I_{d 22}$ due to nonzero $V_{o d}$ is equal and opposite to the variation in $I_{d 23}$ due to $V_{o d}$; thus, these variations cancel when summed to form $I_{c m s}$. Next, consider the case when $V_{o c} \\neq V_{C M}$. $V_{o c}$ may not equal $V_{C M}$ due to device mismatch, finite gain in the CMFB loop, or the presence of an ac component in $V_{o c}$. Equation 12.61 shows that $I_{c m s}$ includes terms involving $V_{o d}^{2}$ that affect $I_{c m s}$ when $V_{o c} \\neq V_{C M}$. Therefore, even with perfectly matched transistors, this CM sensor does not behave like an ideal CM sensor as described by (12.49). The terms involving $V_{o d}^{2}$ arise from the (square-law) nonlinearity of the $M_{21}-M_{22}$ and $M_{23}-M_{24}$ differential pairs converting $V_{o 1}-V_{C M}$ and $V_{o 2}-V_{C M}$ into currents. The dependence of $I_{c m s}$ on $V_{o d}^{2}$ can cause a shift in the dc CM output voltage. Moreover, if $V_{o d}$ is not constant, this dependence can introduce an ac component in $V_{o c}$."

The source-coupled pairs $M_{21}-M_{22}$ and $M_{23}-M_{24}$ collectively sense the CM output voltage and produce an output proportional to the difference between $V_{o c}$ and $V_{C M}$. To demonstrate this, initially assume that the differential inputs to these source-coupled pairs, $V_{o 1}-V_{C M}$ and $V_{o 2}-V_{C M}$, are sufficiently small to permit small-signal analysis. Also, assume the CM gain of these pairs is zero.

This expression indicates that the current through $M_{25}$ comprises a dc term $I_{20}$ plus a term proportional to $V_{o c}-V_{C M}$. The current $I_{d 25}$ is mirrored by $M_{5}$ in Fig. 12.2 to generate the tail current in the op amp, which regulates the CM output voltage.\n\nThe dc output of the CM-sense circuit should supply the dc voltage required at the CMC input to achieve $V_{o c}=V_{C M}$.

As with the CM-sense amplifier in Fig. 12.16b, a smaller $I_{20}$ can be used, but this reduces the magnitude of the pole associated with the $M_{5}-M_{25}$ current mirror. [Refer to the text associated with (12.53).] This method does not resistively load the op-amp outputs, but the source-coupled pairs $M_{21}-M_{24}$ capacitively load them.\n\nThe preceding analysis assumes $M_{21}-M_{24}$ always operate in the active region and that $V_{o 1}-V_{C M}$ and $V_{o 2}-V_{C M}$ can be treated as small-signal inputs. Even if these voltages increase, the CMFB loop remains functional as long as $M_{21}-M_{24}$ stay on. However, the small-signal analysis is invalid if the transistors exit the active region. If the op-amp outputs become large enough to turn off any of $M_{21}-M_{24}$ during part of the output swing, the CMFB loop will malfunction during that period. The requirement for $M_{21}-M_{24}$ to remain on throughout the entire output swing imposes a limit on the op amp's output swing. The input voltage range for both transistors in a differential pair to stay on is related to their gate overdrive voltage. [See (3.161).] Thus, to keep $M_{21}-M_{24}$ on for large $V_{o 1}$ and $V_{o 2}$, they need substantial overdrives. In contrast, a scheme using resistors to detect the CM output voltage does not impose such an output-swing limit since the CM-sense amplifier is driven by $V_{o c}$, which is ideally constant, rather than $V_{o 1}$ and $V_{o 2}$, which include CM and DM components.\n\nEquation 12.56 suggests that this CM-sense circuit is nearly ideal, producing an output current with a constant term plus a term proportional to $V_{o c}-V_{C M}$.

To interpret (12.61), first consider the case when $V_{o c}=V_{C M}$. Then (12.61) indicates that the CM-sense output current is constant at $I_{c m s}=I_{20}$. While $I_{c m s}$ is constant, (12.59) and (12.60) show that $I_{d 22}$ and $I_{d 23}$ are not constant if $V_{o d}$ is nonzero and time-varying, and they are nonlinear functions of $V_{o d}$ (see the plot in Fig. 3.51). However, the variation in $I_{d 22}$ due to nonzero $V_{o d}$ is equal and opposite to the variation in $I_{d 23}$, so these variations cancel when summed to form $I_{c m s}$. Next, consider the case when $V_{o c} \\neq V_{C M}$. $V_{o c}$ may not equal $V_{C M}$ due to device mismatch, finite gain in the CMFB loop, or an ac component in $V_{o c}$. Equation 12.61 shows that $I_{c m s}$ includes terms with $V_{o d}^{2}$ that affect $I_{c m s}$ when $V_{o c} \\neq V_{C M}$. Thus, even with perfectly matched transistors, this CM sensor does not behave ideally as described by (12.49). The $V_{o d}^{2}$ terms arise from the (square-law) nonlinearity of the $M_{21}-M_{22}$ and $M_{23}-M_{24}$ differential pairs converting $V_{o 1}-V_{C M}$ and $V_{o 2}-V_{C M}$ into currents. The dependency of $I_{c m s}$ on $V_{o d}^{2}$ can cause a shift in the dc CM output voltage. Moreover, if $V_{o d}$ is not constant, this dependency can introduce an ac component in $V_{o c}$."

    "text": "A simplified representation of a CMFB scheme utilizing only transistors is depicted in Fig. 12.19. Here, $M_{21}-M_{24}$ are matched transistors. The source-coupled pairs $M_{21}-M_{22}$ and $M_{23}-M_{24}$ collectively detect the CM output voltage and produce an output proportional to the difference between $V_{o c}$ and $V_{C M}$. To illustrate this, initially assume that the differential inputs to these source-coupled pairs, $V_{o 1}-V_{C M}$ and $V_{o 2}-V_{C M}$, are sufficiently small to permit small-signal analysis. Also, assume the CM gain of these pairs is zero. Under these conditions, the drain currents in $M_{22}$ and $M_{23}$ are:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& I_{d 22}=-\\frac{I_{20}}{2}-g_{m 22} \\frac{\\left(V_{o 2}-V_{C M}\\right)}{2}  \\tag{12.54}\\\\\n& I_{d 23}=-\\frac{I_{20}}{2}-g_{m 23} \\frac{\\left(V_{o 1}-V_{C M}\\right)}{2} \\tag{12.55}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThese currents are combined in the diode-connected $M_{25}$ to yield the CM sensor output current:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{c m s}=I_{d 25} & =-I_{d 22}-I_{d 23}=I_{20}+g_{m 22}\\left(\\frac{V_{o 1}+V_{o 2}}{2}-V_{C M}\\right) \\\\\n& =I_{20}+g_{m 22}\\left(V_{o c}-V_{C M}\\right) \\tag{12.56}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nsince $g_{m 22}=g_{m 23}$. This final expression indicates that the current through $M_{25}$ comprises a dc term $I_{20}$ and a term proportional to $V_{o c}-V_{C M}$. The current $I_{d 25}$ is mirrored by $M_{5}$ in Fig. 12.2 to form the tail current in the op amp, which regulates the CM output voltage.\n\nThe dc output of the CM-sense circuit should supply the necessary dc voltage at the CMC input to achieve $V_{o c}=V_{C M}$. If $V_{o c}=V_{C M}$, the drain current in $M_{25}$ is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{D 25}=\\left|I_{D 22}\\right|+\\left|I_{D 23}\\right|=\\frac{I_{20}}{2}+\\frac{I_{20}}{2}=I_{20} \\tag{12.57}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nOne design option is choosing $I_{20}=\\left|I_{D 3}\\right|+\\left|I_{D 4}\\right|$ and $(W / L)_{25}=(W / L)_{5}$. As with the CM-sense amplifier in Fig. 12.16b, a smaller $I_{20}$ can be used, but this reduction decreases the magnitude of the pole associated with the $M_{5}-M_{25}$ current mirror. [See the text associated with (12.53).] This approach does not resistively load the op-amp outputs, but the source-coupled pairs $M_{21}-M_{24}$ do capacitively load them.\n\nThe preceding analysis assumes $M_{21}-M_{24}$ always operate in the active region and that $V_{o 1}-V_{C M}$ and $V_{o 2}-V_{C M}$ can be treated as small-signal inputs. Even if these voltages increase, the CMFB loop remains functional as long as $M_{21}-M_{24}$ stay on. However, the small-signal analysis is invalid if the transistors exit the active region. If the op-amp outputs become large enough to turn off any of $M_{21}-M_{24}$ during part of the output swing, the CMFB loop will malfunction during that segment. The requirement for $M_{21}-M_{24}$ to remain on throughout the entire output swing imposes a limit on the op amp's output swing. The input voltage range for both transistors in a differential pair to stay on is related to their gate overdrive voltage. [See (3.161).] Therefore, maintaining $M_{21}-M_{24}$ on for large $V_{o 1}$ and $V_{o 2}$ necessitates large overdrives. In contrast, a scheme using resistors to detect the CM output voltage does not impose such an output-swing limit, as the CM-sense amplifier is driven by $V_{o c}$, which is ideally constant, rather than $V_{o 1}$ and $V_{o 2}$, which include CM and DM components.\n\nEquation 12.56 suggests that this CM-sense circuit is nearly ideal, producing an output current with a constant term plus a term proportional to $V_{o c}-V_{C M}$.

To interpret (12.61), first consider the case when $V_{o c}=V_{C M}$. Then (12.61) indicates that the CM-sense output current is constant with $I_{c m s}=I_{20}$. While $I_{c m s}$ is constant, (12.59) and (12.60) show that $I_{d 22}$ and $I_{d 23}$ are not constant if $V_{o d}$ is nonzero and time-varying, and $I_{d 22}$ and $I_{d 23}$ are nonlinear functions of $V_{o d}$ (see the plot in Fig. 3.51). However, the variation in $I_{d 22}$ due to nonzero $V_{o d}$ is equal and opposite to the variation in $I_{d 23}$ due to $V_{o d}$; thus, these variations cancel when summed to form $I_{c m s}$. Next, consider the case when $V_{o c} \\neq V_{C M}$. $V_{o c}$ may not equal $V_{C M}$ due to device mismatch, finite gain in the CMFB loop, or the presence of an ac component in $V_{o c}$. Equation 12.61 reveals that $I_{c m s}$ includes terms involving $V_{o d}^{2}$ that affect $I_{c m s}$ when $V_{o c} \\neq V_{C M}$. Therefore, even with perfectly matched transistors, this CM sensor does not behave like an ideal CM sensor as described by (12.49). The terms involving $V_{o d}^{2}$ arise from the (square-law) nonlinearity of the $M_{21}-M_{22}$ and $M_{23}-M_{24}$ differential pairs converting $V_{o 1}-V_{C M}$ and $V_{o 2}-V_{C M}$ into currents. The dependency of $I_{c m s}$ on $V_{o d}^{2}$ can cause a shift in the dc CM output voltage. Moreover, if $V_{o d}$ is not constant, this dependency can introduce an ac component in $V_{o c}$."

    "text": "A simplified representation of a CMFB scheme utilizing only transistors is depicted in Fig. 12.19. Here, transistors $M_{21}-M_{24}$ are matched. The source-coupled pairs $M_{21}-M_{22}$ and $M_{23}-M_{24}$ collectively detect the CM output voltage and produce an output proportional to the difference between $V_{o c}$ and $V_{C M}$. To illustrate this, initially assume that the differential inputs to these source-coupled pairs, which are $V_{o 1}-V_{C M}$ and $V_{o 2}-V_{C M}$, are sufficiently small to permit small-signal analysis. Also, assume the CM gain of these pairs is zero. Under these premises, the drain currents in $M_{22}$ and $M_{23}$ are:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& I_{d 22}=-\\frac{I_{20}}{2}-g_{m 22} \\frac{\\left(V_{o 2}-V_{C M}\\right)}{2}  \\tag{12.54}\\\\\n& I_{d 23}=-\\frac{I_{20}}{2}-g_{m 23} \\frac{\\left(V_{o 1}-V_{C M}\\right)}{2} \\tag{12.55}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThese currents are combined in the diode-connected $M_{25}$ to yield the CM sensor output current:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{c m s}=I_{d 25} & =-I_{d 22}-I_{d 23}=I_{20}+g_{m 22}\\left(\\frac{V_{o 1}+V_{o 2}}{2}-V_{C M}\\right) \\\\\n& =I_{20}+g_{m 22}\\left(V_{o c}-V_{C M}\\right) \\tag{12.56}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nsince $g_{m 22}=g_{m 23}$. This final expression indicates that the current through $M_{25}$ comprises a dc term $I_{20}$ plus a term proportional to $V_{o c}-V_{C M}$. The current $I_{d 25}$ is mirrored by $M_{5}$ in Fig. 12.2 to generate the tail current in the op amp, which regulates the CM output voltage.\n\nThe dc output of the CM-sense circuit should supply the necessary dc voltage at the CMC input to achieve $V_{o c}=V_{C M}$. If $V_{o c}=V_{C M}$, the drain current in $M_{25}$ is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{D 25}=\\left|I_{D 22}\\right|+\\left|I_{D 23}\\right|=\\frac{I_{20}}{2}+\\frac{I_{20}}{2}=I_{20} \\tag{12.57}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSelecting $I_{20}=\\left|I_{D 3}\\right|+\\left|I_{D 4}\\right|$ and $(W / L)_{25}=(W / L)_{5}$ is one design approach. As with the CM-sense amplifier in Fig. 12.16b, a reduced $I_{20}$ can be employed, but such current reduction diminishes the magnitude of the pole associated with the $M_{5}-M_{25}$ current mirror. [Refer to the text related to (12.53).] This method does not resistively load the op-amp outputs, but the source-coupled pairs $M_{21}-M_{24}$ capacitively load them.\n\nThe preceding analysis of this CM-sense circuit presumed that $M_{21}-M_{24}$ consistently operate in the active region and that voltages $V_{o 1}-V_{C M}$ and $V_{o 2}-V_{C M}$ can be treated as small-signal inputs. Even if these voltages increase, the CMFB loop remains functional as long as $M_{21}-M_{24}$ stay on. However, the small-signal analysis is invalid if the transistors exit the active region. If the op-amp outputs become sufficiently large to turn off any of $M_{21}-M_{24}$ during part of the output swing, the CMFB loop will malfunction during that segment. The requirement for $M_{21}-M_{24}$ to remain on throughout the entire output swing imposes a limit on the op amp's output swing. The input voltage range for both transistors in a differential pair to stay on is related to their gate overdrive voltage. [See (3.161).] Therefore, to keep $M_{21}-M_{24}$ on for large $V_{o 1}$ and $V_{o 2}$, they need substantial overdrives. Conversely, the method using resistors to detect the CM output voltage does not impose such an output-swing limit since the CM-sense amplifier is driven by $V_{o c}$, which is ideally constant, rather than $V_{o 1}$ and $V_{o 2}$, which include CM and DM components.\n\nEquation 12.56 suggests that this CM-sense circuit is nearly flawless, producing an output current with a constant term plus a term proportional to $V_{o c}-V_{C M}$.

A similar analysis for this pair results in:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n-I_{d 23} \\approx & \\frac{I_{20}}{2}+\\frac{k_{p}^{\\prime}}{4}\\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)_{23}\\left(\\frac{V_{o d}}{2}+V_{o c}-V_{C M}\\right) \\sqrt{4 V_{o v 23}^{2}-\\left(V_{o d} / 2\\right)^{2}} \\\\\n& \\times\\left[1-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\left(V_{o c}-V_{C M}\\right) V_{o d}}{4 V_{o v 23}^{2}-\\left(V_{o d} / 2\\right)^{2}}\\right)-\\frac{1}{8}\\left(\\frac{\\left(V_{o c}-V_{C M}\\right) V_{o d}}{4 V_{o v 23}^{2}-\\left(V_{o d} / 2\\right)^{2}}\\right)^{2}+\\cdots\\right] \\tag{12.60}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSubstituting (12.59) and (12.60) in (12.58) with $V_{\\text {ov } 22}=V_{\\text {ov23 }}$ and $(W / L)_{22}=(W / L)_{23}$ gives:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{c m s}=I_{d 25} \\approx & I_{20}+\\frac{k_{p}^{\\prime}}{2}\\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)_{23}\\left(V_{o c}-V_{C M}\\right) \\sqrt{4 V_{o v 23}^{2}-\\left(V_{o d} / 2\\right)^{2}} \\\\\n& \\times\\left[1-\\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{V_{o d}^{2}}{4 V_{o v 23}^{2}-\\left(V_{o d} / 2\\right)^{2}}\\right)-\\frac{1}{8}\\left(\\frac{\\left(V_{o c}-V_{C M}\\right) V_{o d}}{4 V_{o v 23}^{2}-\\left(V_{o d} / 2\\right)^{2}}\\right)^{2}+\\cdots\\right] \\tag{12.61}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIf $\\left|V_{o d} / 2\\right| \\ll\\left|2 V_{o v 23}\\right|$, this equation simplifies to (12.56). To interpret (12.61), first consider $V_{o c}=V_{C M}$. Then (12.61) indicates that the CM-sense output current is constant with $I_{c m s}=I_{20}$. While $I_{c m s}$ is constant, (12.59) and (12.60) show that $I_{d 22}$ and $I_{d 23}$ are not constant if $V_{o d}$ is nonzero and time-varying, and $I_{d 22}$ and $I_{d 23}$ are nonlinear functions of $V_{o d}$ (see the plot in Fig. 3.51). However, the variation in $I_{d 22}$ due to nonzero $V_{o d}$ is equal and opposite to the variation in $I_{d 23}$ due to $V_{o d}$; thus, these variations cancel when summed to form $I_{c m s}$. Next, consider $V_{o c} \\neq V_{C M}$. $V_{o c}$ may not equal $V_{C M}$ due to device mismatch, finite gain in the CMFB loop, or an ac component in $V_{o c}$. Equation 12.61 reveals that $I_{c m s}$ includes terms involving $V_{o d}^{2}$ that affect $I_{c m s}$ when $V_{o c} \\neq V_{C M}$. Hence, even with perfectly matched transistors, this CM sensor does not behave like an ideal CM sensor as described by (12.49). The terms involving $V_{o d}^{2}$ arise from the (square-law) nonlinearity of the $M_{21}-M_{22}$ and $M_{23}-M_{24}$ differential pairs converting $V_{o 1}-V_{C M}$ and $V_{o 2}-V_{C M}$ into currents. The dependence of $I_{c m s}$ on $V_{o d}^{2}$ can cause a shift in the dc CM output voltage. Moreover, if $V_{o d}$ is not constant, this dependence can introduce an ac component in $V_{o c}$."

    "text": "Another CMFB configuration is depicted in Fig. 12.20. ${ }^{8}$ The basic op amp from Fig. 12.2 is reillustrated here, with $M_{5}$ substituted by $M_{30}-M_{32}$. Transistors $M_{30}-M_{35}$ are integral to the CMFB loop. In this setup, $M_{31}, M_{32}, M_{34}$, and $M_{35}$ function in the triode region, whereas $M_{30}, M_{33}$, and $M_{36}$ operate in the active region. The target CM output voltage $V_{C M}$ is linked to the gates of $M_{34}$ and $M_{35}$. To streamline the explanation of this circuit, it is assumed that $M_{30}-M_{35}$ are matched and the body effect is negligible. Before delving into the mathematical analysis of this CMFB method, its functionality will be described intuitively. Initially, suppose that the op-amp outputs in Fig. 12.20 exhibit only a CM component; specifically, $V_{o 1}=V_{o 2}=V_{o c}$. Consequently, the gate voltages of $M_{31}$ and $M_{32}$ equal $V_{o c}$. Given that $\\left|I_{D 3}\\right|=\\left|I_{D 4}\\right|=I_{1}$, the drain current in $M_{30}$ must be $2 I_{1}$ to satisfy KCL. Transistors $M_{30}-M_{35}$ constitute a degenerated current mirror, resulting in $I_{D 30}=I_{D 33}=2 I_{1}$ when $V_{o c}=V_{C M}$, owing to the matching of $M_{30}-M_{35}$. Thus, $V_{o c}=V_{C M}$ represents a viable operating point for this circuit. Negative feedback drives the circuit to this operating point, as explained below. Up to this point, the assumption has been that only CM signals are present. Differential signals do not impact the operation of this feedback loop, as demonstrated by the subsequent analysis.\n\nSince $M_{31}$ and $M_{32}$ are matched and operate in the triode region, the sum of their drain currents $I_{c m s}$ is [using (1.152)]\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{c m s}=I_{d 31}+I_{d 32}= & k_{n}^{\\prime}\\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)_{31}\\left(\\left(V_{o 1}+V_{S S}-V_{t 31}\\right) V_{d s 31}-\\frac{V_{d s 31}^{2}}{2}\\right) \\\\\n& +k_{n}^{\\prime}\\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)_{32}\\left(\\left(V_{o 2}+V_{S S}-V_{t 32}\\right) V_{d s 32}-\\frac{V_{d s 32}^{2}}{2}\\right) \\\\\n= & 2 k_{n}^{\\prime}\\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)_{31}\\left(V_{o c}+V_{S S}-V_{t n}-\\frac{V_{d s 31}}{2}\\right) V_{d s 31} \\tag{12.62}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nbecause $V_{d s 31}=V_{d s 32}, V_{t 31}=V_{t 32}=V_{t n}$, and $(W / L)_{31}=(W / L)_{32}$. This equation indicates that $I_{c m s}$ depends on the CM output voltage and is independent of the differential output voltage, as changes in the drain currents of $M_{31}$ and $M_{32}$ due to nonzero $V_{o d}$ are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, thus canceling out when summed in (12.62).\n\nApplying KVL around the lower transistors $M_{30}-M_{35}$ yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{d s 31}=V_{d s 35}+V_{g s 33}-V_{g s 30} \\tag{12.63}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAssuming $I_{d 30} \\approx I_{d 33}$, we get $V_{g s 30} \\approx V_{g s 33}$, and (12.63) simplifies to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{d s 31} \\approx V_{d s 35} \\tag{12.64}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince $M_{35}$ operates in the triode region with $I_{D 35}=I_{1}$, rearranging (1.152) provides\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{d s 35}=\\frac{I_{1}}{k_{n}^{\\prime}\\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)_{35}\\left(V_{C M}+V_{S S}-V_{t n}-\\frac{V_{d s 35}}{2}\\right)} \\tag{12.65}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nUsing (12.64) and (12.65) in (12.62) with $(W / L)_{31}=(W / L)_{35}$ results in\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{c m s} & \\approx I_{1} \\frac{2 k_{n}^{\\prime}\\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)_{35}\\left(V_{o c}+V_{S S}-V_{t n}-\\frac{V_{d s 35}}{2}\\right)}{k_{n}^{\\prime}\\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)_{35}\\left(V_{C M}+V_{S S}-V_{t n}-\\frac{V_{d s 35}}{2}\\right)}=2 I_{1} \\frac{V_{o c}+V_{S S}-V_{t n}-\\frac{V_{d s 35}}{2}}{V_{C M}+V_{S S}-V_{t n}-\\frac{V_{d s 35}}{2}} \\\\\n& =2 I_{1} \\frac{V_{C M}+V_{S S}-V_{t n}-\\frac{V_{d s 35}}{2}}{V_{C M}+V_{S S}-V_{t n}-\\frac{V_{d s 35}}{2}}+2 I_{1} \\frac{V_{o c}-V_{C M}}{V_{C M}+V_{S S}-V_{t n}-\\frac{V_{d s 35}}{2}}  \\tag{12.66}\\\\\n& =2 I_{1}+2 I_{1} \\frac{V_{o c}-V_{C M}}{V_{C M}+V_{S S}-V_{t n}-\\frac{V_{d s 35}}{2}}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis final expression reveals that the op-amp tail current $I_{c m s}$ comprises a constant component $2 I_{1}$ plus a component dependent on $V_{o c}-V_{C M}$. If $\\left|I_{d 3}\\right|=\\left|I_{d 4}\\right|=I_{1}$, then KCL dictates that $I_{c m s}=2 I_{1}$. Substituting this value in (12.66) yields $V_{o c} \\approx V_{C M}$, as intended. In practice, mismatches can cause $V_{o c}$ to deviate from $V_{C M}$. For instance, if the drain currents in $M_{3}$ and $M_{4}$ exceed $I_{1}$, then (12.66) indicates that $V_{o c}$ must be higher than $V_{C M}$ to increase $I_{c m s}$ beyond $2 I_{1}$.\n\nTo confirm that the CMFB loop here acts as a negative feedback loop, assume $V_{o c}$ rises. This increases the gate-source voltages of $M_{31}$ and $M_{32}$, thereby raising $I_{c m s}$. An increase in $I_{c m s}$ leads to an increase in $V_{s d 3}=V_{s d 4}$ since $M_{3}$ and $M_{4}$ have fixed gate-source voltages. This rise in $V_{s d 3}=V_{s d 4}$ causes $V_{o c}$ to decrease, counteracting the initial increase in $V_{o c}$. In steady state, this CMFB loop ensures $V_{o c} \\approx V_{C M}$.\n\nOne drawback of this scheme is that the CMFB loop malfunctions when the output voltage swing is large enough to turn off either $M_{31}$ or $M_{32}$. Consequently, neither op-amp output can swing within a threshold voltage of $-V_{S S}$. Thus, the op-amp output swing is constrained by this CMFB scheme. Another limitation is that the small-signal gain magnitude in the CMFB loop is lower here than in previous methods due to the reduced transconductance of $M_{31}$ or $M_{32}$ in the triode region compared to the active region. (See Problem 12.19.) This reduction in CMFB loop gain diminishes the control over the CM output voltage. Additionally, the bandwidth of the CMFB loop is lower here due to the low transconductance of $M_{31}$ and $M_{32}$. The bandwidth requirements for the CMFB loop are discussed in Section 12.8.\n\nFigure 12.21 illustrates a CMFB scheme utilizing switched capacitors.\nThis circuit employs capacitors instead of resistors to detect the common-mode output voltage, thereby avoiding resistive loading on the op-amp. The switches control the connection paths based on clock phases φ1 and φ2, enabling the capacitors to sample and hold the common-mode voltage."

    "text": "To address the limitations on the op-amp output swing imposed by the last two CMFB methods and to prevent resistive loading of the op-amp output, capacitors can be employed to detect the CM output voltage. By substituting the CM-sense resistors $R_{c s}$ in Fig. 12.16 with capacitors, resistive loading is eliminated, but these capacitors act as open circuits at dc. To prevent dc bias issues, switched capacitors can be utilized as the CM detector. ${ }^{9}$ A commonly used switched-capacitor (SC) CMFB scheme in switched-capacitor amplifiers and filters (refer to Section 6.1.7) is depicted in Fig. 12.21. Here, the network comprising switches $S_{1}-S_{6}$ and capacitors $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ detects the CM output voltage and subtracts it from the desired CM output voltage $V_{C M}$. Voltage $V_{C S B I A S}$ serves as a dc bias voltage. As in Fig. 6.8, it is assumed that each switch is active when its control signal is high and inactive when it is low. These switches are governed by two nonoverlapping clocks, $\\phi_{1}$ and $\\phi_{2}$ (meaning $\\phi_{1}$ and $\\phi_{2}$ are never high simultaneously). In this section, we assume these switches are ideal. In practice, switches $S_{1}-S_{6}$ are implemented using MOS transistors. Similar to the previous section, the simple op amp in Fig. 12.2 is used as the op amp in Fig. 12.21.\n\nThe SC CMFB circuit is a linear, balanced, discrete-time circuit. Consequently, all points along the axis of symmetry (indicated by a dashed line in Fig. 12.21) operate at ac ground for differential signals. The op-amp CMC input lies on the axis of symmetry, so $V_{c m c}$ possesses a CM component but no DM component. Thus, the switched-capacitor circuit functions effectively as a CM sensor. To demonstrate that voltage $V_{c m c}$ depends on the difference between the actual and desired CM output voltages, consider the CM half-circuit shown in Fig. 12.22a. Capacitor $C_{2}$ remains unswitched and connects from $V_{c m c}$ to $V_{o c}$. Since $V_{c m c}$ is the gate voltage of $M_{5}$ in Fig. 12.2, there is voltage gain from $V_{c m c}$ to $V_{o c}$, represented by controlled source $a_{c m c}$. Comparing this half-circuit to Fig. 6.10a, we observe that $C_{2}$ connected across the gain stage and switched-capacitor $C_{1}$ form a switched-capacitor integrator. This integrator is part of a negative feedback loop since its output $V_{o c}$ is fed back to a switch connected to $C_{1}$.\n\nWhen $\\phi_{1}$ is high, $C_{1}$ charges to $V_{C M}-V_{C S B I A S}$. When $\\phi_{2}$ is high, $C_{1}$ connects between $V_{o c}$ and $V_{c m c}$. In steady state, $V_{o c}$ remains constant due to the applied dc voltages $V_{C M}$ and $V_{C S B I A S}$ and the operation of the switched-capacitor integrator in a negative feedback loop. Once $V_{o c}$ stabilizes, $C_{1}$ does not transfer charge to $C_{2}$ when $\\phi_{2}$ is high.

The voltage $V_{C S B I A S}$ is the gate voltage of the replica of $M_{5}$. Since this bias circuit uses replicas of the op amp's transistors to generate $V_{C S B I A S}$, this method is known as replica biasing.\n\nA key advantage of this CMFB approach is that the op-amp output voltage swing is not constrained by the CM-sense circuit, as it consists solely of passive elements (capacitors) and switches. (If a switch is made from $n$-channel and $p$-channel transistors in parallel, driven by clock $\\phi$ and its inverse, respectively, it can pass any signal within the power-supply voltages if $V_{D D}+V_{S S}>V_{t n}+\\left|V_{t p}\\right| .^{10}$) In reality, an MOS transistor is not an ideal switch. It must have a sufficient $W / L$ ratio to achieve a low drain-source resistance when on. However, when each transistor turns off, charge from its channel and associated gate overlap capacitance transfers to its drain and source nodes. Thus, the MOS transistors acting as switches will transfer charge to $C_{1}$. Let $\\Delta Q$ represent the net charge transferred to $C_{1}$ per clock period. Accounting for this charge, (12.67) becomes\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{1}\\left(V_{C M}-V_{C S B I A S}\\right)=C_{1}\\left(V_{o c}-V_{c m c}\\right)+\\Delta Q \\tag{12.70}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{C M}-V_{o c}=V_{C S B I A S}-V_{c m c}+\\frac{\\Delta Q}{C_{1}} \\tag{12.71}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nComparing (12.71) with (12.68) reveals that $\\Delta Q / C_{1}$ introduces an offset in $V_{o c}$, causing $V_{o c}$ to deviate from $V_{C M}$ when $V_{C S B I A S}=V_{c m c}$. If $V_{C M}$ was selected to maximize the op-amp output swing, a shift in $V_{o c}$ will decrease the op-amp output swing. The amount of charge transferred by each switch transistor increases with its width $W$ [since the gate-channel and overlap capacitances are proportional to $W$ as shown in (1.187) and (2.45)], leading to a trade-off between low switch on-resistance and minimal charge transfer. From (12.71), increasing $C_{1}$ reduces the impact of the transferred charge on $V_{o c}$, but it also increases the capacitive loading on the op-amp outputs when $\\phi_{2}$ is high."

By substituting the CM-sense resistors $R_{c s}$ in Fig. 12.16 with capacitors, resistive loading is eliminated, but these capacitors present an open circuit at dc. To circumvent dc bias issues, switched capacitors can serve as the CM detector. ${ }^{9}$ A commonly used switched-capacitor (SC) CMFB scheme in switched-capacitor amplifiers and filters (refer to Section 6.1.7) is depicted in Fig. 12.21. Here, the network comprising switches $S_{1}-S_{6}$ and capacitors $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ detects the CM output voltage and subtracts it from the desired CM output voltage $V_{C M}$. Voltage $V_{C S B I A S}$ is a dc bias voltage. As in Fig. 6.8, each switch is active when its control signal is high and inactive when it is low. These switches are governed by two nonoverlapping clocks, $\\phi_{1}$ and $\\phi_{2}$ (meaning $\\phi_{1}$ and $\\phi_{2}$ are never simultaneously high). In this section, we assume these switches are ideal. In practice, switches $S_{1}-S_{6}$ are realized using MOS transistors. As in the preceding section, we utilize the simple op amp from Fig. 12.2 as the op amp in Fig. 12.21.\n\nThe SC CMFB circuit is a linear, balanced, discrete-time circuit. Consequently, all points on the axis of symmetry (indicated by a dashed line in Fig. 12.21) operate at ac ground for differential signals. The op-amp CMC input lies along this axis, so $V_{c m c}$ exhibits a CM component but no DM component, making the switched-capacitor circuit an effective CM sensor. To demonstrate that voltage $V_{c m c}$ depends on the difference between the actual and desired CM output voltages, consider the CM half-circuit shown in Fig. 12.22a. Capacitor $C_{2}$, which is not switched, connects from $V_{c m c}$ to $V_{o c}$. Since $V_{c m c}$ is the gate voltage of $M_{5}$ in Fig. 12.2, there is a voltage gain from $V_{c m c}$ to $V_{o c}$, represented by the controlled source $a_{c m c}$. Comparing this half-circuit to Fig. 6.10a, we observe that $C_{2}$ connected across the gain stage and the switched capacitor $C_{1}$ form a switched-capacitor integrator. This integrator is part of a negative feedback loop because its output $V_{o c}$ is fed back to a switch connected to $C_{1}$.\n\nWhen $\\phi_{1}$ is high, $C_{1}$ charges to $V_{C M}-V_{C S B I A S}$. When $\\phi_{2}$ is high, $C_{1}$ connects between $V_{o c}$ and $V_{c m c}$. In steady state, $V_{o c}$ remains constant due to the applied dc voltages $V_{C M}$ and $V_{C S B I A S}$ and the operation of the switched-capacitor integrator in a negative feedback loop. Once $V_{o c}$ stabilizes, $C_{1}$ does not transfer charge to $C_{2}$ when $\\phi_{2}$ is high.

If $V_{C M}$ was selected to maximize the op-amp output swing, a shift in $V_{o c}$ will reduce this swing. The charge transferred by each switch transistor increases with its width $W$ [since gate-channel and overlap capacitances are proportional to $W$, as shown in (1.187) and (2.45)], necessitating a trade-off between low switch on-resistance and minimal charge transfer.

    "text": "To address the output swing constraints of the last two CMFB methods and to prevent resistive loading on the op amp, capacitors can be employed to sense the CM output voltage. Replacing the CM-sense resistors $R_{c s}$ in Fig. 12.16 with capacitors eliminates resistive loading, but these capacitors act as open circuits at dc. To circumvent dc bias issues, switched capacitors can serve as the CM detector. ${ }^{9}$ A commonly used switched-capacitor (SC) CMFB scheme in switched-capacitor amplifiers and filters (refer to Section 6.1.7) is depicted in Fig. 12.21. Here, the network comprising switches $S_{1}-S_{6}$ and capacitors $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ detects the CM output voltage and subtracts it from the desired CM output voltage $V_{C M}$. Voltage $V_{C S B I A S}$ is a dc bias voltage. As in Fig. 6.8, each switch is active when its control signal is high and inactive when low. These switches are governed by two nonoverlapping clocks, $\\phi_{1}$ and $\\phi_{2}$ (meaning $\\phi_{1}$ and $\\phi_{2}$ are never simultaneously high). In this section, we assume ideal switches. In practice, switches $S_{1}-S_{6}$ are realized using MOS transistors. We use the simple op amp from Fig. 12.2 as the op amp in Fig. 12.21.\n\nThe SC CMFB circuit is a linear, balanced, discrete-time circuit. Consequently, all points on the symmetry axis (indicated by a dashed line in Fig. 12.21) operate at ac ground for differential signals. The op-amp CMC input lies on this axis, so $V_{c m c}$ has a CM component but no DM component, making the switched-capacitor circuit an effective CM sensor. To demonstrate that $V_{c m c}$ depends on the difference between the actual and desired CM output voltages, consider the CM half-circuit in Fig. 12.22a. Capacitor $C_{2}$, which is not switched, connects from $V_{c m c}$ to $V_{o c}$. Since $V_{c m c}$ is the gate voltage of $M_{5}$ in Fig. 12.2, there is a voltage gain from $V_{c m c}$ to $V_{o c}$, represented by controlled source $a_{c m c}$. Comparing this half-circuit to Fig. 6.10a, we see that $C_{2}$ across the gain stage and switched-capacitor $C_{1}$ form a switched-capacitor integrator. This integrator is part of a negative feedback loop as its output $V_{o c}$ connects back to a switch linked to $C_{1}$.\n\nWhen $\\phi_{1}$ is high, $C_{1}$ charges to $V_{C M}-V_{C S B I A S}$. When $\\phi_{2}$ is high, $C_{1}$ connects between $V_{o c}$ and $V_{c m c}$. In steady state, $V_{o c}$ remains constant due to the dc nature of $V_{C M}$ and $V_{C S B I A S}$ and the negative feedback loop of the switched-capacitor integrator. Once $V_{o c}$ stabilizes, $C_{1}$ does not transfer charge to $C_{2}$ when $\\phi_{2}$ is high.

Then (12.68) simplifies to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{o c} \\approx V_{C M} \\tag{12.69}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nas intended. For the op amp in Fig. 12.2, the bias voltage $V_{C S B I A S}$ can be generated by passing a current equivalent to $\\left|I_{D 3}\\right|+\\left|I_{D 4}\\right|$ through a diode-connected replica of $M_{5}$ connected to $-V_{S S}$, as illustrated in Fig. 12.22b. The replicas of $M_{3}$ and $M_{4}$ have the same source and gate connections as in the op amp, replicating the currents $\\left|I_{D 3}\\right|$ and $\\left|I_{D 4}\\right|$ in Fig. 12.2. The voltage $V_{C S B I A S}$ is the gate voltage of the $M_{5}$ replica. This biasing method, which uses replicas of the op amp's transistors, is known as replica biasing.\n\nA key advantage of this CMFB approach is that the op-amp output voltage swing is not constrained by the CM-sense circuit, as it comprises only passive elements (capacitors) and switches. (If a switch is made from $n$-channel and $p$-channel transistors in parallel, driven by clock $\\phi$ and its inverse, respectively, it can pass any signal within the power-supply voltages if $V_{D D}+V_{S S}>V_{t n}+\\left|V_{t p}\\right| .^{10}$) In reality, MOS transistors are not ideal switches. They must have a sufficient $W / L$ ratio to achieve a low drain-source resistance when on. However, when each transistor turns off, charge from its channel and associated gate overlap capacitance transfers to its drain and source nodes. Thus, the MOS transistors acting as switches will transfer charge to $C_{1}$. Let $\\Delta Q$ denote the net charge transferred to $C_{1}$ per clock period. Accounting for this charge, (12.67) becomes\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{1}\\left(V_{C M}-V_{C S B I A S}\\right)=C_{1}\\left(V_{o c}-V_{c m c}\\right)+\\Delta Q \\tag{12.70}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{C M}-V_{o c}=V_{C S B I A S}-V_{c m c}+\\frac{\\Delta Q}{C_{1}} \\tag{12.71}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nComparing (12.71) with (12.68) reveals that $\\Delta Q / C_{1}$ introduces an offset in $V_{o c}$, causing $V_{o c}$ to deviate from $V_{C M}$ when $V_{C S B I A S}=V_{c m c}$. If $V_{C M}$ was selected to maximize the op-amp output swing, a shift in $V_{o c}$ will decrease the op-amp output swing. The charge transferred by each switch transistor increases with its width $W$ [since gate-channel and overlap capacitances are proportional to $W$, as shown in (1.187) and (2.45)], leading to a trade-off between low switch on-resistance and minimal charge transfer. From (12.71), increasing $C_{1}$ reduces the impact of the transferred charge on $V_{o c}$, but it also increases capacitive loading at the op-amp outputs when $\\phi_{2}$ is high."

The CMFB loop manipulates the CM output voltage by linking to the gate of M5.\n\nFigure 12.24 presents (a) the DM half-circuit and (b) the CM half-circuit for the op amp in Fig. 12.23.\n\nThe DM half-circuit in Fig. 12.24a constitutes a series of two common-source amplifiers with active loads, delivering the low-frequency DM gain as expressed in equation (12.72). The Miller-compensated second stage can be modeled by the circuit in Fig. 9.21 with parameters defined as per equations (9.32) and (9.33). Assuming the op amp is operational within a feedback loop, the feedback factor for the DM feedback loop is frequency-independent, and the right-half-plane zero has been nullified. To achieve a $45^{\\circ}$ phase margin, the magnitude of the DM loop gain should be unity at the frequency $\\left|p_{2 d}\\right|$. Since the gain magnitude times frequency is constant from $\\left|p_{1 d}\\right|$ to $\\left|p_{2 d}\\right|$ due to the single-pole roll-off, we can write\n\n$$\n\\left|a_{d m 0} f_{d m} p_{1 d}\\right|=1 \\cdot\\left|p_{2 d}\\right| \\tag{12.73}\n$$\n\nSubstituting (12.72), (9.32), and (9.33) into (12.73) yields\n\n$$\n\\frac{g_{m 2}}{C} f_{d m} \\approx \\frac{g_{m 6}}{C_{2 d}} \\tag{12.74}\n$$\n\nassuming that the DM load capacitance $C_{2 d}$ and the compensation capacitor $C$ are much larger than the internal node capacitance $C_{1 d}$. If the other values are known, the compensation capacitor can be ascertained from (12.74).\n\nThe CM half-circuit is depicted in Fig. 12.24b. The first stages of the CM and DM half-circuits differ, but the second stages are identical. To concentrate on the CMFB loop, we will assume $v_{i c}=0$. (Nonzero $v_{i c}$ will be considered later.) In the CM half-circuit, the first stage comprises a common-source $M_{5 h}$ with a common-gate $M_{2}$ and an active load $M_{4}$. As in Fig. $12.14 b, M_{5 h}$ is one half of $M_{5}$, with $(W / L)_{5 h}=(W / L)_{5} / 2$ and $I_{D 5 h}=I_{D 5} / 2$. The first stage is followed by the common-source second stage, $M_{6}-M_{7}$. The low-frequency CMC gain is\n\n$$\na_{c m c 0}=\\frac{v_{o c}}{v_{c m c}} \\approx g_{m 5 h}\\left[\\left(r_{o 2} g_{m 2} r_{o 5 h}\\right) \\| r_{o 4}\\right] g_{m 6}\\left(r_{o 6} \\| r_{o 7}\\right) \\tag{12.75}\n$$\n\nCapacitance associated with the source of cascode $M_{1}$ introduces a pole $p_{x}$ in the CMC gain. If $\\left|p_{x}\\right|$ is much larger than the magnitude of the nondominant pole $\\left|p_{2 c}\\right|$ in (9.33) from the Miller-compensated second stage, pole $p_{x}$ can be disregarded, and the gain $a_{c m c}$ can be approximated as having two poles that are given by (9.32) and (9.33). These poles can be different than the poles in the DM gain for two reasons. First, the output load capacitances in the DM and CM half-circuits can be different, and second, the output resistances of the first stages in the half-circuits can be different. The zero due to feedforward is the same as for DM gain and can be eliminated as described in Chapter 9. To simplify the following analysis, we will assume that all poles and zeros in the CMFB loop other than the two poles associated with the Miller compensation can be ignored. To achieve a $45^{\\circ}$ phase margin, the magnitude of the CMFB loop gain should diminish to unity at $\\left|p_{2 c}\\right|$. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\left|a_{c m c 0} a_{c m s} 0 p_{1 c}\\right|=1 \\cdot\\left|p_{2 c}\\right| \\tag{12.76}\n$$\n\nwhere $a_{c m s 0}$ is the low-frequency gain through the CM-sense circuit\n\n$$\na_{c m s 0}=\\left.\\frac{v_{c m c}}{v_{o c}}\\right|_{\\omega=0, \\text { CMFB loop open }}=\\left.\\frac{v_{c m s}}{v_{o c}}\\right|_{\\omega=0, \\text { CMFB loop open }} \\tag{12.77}\n$$\n\nSubstituting (12.75), (9.32), and (9.33) into (12.76) and using $R_{1} \\approx r_{o 2} g_{m 2} r_{o 5 h}$ gives\n\n$$\n\\frac{g_{m 5 h}}{C}\\left|a_{c m s}\\right| \\approx \\frac{g_{m 6}}{C_{2 c}} \\tag{12.78}\n$$\n\nassuming that the CM load capacitance $C_{2 c}$ and the compensation capacitor $C$ are much larger than the internal node capacitance $C_{1 c}$. The compensation capacitor required for the CMFB loop can be derived from (12.78).\n\nIn an ideal scenario, the compensation capacitor values calculated in (12.74) and (12.78) would be equivalent, and the CMFB and DM loops would each possess a phase margin of $45^{\\circ}$. However, in practice, these values seldom match. If the value of $C$ is selected to be the greater of the values provided by (12.74) and (12.78), one feedback loop will have a phase margin of $45^{\\circ}$, and the other loop will have a phase margin exceeding $45^{\\circ}$ and will be overcompensated. A drawback of overcompensation is that the unity-gain frequency of the loop gain and the closed-loop bandwidth are reduced compared to optimal compensation. If the larger $C$ is necessary to compensate the DM feedback loop, using that compensation capacitor will overcompensate the CMFB loop. Since the CMFB ideally operates on only dc signals, diminishing its bandwidth may be tolerable. (Refer to Section 12.8 for further discussion on this topic.) Conversely, if the larger $C$ is required to compensate the CMFB feedback loop, using that compensation capacitor will overcompensate the DM loop. However, narrowing the bandwidth of the DM feedback loop through overcompensation is typically undesirable because this loop processes the DM input signal, which may have a broad bandwidth.\n\nAn alternative to employing the larger $C$ value that optimally compensates the CMFB loop but overcompensates the DM loop involves using the value of $C$ that yields a $45^{\\circ}$ phase margin in the DM loop from (12.74) and concurrently scaling down $g_{m 5 h}$ to satisfy (12.78). This approach delivers a $45^{\\circ}$ phase margin for both feedback loops without compromising bandwidth in the DM loop. Scaling $g_{m 5 h}=g_{m 5} / 2$ could be achieved by reducing $(W / L)_{5}$, but such scaling would diminish the CM input range of the op amp because decreasing $(W / L)_{5}$ increases $\\left|V_{o v 5}\\right|$. Another solution is to split $M_{5}$ into two parallel transistors, one with its gate connected to a bias voltage and the other with its gate connected to CMC, as described in Section 12.4.2 and Fig. 12.15. A drawback of this approach is that reducing $g_{m 5 h}$ diminishes $\\left|a_{c m c 0}\\right|$, as evident in (12.75).\n\nNeglecting constraints imposed by the CM-sense circuit, we observe that each op-amp output in Fig. 12.23 can swing until a transistor in the second stage enters the triode region. The maximum value of $V_{o 1}$ is $V_{D D}-\\left|V_{o v 7}\\right|$, and its minimum value is $-V_{S S}+V_{o v 6}$. Consequently, the peak differential output voltage is\n\n$$\nV_{o d(\\text { peak })} =V_{o 1(\\max )}-V_{o 2(\\min )}=V_{o 1(\\max )}-V_{o 1(\\min )}=V_{D D}-\\left|V_{o v 7}\\right|-\\left(-V_{S S}+V_{o v 6}\\right) =V_{D D}+V_{S S}-V_{o v 6}-\\left|V_{o v 7}\\right| \\tag{12.79}\n$$\n\nThe CM input range of the op amp is confined in the positive direction by the tail current source, which transitions from active to triode when $\\left|V_{d s}\\right|=\\left|V_{o v 5}\\right|$; thus, we desire\n\n$$\nV_{I C}<V_{D D}-\\left|V_{G S 1}\\right|-\\left|V_{o v 5}\\right| \\tag{12.80}\n$$\n\nThe lower limit of the CM input range occurs when input transistor $M_{1}$ (or $M_{2}$ ) enters the triode region, hence\n\n$$\nV_{I C}>-V_{S S}+V_{G S 6}+V_{t 1} \\tag{12.81}\n$$\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nModify the single-ended two-stage op amp from the examples in Sections 6.3.5 and 9.4.3 into a fully differential op amp. It will be utilized in the feedback circuit illustrated in Fig. 12.25, which represents the connections in a switched-capacitor circuit when one clock is high (assuming the switches are ideal). The capacitor values are $C_{S}=2 \\mathrm{pF}, C_{F}=5 \\mathrm{pF}$, and $C_{L}=2 \\mathrm{pF}$. Design for 1-V peak output swing and phase margins of $45^{\\circ}$ or greater in the DM and CMFB loops. Use $V_{D D}=V_{S S}=1.65 \\mathrm{~V}$, and design for a CM output voltage of 0 V.\n\nCommence by designing the devices to fulfill the bias and low-frequency requirements. Subsequently, compensate the amplifier. Utilizing the device dimensions and bias currents from the example in Section 6.3.5, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n(W / L)_{1}=(W / L)_{2}=77 \\quad(W / L)_{3}=(W / L)_{4}=4 \\quad(W / L)_{5}=25 \\\\\n(W / L)_{6}=(W / L)_{9}=16 \\quad(W / L)_{7}=(W / L)_{10}=50\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nFor CMFB, we will employ two differential pairs as depicted in Fig. 12.26. Since the input stage in Fig. 12.23 is the complement of the op amp in Fig. 12.2, the CMFB circuit in Fig. 12.26 is the complement of the circuit in Fig. 12.19 to allow control of the op-amp tail current $I_{D 5}$ through a current mirror formed by $M_{5}$ and $M_{25}$. Additionally, the CM-sense output $V_{c m s}$ is derived from the drains of $M_{21}$ and $M_{24}$, which renders the gain $a_{c m s}$ negative. This inversion is necessary to confer negative feedback in the CMFB loop because the CMC gain $a_{c m c}$ is positive at low frequencies in this two-stage op amp. We select $M_{25}$ to be matched to $M_{5}$, forming a unity-gain current mirror. Given the desired tail current of $\\left|I_{D 5}\\right|=200 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$, we aim for\n\n$$\n\\left|I_{D 25}\\right|=I_{D 26}=I_{D 27}=200 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}\n$$\n\nConsequently, each transistor $M_{21}-M_{24}$ is intended to carry $100 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$ of drain current. These transistors must remain active throughout the entire range of the op-amp output swing. For a differential output voltage of 1 V peak, each op-amp output $\\left(V_{o 1}\\right.$ or $\\left.V_{o 2}\\right)$ must swing $\\pm 0.5$ V. From (3.161), the transistors in a differential pair remain active as long as the magnitude of the differential input voltage is less than $\\sqrt{2} V_{o v}$. Therefore,"

Key distinctions from its single-ended equivalent in Figure 6.16 include the addition of transistors $M_{9}-M_{10}$, which mirror the common-source stage $M_{6}-M_{7}$ to produce a second output, and the elimination of the gate-to-drain connection on $M_{3}$ for symmetry in the input stage. This input stage mirrors the differential stage in Figure 12.2. The common-mode control (CMC) input is linked to the gate of the tail current source $M_{5}$. Adjusting the voltage at the gate of $M_{5}$ modifies the drain currents of $M_{1}-M_{4}$ uniformly. Consequently, $V_{d s 3}$ and $V_{d s 4}$ vary equally, and these changes are amplified by the common-source stages $M_{6}-M_{7}$ and $M_{9}-M_{10}$, leading to equivalent modifications in output voltages $V_{o 1}$ and $V_{o 2}$, and thus altering $V_{o c}$. Hence, the CM output voltage can be managed by a CMFB loop connected to the gate of $M_{5}$.\n\nIn Figure 12.23, two Miller compensation capacitors $C$ are installed across the balanced second stages, compensating for both the differential mode (DM) and common-mode (CM) circuits, as depicted in Figure 12.24.

The amplifier employs PMOS and NMOS transistors configured symmetrically for high gain and stability. The CM feedback loop is utilized to control the CM output voltage by connecting to the gate of M5.

Given that the gain magnitude multiplied by frequency remains constant from $\\left|p_{1 d}\\right|$ to $\\left|p_{2 d}\\right|$ due to the single-pole roll-off, we can write:\n\n$$\n\\left|a_{d m 0} f_{d m} p_{1 d}\\right|=1 \\cdot\\left|p_{2 d}\\right|\n$$\n\nSubstituting equations (12.72), (9.32), and (9.33) into the above yields:\n\n$$\n\\frac{g_{m 2}}{C} f_{d m} \\approx \\frac{g_{m 6}}{C_{2 d}}\n$$\n\nassuming that the DM load capacitance $C_{2 d}$ and the compensation capacitor $C$ are significantly larger than the internal node capacitance $C_{1 d}$. If other values are known, the compensation capacitor can be determined from this equation.\n\nThe CM half-circuit is shown in Figure 12.24b. Although the first stages of the CM and DM half-circuits differ, the second stages are identical. Focusing on the CMFB loop, we assume $v_{i c}=0$. In the CM half-circuit, the first stage includes a common-source $M_{5 h}$ with a common-gate $M_{2}$ and an active load $M_{4}$. Similar to Figure 12.14b, $M_{5 h}$ represents half of $M_{5}$, with $(W / L)_{5 h}=(W / L)_{5} / 2$ and $I_{D 5 h}=I_{D 5} / 2$. The first stage is followed by the common-source second stage, $M_{6}-M_{7}$. The low-frequency CMC gain is given by:\n\n$$\na_{c m c 0}=\\frac{v_{o c}}{v_{c m c}} \\approx g_{m 5 h}\\left[\\left(r_{o 2} g_{m 2} r_{o 5 h}\\right) \\| r_{o 4}\\right] g_{m 6}\\left(r_{o 6} \\| r_{o 7}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe capacitance associated with the source of cascode $M_{1}$ introduces a pole $p_{x}$ in the CMC gain. If $\\left|p_{x}\\right|$ is much greater than the magnitude of the nondominant pole $\\left|p_{2 c}\\right|$ from the Miller-compensated second stage, pole $p_{x}$ can be disregarded, and the gain $a_{c m c}$ can be approximated as having two poles given by equations (9.32) and (9.33). These poles can differ from those in the DM gain due to variations in output load capacitances and output resistances of the first stages in the half-circuits. The zero due to feedforward is identical to that for the DM gain and can be eliminated as described in Chapter 9. To simplify the analysis, we assume that all poles and zeros in the CMFB loop other than those associated with Miller compensation can be ignored. To achieve a $45^{\\circ}$ phase margin, the CMFB loop gain magnitude should fall to unity at $\\left|p_{2 c}\\right|$. Therefore:\n\n$$\n\\left|a_{c m c 0} a_{c m s} 0 p_{1 c}\\right|=1 \\cdot\\left|p_{2 c}\\right|\n$$\n\nwhere $a_{c m s 0}$ is the low-frequency gain through the CM-sense circuit:\n\n$$\na_{c m s 0}=\\left.\\frac{v_{c m c}}{v_{o c}}\\right|_{\\omega=0, \\text { CMFB loop open }}=\\left.\\frac{v_{c m s}}{v_{o c}}\\right|_{\\omega=0, \\text { CMFB loop open }}\n$$\n\nSubstituting equations (12.75), (9.32), and (9.33) into the previous equation and using $R_{1} \\approx r_{o 2} g_{m 2} r_{o 5 h}$ results in:\n\n$$\n\\frac{g_{m 5 h}}{C}\\left|a_{c m s}\\right| \\approx \\frac{g_{m 6}}{C_{2 c}}\n$$\n\nassuming that the CM load capacitance $C_{2 c}$ and the compensation capacitor $C$ are much larger than the internal node capacitance $C_{1 c}$. The compensation capacitor required for the CMFB loop can be derived from this equation.\n\nIdeally, the compensation capacitor values calculated from equations (12.74) and (12.78) would be equal, providing both the CMFB and DM loops with a phase margin of $45^{\\circ}$. However, in practice, these values seldom match. If the larger $C$ value is chosen to optimally compensate the CMFB loop, it will overcompensate the DM loop. A disadvantage of overcompensation is that the unity-gain frequency of the loop gain and the closed-loop bandwidth are reduced compared to optimal compensation. If the larger $C$ is necessary for the DM feedback loop, using it will overcompensate the CMFB loop. Since the CMFB ideally operates on DC signals only, decreasing its bandwidth may be tolerable. If the larger $C$ is required for the CMFB feedback loop, using it will overcompensate the DM loop. Nevertheless, reducing the bandwidth of the DM feedback loop through overcompensation is typically undesirable because this loop processes the DM input signal, which may have a wide bandwidth.\n\nAn alternative to using the larger $C$ value that optimally compensates the CMFB loop but overcompensates the DM loop involves using the $C$ value that yields a $45^{\\circ}$ phase margin in the DM loop from equation (12.74) if $g_{m 5 h}$ is scaled down to satisfy equation (12.78). This method achieves a $45^{\\circ}$ phase margin for both feedback loops without compromising the DM loop bandwidth. Scaling of $g_{m 5 h}=g_{m 5} / 2$ could be accomplished by reducing $(W / L)_{5}$, but this would decrease the CM input range of the op amp because decreasing $(W / L)_{5}$ increases $\\left|V_{o v 5}\\right|$. Another solution is to split $M_{5}$ into two parallel transistors, one with its gate connected to a bias voltage and the other with its gate connected to CMC, as described in Section 12.4.2 and Figure 12.15. A drawback of this approach is that reducing $g_{m 5 h}$ decreases $\\left|a_{c m c 0}\\right|$, as evident in equation (12.75).\n\nDisregarding limitations imposed by the CM-sense circuit, the op-amp outputs in Figure 12.23 can swing until a transistor in the second stage enters the triode region. The maximum value of $V_{o 1}$ is $V_{D D}-\\left|V_{o v 7}\\right|$, and its minimum value is $-V_{S S}+V_{o v 6}$. Therefore, the peak differential output voltage is:\n\n$$\nV_{o d(\\text { peak })} =V_{o 1(\\max )}-V_{o 2(\\min )}=V_{o 1(\\max )}-V_{o 1(\\min )}=V_{D D}-\\left|V_{o v 7}\\right|-\\left(-V_{S S}+V_{o v 6}\\right)=V_{D D}+V_{S S}-V_{o v 6}-\\left|V_{o v 7}\\right|\n$$\n\nThe CM input range of the op amp is constrained in the positive direction by the tail current source, which transitions from active to triode when $\\left|V_{d s}\\right|=\\left|V_{o v 5}\\right|$; hence:\n\n$$\nV_{I C}<V_{D D}-\\left|V_{G S 1}\\right|-\\left|V_{o v 5}\\right|\n$$\n\nThe lower limit of the CM input range occurs when the input transistor $M_{1}$ (or $M_{2}$) enters the triode region, so:\n\n$$\nV_{I C}>-V_{S S}+V_{G S 6}+V_{t 1}\n$$\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nModify the single-ended two-stage op amp from the examples in Sections 6.3.5 and 9.4.3 into a fully differential op amp. It will be employed in the feedback circuit depicted in Figure 12.25, which illustrates the connections in a switched-capacitor circuit when one clock is high (assuming ideal switches). The capacitor values are $C_{S}=2 \\mathrm{pF}, C_{F}=5 \\mathrm{pF}$, and $C_{L}=2 \\mathrm{pF}$. Design for a 1-V peak output swing and phase margins of $45^{\\circ}$ or more in both the DM and CMFB loops. Use $V_{D D}=V_{S S}=1.65 \\mathrm{~V}$, and aim for a CM output voltage of 0 V.\n\nInitially, design the devices to meet the bias and low-frequency requirements. Then, proceed to compensate the amplifier. Utilizing the device sizes and bias currents from the example in Section 6.3.5, we have:\n\n$$\n(W / L)_{1}=(W / L)_{2}=77, (W / L)_{3}=(W / L)_{4}=4, (W / L)_{5}=25, (W / L)_{6}=(W / L)_{9}=16, (W / L)_{7}=(W / L)_{10}=50\n$$\n\nwith $L_{\\mathrm{drwn}}=1 \\mu \\mathrm{~m},\\left|I_{D 1}\\right|=\\left|I_{D 2}\\right|=100 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$, and $I_{D 6}=400 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$. In that example, these values yielded a calculated DC gain of $a_{d m 0}=-7500$ and a simulated gain of $a_{d m 0}=-6200$.\n\nFor CMFB, we will employ two differential pairs as shown in Figure 12.26. Since the input stage in Figure 12.23 is complementary to the op amp in Figure 12.2, the CMFB circuit in Figure 12.26 is the complement of the circuit in Figure 12.19, allowing control of the op-amp tail current $I_{D 5}$ through a current mirror formed by $M_{5}$ and $M_{25}$. Additionally, the CM-sense output $V_{c m s}$ is taken from the drains of $M_{21}$ and $M_{24}$, making the gain $a_{c m s}$ negative. This inversion is necessary to provide negative feedback in the CMFB loop, as the CMC gain $a_{c m c}$ is positive at low frequencies in this two-stage op amp. We select $M_{25}$ to be matched to $M_{5}$, forming a unity-gain current mirror. Since the desired tail current is $\\left|I_{D 5}\\right|=200 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$, we aim for:\n\n$$\n\\left|I_{D 25}\\right|=I_{D 26}=I_{D 27}=200 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}\n$$\n\nConsequently, each transistor $M_{21}-M_{24}$ carries a nominal $100 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$ of drain current. These transistors must remain active across the entire range of the op-amp output swing. For a differential output voltage of 1 V peak, each op-amp output ($V_{o 1}$ or $V_{o 2}$) must swing $\\pm 0.5$ V. From equation (3.161), the transistors in a differential pair stay active as long as the differential input voltage magnitude is less than $\\sqrt{2} V_{o v}$. Therefore, we target:\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{2} V_{o v}=0.5 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nor $V_{o v}=0.35 \\mathrm{~V}$ for $M_{21}-M_{24}$. From equation (1.157), we obtain:\n\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)_{21}=\\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)_{22}=\\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)_{23}=\\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)_{24}=\\frac{2 I_{D 21}}{k_{n}^{\\prime}\\left(V_{o v 21}\\right)^{2}}=\\frac{2(100)}{(194)(0.35)^{2}}=8.4\n$$\n\nThe remaining device sizes to be determined are for matched transistors $M_{26}$ and $M_{27}$. Each device acts as a current source carrying $200 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$. For these transistors to function as current sources, they should always remain active. Focusing on $M_{26}$, we aim for $V_{o v 26}<V_{d s 26(\\mathrm{~min})}$. To determine $V_{d s 26(\\min )}$, consider an extreme case where $M_{21}$ just turns off as $V_{o 1}$ swings down to its lowest value. In this scenario, $M_{22}$ carries $200 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$, and:\n\n$$\nV_{g s 22(\\max )}=V_{t 22}+\\sqrt{\\frac{2 I_{D 22(\\max )}}{k_{n}^{\\prime}(W / L)_{22}}}=V_{t 22}+\\sqrt{\\frac{2(200)}{194(8.4)}}=V_{t 22}+0.5 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nThe gate voltage of $M_{22}$ is $V_{C M}=0$. Therefore, the minimum source-body voltage for $M_{22}$, which is the minimum drain-source voltage of $M_{26}$, is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV"

In contrast to the single-ended version depicted in Figure 6.16, this design features the addition of $M_{9}-M_{10}$, which mirrors the common-source stage $M_{6}-M_{7}$ to produce a second output. Additionally, the gate-to-drain connection on $M_{3}$ has been removed to achieve a symmetrical input stage. This input stage is the complementary counterpart of the differential stage shown in Figure 12.2. The common-mode control (CMC) input is linked to the gate of the tail current source transistor $M_{5}$.

    "text": "The rephrased text is as follows:\n\nIn Figure 12.23, a two-stage fully differential operational amplifier is depicted. Notably, it differs from the single-ended version in Figure 6.16 by incorporating $M_{9}-M_{10}$, a mirrored common-source stage akin to $M_{6}-M_{7}$ for a secondary output, and eliminating the gate-to-drain connection on $M_{3}$ for a balanced input stage. The input stage mirrors the differential stage in Figure 12.2. The common-mode control input acts on the gate of the tail current source transistor, $M_{5}$. Any fluctuation at the gate of $M_{5}$ triggers a proportional adjustment in the drain currents of $M_{1}-M_{4}$, leading to commensurate changes in $V_{d s 3}$ and $V_{d s 4}$. These modifications are then amplified by the common-source stages $M_{6}-M_{7}$ and $M_{9}-M_{10}$, resulting in matched alterations to the output voltages $V_{o 1}$ and $V_{o 2}$, which in turn modifies $V_{o c}$. Consequently, the common-mode output voltage can be manipulated by a CMFB loop linked to the gate of $M_{5}$.\n\nFigure 12.23 also showcases two Miller compensation capacitors, $C$, straddling the balanced second stages. These capacitors serve to stabilize both the differential mode (DM) and common-mode (CM) circuits, as detailed in Figure 12.24. Techniques from Chapter 9 to obviate the right-half-plane zero caused by feedforward through the compensation capacitors can be applied here, although not explicitly illustrated.\n\nIn Figure 12.24a, the DM half-circuit is configured as a tandem of two common-source amplifiers with active loads, providing a low-frequency DM gain. The Miller-compensated second stage can be emulated by the circuit in Figure 9.21 with specific resistor and capacitor values. Assuming the operational amplifier is part of a feedback loop with a frequency-independent feedback factor and the right-half-plane zero has been nullified, the DM loop gain should equal unity at the frequency corresponding to the second pole to ensure a $45^{\\circ}$ phase margin.\n\nThe CM half-circuit in Figure 12.24b features a common-source stage with a common-gate and active load configuration, followed by a common-source second stage. The low-frequency CMC gain is expressed as a function of the transconductances and output resistances of the involved transistors. To ignore the pole introduced by the capacitance at the source of the cascode transistor $M_{1}$, it should be much larger than the nondominant pole from the Miller-compensated second stage. For a $45^{\\circ}$ phase margin in the CMFB loop, the loop gain magnitude must be unity at the frequency of the second pole.\n\nIn designing a fully differential op amp for use in switched-capacitor circuits, as shown in Figure 12.25, one must first meet the bias and low-frequency requirements before addressing compensation. The CMFB circuit, as shown in Figure 12.26, employs two differential pairs to control the op-amp tail current through a current mirror.\n\nThe example continues with detailed calculations and design considerations for the compensation capacitors, device sizes, and bias currents to achieve the desired phase margins and output swing. SPICE simulations are conducted to validate the design choices and ensure stability in both the DM and CMFB loops. The discussion concludes with alternative CMFB approaches and considerations for increasing the output swing of the op amp."

    "text": "Figure 12.23 depicts a fully differential two-stage operational amplifier (op amp), which differs from its single-ended counterpart in Figure 6.16 in two key aspects. Firstly, it includes the addition of transistors $M_{9}-M_{10}$, which mirror the common-source stage $M_{6}-M_{7}$ to produce a second output. Secondly, the gate-to-drain connection on transistor $M_{3}$ is omitted to create a symmetric input stage. This input stage is the complementary version of the differential stage depicted in Figure 12.2. The common-mode control (CMC) input is the gate of the tail current source transistor $M_{5}$. Any change in the voltage at this gate alters the drain currents of transistors $M_{1}-M_{4}$ equally. Consequently, the drain-to-source voltages of $M_{3}$ and $M_{4}$ change uniformly. These voltage alterations are amplified by the common-source stages $M_{6}-M_{7}$ and $M_{9}-M_{10}$, leading to proportional changes in the output voltages $V_{o1}$ and $V_{o2}$, thereby modifying $V_{oc}$. Thus, the common-mode output voltage can be regulated by a common-mode feedback (CMFB) loop connected to the gate of $M_{5}$.\n\nIn Figure 12.23, two Miller compensation capacitors, labeled as $C$, are installed across the symmetrical second stages to compensate for both the differential mode (DM) and common-mode (CM) circuits, as shown in Figure 12.24.
