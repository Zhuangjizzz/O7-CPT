Identification of Components and Structure: Silicon Substrate: The base material upon which other layers are deposited. Silicon Dioxide (SiO2) Layer: A thin oxide layer initially grown on the silicon substrate. Silicon Nitride (SiN) Layer: A deposited layer acting as an oxidation barrier. Connections and Interactions: The silicon nitride layer covers the silicon dioxide, preventing oxygen from reaching the silicon surface in areas where the nitride is present. This selective masking allows for controlled oxidation only in areas where the nitride has been removed. Labels, Annotations, and Key Features: The diagram likely includes annotations indicating which areas will undergo oxidation and which will remain protected by the nitride layer. These annotations help in understanding the selective oxidation process and its impact on the substrate's surface topology. Function: To illustrate the role of silicon nitride as a mask in the local oxidation process to control oxidation areas."

The diagram illustrates the cross-sectional view of the silicon substrate after the removal of silicon nitride and the growth of thick oxide in the exposed regions. Identification of Components and Structure: The base layer is the silicon substrate. There are regions with thick silicon dioxide (SiO2) and thin silicon dioxide. The thick oxide regions are where the silicon nitride was removed before oxidation. The thin oxide regions were covered by silicon nitride during oxidation.

For instance, if the circuit is to operate at a power-supply voltage of 36 V, the devices generally need to have breakdown voltages above this value. The collector-base plane breakdown voltage must be several times the power-supply voltage due to the effects of collector avalanche multiplication. Therefore, for a breakdown voltage of 36 V, a collector-base plane breakdown voltage of approximately 90 V is required, which implies an impurity concentration in the collector of about 10^15 atoms/cm^3 and a resistivity of 5 Ohm-cm. The thickness of the epitaxial layer must be large enough to accommodate the depletion layer associated with the collector-base junction."

Considering the effects of collector avalanche multiplication, if a breakdown voltage of 36 V is required for the transistor, the collector-base plane breakdown voltage must be approximately 90 V. This implies that the impurity concentration in the collector should be about $10^{15}$ atoms/cm³ and the resistivity around $5 \\Omega-\\mathrm{cm}$. Using the principles from Chapter 1, the depletion layer thickness at 36 V is calculated to be approximately 6 µm. Given that the buried layer diffuses outward by about 8 µm during processing and the base diffusion will be around 3 µm deep, an epitaxial layer thickness of 17 µm is necessary for a 36-V circuit."

            "value": "Estimate the collector resistance of the transistor of Fig. 2.25, assuming the doping profile of Fig. 2.17. We first calculate the rc1 component. The thickness of the lightly doped epi layer between the collector-base junction and the buried layer is 6 µm. Assuming that the collector-base junction is at zero bias, the results of Chapter 1 can be used to show that the depletion layer is about 1 µm thick. Thus the undepleted epi material under the base is 5 µm thick. The effective cross-sectional area of the resistance rc1 is larger at the buried layer than at the collector-base junction. The emitter dimensions are 20 µm × 25 µm, while the buried layer dimensions are 41 µm × 85 µm on the mask. Since the buried layer side-diffuses a distance roughly equal to the distance that it out-diffuses, about 8 µm must be added on each edge, giving an effective size of 57 µm × 101 µm. An exact calculation of the ohmic resistance of this three-dimensional region would require a solution of Laplace's equation in the region, with a rather complex set of boundary conditions. Consequently, we will carry out an approximate analysis by modeling the region as a rectangular parallelepiped, as shown in Fig. 2.28b. Under the assumptions that the top and bottom surfaces of the region are equipotential surfaces, and that the current flow in the region takes place only in the vertical direction, the resistance of the structure can be shown to be R = (ρ * T / W * L) * ln(a/b) / (a - b), where ρ is the resistivity, T is the thickness, W and L are the width and length, and a and b are the aspect ratios. Direct application of this expression to the case at hand would give an unrealistically low value of resistance, because the assumption of one-dimensional flow is seriously violated when the dimensions of the lower rectangle are much larger than those of the top rectangle. Equation 2.18 gives realistic results when the sides of the region form an angle of about 60° or less with the vertical. When the angle of the sides is increased beyond this point, the resistance does not decrease very much because of the long path for current flow between the top electrode and the remote regions of the bottom electrode. Thus the limits of the bottom electrode should be determined either by the edges of the buried layer or by the edges of the emitter plus a distance equal to about twice the vertical thickness T of the region, whichever is smaller. For the case of rc1, T = 5 µm, ρ = 5 Ω-cm. We assume that the effective emitter dimensions are those defined by the mask plus approximately 2 µm of side diffusion on each edge. Thus W = 24 µm and L = 29 µm. For this case, the buried-layer edges are further away from the emitter edge than twice the thickness T on all four sides when side diffusion is taken into account. Thus the effective buried-layer dimensions that we use in (2.18) are W_BL = 44 µm and L_BL = 49 µm. And a = 1.83, b = 1.69. Thus from (2.18), rc1 = 204 Ω. We will now calculate rc2, assuming a buried-layer sheet resistance of 20 Ω/□. The distance from the center of the emitter to the center of the collector-contact diffusion is 62 µm, and the width of the buried layer is 41 µm. The rc2 component is thus, approximately, rc2 = (20 Ω/□) * (L / W) = 30 Ω. Here the buried-layer side diffusion was not taken into account because the ohmic resistance of the buried layer is determined entirely by the number of impurity atoms actually diffused into the silicon, which is determined by the mask dimensions and the sheet resistance of the buried layer. For the calculation of rc3, the dimensions of the collector-contact n+ diffusion are 18 µm × 49 µm, including side diffusion. The distance from the buried layer to the bottom of the n+ diffusion is seen in Fig. 2.17 to be 6.5 µm, and thus T = 6.5 µm in this case. On the three sides of the collector n+ diffusion that do not face the base region, the out-diffused buried layer extends only 4 µm outside the n+ diffusion, and thus the effective dimension of the buried layer is determined by the actual buried-layer edge on these sides. On the side facing the base region, the effective edge of the buried layer is a distance 2T, or 13 µm, away from the edge of the n+ diffusion. The effective buried-layer dimensions for the calculation of rc3 are thus 35 µm × 57 µm. Using (2.18), rc3 = 243 Ω. The total collector resistance is thus rc = rc1 + rc2 + rc3 = 531 Ω. The value actually observed in such devices is somewhat lower than this for three reasons. First, we have approximated the flow as one-dimensional, and it is actually three-dimensional. Second, for larger collector-base voltages, the collector-base depletion layer extends further into the epi, decreasing rc1. Third, the value of rc that is important is often that for a saturated device. In saturation, holes are injected into the epi region under the emitter by the forward-biased, collector-base junction, and they modulate the conductivity of the region even at moderate current levels. Thus the collector resistance one measures when the device is in saturation is closer to (rc2 + rc3), or about 250 to 300 Ω. Thus rc is smaller in saturation than in the forward-active region."

In a lateral pnp transistor, the emitter and collector are formed with the same diffusion that forms the base of the npn transistors. The collector is a p-type ring around the emitter, and the base contact is made in the n-type epitaxial material outside the collector ring. The flow of minority carriers across the base is lateral, meaning that holes are injected from the emitter, flow parallel to the surface across the n-type base region, and are ideally collected by the p-type collector before reaching the base contact. In contrast, npn transistors have a vertical structure where the emitter, base, and collector are stacked on top of each other. The current flow in an npn transistor is vertical, with electrons flowing from the emitter to the collector through the base."

In a typical analog IC process, the width of this depletion layer is 6 μm to 8 μm when the collector-emitter voltage is in the 40-V range. Thus, the minimum base width for such a device is about 8 μm, and the minimum base transit time can be estimated from the formula τ_F = (W_B^2) / (2 D_p), where τ_F is the base transit time, W_B is the base width, and D_p is the diffusion coefficient for holes in the base region."

First, there is a decrease in the effective lifetime of minority carriers in the base since there is an increased number of majority carriers with which recombination can occur. This decreases the base transport factor. Second, the increase in the majority-carrier density represents an effective increase in base doping density, which causes a decrease in emitter injection efficiency.

Function: The graph is a current-voltage (I-V) characteristic curve, which is commonly used to illustrate the behavior of diodes. The horizontal axis is labeled 'V' for voltage, measured in volts (V). The vertical axis is labeled 'I' for current, measured in amperes (A). The scales on both axes appear to be linear. The graph shows a sharp increase in current after a certain threshold voltage is reached, indicating the Zener breakdown region. Initially, as the voltage increases, the current remains nearly zero, showing that the diode is in its non-conducting state. At approximately 6.2 V, the current begins to rise steeply, indicating the onset of Zener breakdown where the diode starts to conduct significantly. The breakdown voltage is clearly marked at 6.2 V, which is a critical value for the operation of the Zener diode. This point signifies the transition from the non-conducting state to the conducting state due to the Zener effect. The steep slope beyond 6.2 V indicates a low dynamic resistance, typical of Zener diodes in breakdown. The graph does not have additional annotations or markers beyond the labeled breakdown voltage.
