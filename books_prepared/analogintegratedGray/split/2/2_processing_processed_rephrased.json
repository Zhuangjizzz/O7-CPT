    "text": "Introducing small amounts of $n$-type or $p$-type impurities into a crystalline silicon sample boosts the number of majority carriers (electrons for $n$-type, holes for $p$-type) while reducing the number of minority carriers. This process of adding impurities is known as doping. For typical impurity levels, the majority carrier density closely matches the density of impurity atoms in the crystal. Thus, for $n$-type material,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nn_{n} \\approx N_{D} \\tag{2.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $n_{n}\\left(\\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}\\right)$ is the equilibrium electron concentration and $N_{D}\\left(\\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}\\right)$ is the $n$-type donor impurity concentration.

An increase in the equilibrium concentration of one carrier type inevitably leads to a decrease in the other, as holes and electrons recombine at a rate proportional to their concentrations. The recombination rate, $R$, is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR=\\gamma n p \\tag{2.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\gamma$ is a constant, and $n$ and $p$ are the electron and hole concentrations, respectively. The generation of hole-electron pairs is a thermal process dependent solely on temperature, with the generation rate, $G$, unaffected by impurity concentration.

For practical impurity levels, majority carriers far outnumber minority carriers.\n\nThe significance of minority- and majority-carrier concentrations in transistor operation was discussed in Chapter 1. Another crucial effect of impurity addition is an increase in the material's ohmic conductivity, given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\sigma=q\\left(\\mu_{n} n+\\mu_{p} p\\right) \\tag{2.7}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mu_{n}\\left(\\mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \\mathrm{V}-\\mathrm{s}\\right)$ is electron mobility, $\\mu_{p}\\left(\\mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \\mathrm{V}-\\mathrm{s}\\right)$ is hole mobility, and $\\sigma$ $(\\Omega-\\mathrm{cm})^{-1}$ is electrical conductivity.

Conductivity and resistivity are related by $\\rho=1 / \\sigma$.\n\n**Figure 2.1: Hole and Electron Mobility as a Function of Doping in Silicon**\nThe graph illustrates the relationship between the mobility of charge carriers (holes and electrons) in silicon and the total impurity concentration. The x-axis, scaled logarithmically, ranges from 10¹⁴ to 10²¹ cm⁻³, representing the total impurity concentration. The y-axis, also logarithmic, ranges from 10 to 10³ cm²/V-s, depicting the mobility (μ) of the charge carriers.\n\nTwo curves are presented: one for electrons and one for holes, both showing a downward trend, indicating reduced mobility with increasing impurity concentration. Electron mobility starts around 1400 cm²/V-s at lower concentrations (10¹⁴ cm⁻³) and drops to about 100 cm²/V-s at higher concentrations (10²¹ cm⁻³).

Thus, (2.10) can be applied to diffused layers if the appropriate $R_{\\square}$ value is used. Equation 2.15 indicates that the sheet resistance of the diffused layer depends on the total number of impurity atoms per unit area in the layer. The depth $x_{j}$ in (2.13), (2.14), and (2.15) is actually the distance from the surface to the edge of the junction depletion layer, as donor atoms within the depletion layer do not contribute to conduction. Sheet resistance is a valuable parameter for characterizing diffusion processes electrically and is crucial in designing integrated resistors. The sheet resistance of a diffused layer can be easily measured in a laboratory, making the actual evaluation of (2.15) rarely necessary.\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nCalculate the resistance of a layer with a length of $50 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ and a width of $5 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ in a material with a sheet resistance of $200 \\Omega / \\square$.\n\nFrom (2.10):\n\n$$\nR=\\frac{50}{5} \\times 200 \\Omega=2 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega\n$$\n\nNote that this region consists of 10 squares in series, so $R$ is 10 times the sheet resistance.\n\nTo utilize these diffusion process steps for fabricating useful devices, the diffusion must be confined to a small region on the sample's surface rather than the entire planar surface.

Thus, (2.10) can be applied to diffused layers if the appropriate $R_{\\square}$ value is used. Equation 2.15 indicates that the sheet resistance of the diffused layer depends on the total number of impurity atoms per unit area in the layer. The depth $x_{j}$ in (2.13), (2.14), and (2.15) is actually the distance from the surface to the edge of the junction depletion layer, as donor atoms within the depletion layer do not contribute to conduction. Sheet resistance is a valuable parameter for electrical characterization of diffusion processes and is crucial in designing integrated resistors. The sheet resistance of a diffused layer is easily measurable in a laboratory; however, the actual evaluation of (2.15) is rarely necessary.\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nCalculate the resistance of a layer with a length of $50 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ and a width of $5 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ in a material with a sheet resistance of $200 \\Omega / \\square$.\n\nFrom (2.10):\n\n$$\nR=\\frac{50}{5} \\times 200 \\Omega=2 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega\n$$\n\nNote that this region comprises 10 squares in series, making $R$ ten times the sheet resistance.\n\nTo fabricate useful devices using these diffusion process steps, the diffusion must be confined to a small region on the sample's surface rather than the entire planar surface. This confinement is achieved through photolithography."

Typically, the thin oxide areas are the active-device regions, while the thick oxide areas serve to electrically isolate the devices from one another. A key requirement is that the transition from thick to thin oxide must be smooth, avoiding significant vertical steps in the silicon surface, to ensure that subsequent metallization and patterns can be deposited on a relatively flat surface. This is achieved through local oxidation. The process starts with a silicon sample that already has a thin oxide layer, as depicted in Fig. 2.9a. Initially, a silicon nitride (SiN) layer is deposited on the sample and then selectively removed using a masking step from areas where thick oxide is to be grown, as shown in Fig. 2.9b.

The final geometry, after removing the nitride, is shown in Fig. 2.9c. This figure highlights the smooth transition of the silicon dioxide surface from thick to thin areas, with the transition height being less than the oxide thickness difference due to the consumption of underlying silicon during oxidation in the thick oxide regions."

Initially, a silicon nitride (SiN) layer is deposited on the sample and then selectively removed using a masking step from areas where thick oxide is to be grown, as shown in Fig. 2.9b. Silicon nitride serves as a barrier to oxygen.\n\n**Fig. 2.9a Description:**\nFig. 2.9a presents the initial stage of the local oxidation process on a silicon wafer.

The cross-sectional view highlights the interface between the silicon and the thin oxide layer, which appears as a uniform, continuous layer atop the substrate. This stage represents the baseline before additional deposition or patterning, with no other components or structures visible.\n\n**Fig. 2.9b Description:**\nThe image labeled \"Fig. 2.9b\" illustrates a stage in the local oxidation process for semiconductor fabrication.

    "text": "The evolution of integrated-circuit (IC) fabrication has seen significant transformations since the advent of the fundamental planar process. These advancements have been propelled by progress in photolithography and processing methods, as well as the prevalent trend towards lowering power-supply voltages in numerous systems. Innovations in photolithography have enabled the reduction of the smallest achievable feature size from tens of microns down to the submicron scale. The precision afforded by ion implantation has made this technique the prevailing method for predepositing impurity atoms. Moreover, many circuits now operate with 3 V or 5 V power supplies, in contrast to the earlier $\\pm 15 \\mathrm{~V}$ supplies that were used to achieve a high dynamic range in standalone ICs, such as operational amplifiers. Lowering the operating voltages permits tighter spacing between devices within an IC and allows for shallower structures with enhanced frequency capabilities. These benefits arise from the reduction in the thickness of junction depletion layers that accompanies lower operating voltages, as explained in Chapter 1. Consequently, the most advanced IC processes for the highest frequencies are designed to operate with $5-\\mathrm{V}$ supplies or less and are typically not functional at higher supply voltages. Indeed, there is an inherent trade-off between a process's frequency capability and its breakdown voltage.\n\nIn this section, we will delve into the sequence of steps involved in fabricating high-voltage bipolar ICs using junction isolation. This method represents the original IC process and remains relevant for illustrating the foundational techniques of IC fabrication. It continues to be employed in various forms for the production of high-voltage circuits.\n\nFabricating a junction-isolated bipolar IC entails a series of six to eight masking and diffusion steps. The process begins with a wafer of $p$-type silicon, usually $250 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ thick and having an impurity concentration of about $10^{16}$ atoms $/ \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$. We will focus on the diffusion steps required to form an $n p n$ IC transistor. The initial mask and diffusion step, depicted in Fig. 2.10, creates a low-resistance n-type layer that will eventually serve as a low-resistance path for the collector current of the transistor. This step is known as the buried-layer diffusion, and the resulting layer is termed the buried layer. The sheet resistance of this layer typically ranges from 20 to $50 \\Omega / \\square$, and the impurity used is usually arsenic or antimony, chosen for their slow diffusion rate, which minimizes redistribution during subsequent processing.\n\nFollowing the buried-layer step, the wafer is stripped of oxide, and an epitaxial layer is grown, as shown in Fig. 2.11. The thickness and $n$-type impurity concentration of this layer determine the collector-base breakdown voltage of the transistors in the circuit, as this material constitutes the collector region of the transistor. For instance, if the circuit is intended to operate at a power-supply voltage of 36 V, the devices must have $B V_{C E O}$ breakdown voltages exceeding this value. As discussed in Chapter 1, this necessitates a collector-base plane breakdown voltage several times this value due to the effects of collector avalanche multiplication. For a $B V_{C E O}$ of 36 V, a collector-base plane breakdown voltage of approximately 90 V is required, implying an impurity concentration in the collector of around $10^{15}$ atoms $/ \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and a resistivity of $5 \\Omega-\\mathrm{cm}$. Consequently, the epitaxial layer's thickness must be sufficient to accommodate the depletion layer associated with the collector-base junction. At 36 V, the findings of Chapter 1 indicate that the depletion-layer thickness is approximately $6 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$. Considering that the buried layer diffuses outward about $8 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ during subsequent processing and the base diffusion will be about $3 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ deep, an epitaxial layer thickness of $17 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ is necessary for a $36-\\mathrm{V}$ circuit. For circuits with lower operating voltages, thinner and more heavily doped epitaxial layers are utilized to decrease the transistor collector series resistance, as will be demonstrated later.\n\nAfter epitaxial growth, an oxide layer is formed on the epitaxial layer's surface. A mask step and boron ($p$-type) predeposition and diffusion are then performed, resulting in the structure shown in Fig. 2.12. This diffusion step serves to isolate the collectors of the transistors from one another using reverse-biased pn junctions, and it is referred to as the isolation diffusion. Due to the depth to which the diffusion must penetrate, this step requires several hours in a diffusion furnace at temperatures of roughly $1200^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. The isolated diffused layer exhibits a sheet resistance between $20 \\Omega / \\square$ and $40 \\Omega / \\square$.\n\nSubsequent steps involve the base mask, base predeposition, and base diffusion, as depicted in Fig. 2.13. The base diffusion, typically a boron diffusion, yields a layer with a sheet resistance ranging from $100 \\Omega / \\square$ to $300 \\Omega / \\square$ and a depth of $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ to $3 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ by the end of the process. This diffusion not only forms the bases of the transistors but also constitutes many of the resistors in the circuit, making precise control of the sheet resistance crucial.\n\nAfter the base diffusion, the transistors' emitters are formed through a mask step, $n$-type predeposition, and diffusion, as shown in Fig. 2.14. The resulting sheet resistance lies between $2 \\Omega / \\square$ and $10 \\Omega / \\square$, and the depth is $0.5 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ to $2.5 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ post-diffusion. This diffusion step also establishes a low-resistance region that acts as the contact to the collector region, which is necessary because achieving ohmic contact between aluminum metallization and the high-resistivity epitaxial material directly is challenging. The subsequent masking step, known as the contact mask, is used to create openings in the oxide above the emitter, base, and collector of the transistors to facilitate electrical connections. Contact windows are also opened for the passive components on the chip. The entire wafer is then coated with a thin (approximately $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$) layer of aluminum that will interconnect the circuit elements. The actual interconnect pattern is defined by the final mask step, where aluminum is etched away in areas where the photoresist is removed during the develop step. The resulting structure is shown in Fig. 2.15. A microscope photograph of an actual structure of the same type is presented in Fig. 2.16. The terraced effect on the device's surface is due to the additional oxide growth during each diffusion cycle, resulting in the thickest oxide layer over the epitaxial region, where no oxide has been removed, a thinner layer over the base and isolation regions, which are both exposed at the base mask step, and the thinnest layer over the emitter diffusion. A typical diffusion profile for a high-voltage, deep-diffused analog IC is shown in Fig. 2.17.\n\nThis sequence of steps enables the concurrent fabrication of a large number (often thousands) of complex circuits on a single wafer. The wafer is then subjected to an automatic tester, which verifies the electrical characteristics of each circuit on the wafer and marks circuits that fail to meet specifications with an ink dot. The wafer is subsequently divided into individual circuits through sawing or scribing and breaking. The resulting silicon chips are known as dice, with the singular form being die. Each functional die is then mounted in a package, ready for final testing."

These outcomes are attributed to the reduction of junction depletion layer thickness resulting from the decrease in operating voltages, as elaborated in Chapter 1. Consequently, the most advanced IC production processes are designed to operate on 5 V or less power supplies and are generally unsuitable for higher supply voltages. In reality, a fundamental compromise exists between a process's frequency capability and its breakdown voltage.\n\nWithin this section, we initially analyze the sequence of steps involved in producing high-voltage bipolar integrated circuits using junction isolation. This process marked the birth of the initial integrated circuit production technique. It serves as an educational tool to demonstrate the rudimentary approaches to IC fabrication and remains in use today in various iterations to manufacture high-voltage circuits.\n\nThe production of a junction-isolated bipolar integrated circuit encompasses a series of six to eight masking and diffusion steps. The starting material is a p-type silicon wafer, typically measuring 250 micrometers in thickness and with an impurity concentration of about $10^{16}$ atoms $\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. We will discuss the series of diffusion steps needed to establish an npn integrated-circuit transistor. The initial mask and diffusion step, depicted in Figure 2.10, generates a low-resistance n-type layer destined to become a collector current conduit for the transistor. This step is termed buried-layer diffusion, and the layer itself is referred to as the buried layer. The sheet resistance of this layer is in the range of 20 to 50 $\\Omega / \\square$, with arsenic or antimony typically used as impurities due to their slow diffusion rates and resultant minor redistribution during subsequent processing.\n\nFollowing the buried-layer step, the wafer is stripped of all oxide layers and an epitaxial layer is grown, as illustrated in Figure 2.11. The thickness of the layer and its n-type impurity concentration determine the collector-base breakdown voltage of the transistors in the circuit, as this material constitutes the collector region of the transistor. For instance, if the circuit is designed to operate at a 36 V power supply, the devices usually require collector-base breakdown voltages exceeding this value. As detailed in Chapter 1, this implies that the plane breakdown voltage in the collector-base junction must be several multiples of this value due to the effects of collector avalanche multiplication. For a BV$_{C E O}$ of 36 V, a collector-base plane breakdown voltage of roughly 90 V is needed, implying an impurity concentration in the collector of approximately $10^{15}$ atoms $\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ and a resistivity of 5 $\\Omega-\\mathrm{cm}$. The epitaxial layer must be thick enough to accommodate the depletion layer associated with the collector-base junction. At 36 V, the findings from Chapter 1 can be utilized to demonstrate that the depletion layer thickness is approximately 6 µm. Since the buried layer diffuses outward about 8 µm during subsequent processing, and the base diffusion will be approximately 3 µm deep, an epitaxial layer thickness of 17 µm is necessary for a 36-V circuit. For circuits with lower operating voltages, thinner and more heavily doped epitaxial layers are employed to decrease the transistor collector series resistance, as explained later.\n\nFollowing epitaxial growth, an oxide layer is developed on the surface of the epitaxial layer. A masking step, boron ($p$-type) predeposition, and diffusion are then executed, resulting in the structure shown in Figure 2.12. The purpose of this diffusion is to electrically isolate the collectors of the transistors using reverse-biased pn junctions, and it is referred to as isolation diffusion."

This transformation is largely attributed to advancements in photolithography, processing techniques, and the growing inclination towards lowering power-supply voltages across numerous systems. The evolution in photolithography has shrunk the smallest achievable feature size from microns to submicron dimensions. The pinpoint accuracy achievable through ion implantation has made this technique the primary method for depositing impurity atoms in advance. Furthermore, numerous circuits currently run on 3 V or 5 V power supplies instead of the $\\pm 15 \\mathrm{~V}$ supplies previously employed to achieve a wide dynamic range in stand-alone ICs, such as operational amplifiers. The decrease in operating voltages enables a closer arrangement of devices within an IC. It also allows for the creation of thinner structures with greater frequency capabilities. These benefits arise from the reduction in the thickness of junction depletion layers achieved by decreasing operating voltages, as outlined in Chapter 1. Consequently, the most advanced IC manufacturing processes are designed to operate at $5-\\mathrm{V}$ or lower supplies and are generally ineffective at higher voltages. Indeed, a fundamental trade-off exists between the frequency performance of a process and its breakdown voltage.\n\nIn this section, we first explore the sequence of steps involved in fabricating high-voltage bipolar ICs that employ junction isolation. This was the initial process for IC creation. The diagram titled \"Figure 2.10 Buried-layer diffusion\" demonstrates a cross-section of a semiconductor structure integral to high-voltage bipolar IC production. The key elements and features depicted in the diagram include:\n\n1. **P-type Substrate:** The fundamental material of the structure is a p-type silicon substrate, represented as a broad, dotted area at the base of the diagram, signifying the presence of p-type impurities throughout the material.\n\n2. **N+ Buried Layer:** Above the p-type substrate lies an n+ buried layer, depicted as a grey, rectangular area nestled within the substrate. The notation 'n+' denotes a high density of n-type dopants, essential for establishing a low-resistance path in the semiconductor.\n\n3. **N-type Impurities:** On the structure's surface is a region designated \"n-type impurities,\" visualized as a slender layer atop the diagram, suggesting the infiltration of n-type dopants into the substrate. This process is vital for generating the required electrical attributes of the device.\n\n4. **Diffusion Process:** The diagram vividly illustrates the diffusion process by which n-type impurities are infused into the p-type substrate to create the n+ buried layer. This is a pivotal step in the formation of junction-isolated bipolar ICs.\n\nThe diagram serves to elucidate the fundamental structure and process of buried-layer diffusion in semiconductor creation, emphasizing the interactions among various doped regions and their function in crafting high-voltage circuits.\n\nThe diagram depicted in Figure 2.10, titled \"Buried-layer diffusion,\" is instrumental in illustrating the fundamental approaches of IC fabrication. It remains in use, in various forms, for producing high-voltage circuits.\n\nThe manufacturing process for a junction-isolated bipolar IC involves a sequence of six to eight masking and diffusion steps. The initial material is a wafer of p-type silicon, typically 250 µm thick and with an impurity concentration of around $10^{16}$ atoms $/ \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$. We will consider the sequence of diffusion steps necessary to create an npn integrated-circuit transistor. The initial mask and diffusion step, illustrated in Figure 2.10, establishes a low-resistance n-type layer destined to become a low-resistance path for the transistor's collector current. This step is designated as buried-layer diffusion, and the layer is referred to as the buried layer. The sheet resistance of the layer is within the range of 20 to 50 $\\Omega / \\square$, and the impurity employed is usually arsenic or antimony since these impurities diffuse slowly and do not significantly scatter during subsequent processing.\n\nFollowing the buried-layer stage, the wafer is stripped of all oxide, and an epitaxial layer is developed, as depicted in Figure 2.11. The thickness of this layer and its n-type impurity concentration dictate the collector-base breakdown voltage of the transistors within the circuit, given that this material forms the collector region of the transistor. For example, if the circuit is designed to operate at a power-supply voltage of 36 V, the devices typically need to possess BVCEO breakdown voltages exceeding this value. As explained in Chapter 1, this suggests that the plane breakdown voltage at the collector-base junction must be several times higher due to the effects of collector avalanche multiplication. For BVCEO=36 V, a collector-base plane breakdown voltage of approximately 90 V is necessary, which implies an impurity concentration in the collector of approximately $10^{15}$ atoms $/ \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and a resistivity of 5 $\\Omega-\\mathrm{cm}$. The thickness of the epitaxial layer must then be sufficient to accommodate the depletion layer associated with the collector-base junction. At 36 V, the results presented in Chapter 1 can be utilized to demonstrate that the depletion layer thickness is approximately 6 µm. Since the buried layer diffuses outward by approximately 8 µm during subsequent processing, and the base diffusion will be about 3 µm deep, a total epitaxial layer thickness of 17 µm is required for a 36-V circuit. For circuits with lower operating voltages, thinner and more heavily doped epitaxial layers are employed to minimize the transistor collector series resistance, as will be demonstrated later.\n\nAfter epitaxial growth, an oxide layer is grown on the epitaxial layer's upper surface. A masking step, boron (p-type) predeposition, and diffusion are carried out, resulting in the structure shown in Figure 2.12. The purpose of this diffusion is to insulate the transistors' collectors with reverse-biased pn junctions, and it is termed isolation diffusion.\n\nBecause the diffusion must penetrate deeply, this process necessitates several hours in a diffusion furnace at temperatures around $1200^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. The diffused layer's sheet resistance ranges from 20 to 40 $\\Omega / \\square$.\n\nThe subsequent steps are the base mask, base predeposition, and base diffusion, as illustrated in Figure 2.13. The sheet resistance typically ranges from 100 to 300 $\\Omega / \\square$, and the depth ranges from 1 µm to 3 µm by the end of the process. This diffusion step not only creates the bases of the transistors but also many of the resistors within the circuit, thus control over the sheet resistance is crucial.\n\nFollowing base diffusion, the transistors' emitters are formed via a masking step, n-type predeposition, and diffusion, as shown in Figure 2.14. The sheet resistance is between 2 and 10 $\\Omega / \\square$, and the depth ranges from 0.5 to 2.5 µm after diffusion. This diffusion step also forms a low-resistance region serving as the collector contact. This is necessary because ohmic contact is challenging to achieve between aluminum metallization and the high-resistivity epitaxial material directly. The subsequent masking step, the contact mask, is used to open holes in the oxide over the emitter, base, and collector of the transistors to allow electrical contact. Contact windows are also opened for the passive components on the chip. The entire wafer is then coated with a thin (about 1 µm) layer of aluminum that will interconnect the circuit elements. The actual interconnect pattern is defined by the final mask step, in which the aluminum is etched away in the areas where the photoresist is removed in the develop step. The final structure is shown in Figure 2.15. A microscope photograph of an actual structure of the same type is shown in Figure 2.16. The terraced effect on the surface of the device results from the fact that additional oxide is grown during each diffusion cycle, so that the oxide is thickest over the epitaxial region, where no oxide has been removed, is less thick over the base and isolation regions, which are both opened at the base mask step, and is thinnest over the emitter diffusion. A typical diffusion profile for a high-voltage, deep-diffused analog integrated circuit is shown in Figure 2.17.\n\nThis sequence enables the simultaneous production of numerous complex circuits on a single wafer. The wafer is then subjected to an automatic tester, which checks the electrical properties of each circuit on the wafer and marks those that fail to meet specifications with an ink dot. The wafer is then divided into individual circuits by sawing or scribing and breaking, resulting in silicon chips known as dice. Each good die is then mounted in a package for final testing.\n```"

There exists an inherent trade-off between a process's frequency capability and its breakdown voltage.\n\nThis section explores the steps involved in fabricating high-voltage bipolar ICs using junction isolation. This original IC process is depicted in \"Figure 2.10 Buried-layer diffusion,\" which illustrates a cross-sectional view of the semiconductor structure.

This process is essential for forming the necessary electrical characteristics of the device.\n\n4. **Diffusion Process:** The diagram visually represents the diffusion process where n-type impurities are introduced into the p-type substrate to form the n+ buried layer. This is a key step in creating junction-isolated bipolar integrated circuits.\n\nOverall, the diagram illustrates the basic structure and process of buried-layer diffusion in semiconductor fabrication, highlighting the interaction between different types of doped regions and their role in forming high-voltage circuits.\n\nThe original IC process is still utilized in various forms to fabricate high-voltage circuits. The fabrication of a junction-isolated bipolar IC involves a sequence of six to eight masking and diffusion steps. The starting material is a wafer of $p$-type silicon, usually $250 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ thick and with an impurity concentration of approximately $10^{16}$ atoms $/ \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$. We will consider the sequence of diffusion steps required to form an $n p n$ IC transistor. The first mask and diffusion step, illustrated in Fig. 2.10, forms a low-resistance n-type layer that will eventually become a low-resistance path for the collector current of the transistor. This step is called the buried-layer diffusion, and the layer itself is called the buried layer. The sheet resistance of the layer is in the range of 20 to $50 \\Omega / \\square$, and the impurity used is usually arsenic or antimony because these impurities diffuse slowly and thus do not greatly redistribute during subsequent processing.\n\nAfter the buried-layer step, the wafer is stripped of all oxide and an epi layer is grown, as shown in Fig. 2.11. The thickness of the layer and its $n$-type impurity concentration determine the collector-base breakdown voltage of the transistors in the circuit since this material forms the collector region of the transistor. For example, if the circuit is to operate at a power-supply voltage of 36 V, the devices generally are required to have $B V_{C E O}$ breakdown voltages above this value. As described in Chapter 1, this implies that the plane breakdown voltage in the collector-base junction must be several times this value because of the effects of collector avalanche multiplication. For $B V_{C E O}=36 \\mathrm{~V}$, a collector-base plane breakdown voltage of approximately 90 V is required, which implies an impurity concentration in the collector of approximately $10^{15}$ atoms $/ \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and a resistivity of $5 \\Omega-\\mathrm{cm}$. The thickness of the epitaxial layer then must be large enough to accommodate the depletion layer associated with the collector-base junction. At 36 V, the results of Chapter 1 can be used to show that the depletion-layer thickness is approximately $6 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$. Since the buried layer diffuses outward approximately $8 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ during subsequent processing, and the base diffusion will be approximately $3 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ deep, a total epitaxial layer thickness of $17 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ is required for a $36-\\mathrm{V}$ circuit. For circuits with lower operating voltages, thinner and more heavily doped epitaxial layers are used to reduce the transistor collector series resistance, as will be shown later.\n\nFollowing the epitaxial growth, an oxide layer is grown on the top surface of the epitaxial layer. A mask step and boron ($p$-type) predeposition and diffusion are performed, resulting in the structure shown in Fig. 2.12. The function of this diffusion is to isolate the collectors of the transistors from each other with reverse-biased pn junctions, and it is termed the isolation diffusion. Because of the depth to which the diffusion must penetrate, this diffusion requires several hours in a diffusion furnace at temperatures of about $1200^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. The isolated diffused layer has a sheet resistance from $20 \\Omega / \\square$ to $40 \\Omega / \\square$.\n\nThe next steps are the base mask, base predeposition, and base diffusion, as shown in Fig. 2.13. The latter is usually a boron diffusion, and the resulting layer has a sheet resistance of from $100 \\Omega / \\square$ to $300 \\Omega / \\square$, and a depth of $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ to $3 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ at the end of the process. This diffusion forms not only the bases of the transistors but also many of the resistors in the circuit, so that control of the sheet resistance is important.\n\nFollowing the base diffusion, the emitters of the transistors are formed by a mask step, $n$-type predeposition, and diffusion, as shown in Fig. 2.14. The sheet resistance is between $2 \\Omega / \\square$ and $10 \\Omega / \\square$, and the depth is $0.5 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ to $2.5 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ after the diffusion. This diffusion step is also used to form a low-resistance region, which serves as the contact to the collector region. This is necessary because ohmic contact is difficult to accomplish between aluminum metallization and the high-resistivity epitaxial material directly. The next masking step, the contact mask, is used to open holes in the oxide over the emitter, the base, and the collector of the transistors so that electrical contact can be made to them. Contact windows are also opened for the passive components on the chip.

The wafer is then placed in an automatic tester, which checks the electrical characteristics of each circuit on the wafer and puts an ink dot on circuits that fail to meet specifications. The wafer is then broken up, by sawing or scribing and breaking, into individual circuits. The resulting silicon chips are called dice, and the singular is die.

As a result, the most advanced-frequency IC processes are designed to operate with $5-\\mathrm{V}$ supplies or less and are generally not compatible with higher supply voltages. There is an inherent trade-off between a process's frequency capability and its breakdown voltage.\n\nThis section outlines the sequential steps involved in the fabrication of high-voltage bipolar integrated circuits using junction isolation. This process, which was the original IC technique, serves as a useful framework for understanding the fundamental methods of IC fabrication and continues to be employed in various forms for the production of high-voltage circuits.\n\nThe fabrication of junction-isolated bipolar integrated circuits involves a sequence of six to eight masking and diffusion steps. The process begins with a wafer of $p$-type silicon, typically $250 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ thick with an impurity concentration of approximately $10^{16}$ atoms $/ \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$. We will examine the diffusion steps necessary to form an $n p n$ integrated-circuit transistor. The initial mask and diffusion step, depicted in Fig. 2.10, creates a low-resistance n-type layer that will ultimately serve as a low-resistance path for the transistor's collector current. This step is known as the buried-layer diffusion, and the resulting layer is referred to as the buried layer. The sheet resistance of this layer typically ranges from 20 to $50 \\Omega / \\square$, and the impurity of choice is usually arsenic or antimony due to their slow diffusion, which minimizes redistribution during subsequent processing.\n\nAfter the buried-layer diffusion, the wafer is stripped of all oxide, and an epitaxial layer is grown, as shown in Fig. 2.11. The thickness of this layer and its $n$-type impurity concentration are crucial in determining the collector-base breakdown voltage of the transistors in the circuit, as this material constitutes the transistor's collector region. For instance, if the circuit is intended to operate at a power-supply voltage of 36 V, the devices must typically have $B V_{C E O}$ breakdown voltages exceeding this value. As explained in Chapter 1, this necessitates that the plane breakdown voltage in the collector-base junction be several times the $B V_{C E O}$ value due to the effects of collector avalanche multiplication. For a $B V_{C E O}$ of 36 V, a collector-base plane breakdown voltage of approximately 90 V is required, suggesting an impurity concentration in the collector of about $10^{15}$ atoms $/ \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and a resistivity of $5 \\Omega-\\mathrm{cm}$. Consequently, the epitaxial layer's thickness must be sufficient to accommodate the depletion layer associated with the collector-base junction. At 36 V, the findings of Chapter 1 can be used to demonstrate that the depletion-layer thickness is approximately $6 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$. Given that the buried layer diffuses outward by about $8 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ during subsequent processing, and the base diffusion will be roughly $3 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ deep, a total epitaxial layer thickness of $17 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ is necessary for a $36-\\mathrm{V}$ circuit. For circuits with lower operating voltages, thinner and more heavily doped epitaxial layers are employed to diminish the transistor collector series resistance, as will be discussed later.\n\nFollowing epitaxial growth, an oxide layer is grown on the epitaxial layer's surface. A subsequent mask step involves boron ($p$-type) predeposition and diffusion, resulting in the structure shown in Fig. 2.12. The purpose of this diffusion is to electrically isolate the collectors of the transistors from one another using reverse-biased pn junctions, a process termed isolation diffusion. Given the depth to which the diffusion must extend, this process necessitates several hours in a diffusion furnace at temperatures around $1200^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. The isolated diffused layer exhibits a sheet resistance ranging from $20 \\Omega / \\square$ to $40 \\Omega / \\square$.\n\nThe subsequent steps involve the base mask, base predeposition, and base diffusion, as depicted in Fig. 2.13. The base diffusion is usually a boron diffusion, and the resulting layer has a sheet resistance ranging from $100 \\Omega / \\square$ to $300 \\Omega / \\square$, with a depth of $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ to $3 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ by the end of the process. This diffusion not only forms the bases of the transistors but also constitutes many of the resistors in the circuit, making control of the sheet resistance crucial.\n\nAfter the base diffusion, the emitters of the transistors are formed through a mask step, $n$-type predeposition, and diffusion, as shown in Fig. 2.14. The sheet resistance of this layer is between $2 \\Omega / \\square$ and $10 \\Omega / \\square$, and the depth is $0.5 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ to $2.5 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ after the diffusion. This diffusion step is also used to create a low-resistance region that serves as the contact to the collector region. This is essential because achieving ohmic contact between aluminum metallization and the high-resistivity epitaxial material directly is challenging. The subsequent masking step, known as the contact mask, is used to create openings in the oxide over the emitter, the base, and the collector of the transistors to enable electrical contact with these regions. Contact windows are also opened for the passive components on the chip. The entire wafer is then coated with a thin (about $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$) layer of aluminum that will interconnect the circuit elements. The actual interconnect pattern is defined by the final mask step, where the aluminum is etched away in the areas where the photoresist is removed during the develop step. The final structure is shown in Fig. 2.15. A microscope photograph of an actual structure of the same type is shown in Fig. 2.16. The terraced effect on the device's surface results from the additional oxide growth during each diffusion cycle, causing the oxide to be thickest over the epitaxial region, less thick over the base and isolation regions, which are both exposed at the base mask step, and thinnest over the emitter diffusion. A typical diffusion profile for a high-voltage, deep-diffused analog integrated circuit is shown in Fig. 2.17.\n\nThis sequence allows for the simultaneous fabrication of a large number (often thousands) of complex circuits on a single wafer. The wafer is then placed in an automatic tester, which verifies the electrical characteristics of each circuit on the wafer and marks circuits that fail to meet specifications with an ink dot. The wafer is then divided into individual circuits by sawing or scribing and breaking. The resulting silicon chips are referred to as dice, with the singular form being die. Each functional die is then mounted in a package, prepared for final testing."

    "text": "Rephrased text:\n\nA significant portion of the bipolar analog integrated circuits produced today relies on the fundamental technology outlined earlier, or some adaptation of it. The manufacturing process is straightforward and cost-effective. Nevertheless, many crucial commercial applications for these circuits have increasingly called for enhanced frequency response capabilities, which necessitates the development of transistors with higher frequency response within the technology. The demand for greater speed requires a device structure with a narrower base width to decrease base transit time and overall smaller dimensions to reduce parasitic capacitances. The smaller device dimensions necessitate a proportional reduction in the width of the junction depletion layers within the structure, which in turn demands lower circuit operating voltages and higher impurity concentrations in the device structure. To satisfy this requirement, a category of bipolar fabrication technologies has emerged that, in comparison to the high-voltage process sequence discussed previously, employ much thinner and more heavily doped epitaxial layers, selectively oxidized regions for isolation instead of diffused junctions, and a polysilicon layer as the dopant source for the emitter. Due to the increasing significance of this class of bipolar process, the sequence for such a process is explained in this section.\n\nThe process begins similarly to the conventional method, with a mask and implant step that results in the creation of a heavily-doped $n^{+}$ buried layer in a $p$-type substrate. After this, a thin $n$-type epitaxial layer is grown, approximately $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ thick and about $0.5 \\Omega-\\mathrm{cm}$ in resistivity. The outcome after these steps is depicted in cross-section in Fig. 2.18.\n\nSubsequently, a selective oxidation step is performed to create the regions that will separate the transistor from its neighbors and also isolate the collector-contact region from the rest of the transistor. The oxidation step is as described in Section 2.2.7, except that prior to the actual growth of the thick $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ layer, an etching step is conducted to eliminate silicon material from the areas where oxide will grow. Without this step, the thick oxide growth results in elevated humps in the areas where the oxide is grown, causing difficulties in coverage by subsequent layers of metal and polysilicon that will be deposited. The removal of some silicon material before oxide growth results in a nearly planar surface after the oxide is grown and resolves the step coverage problem in subsequent processing. The resulting structure following this step is shown in Fig. 2.19. Note that the $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ regions extend all the way down to the $p$-type substrate, electrically isolating the $n$-type epi regions from one another. These regions are often referred to as moats. Because the growth of oxide layers thicker than a micron or so requires impractically long times, this method of isolation is practical only for very thin transistor structures.\n\nFollowing this, two mask and implant steps are carried out. A heavy $n^{+}$ implant is made in the collector-contact region and diffused down to the buried layer, resulting in a low-resistance path to the collector. A second mask is used to define the base region, and a thin-base $p$-type implant is performed. The resulting structure is shown in Fig. 2.20.\n\nA significant challenge in fabricating this type of device is the creation of very thin base and emitter structures, and then providing low-resistance ohmic contact to these regions. This is most often achieved using polysilicon as a doping source. An $n^{+}$ doped layer of polysilicon is deposited and masked to leave polysilicon only in the region directly over the emitter. During subsequent high-temperature processing steps, the dopant (usually arsenic) diffuses out of the polysilicon and into the crystalline silicon, forming a very thin, heavily doped emitter region. Following the poly deposition, a heavy $p$-type implant is performed, which results in a more heavily doped $p$-type layer at all points in the base region except directly under the polysilicon, where the polysilicon itself acts as a mask to prevent the boron atoms from reaching this part of the base region.

This fabrication process is known for its simplicity and cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, many commercially significant circuit applications necessitate progressively greater frequency response capabilities, which implies a direct requirement for transistors that can handle higher frequencies. The demand for increased speed necessitates a device structure with a narrower base width to minimize base transit time and smaller overall dimensions to reduce parasitic capacitances. These smaller device dimensions necessitate a proportional reduction in the width of the junction depletion layers within the structure, which in turn requires the use of lower circuit operating voltages and higher impurity concentrations in the device structure. To satisfy this requirement, a class of bipolar fabrication technologies has emerged, which, compared to the high-voltage process sequence described previously, utilize much thinner and more heavily doped epitaxial layers, selectively oxidized regions for isolation instead of diffused junctions, and a polysilicon layer as the dopant source for the emitter. Due to the increasing significance of this class of bipolar process, the sequence for such a process is described in this section.\n\nThe initial steps of the process are akin to those of the conventional process, involving a mask and implant step that culminates in the creation of a heavily-doped n+ buried layer within a p-type substrate. Following this, a thin n-type epitaxial layer is grown, approximately 1 micrometer thick, with a resistivity of about 0.5 Ohm-cm. The outcome of these steps is depicted in a cross-sectional view in Fig. 2.18.\n\nSubsequently, a selective oxidation step is performed to create the regions that will isolate the transistor from its neighbors and also isolate the collector-contact region from the rest of the transistor. The oxidation step is as described in Section 2.2.7, with the exception that before the actual growth of the thick SiO2 layer, an etching step is carried out to remove silicon material from the regions where oxide will be grown. If this is not done, the thick oxide growth results in elevated humps in the regions where the oxide is grown, causing issues with coverage by subsequent layers of metal and polysilicon that will be deposited. The removal of some silicon material before oxide growth results in a nearly planar surface after the oxide is grown and eliminates the step coverage problem in subsequent processing. The resulting structure following this step is shown in Fig. 2.19.\n\nTwo mask and implant steps are then performed. A heavy n+ implant is made in the collector-contact region and diffused down to the buried layer, resulting in a low-resistance path to the collector. A second mask is used to define the base region, and a thin-base p-type implant is performed. The resulting structure is shown in Fig. 2.20.\n\nA significant challenge in fabricating this type of device is the formation of very thin base and emitter structures and then providing low-resistance ohmic contact to these regions. This is most often achieved using polysilicon as a doping source. An n+ doped layer of polysilicon is deposited and masked to leave polysilicon only in the region directly over the emitter. During subsequent high-temperature processing steps, the dopant (usually arsenic) diffuses out of the polysilicon and into the crystalline silicon, forming a very thin, heavily doped emitter region. Following the poly deposition, a heavy p-type implant is performed, which results in a more heavily doped p-type layer at all points in the base region except directly under the polysilicon, where the polysilicon itself acts as a mask to prevent the boron atoms from reaching this part of the base region. The structure that results following this step is shown in Fig. 2.21.\n\nThis method of forming low-resistance regions to contact the base is called a self-aligned structure because the alignment of the base region with the emitter happens automatically and does not depend on mask alignment.

    "text": "The technology underlying a significant portion of bipolar analog integrated circuits produced today is based on the fundamental process outlined previously, with some variations. This technology is marked by a straightforward and inexpensive fabrication sequence. However, the demand for increased frequency response in circuits of commercial significance necessitates transistors with enhanced frequency capabilities within this technology. This requirement for higher speed leads to the design of devices with narrower base widths to decrease base transit time and overall smaller dimensions to reduce parasitic capacitances. The reduction in device size necessitates a proportional decrease in the width of the junction depletion layers, which, in turn, calls for lower circuit operating voltages and higher impurity concentrations within the device structure. To satisfy this demand, a class of bipolar fabrication technologies has emerged. These technologies employ much thinner and more heavily doped epitaxial layers, selectively oxidized regions for isolation as opposed to diffused junctions, and a polysilicon layer as the dopant source for the emitter, in contrast to the high-voltage process sequence discussed earlier. Due to the escalating relevance of this class of bipolar process, the fabrication sequence is detailed in this section.\n\nThe process begins analogously to the conventional sequence, involving a mask and implantation step that culminates in the creation of a heavily doped n+ buried layer within a p-type substrate. Subsequently, a thin n-type epitaxial layer, approximately 1 micrometer thick and with a resistivity of about 0.5 Ohm-cm, is grown on top. The resultant structure following these steps is illustrated in cross-section in Figure 2.18.\n\nThe subsequent step involves selective oxidation to shape the regions that will insulate the transistor from its neighbors and to isolate the collector-contact region from the rest of the transistor. The oxidation process is similar to the one described in Section 2.2.7, with the key difference being the removal of silicon material from regions destined for oxide growth before the actual thick SiO2 layer formation. This pre-oxidation etch prevents the formation of elevated humps in the oxide growth regions, which could complicate the deposition of subsequent metal and polysilicon layers. The etch ensures a nearly planar surface post-oxidation, thereby mitigating step coverage issues in later processing stages. The structure after this step is depicted in Figure 2.19, illustrating how the SiO2 regions extend to the p-type substrate, electrically isolating the n-type epi regions from each other, often referred to as moats. Since oxide layer growth thicker than a micron requires impractically long periods, this isolation method is feasible only for very thin transistor structures.\n\nFollowing this, two mask and implant steps are executed. A heavy n+ implant is performed in the collector-contact region, diffusing down to the buried layer to establish a low-resistance path to the collector. A subsequent mask defines the base region, followed by a thin-base p-type implant. The structure after these steps is shown in Figure 2.20.\n\nA significant challenge in fabricating this type of device involves creating very thin base and emitter structures while providing low-resistance ohmic contact to these regions. This is commonly achieved using polysilicon as a doping source. An n+ doped layer of polysilicon is deposited and masked to ensure its presence only above the emitter. During subsequent high-temperature processing, the dopant (usually arsenic) diffuses out of the polysilicon into the crystalline silicon, forming a very thin, heavily doped emitter region. After the poly deposition, a heavy p-type implant is carried out, resulting in a more heavily doped p-type layer throughout the base region except directly under the polysilicon, where the polysilicon itself acts as a mask, preventing boron atoms from reaching this section of the base region. The resulting structure is shown in Figure 2.21.\n\nThis method of forming low-resistance regions to contact the base is referred to as a self-aligned structure because the alignment of the base region with the emitter occurs automatically and is not dependent on mask alignment. A similar process is employed in MOS technology, which is described later in this chapter.\n\nThe final device structure after metallization is depicted in Figure 2.22. Since the moats are composed of SiO2, the metallization contact windows can overlap into them, which significantly reduces the minimum achievable dimensions of the base and collector regions. All exposed silicon and polysilicon are covered with a highly conductive silicide (a compound of silicon and a refractory metal such as tungsten) to minimize series and contact resistance. For minimum-dimension transistors, the emitter contact is made by extending the polysilicon to a region outside the device active area and forming a metal contact to the polysilicon there. A photograph of such a device is shown in Figure 2.23, and a typical impurity profile is depicted in Figure 2.24. The use of the remote emitter contact with polysilicon connection does introduce some series emitter resistance, so for larger device geometries or cases where emitter resistance is critical, a larger emitter is employed, and the contact is placed directly atop the polysilicon emitter itself. Production IC processes based on technologies akin to the one described yield bipolar transistors with fT values well in excess of 10 GHz, compared to a typical value of 500 MHz for deep-diffused, high-voltage processes."

Following the poly deposition, a heavy p-type implant is performed, which results in a more heavily doped p-type layer at all points in the base region except directly under the polysilicon, where the polysilicon itself acts as a mask to prevent the boron atoms from reaching this part of the base region. The structure that results following this step is shown in Fig. 2.21.\n\nThis method of forming low-resistance regions to contact the base is called a self-aligned structure because the alignment of the base region with the emitter happens automatically and does not depend on mask alignment. Similar processing is used in MOS technology, described later in this chapter.\n\nThe final device structure after metallization is shown in Fig. 2.22. Since the moats are made of SiO2, the metallization contact windows can overlap into them, a fact that dramatically reduces the minimum achievable dimensions of the base and collector regions. All exposed silicon and polysilicon is covered with a highly conductive silicide (a compound of silicon and a refractory metal such as tungsten) to reduce series and contact resistance. For minimum-dimension transistors, the contact to the emitter is made by extending the polysilicon to a region outside the device active area and forming a metal contact to the polysilicon there. A photograph of such a device is shown in Fig. 2.23, and a typical impurity profile is shown in Fig. 2.24. The use of the remote emitter contact with polysilicon connection does add some series emitter resistance, so for larger device geometries or cases in which emitter resistance is critical, a larger emitter is used and the contact is placed directly on top of the polysilicon emitter itself. Production IC processes based on technologies similar to the one just described yield bipolar transistors having fT values well in excess of 10 GHz, compared to a typical value of 500 MHz for deep-diffused, high-voltage processes."

Due to the complex three-dimensional shape of the collector region, only an approximate value for the collector resistance can be derived through manual analysis.\n\nThe collector-base capacitance is simply the capacitance of the collector-base junction, encompassing both the flat bottom portion of the junction and the sidewalls. This junction is formed by the diffusion of boron into an $n$-type epitaxial material, assumed to have a resistivity of $5 \\Omega$-cm, corresponding to an impurity concentration of $10^{15} \\mathrm{atoms} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$. The uniformly doped epi layer is much more lightly doped than the $\\rho$-diffused region, leading to a step junction where the depletion layer lies almost entirely in the epitaxial material.

This nomograph graphically represents the relationship between the capacitance per unit area of an abrupt $p-n$ junction and the applied reverse voltage $V_R$, as well as the depletion layer depth $X_d$, showing how these parameters vary with the impurity concentration on the lightly doped side of the junction."

Hence, the circuit design process inherently involves a degree of device design. For instance, amplifiers often necessitate a transistor with high current capacity in the output stage. This can be achieved by expanding the device geometry beyond the standard size, effectively creating a parallel connection of numerous standard devices.

During the forward-active operational mode, the sole electrically active part of the structure that contributes to current amplification is the base region directly beneath the emitter diffusion. The remainder of the structure facilitates the connection of the transistor's three terminals and ensures the electrical separation of the device from other components on the same semiconductor wafer. These regions predominantly introduce parasitic resistances and capacitances that must be incorporated into the small-signal model of the complete device to accurately depict its high-frequency behavior.\n\nA key difference between designing integrated circuits and discrete-component circuits lies in the fact that an IC designer has the ability to employ a device geometry tailored to the specific conditions encountered within a circuit. Consequently, the process of circuit design often involves a degree of device design. For instance, there is a frequent requirement for a transistor with a high current-carrying capacity in the output stage of an amplifier. Such a transistor can be fabricated using a larger device geometry compared to the standard type, effectively creating many standard transistors connected in parallel. Nevertheless, the larger geometry will exhibit higher base-emitter, collector-base, and collector-substrate capacitance than the standard device, which must be considered when analyzing the frequency response of the circuit. The circuit designer must therefore be capable of assessing the impact of alterations in device geometry on device characteristics and estimating significant device parameters based on known device structure and doping levels. To demonstrate this approach, we will compute the model parameters of the npn device illustrated in Figure 2.25. This configuration is representative of devices employed in circuits with a $5-\\Omega-\\mathrm{cm}$, $17-\\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ epitaxial layer. The emitter diffusion measures $20 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\times 25 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$, the base diffusion is 45 $\\mu \\mathrm{m} \\times 60 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$, and the base-isolation spacing is $25 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$. The total device dimensions are $140 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\times 95 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$. Devices intended for lower epi resistivity and thickness can be substantially smaller; the base-isolation spacing is dictated by the side diffusion of the isolation region and the depletion layers associated with the base-collector and collector-isolation junctions.\n\nThe saturation current $I_{S}$ is presented in Equation (2.16) from Chapter 1. It is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{S}=\\frac{q A \\bar{D}_{n} n_{i}^{2}}{Q_{B}} \\tag{2.16}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $A$ is the area of the emitter-base junction, $Q_{B}$ is the total number of impurity atoms per unit area within the base, $n_{i}$ is the intrinsic carrier concentration, and $\\bar{D}_{n}$ is the effective diffusion constant for electrons in the base region of the transistor. The value of $Q_{B}$ can be identified as the area under the concentration curve in the base region, as depicted in Figure 2.17. This value can be determined graphically or, more conveniently, experimentally through measurements of the base-emitter voltage at a constant collector current. Substituting Equation (2.16) into Equation (1.35) yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{Q_{B}}{\\bar{D}_{n}}=A \\frac{q n_{i}^{2}}{I_{C}} \\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}} \\tag{2.17}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand $Q_{B}$ can be calculated using this equation.\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nA base-emitter voltage of 550 mV is measured at a collector current of $10 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$ on a test transistor with an emitter area of $100 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\times 100 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$. Estimate $Q_{B}$ given a temperature of $T=300^{\\circ} \\mathrm{K}$ and an intrinsic carrier concentration of $n_{i}=1.5 \\times 10^{10} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$. Using Equation (2.17), we find\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{Q_{B}}{\\bar{D}_{n}} & =\\left(100 \\times 10^{-4}\\right)^{2} \\frac{1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\times 2.25 \\times 10^{20}}{10^{-5}} \\exp (550 / 26) \\\\\n& =5.54 \\times 10^{11} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-4} \\mathrm{~s}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAt the doping levels present in the base, an approximate value of $\\bar{D}_{n}$, the electron diffusivity, is\n\n$$\n\\bar{D}_{n}=13 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}\n$$\n\nThus, for this example,\n\n$$\nQ_{B}=5.54 \\times 10^{11} \\times 13 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-2}=7.2 \\times 10^{12} \\text { atoms } / \\mathrm{cm}^{2}\n$$\n\nNote that $Q_{B}$ depends on the diffusion profiles and will vary for different processes. Typically, fabrication processes designed for lower voltage operation employ thinner base regions and exhibit lower values of $Q_{B}$. Within a single process, $Q_{B}$ can fluctuate by a factor of two or three due to variations in the diffusion process. The primary significance of the numerical value for $Q_{B}$ is that it enables the calculation of the saturation current $I_{S}$ for any device structure once the emitter-base junction area is known.\n\nThe series base resistance $r_{b}$ is due to the physical separation of the base contact from the active base region, resulting in a substantial ohmic resistance between them. This resistance can significantly impact the high-frequency gain and noise performance of the device. As shown in Figure 2.26a, this resistance comprises two components: the resistance $r_{b 1}$ between the base contact and the edge of the emitter diffusion, and the resistance $r_{b 2}$ between the edge of the emitter and the point within the base region where the current is flowing. The first component can be estimated by neglecting edge effects and assuming that this resistance is that of a rectangle of material, as illustrated in Figure 2.26b. For a base sheet resistance of $100 \\Omega / \\square$ and typical dimensions as shown in Figure 2.26b, this would give a resistance of\n\n$$\nr_{b 1}=\\frac{10 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}}{25 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}} 100 \\Omega=40 \\Omega\n$$\n\nThe calculation of $r_{b 2}$ is complex due to several factors. First, the current flow in this region is not well modeled by a single resistor because the base resistance is distributed throughout the base region, and two-dimensional effects are important. Second, at moderate current levels, current crowding can lead to most of the carrier injection from the emitter into the base occurring near the periphery of the emitter diffusion. At higher current levels, essentially all injection occurs at the periphery, and the effective value of $r_{b}$ approaches $r_{b 1}$. In this scenario, the region directly beneath the emitter is not involved in transistor action. A typical variation of $r_{b}$ with collector current for the npn geometry of Figure 2.25 is shown in Figure 2.27. In transistors designed for low-noise and/or high-frequency applications where low $r_{b}$ is crucial, efforts are often made to maximize the periphery of the emitter adjacent to the base contact. At the same time, the emitter-base and collector-base junction areas must be kept small to minimize capacitance. In the case of high-frequency transistors, this usually suggests the use of an emitter geometry consisting of many narrow stripes with base contacts between them. The ease with which designers can employ such device geometries exemplifies the flexibility provided by monolithic IC fabrication.\n\nThe series collector resistance $r_{c}$ is important in both high-frequency circuits and low-frequency applications requiring low collector-emitter saturation voltage. Due to the complex three-dimensional shape of the collector region, an approximate value for the collector resistance can only be obtained by hand analysis. From Figure 2.28, we see that the resistance consists of three parts: that from the collector-base junction under the emitter down to the buried layer, $r_{c 1}$; that of the buried layer from the region under the emitter over to the region under the collector contact, $r_{c 2}$; and finally, that portion from the buried layer up to the collector contact, $r_{c 3}$. The small-signal series collector resistance in the forward-active region can be estimated by summing the resistances of these three paths.\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nEstimate the collector resistance of the transistor of Figure 2.25, assuming the doping profile of Figure 2.17. We first calculate the $r_{c 1}$ component. The thickness of the lightly doped epi layer between the collector-base junction and the buried layer is $6 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$. Assuming that the collector-base junction is at zero bias, the results of Chapter 1 can be used to show that the depletion layer is about $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ thick. Thus the undepleted epi material under the base is $5 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ thick.\n\nThe effective cross-sectional area of the resistance $r_{c 1}$ is larger at the buried layer than at the collector-base junction. The emitter dimensions are $20 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\times 25 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$, while the buried layer dimensions are $41 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\times 85 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ on the mask. Since the buried layer side-diffuses a distance roughly equal to the distance that it out-diffuses, about $8 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ must be added on each edge, giving an effective size of $57 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\times 101 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$. An exact calculation of the ohmic resistance of this three-dimensional region would require solving Laplace's equation in the region, with a complex set of boundary conditions. Consequently, we will carry out an approximate analysis by modeling the region as a rectangular parallelepiped, as shown in Figure 2.28b. Under the assumptions that the top and bottom surfaces of the region are equipotential surfaces, and that the current flow in the region occurs only in the vertical direction, the resistance of the structure can be shown to be\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR=\\frac{\\rho T}{W L} \\frac{\\ln \\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right)}{(a-b)} \\tag{2.18}\n\\end{equation*}\n```\n```"

Referencing Figure 2.17, $Q_{B}$ corresponds to the area under the concentration curve in the base region. This value can be determined graphically or more conveniently through experimental measurements of the base-emitter voltage at a constant collector current. By substituting equation (2.16) into (1.35), we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{Q_{B}}{\\bar{D}_{n}}=A \\frac{q n_{i}^{2}}{I_{C}} \\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}} \\tag{2.17}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand $Q_{B}$ can be calculated using this equation.\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nWith a base-emitter voltage of 550 mV and a collector current of $10 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$, a test transistor with an emitter area of $100 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\times 100 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ yields an estimated $Q_{B}$.

As the base contact is physically removed from the active base region, a substantial series ohmic resistance is observed between the contact and the active base.

The second part $r_{b 2}$ is the resistance between the edge of the emitter and the site within the base region where the current is actually flowing.\n```\nRephrased text:\n\n```\nThe architecture of a high-voltage npn transistor within an integrated circuit was detailed in the preceding section, and its layout in both plan and cross-sectional perspectives can be observed in Figure 2.25. Within the forward-active operating mode, it is only the section of the base directly below the emitter diffusion that is electrically active and responsible for the current amplification. The rest of the structure ensures the topmost contact for the three transistor terminals and isolates the device from adjacent components on the same die. These regions primarily introduce parasitic resistances and capacitances, which are necessary to incorporate into the small-signal model to accurately capture the device's high-frequency performance.\n\nThere is a notable distinction between the design principles of integrated-circuit and discrete-component circuits, as the IC designer has the capability to adopt a device shape specifically tailored to the unique conditions of the circuit. Consequently, the process of circuit design often intersects with device design. For example, an amplifier's output stage may necessitate a transistor capable of carrying a high current. This can be realized by employing a larger device dimension than the standard, effectively creating a transistor composed of multiple standard devices in parallel. Yet, the increased dimension results in elevated base-emitter, collector-base, and collector-substrate capacitance compared to the standard device, which must be considered during the analysis of the circuit's frequency response. The circuit designer must then evaluate how alterations in the device's geometry influence its attributes and estimate critical device parameters once the device's structure and doping levels are established. To exemplify this methodology, we will compute the model parameters of the npn device presented in Figure 2.25. This structure is typical of the devices found in circuits with an epitaxial layer exhibiting a resistivity of $5-\\Omega-\\mathrm{cm}$ and a thickness of $17-\\mu \\mathrm{~m}$.

The total size of the device measures $140 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\times 95 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$. For devices designed for lower epi resistivity and reduced thickness, the dimensions can be substantially minimized. The base-isolation spacing is influenced by the side diffusion of the isolation region along with the depletion layers linked to the base-collector and collector-isolation junctions.\n```"

Substituting into the equation from Chapter 1 gives:\n\n$$\n\\frac{Q_{B}}{\\bar{D}_{n}}=A \\frac{q n_{i}^{2}}{I_{C}} \\exp \\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}\n$$\n\nand $Q_{B}$ can be calculated using this equation.\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nA base-emitter voltage of 550 mV is measured at a collector current of $10 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$ on a test transistor with a $100 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\times 100 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ emitter area.

Generally, processes intended for lower voltage operation use thinner base regions and have lower $Q_{B}$ values. Within a nominally fixed process, $Q_{B}$ can vary by a factor of two or three due to diffusion process variations. The primary importance of the $Q_{B}$ value is that it allows the calculation of the saturation current $I_{S}$ for any device structure once the emitter-base junction area is known.\n\nSeries Base Resistance $r_{b}$. Due to the physical separation between the base contact and the active base region, a significant series ohmic resistance is observed between the contact and the active base. This resistance can significantly impact the high-frequency gain and noise performance of the device. As shown in Fig. 2.26a, this resistance consists of two parts. The first part, $r_{b 1}$, is the resistance of the path between the base contact and the edge of the emitter diffusion. The second part, $r_{b 2}$, is the resistance between the edge of the emitter and the point within the base region where the current is actually flowing. The former component can be estimated by neglecting fringing and assuming that this component of the resistance is that of a rectangle, as shown in Fig. 2.26b. For a base sheet resistance of $100 \\Omega / \\square$ and typical dimensions as shown in Fig. 2.26b, this would result in a resistance of:\n\n$$\nr_{b 1}=\\frac{10 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}}{25 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}} 100 \\Omega=40 \\Omega\n$$\n\nThe calculation of $r_{b 2}$ is complicated by several factors. First, the current flow in this region is not well modeled by a single resistor due to the distributed nature of the base resistance and the importance of two-dimensional effects. Second, at moderate current levels, current crowding causes most of the carrier injection from the emitter into the base to occur near the periphery of the emitter diffusion. At higher current levels, essentially all of the injection takes place at the periphery, and the effective value of $r_{b}$ approaches $r_{b 1}$. In this situation, the base region directly beneath the emitter is not involved in transistor action. A typical variation of $r_{b}$ with collector current for the npn geometry of Fig. 2.25 is shown in Fig. 2.27. In transistors designed for low-noise and/or high-frequency applications where low $r_{b}$ is crucial, efforts effort is often made to maximize the perimeteriphery of the emitter that is adjacent to the base contact. At the same time, the emitter-base and\nSeries description\nIn original section detailed the structure of a high-voltage, integrated-circuit npn transistor, depicted depicted in both plan and cross-sectional views in Fig. 2.25. During forward-active operation, the segment of the base directly beneath the emitter diffusion is the only part of the structure that actively contributes to current gain. The rest of the structure ensures that there is a top contact for the three transistor terminals and maintains electrical isolation from other devices on the die. In terms of electrical effects, these regions introduce parasitic resistances and capacitances that must be considered in the small-signal model to accurately represent the device's high-frequency behavior.\n\nA significant difference between integrated-circuit design and discrete-component circuit design lies in the IC designer's ability to optimize the device geometry for specific circuit conditions. This means the circuit design process also involves some device design. For instance, if a transistor with high current-carrying capability is needed for an amplifier's output stage, this can be achieved by using a larger device geometry, effectively creating a parallel connection of many standard devices. However, this larger geometry results in increased base-emitter, collector-base, and collector-substrate capacitance compared to a standard device, which must be considered when analyzing the circuit's frequency response. The circuit designer must be able to assess how changes in device geometry affect device characteristics and estimate key device parameters when the device structure and doping levels are known. To demonstrate this process, we will calculate the model parameters of the npn device shown in Fig. 2.25, which is representative of devices used in circuits with a $5-\\Omega-\\mathrm{cm}$, $17-\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ epitaxial layer. The emitter diffusion measures $20 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\times 25 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$, the base diffusion is $45 \\mu \\mathrm{m} \\times 60 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$, and the base-isolation spacing is $25 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$. The overall device dimensions are $140 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\times 95 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$. For lower epitaxial resistivity and thickness, device geometries can be significantly smaller; the base-isolation spacing is determined by the side diffusion of the isolation region and the depletion layers associated with the base-collector and collector-isolation junctions.\n\nThe saturation current $I_{S}$ of a graded-base transistor, as discussed in Chapter 1, is given by:\n\n$$\nI_{S}=\\frac{q A \\bar{D}_{n} n_{i}^{2}}{Q_{B}}\n$$\n\nwhere $A$ is the emitter-base junction area, $Q_{B}$ is the total number of impurity atoms per unit area in the base, $n_{i}$ is the intrinsic carrier concentration, and $\\bar{D}_{n}$ is the effective diffusion constant for electrons in the base region of the transistor.

The nomograph of Fig. 2.29 can also be used to determine the junction depletion-region width as a function of applied voltage, since this width is inversely proportional to the capacitance. The width in microns is given on the axis on the right side of the figure.\n\nNote that the horizontal axis in Fig. 2.29 is the total junction potential, which is the applied potential plus the built-in voltage $\\psi_{0}$. In order to use the curve, then, the built-in potential must be calculated. While this would be an involved calculation for a diffused junction, the built-in potential is actually only weakly dependent on the details of the diffusion profile and can be assumed to be about 0.55 V for the collector-base junction, 0.52 V for the collector-substrate junction, and about 0.7 V for the emitter-base junction.\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nCalculate the collector-base capacitance of the device of Fig. 2.25. The zero-bias capacitance per unit area of the collector-base junction can be found from Fig. 2.29 to be approximately $10^{-4} \\mathrm{pF} / \\mathrm{mm}^{2}$.

The collector-substrate capacitance consists of three portions: that of the junction between the buried layer and the substrate, that of the sidewall of the isolation diffusion, and that between the epitaxial material and the substrate. Since the substrate has an impurity concentration of about $10^{16} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$, it is more heavily doped than the epi material, and we can analyze both the sidewall and epi-substrate capacitance under the assumption that the junction is a one-sided step junction with the epi material as the lightly doped side. Under this assumption, the capacitance per unit area in these regions is the same as in the collector-base junction.\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nCalculate the collector-substrate capacitance of the standard device of Fig. 2.25. The area of the collector-substrate sidewall is\n\n$$\nA_{\\text {sidewall }}=(17 \\mu \\mathrm{~m})(140 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}+140 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}+95 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}+95 \\mu \\mathrm{~m})\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)=12,550 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2}\n$$\n\nWe will assume that the actual buried layer covers the area defined by the mask, indicated on Fig. 2.25 as an area of $41 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\times 85 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$, plus $8 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ of side-diffusion on each edge. This gives a total area of $57 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\times 101 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$.

The area of the buried layer is\n\n$$\nA_{B L}=57 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\times 101 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}=5757 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2}\n$$\n\nand the zero-bias capacitance from the buried layer to the substrate is thus\n\n$$\nC_{c s 0}(B L)=\\left(5757 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2}\\right)\\left(3.3 \\times 10^{-4} \\mathrm{pF} / \\mu \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\right)=1.89 \\mathrm{pF}\n$$\n\nThe total zero-bias, collector-substrate capacitance is thus\n\n$$\nC_{c s 0}=1.26 \\mathrm{pF}+0.754 \\mathrm{pF}+1.89 \\mathrm{pF}=3.90 \\mathrm{pF}\n$$\n\nEmitter-Base Capacitance. The emitter-base junction of the transistor has a doping profile that is not well approximated by a step junction because the impurity concentration on both sides of the junction varies with distance in a rather complicated way. Furthermore, the sidewall capacitance per unit area is not constant but varies with distance from the surface because the base impurity concentration varies with distance. A precise evaluation of this capacitance can be carried out numerically, but a first-order estimate of the capacitance can be obtained by calculating the capacitance of an abrupt junction with an impurity concentration on the lightly doped side that is equal to the concentration in the base at the edge of the junction. The sidewall contribution is neglected.\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nCalculate the zero-bias, emitter-base junction capacitance of the standard device of Fig. 2.25.\nWe first estimate the impurity concentration at the emitter edge of the base region. From Fig. 2.17, it can be seen that this concentration is approximately $10^{17}$ atoms $/ \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$. From the nomograph of Fig. 2.29, this abrupt junction would have a zero-bias capacitance per unit area of $10^{-3} \\mathrm{pF} / \\mu \\mathrm{m}^{2}$. Since the area of the bottom portion of the emitter-base junction is $25 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\times 20$ $\\mu \\mathrm{m}$, the capacitance of the bottom portion is\n\n$$\nC_{\\text {bottom }}=\\left(500 \\mu^{2}\\right)\\left(10^{-3} \\mathrm{pF} / \\mu \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\right)=0.5 \\mathrm{pF}\n$$\n\nAgain assuming a cylindrical cross section, the sidewall area is given by\n\n$$\nA_{\\text {sidewall }}=2(25 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}+20 \\mu \\mathrm{~m})\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)(2.5 \\mu \\mathrm{~m})=353 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2}\n$$\n\nAssuming that the capacitance per unit area of the sidewall is approximately the same as the bottom,\n\n$$\nC_{\\text {sidewall }}=\\left(353 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2}\\right)\\left(10^{-3} \\mathrm{pF} / \\mu \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\right)=0.35 \\mathrm{pF}\n$$\n\nThe total emitter-base capacitance is\n\n$$\nC_{j e 0}=0.85 \\mathrm{pF}\n$$\n\nCurrent Gain. As described in Chapter 1, the current gain of the transistor depends on minority-carrier lifetime in the base, which affects the base transport factor, and on the diffusion length in the emitter, which affects the emitter efficiency. In analog IC processing, the base minority-carrier lifetime is sufficiently long that the base transport factor is not a limiting factor in the forward current gain in $n p n$ transistors. Because the emitter region is heavily doped with phosphorus, the minority-carrier lifetime is degraded in this region, and current gain is limited primarily by emitter efficiency. ${ }^{12}$ Because the doping level, and hence lifetime, vary with distance in the emitter, the calculation of emitter efficiency for the npn transistor is difficult, and measured parameters must be used. The room-temperature current gain typically lies between 200 and 1000 for these devices. The current gain falls with decreasing temperature, usually to a value of from 0.5 to 0.75 times the room temperature value at $-55^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.\n\nSummary of High-Voltage npn Device Parameters.

The thick epi device is typical of those used in circuits operating at up to 44 V power-supply voltage, while the thinner device can operate up to about 20 V . While the geometry of the thin epi device is smaller, the collector-base capacitance is larger because of the heavier epi doping. The emitter-base capacitance is higher because the base is shallower, and the doping level in the base at the emitter-base junction is higher.\nthinner epitaxial layers can be used, and smaller device geometries can be used as a result. Also shown in Fig. 2.30 are typical parameters for a device made with 1- $\\Omega-\\mathrm{cm}$ epi material, which is $10 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ thick.

The total emitter-base capacitance is \\( C_{j e 0}=0.85 \\mathrm{pF} \\).\n\n**Current Gain** of the transistor depends on the minority-carrier lifetime in the base and the diffusion length in the emitter. In analog IC processing, the base minority-carrier lifetime is sufficiently long, making the base transport factor non-limiting. However, the emitter efficiency is limited by the doping level and lifetime variations in the emitter.\n\n**Summary of High-Voltage npn Device Parameters** for the device in **Figure 2.25** is shown in **Figure 2.30**.

The collector-substrate capacitance consists of three portions: that of the junction between the buried layer and the substrate, that of the sidewall of the isolation diffusion, and that between the epitaxial material and the substrate. Since the substrate has an impurity concentration of about \\( 10^{16} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3} \\), it is more heavily doped than the epi material, and we can analyze both the sidewall and epi-substrate capacitance under the assumption that the junction is a one-sided step junction with the epi material as the lightly doped side. Under this assumption, the capacitance per unit area in these regions is the same as in the collector-base junction.\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nCalculate the collector-substrate capacitance of the standard device in Figure 2.25. The area of the collector-substrate sidewall is:\n\n$$\nA_{\\text {sidewall }}=(17 \\mu \\mathrm{~m})(140 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}+140 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}+95 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}+95 \\mu \\mathrm{~m})\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)=12,550 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2}\n$$\n\nAssuming that the actual buried layer covers the area defined by the mask, indicated on Figure 2.25 as an area of \\( 41 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\times 85 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\), plus \\( 8 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\) of side-diffusion on each edge.

The emitter-base junction of the transistor has a doping profile that is not well approximated by a step junction because the impurity concentration on both sides of the junction varies with distance in a rather complicated way. Furthermore, the sidewall capacitance per unit area is not constant but varies with distance from the surface because the base impurity concentration varies with distance. A precise evaluation of this capacitance can be carried out numerically, but a first-order estimate of the capacitance can be obtained by calculating the capacitance of an abrupt junction with an impurity concentration on the lightly doped side that is equal to the concentration in the base at the edge of the junction. The sidewall contribution is neglected.\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nCalculate the zero-bias, emitter-base junction capacitance of the standard device in Figure 2.25.\nWe first estimate the impurity concentration at the emitter edge of the base region. From Figure 2.17, it can be seen that this concentration is approximately \\( 10^{17} \\) atoms \\( / \\mathrm{cm}^{3} \\). From the nomograph of Figure 2.29, this abrupt junction would have a zero-bias capacitance per unit area of \\( 10^{-3} \\mathrm{pF} / \\mu \\mathrm{m}^{2} \\). Since the area of the bottom portion of the emitter-base junction is \\( 25 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\times 20 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\), the capacitance of the bottom portion is:\n\n$$\nC_{\\text {bottom }}=\\left(500 \\mu^{2}\\right)\\left(10^{-3} \\mathrm{pF} / \\mu \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\right)=0.5 \\mathrm{pF}\n$$\n\nAssuming a cylindrical cross section, the sidewall area is given by:\n\n$$\nA_{\\text {sidewall }}=2(25 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}+20 \\mu \\mathrm{~m})\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)(2.5 \\mu \\mathrm{~m})=353 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2}\n$$\n\nAssuming that the capacitance per unit area of the sidewall is approximately the same as the bottom,\n\n$$\nC_{\\text {sidewall }}=\\left(353 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2}\\right)\\left(10^{-3} \\mathrm{pF} / \\mu \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\right)=0.35 \\mathrm{pF}\n$$\n\nThe total emitter-base capacitance is:\n\n$$\nC_{j e 0}=0.85 \\mathrm{pF}\n$$\n\nCurrent Gain. As described in Chapter 1, the current gain of the transistor depends on minority-carrier lifetime in the base, which affects the base transport factor, and on the diffusion length in the emitter, which affects the emitter efficiency. In analog IC processing, the base minority-carrier lifetime is sufficiently long that the base transport factor is not a limiting factor in the forward current gain in \\( n p n \\) transistors. Because the emitter region is heavily doped with phosphorus, the minority-carrier lifetime is degraded in this region, and current gain is limited primarily by emitter efficiency. Because the doping level, and hence lifetime, vary with distance in the emitter, the calculation of emitter efficiency for the npn transistor is difficult, and measured parameters must be used. The room-temperature current gain typically lies between 200 and 1000 for these devices. The current gain falls with decreasing temperature, usually to a value of from 0.5 to 0.75 times the room temperature value at \\( -55^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} \\).\n\nSummary of High-Voltage npn Device Parameters. A typical set of device parameters for the device in Figure 2.25 is shown in Figure 2.30. This transistor geometry is typical of that used for circuits that must operate at power supply voltages up to 40 V. For lower operating voltages, thinner epitaxial layers can be used, and smaller device geometries can be used as a result. Also shown in Figure 2.30 are typical parameters for a device made with 1- \\( \\Omega-\\mathrm{cm} \\) epi material, which is \\( 10 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\) thick. Such a device is physically smaller and has a collector-emitter breakdown voltage of about 25 V.\n\nAdvanced-Technology Oxide-Isolated npn Bipolar Transistors. The structure of an advanced oxide-isolated, poly-emitter npn bipolar transistor is shown in plan view and cross section in Figure 2.31. Typical parameters for such a device are listed in Figure 2.32. Note the enormous reduction in device size, transit time, and parasitic capacitance compared to the high-voltage, deep-diffused process. These very small devices achieve optimum performance characteristics at relatively low bias currents. The value of \\( \\beta \\) for such a device typically peaks at a collector current of about \\( 50 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\). For these advanced-technology transistors, the use of ion implantation allows precise control of very shallow emitter (0.1 \\( \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\)) and base (0.2 \\( \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\)) regions. The resulting base width is of the order of 0.1 \\( \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\), and the base transit time is about 25 times smaller than the deep-diffused device in Figure 2.17. This is observed in practice, and the ion-implanted transistor has a peak \\( f_{T} \\) of about 13 GHz."

The collector-substrate capacitance consists of three portions: that of the junction between the buried layer and the substrate, that of the sidewall of the isolation diffusion, and that between the epitaxial material and the substrate. Since the substrate has an impurity concentration of about \\(10^{16} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}\\), it is more heavily doped than the epi material, and we can analyze both the sidewall and epi-substrate capacitance under the assumption that the junction is a one-sided step junction with the epi material as the lightly doped side. Under this assumption, the capacitance per unit area in these regions is the same as in the collector-base junction.\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nCalculate the collector-substrate capacitance of the standard device in Figure 2.25. The area of the collector-substrate sidewall is\n\n$$\nA_{\\text {sidewall }}=(17 \\mu \\mathrm{~m})(140 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}+140 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}+95 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}+95 \\mu \\mathrm{~m})\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)=12,550 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2}\n$$\n\nAssuming that the actual buried layer covers the area defined by the mask, indicated on Figure 2.25 as an area of \\(41 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\times 85 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}\\), plus \\(8 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}\\) of side-diffusion on each edge, we get a total area of \\(57 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\times 101 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}\\). The area of the junction between the epi material and the substrate is the total area of the isolated region, minus that of the buried layer.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nA_{\\text {epi-substrate }} & =(140 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\times 95 \\mu \\mathrm{~m})-(57 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\times 101 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}) \\\\\n& =7543 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe capacitances of the sidewall and epi-substrate junctions, using a capacitance per unit area of \\(10^{-4} \\mathrm{pF} / \\mu \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\), are\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nC_{c s 0}(\\text { sidewall }) & =\\left(12,550 \\mu^{2}\\right)\\left(10^{-4} \\mathrm{pF} / \\mu \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\right)=1.26 \\mathrm{pF} \\\\\nC_{c s 0}(\\text { epi-substrate }) & =\\left(7543 \\mu^{2}\\right)\\left(10^{-4} \\mathrm{pF} / \\mu \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\right)=0.754 \\mathrm{pF}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFor the junction between the buried layer and the substrate, the lightly doped side of the junction is the substrate. Assuming a substrate doping level of \\(10^{16}\\) atoms \\(/ \\mathrm{cm}^{3}\\), and a built-in voltage of 0.52 V, we can calculate the zero-bias capacitance per unit area as \\(3.3 \\times\\) \\(10^{-4} \\mathrm{pF} / \\mathrm{mm}^{2}\\). The area of the buried layer is\n\n$$\nA_{B L}=57 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\times 101 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}=5757 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2}\n$$\n\nand the zero-bias capacitance from the buried layer to the substrate is thus\n\n$$\nC_{c s 0}(B L)=\\left(5757 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2}\\right)\\left(3.3 \\times 10^{-4} \\mathrm{pF} / \\mu \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\right)=1.89 \\mathrm{pF}\n$$\n\nThe total zero-bias, collector-substrate capacitance is thus\n\n$$\nC_{c s 0}=1.26 \\mathrm{pF}+0.754 \\mathrm{pF}+1.89 \\mathrm{pF}=3.90 \\mathrm{pF}\n$$\n\nEmitter-Base Capacitance. The emitter-base junction of the transistor has a doping profile that is not well approximated by a step junction because the impurity concentration on both sides of the junction varies with distance in a rather complicated way. Furthermore, the sidewall capacitance per unit area is not constant but varies with distance from the surface because the base impurity concentration varies with distance. A precise evaluation of this capacitance can be carried out numerically, but a first-order estimate of the capacitance can be obtained by calculating the capacitance of an abrupt junction with an impurity concentration on the lightly doped side that is equal to the concentration in the base at the edge of the junction. The sidewall contribution is neglected.\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nCalculate the zero-bias, emitter-base junction capacitance of the standard device in Figure 2.25.\nWe first estimate the impurity concentration at the emitter edge of the base region. From Figure 2.17, it can be seen that this concentration is approximately \\(10^{17}\\) atoms \\(/ \\mathrm{cm}^{3}\\). From the nomograph of Figure 2.29, this abrupt junction would have a zero-bias capacitance per unit area of \\(10^{-3} \\mathrm{pF} / \\mu \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\). Since the area of the bottom portion of the emitter-base junction is \\(25 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\times 20\\) \\(\\mu \\mathrm{m}\\), the capacitance of the bottom portion is\n\n$$\nC_{\\text {bottom }}=\\left(500 \\mu^{2}\\right)\\left(10^{-3} \\mathrm{pF} / \\mu \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\right)=0.5 \\mathrm{pF}\n$$\n\nAssuming a cylindrical cross section, the sidewall area is given by\n\n$$\nA_{\\text {sidewall }}=2(25 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}+20 \\mu \\mathrm{~m})\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)(2.5 \\mu \\mathrm{~m})=353 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2}\n$$\n\nAssuming that the capacitance per unit area of the sidewall is approximately the same as the bottom,\n\n$$\nC_{\\text {sidewall }}=\\left(353 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2}\\right)\\left(10^{-3} \\mathrm{pF} / \\mu \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\right)=0.35 \\mathrm{pF}\n$$\n\nThe total emitter-base capacitance is\n\n$$\nC_{j e 0}=0.85 \\mathrm{pF}\n$$\n\nCurrent Gain. As described in Chapter 1, the current gain of the transistor depends on minority-carrier lifetime in the base, which affects the base transport factor, and on the diffusion length in the emitter, which affects the emitter efficiency. In analog IC processing, the base minority-carrier lifetime is sufficiently long that the base transport factor is not a limiting factor in the forward current gain in \\( n p n \\) transistors. Because the emitter region is heavily doped with phosphorus, the minority-carrier lifetime is degraded in this region, and current gain is limited primarily by emitter efficiency. Because the doping level, and hence lifetime, vary with distance in the emitter, the calculation of emitter efficiency for the npn transistor is difficult, and measured parameters must be used. The room-temperature current gain typically lies between 200 and 1000 for these devices. The current gain falls with decreasing temperature, usually to a value of from 0.5 to 0.75 times the room temperature value at \\(-55^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\).\n\nSummary of High-Voltage npn Device Parameters. A typical set of device parameters for the device in Figure 2.25 is shown in Figure 2.30. This transistor geometry is typical of that used for circuits that must operate at power supply voltages up to 40 V.

The thick epi device is typical of those used in circuits operating at up to 44 V power-supply voltage, while the thinner device can operate up to about 20 V. Although the geometry of the thin epi device is smaller, the collector-base capacitance is larger because of the heavier epi doping. The emitter-base capacitance is higher because the base is shallower, and the doping level in the base at the emitter-base junction is higher. Thinner epitaxial layers can be used, and smaller device geometries can be employed as a result. Also shown in Figure 2.30 are typical parameters for a device made with 1- \\(\\Omega-\\mathrm{cm}\\) epi material, which is \\(10 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}\\) thick. Such a device is physically smaller and has a collector-emitter breakdown voltage of about 25 V.\n\nAdvanced-Technology Oxide-Isolated npn Bipolar Transistors. The structure of an advanced oxide-isolated, poly-emitter npn bipolar transistor is shown in plan view and cross section in Figure 2.31. Typical parameters for such a device are listed in Figure 2.32. Note the enormous reduction in device size, transit time, and parasitic capacitance compared to the high-voltage, deep-diffused process. These very small devices achieve optimum performance characteristics at relatively low bias currents. The value of \\(\\beta\\) for such a device typically peaks at a collector current of about \\(50 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}\\). For these advanced-technology transistors, the use of ion implantation allows precise control of very shallow emitter \\(0.1 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}\\) and base \\(0.2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}\\) regions."

The emitter-base junction of the transistor has a doping profile that is not well approximated by a step junction because the impurity concentration on both sides of the junction varies with distance in a rather complicated way. Furthermore, the sidewall capacitance per unit area is not constant but varies with distance from the surface because the base impurity concentration varies with distance. A precise evaluation of this capacitance can be carried out numerically, but a first-order estimate of the capacitance can be obtained by calculating the capacitance of an abrupt junction with an impurity concentration on the lightly doped side that is equal to the concentration in the base at the edge of the junction. The sidewall contribution is neglected.\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nCalculate the zero-bias, emitter-base junction capacitance of the standard device of Fig. 2.25.\nWe first estimate the impurity concentration at the emitter edge of the base region. From Fig. 2.17, it can be seen that this concentration is approximately \\( 10^{17} \\) atoms \\( / \\mathrm{cm}^{3} \\). From the nomograph of Fig. 2.29, this abrupt junction would have a zero-bias capacitance per unit area of \\( 10^{-3} \\mathrm{pF} / \\mu \\mathrm{m}^{2} \\). Since the area of the bottom portion of the emitter-base junction is \\( 25 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\times 20 \\) \\( \\mu \\mathrm{m} \\), the capacitance of the bottom portion is\n\n$$\nC_{\\text {bottom }}=\\left(500 \\mu^{2}\\right)\\left(10^{-3} \\mathrm{pF} / \\mu \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\right)=0.5 \\mathrm{pF}\n$$\n\nAgain assuming a cylindrical cross section, the sidewall area is given by\n\n$$\nA_{\\text {sidewall }}=2(25 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}+20 \\mu \\mathrm{~m})\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)(2.5 \\mu \\mathrm{~m})=353 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2}\n$$\n\nAssuming that the capacitance per unit area of the sidewall is approximately the same as the bottom,\n\n$$\nC_{\\text {sidewall }}=\\left(353 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2}\\right)\\left(10^{-3} \\mathrm{pF} / \\mu \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\right)=0.35 \\mathrm{pF}\n$$\n\nThe total emitter-base capacitance is\n\n$$\nC_{j e 0}=0.85 \\mathrm{pF}\n$$\n\nCurrent Gain. As described in Chapter 1, the current gain of the transistor depends on minority-carrier lifetime in the base, which affects the base transport factor, and on the diffusion length in the emitter, which affects the emitter efficiency. In analog IC processing, the base minority-carrier lifetime is sufficiently long that the base transport factor is not a limiting factor in the forward current gain in \\( n p n \\) transistors. Because the emitter region is heavily doped with phosphorus, the minority-carrier lifetime is degraded in this region, and current gain is limited primarily by emitter efficiency. ${ }^{12}$ Because the doping level, and hence lifetime, vary with distance in the emitter, the calculation of emitter efficiency for the npn transistor is difficult, and measured parameters must be used. The room-temperature current gain typically lies between 200 and 1000 for these devices. The current gain falls with decreasing temperature, usually to a value of from 0.5 to 0.75 times the room temperature value at \\( -55^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} \\).\n\nSummary of High-Voltage npn Device Parameters.

This limitation spurred the creation of various pnp transistor structures that are compatible with standard IC fabrication processes.\n\nThese devices employ lightly doped n-type epitaxial material as the transistor base, which generally leads to inferior frequency response and high-current behavior compared to npn devices, despite their usefulness. This section will discuss the lateral pnp and substrate pnp transistor structures.\n\nA lateral pnp transistor, typically fabricated in a high-voltage process, is depicted in Figure 2.33a. The emitter and collector are formed from the same diffusion that creates the base of the npn transistors. The collector is a p-type ring encircling the emitter, and the base contact is established in the n-type epitaxial material outside the collector ring. Figure 2.33b illustrates the flow of minority carriers across the base. Holes are injected from the emitter, flow parallel to the surface across the n-type base region, and are ideally collected by the p-type collector before reaching the base contact. Thus, the transistor action is lateral rather than vertical, as seen in npn transistors. The primary drawback of this structure is that the base region is more lightly doped than the collector. Consequently, the collector-base depletion layer extends almost entirely into the base. The base must be sufficiently wide to prevent the depletion layer from reaching the emitter when the maximum collector-emitter voltage is applied. In a typical analog IC process, this depletion layer spans 6 to 8 μm when the collector-emitter voltage is around 40 V. Hence, the minimum base width for such a device is approximately 8 μm, and the minimum base transit time can be calculated using Equation (2.20).\n\nUsing a base width of 8 μm and a hole diffusion coefficient of 10 cm²/s in Equation (2.20) yields a base transit time of 32 ns. This corresponds to a peak cutoff frequency (f_T) of 5 MHz, which is 100 times lower than that of a typical npn transistor in the same process.\n\nLateral pnp transistors typically exhibit low current gain due to several factors. Firstly, minority carriers (holes) in the base are injected not only laterally but also downward from the emitter, with some being collected by the substrate, which acts as the collector of a parasitic vertical pnp transistor. The buried layer establishes a retarding field to counteract this, but it still causes a measurable reduction in β_F. Secondly, the pnp emitter is not as heavily doped as the npn emitter, leading to suboptimal emitter injection efficiency. Finally, the wide base of the lateral pnp results in low emitter injection efficiency and a low base transport factor.\n\nAnother disadvantage of the lightly doped base region is that the current gain decreases rapidly with increasing collector current due to high-level injection. Figure 2.34 shows the minority-carrier distribution in the base of a lateral pnp transistor in the forward-active region. The collector current per unit of cross-sectional area can be derived from Equation (1.32) as Equation (2.21). Rearranging this relationship allows us to calculate the minority-carrier density at the emitter edge of the base, as shown in Equation (2.22). When this concentration is much lower than the majority-carrier density in the base, low-level injection conditions prevail, and the base minority-carrier lifetime remains constant. However, when the minority-carrier density approaches the majority-carrier density, the majority-carrier density must rise to maintain charge neutrality in the base. This results in a decrease in β_F for two reasons: a reduction in the effective lifetime of minority carriers in the base due to increased recombination with majority carriers, and an effective increase in base doping density, which decreases emitter injection efficiency. These mechanisms are present in npn transistors as well but occur at higher current levels due to the higher base doping density in npn transistors.\n\nThe collector current at which these effects become significant can be determined for a lateral pnp transistor by equating the minority-carrier concentration from Equation (2.22) to the equilibrium majority-carrier concentration, as shown in Equation (2.23). From Equation (2.23), we can calculate the collector current for the onset of high-level injection in a pnp transistor, as given in Equation (2.24). Note that this current is directly proportional to the base doping density in the transistor. Since this density is relatively low in lateral pnp transistors, the current density at which the current gain begins to fall is also low.\n\nLateral pnp transistors are also commonly used in shallow oxide-isolated bipolar IC technologies. The device structure is similar to that shown in Figure 2.33, but the device area is significantly smaller, and junction isolation is replaced by oxide isolation. Typical parameters for such a device are listed in Figure 2.32. Similar to npn transistors, we observe substantial reductions in device transit time and parasitic capacitance compared to high-voltage, thick-epi processes. The β value for such a device typically peaks at a collector current of around 50 nA.\n\nAn example calculation demonstrates how to determine the collector current at which the current gain starts to decline for the pnp structure of Figure 2.33a. Given the effective cross-sectional area of the emitter, the majority-carrier density, and the base width and hole diffusion coefficient, we can substitute these values into Equation (2.24) to find the collector current at which the current gain begins to fall.\n\nThe typical lateral pnp structure of Figure 2.33a exhibits a low-current β of approximately 30 to 50, which decreases at collector currents of a few tens of microamperes and falls to less than 10 at a collector current of 1 mA. A set of typical parameters for a structure of this type is shown in Figure 2.35. It should be noted that in lateral pnp transistors, the substrate junction capacitance appears between the base and the substrate.\n\nSubstrate pnp transistors are designed to address the poor high-current performance of lateral pnp transistors, which is due to the relatively small effective cross-sectional area of the emitter resulting from lateral injection. A common application for pnp transistors is in Class-B output stages, where the devices are required to operate at collector currents in the 10-mA range. A lateral pnp designed for such currents would necessitate a large die area. In this scenario, a different structure is often employed, where the substrate itself serves as the collector instead of a diffused p-type region. Such a substrate pnp transistor in a high-voltage, thick-epi process is shown in Figure 2.36a. The p-type emitter diffusion for this particular substrate pnp geometry is rectangular with a rectangular hole in the center. In this hole, an n+ region is formed with the npn emitter diffusion to provide a contact for the n-type base. Due to the lightly doped base material, the series base resistance can become quite high if the base contact is distant from the active base region. In this structure, the n+ base contact diffusion is allowed to come into contact with the p-type emitter diffusion to achieve a low-resistance base contact as close as possible to the active base. The only drawback of this approach, in a substrate pnp structure, is that the emitter-base breakdown voltage is reduced to about 7 V. If a higher emitter-base breakdown voltage is needed, the p-emitter diffusion must be separated from the n+ base contact diffusion by a distance of approximately 10 to 15 μm.

This section will discuss the lateral pnp and substrate pnp structures.\n\nA typical lateral pnp transistor structure, fabricated in a high-voltage process, is depicted in Fig. 2.33a. The emitter and collector are formed using the same diffusion that forms the base of the npn transistors. The collector is a p-type ring around the emitter, and the base contact is made in the n-type epi material outside the collector ring.

The base region must then be made wide enough so that the depletion layer does not reach the emitter when the maximum collector-emitter voltage is applied. In a typical analog IC process, the width of this depletion layer is 6 μm to 8 μm when the collector-emitter voltage is in the 40-V range. Thus, the minimum base width for such a device is about 8 μm, and the minimum base transit time can be estimated as\n\n$$\n\\tau_{F}=\\frac{W_{B}^{2}}{2 D_{p}}\n$$\n\nUsing \\(W_{B}=8 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}\\) and \\(D_{p}=10 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \\mathrm{s}\\) (for holes) in the equation gives\n\n$$\n\\tau_{F}=32 \\mathrm{~ns}\n$$\n\nThis corresponds to a peak \\(f_{T}\\) of 5 MHz, which is 100 times lower than a typical npn transistor in the same process.\n\nThe current gain of lateral pnp transistors tends to be low due to several factors. Firstly, minority carriers (holes) in the base are injected downward from the emitter as well as laterally, and some are collected by the substrate, which acts as the collector of a parasitic vertical pnp transistor.

Finally, the wide base of the lateral pnp results in both a low emitter injection efficiency and a low base transport factor.\n\nAnother drawback resulting from the use of a lightly doped base region is that the current gain of the device falls very rapidly with increasing collector current due to high-level injection. The minority-carrier distribution in the base of a lateral pnp transistor in the forward-active region is shown in Fig. 2.34. The collector current per unit of cross-sectional area can be obtained as\n\n$$\nJ_{p}=q D_{p} \\frac{p_{n}(0)}{W_{B}}\n$$\n\nInverting this relationship, we can calculate the minority-carrier density at the emitter edge of the base as\n\n$$\np_{n}(0)=\\frac{J_{p} W_{B}}{q D_{p}}\n$$\n\nAs long as this concentration is much less than the majority-carrier density in the base, low-level injection conditions exist, and the base minority-carrier lifetime remains constant. However, when the minority-carrier density becomes comparable with the majority-carrier density, the majority-carrier density must increase to maintain charge neutrality in the base. This causes a decrease in \\(\\beta_{F}\\) for two reasons. Firstly, there is a decrease in the effective lifetime of minority carriers in the base due to an increased number of majority carriers with which recombination can occur. Thus, the base transport factor decreases. Secondly, the increase in the majority-carrier density represents an effective increase in base doping density, causing a decrease in emitter injection efficiency. Both these mechanisms are also present in npn transistors but occur at much higher current levels due to the higher doping density in the base of the npn transistor.\n\nThe collector current at which these effects become significant can be calculated for a lateral pnp transistor by equating the minority-carrier concentration given by the equation to the equilibrium majority-carrier concentration. Thus\n\n$$\n\\frac{J_{p} W_{B}}{q D_{p}}=n_{n} \\simeq N_{D}\n$$\n\nwhere the majority-carrier density is substituted for \\(n_{n}\\), and \\(N_{D}\\) is the donor density in the pnp base (npn collector). From this equation, we can calculate the collector current for the onset of high-level injection in a pnp transistor as\n\n$$\nI_{C}=\\frac{q A N_{D} D_{p}}{W_{B}}\n$$\n\nwhere \\(A\\) is the effective area of the emitter-base junction. Note that this current depends directly on the base doping density in the transistor, and since this is quite low in a lateral pnp transistor, the current density at which this fall-off begins is quite low.\n\nLateral pnp transistors are also widely used in shallow oxide-isolated bipolar IC technologies. The device structure used is essentially identical to that of Fig. 2.33, except that the device area is orders of magnitude smaller, and the junction isolation is replaced by oxide isolation.

One reason for the poor high-current performance of the lateral pnp is the relatively small effective cross-sectional area of the emitter, which results from the lateral nature of the injection. A common application for a pnp transistor is in a Class-B output stage where the device is called on to operate at collector currents in the 10-mA range. A lateral pnp designed to do this would require a large amount of die area. In this application, a different structure is usually used, where the substrate itself is used as the collector instead of a diffused p-type region. Such a substrate pnp transistor in a high-voltage, thick-epi process is shown in Fig. 2.36a. The p-type emitter diffusion for this particular substrate pnp geometry is rectangular with a rectangular hole in the middle. In this hole, an n+ region is formed with the npn emitter diffusion to provide a contact for the n-type base. Because of the lightly doped base material, the series base resistance can become quite large if the base contact is far removed from the active base region. In this particular structure, the n+ base contact diffusion is actually allowed to come in contact with the p-type emitter diffusion to get the low-resistance base contact diffusion as close as possible to the active base. The only drawback of this, in a substrate pnp structure, is that the emitter-base breakdown voltage is reduced to approximately 7 V. If larger emitter-base breakdown is required, then the p-emitter diffusion must be separated from the n+ base contact diffusion by a distance of about 10 μm to 15 μm. Many variations exist on the substrate pnp geometry shown in Fig. 2.36a, and they can also be realized in thin-epi, oxide-isolated processes.\n\nThe minority-carrier flow in the forward-active region is illustrated in Fig. 2.36b. The principal advantage of this device is that the current flow is vertical, and the effective cross-sectional area of the emitter is much larger than in the case of the lateral pnp for the same overall device size. The device is restricted to use in emitter-follower configurations, however, since the collector is electrically identical with the substrate that must be tied to the most negative circuit potential. Other than the better current-handling capability, the properties of substrate pnp transistors are similar to those for lateral pnp transistors since the base width is similar in both cases. An important consideration in the design of substrate pnp structures is that the collector current flows in the p-substrate region, which usually has relatively high resistivity. Thus, unless care is taken to provide an adequate low-resistance path for the collector current, a high series collector resistance can result. This resistance can degrade device performance in two ways. Firstly, large collector currents in the pnp can cause enough voltage drop in the substrate region itself that other substrate-epitaxial layer junctions within the circuit can become forward biased. This usually has a catastrophic effect on circuit performance. Secondly, the effects of the collector-base junction capacitance on the pnp are multiplied by the Miller effect resulting from the large series collector resistance, as described further in Chapter 7. To minimize these effects, the collector contact is usually made by contacting the isolation diffusion immediately adjacent to the substrate pnp itself with metallization. For high-current devices, this isolation diffusion contact is made to surround the device to as great an extent as possible.\n\nThe properties of a typical substrate pnp transistor in a high-voltage, thick-epi process are summarized in Fig. 2.37. The dependence of current gain on collector current for a typical npn, lateral pnp, and substrate pnp transistor in a high-voltage, thick-epi process are shown in Fig. 2.38. The low-current reduction in \\(\\beta\\), which is apparent for all three devices, is due to recombination in the base-emitter depletion region, described in Section 1.3.5."

    "text": "Rephrased Text:\n\nThe fabrication process for integrated-circuit bipolar transistors stems from the technology used to create double-diffused epitaxial npn transistors. This process naturally yields high-performance npn transistors. However, fabricating pnp transistors with equivalent performance within the same process is challenging. Early analog integrated circuits omitted pnp transistors due to this difficulty. The absence of a complementary device for functions such as biasing, level shifting, and serving as load devices in amplifier stages significantly constrained the performance of analog circuits. Consequently, various pnp transistor structures were developed to align with the standard IC fabrication process.\n\nThese pnp devices employ the lightly doped n-type epitaxial material as the transistor base, leading to inferior frequency response and high-current behavior compared to npn devices, despite their utility. This section details the lateral pnp and substrate pnp structures.\n\nLateral pnp transistors are fabricated using a high-voltage process, featuring an emitter and collector formed by the same diffusion that shapes the npn transistor base. The collector is a p-type ring encircling the emitter, and the base contact is established in the n-type epitaxial material beyond the collector ring. The base region, being more lightly doped than the collector, necessitates a wider base to prevent the collector-base depletion layer from reaching the emitter under maximum collector-emitter voltage.\n\nThe lateral pnp transistor's current gain is typically low due to several factors. Minority carriers (holes)注入 into the base are also collected by the substrate, acting as a parasitic vertical pnp transistor. Additionally, the emitter's lower doping level in pnp devices compared to npn devices affects injection efficiency. The wide base of lateral pnp transistors further diminishes both emitter injection efficiency and base transport factor.\n\nAnother issue with the lightly doped base region is the rapid decline in current gain with increasing collector current due to high-level injection. The minority-carrier distribution in the base of a lateral pnp transistor in the forward-active region exhibits a linear decrease from the emitter side towards the collector side.\n\nLateral pnp transistors are also employed in shallow oxide-isolated bipolar IC technologies, with device structures similar to those in high-voltage processes but with significantly reduced areas and oxide isolation replacing junction isolation. These devices showcase reduced transit times and parasitic capacitance.\n\nSubstrate pnp transistors are designed to overcome the high-current performance limitations of lateral pnp transistors by using the substrate as the collector. This structure allows for a larger effective cross-sectional area of the emitter and is suited for emitter-follower configurations. However, the substrate pnp transistor shares similar properties with lateral pnp transistors due to the comparable base width.\n\nAn important design consideration for substrate pnp structures is the provision of a low-resistance path for the collector current, as the p-substrate region typically has higher resistivity. Collector contact is often made by contacting the isolation diffusion adjacent to the substrate pnp to minimize series collector resistance and its effects on device performance.\n\nThe properties of substrate pnp transistors in high-voltage, thick-epi processes are summarized, with current gain dependence on collector current demonstrated for npn, lateral pnp, and substrate pnp transistors. The low-current reduction in current gain observed in all three devices is attributed to recombination in the base-emitter depletion region."
