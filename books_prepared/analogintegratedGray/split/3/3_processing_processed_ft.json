The design philosophy here is to minimize the number of active components since they are more expensive than passive ones in discrete form. The circuit uses capacitors for interstage coupling and bypassing. In contrast, the CMOS integrated audio amplifier (Fig. 3.2) employs many more transistors (both NMOS and PMOS) and aims to minimize total resistance. This design philosophy is driven by the fact that in integrated circuits, transistors occupy less area and are cheaper to fabricate than large capacitors. The CMOS circuit avoids large capacitors, enabling direct coupling between stages, and uses transistor current sources for biasing, reflecting the constraints and advantages of monolithic construction."

Initially, the low-frequency hybrid-π model includes two dependent current sources (gmVgs and gmbVbs) and a resistor (ro) between the source and drain. In the first step, these two current sources are combined into a single current source with value (g_m + g_mb) v_sg. Next, this combined current source is split into two current sources: one from the source to the gate and the other from the gate to the drain. Finally, the current source from the source to the gate, which is controlled by the voltage across itself, is replaced by a resistor of value 1/(g_m + g_mb)."

This modeling helps in understanding the circuit's behavior and deriving the relationships between the input voltage and the drain currents."

As illustrated in a conceptual diagram, the dc behavior of the amplifier containing the mismatches is identical to an ideal amplifier with no mismatches but with the input offset voltage source added in series with the input and the input offset current source in shunt across the input terminals. Both quantities are required to represent the effect of mismatch in general so that the model is valid for any source resistance. For example, if the input terminals are driven by an ideal voltage source with zero resistance, the input offset current does not contribute to the amplifier output, and the offset voltage generator is needed to model the effect of mismatch. On the other hand, if the input terminals are driven by an ideal current source with infinite resistance, the input offset voltage does not contribute to the amplifier output, and the offset current generator is needed to model the effect of mismatch.
