    "text": "The fundamental parameter of an amplifier is its gain. Given that amplifiers can be connected to diverse sources and loads, understanding how gain depends on source and load resistance is crucial. One method to examine this dependency is by incorporating these resistances into the amplifier analysis. However, this approach necessitates a new analysis for each change in source or load resistance. To streamline this process, amplifiers are often represented as two-port equivalent networks. As depicted in Fig. 3.3, two-port networks feature four terminals and four port variables (a voltage and a current at each port). A pair of terminals forms a port if the current entering one terminal equals the current exiting the other. In modeling an amplifier, one port signifies the input characteristics and the other the output. Each port has one independently settable variable, while the other variable depends on the two-port network and the independent variables. This dependency is articulated through two equations. Here, we focus on admittance-parameter equations, where terminal currents are treated as dependent variables controlled by independent terminal voltages, reflecting the common practice of modeling transistors with voltage-controlled current sources. If the network is linear and devoid of independent sources, the admittance-parameter equations are:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ni_{1} & =y_{11} v_{1}+y_{12} v_{2}  \\tag{3.1}\\\\\ni_{2} & =y_{21} v_{1}+y_{22} v_{2} \\tag{3.2}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThese equations use small-signal quantities, as transistors exhibit approximate linearity only for small signals around a fixed operating point. An equivalent circuit for these equations is illustrated in Fig. 3.4. The parameters can be derived and interpreted as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& y_{11}=\\left.\\frac{i_{1}}{v_{1}}\\right|_{v_{2}=0}=\\text { Input admittance with the output short-circuited }  \\tag{3.3}\\\\\n& y_{12}=\\left.\\frac{i_{1}}{v_{2}}\\right|_{v_{1}=0}=\\text { Reverse transconductance with the input short-circuited }  \\tag{3.4}\\\\\n& y_{21}=\\left.\\frac{i_{2}}{v_{1}}\\right|_{v_{2}=0}=\\text { Forward transconductance with the output short-circuited }  \\tag{3.5}\\\\\n& y_{22}=\\left.\\frac{i_{2}}{v_{2}}\\right|_{v_{1}=0}=\\text { Output admittance with the input short-circuited } \\tag{3.6}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe $y_{12}$ parameter indicates feedback in the amplifier. When signals travel both from output to input and from input to output, the amplifier is termed bilateral. Often, especially at low frequencies, this feedback is negligible, allowing $y_{12}$ to be assumed zero, making the amplifier unilateral and characterized by the remaining three parameters. With $y_{12}=0$, $y_{21}$ is typically referred to as the short-circuit transconductance, denoted $G_{m}$. For unilateral amplifiers, calculating $y_{11}$ simplifies since the output port connections do not affect the input admittance.\n\nInstead of calculating $y_{11}$ and $y_{22}$, we frequently determine their reciprocals, the input and output impedances $Z_{i}=1 / y_{11}$ and $Z_{o}=1 / y_{22}$, as shown in the unilateral two-port model of Fig. 3.5a. Additionally, we may calculate the open-circuit voltage gain $a_{v}$ instead of $G_{m}=y_{21}$. This substitution is justified by converting the Norton-equivalent output model in Fig. 3.5a to the Thévenin-equivalent output model in Fig. 3.5b. Generally, knowing any two of $G_{m}, Z_{o}$, and $a_{v}$ allows determination of the third, as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\na_{v}=\\left.\\frac{v_{2}}{v_{1}}\\right|_{i_{2}=0}=-G_{m} Z_{o} \\tag{3.7}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nOnce two of these parameters and the input impedance are known, analyzing the effects of loading at the input and output ports becomes feasible. At low frequencies, input and output impedances are predominantly resistive. Thus, we will often characterize the low-frequency behavior of amplifiers by determining the input and output resistances, $R_{i}$ and $R_{o}$, along with $G_{m}$ or $a_{v}$."

When a signal travels both from the output back to the input and from the input to the output, the amplifier is termed bilateral. In many practical scenarios, particularly at low frequencies, this feedback is insignificant, and $y_{12}$ is assumed to be zero, making the amplifier unilateral and characterized by the other three parameters. With $y_{12}=0$, the model includes only one transconductance, $y_{21}$, commonly referred to as the short-circuit transconductance, denoted as $G_{m}$ in this book. For a unilateral amplifier, the calculation of $y_{11}$ simplifies from (3.3) because the output port connections do not affect the input admittance when $y_{12}=0$.\n\nInstead of calculating $y_{11}$ and $y_{22}$, we often determine their reciprocals, the input and output impedances $Z_{i}=1 / y_{11}$ and $Z_{o}=1 / y_{22}$, as shown in the unilateral two-port model of Fig. 3.5a. Additionally, rather than calculating the short-circuit transconductance $G_{m}=y_{21}$, we sometimes compute the open-circuit voltage gain $a_{v}$. This substitution is justified by converting the Norton-equivalent output model in Fig. 3.5a to the Thévenin-equivalent output model in Fig. 3.5b. Generally, finding any two of the three parameters, including $G_{m}, Z_{o}$, and $a_{v}$, specifies the third parameter because\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\na_{v}=\\left.\\frac{v_{2}}{v_{1}}\\right|_{i_{2}=0}=-G_{m} Z_{o} \\tag{3.7}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nOnce two of these parameters and the input impedance are known, it is possible to calculate the effects of loading at the input and output ports. At low frequencies, the input and output impedances are usually dominated by resistances. Therefore, we will characterize the low-frequency behavior of many amplifiers in this book by determining the input and output resistances, $R_{i}$ and $R_{o}$, as well as $G_{m}$ or $a_{v}$.\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nA unilateral amplifier's two-port model is shown in Fig. 3.6. Assuming $R_{i}=1 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega, R_{o}=1 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega$, and $G_{m}=1 \\mathrm{~mA} / \\mathrm{V}$, let $R_{S}$ and $R_{L}$ represent the source resistance of the input generator and the load resistance, respectively.

    "text": "The fundamental characteristic of an amplifier is its gain. Given that amplifiers can be connected to diverse sources and loads, understanding how gain depends on source and load resistance is crucial. One method to study this dependency is by incorporating these resistances into amplifier analysis. However, this method necessitates a new analysis for each change in source or load resistance. To streamline this process, amplifiers are frequently represented as two-port equivalent networks. As depicted in Fig. 3.3, two-port networks have four terminals and four port variables (one voltage and one current per port). A pair of terminals forms a port if the current entering one terminal equals the current exiting the other. In modeling an amplifier, one port depicts the input characteristics and the other the output characteristics. Each port has one independent variable and one dependent on the two-port network and the independent variables. This dependency is described by two equations. Here, we focus on admittance-parameter equations, where terminal currents are treated as dependent variables controlled by independent terminal voltages, since transistors are typically modeled with voltage-controlled current sources. If the network is linear and devoid of independent sources, the admittance-parameter equations are:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ni_{1} & =y_{11} v_{1}+y_{12} v_{2}  \\tag{3.1}\\\\\ni_{2} & =y_{21} v_{1}+y_{22} v_{2} \\tag{3.2}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThese equations use small-signal quantities because transistors exhibit approximately linear behavior only for small signals around a fixed operating point. An equivalent circuit for these equations is illustrated in Fig. 3.4.

With $y_{12}=0$, $y_{21}$ is typically referred to as the short-circuit transconductance, denoted $G_{m}$. In unilateral amplifiers, calculating $y_{11}$ is simplified since the output port connections do not affect the input admittance.\n\nInstead of computing $y_{11}$ and $y_{22}$, we often determine their reciprocals, the input and output impedances $Z_{i}=1 / y_{11}$ and $Z_{o}=1 / y_{22}$, as shown in the unilateral two-port model in Fig. 3.5a. Additionally, we may calculate the open-circuit voltage gain $a_{v}$ instead of $G_{m}=y_{21}$. This substitution is validated by converting the Norton-equivalent output model in Fig. 3.5a to the Thévenin-equivalent output model in Fig. 3.5b.

    "text": "The fundamental parameter of an amplifier is its gain. Given that amplifiers can be connected to a diverse range of sources and loads, predicting how the gain depends on these resistances is crucial. One method to observe this dependency is by incorporating these resistances into the amplifier analysis. However, this approach necessitates a new analysis each time the source or load resistance changes. To streamline this process, amplifiers are frequently modeled as two-port equivalent networks. As depicted in Fig. 3.3, two-port networks have four terminals and four port variables (a voltage and a current at each port). A pair of terminals forms a port if the current entering one terminal equals the current exiting the other. In modeling an amplifier, one port represents the input characteristics and the other the output. One variable at each port can be set independently, while the other is dependent on the two-port network and the independent variables. This dependency is expressed through two equations. We will focus on admittance-parameter equations, where terminal currents are treated as dependent variables controlled by the independent terminal voltages, as we typically model transistors using voltage-controlled current sources. If the network is linear and\n\n**Figure 3.3 Two-port-network block diagram description:**\nThe diagram labeled \"Figure 3.3 Two-port-network block diagram\" illustrates a two-port network system.

This is essential for analyzing small-signal models in electrical engineering, where understanding voltage and current interactions is key for designing and optimizing circuits.\n\n**Figure 3.3 Two-port-network block diagram.**\n\n**Figure 3.4 description:**\n[\nname: y11, type: Resistor, value: y11, ports: {N1: v1, N2: GND}\nname: y12, type: CurrentControlledCurrentSource, value: y12v2, ports: {Np: v1, Nn: GND}\nname: y21, type: CurrentControlledCurrentSource, value: y21v1, ports: {Np: v2, Nn: GND}\nname: y22, type: Resistor, value: y22, ports: {N1: v2, N2: GND}\n]\nextrainfo: This circuit represents an admittance-parameter two-port network, modeling linear systems like transistors using small-signal analysis to relate input voltages to output currents.\n\ncontains no independent sources, the admittance-parameter equations are:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ni_{1} & =y_{11} v_{1}+y_{12} v_{2}  \\tag{3.1}\\\\\ni_{2} & =y_{21} v_{1}+y_{22} v_{2} \\tag{3.2}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe voltages and currents in these equations are deliberately written as small-signal quantities because transistors exhibit approximately linear behavior only for small signals around a fixed operating point. An equivalent circuit for these equations is shown in Fig. 3.4. The parameters can be determined and interpreted as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& y_{11}=\\left.\\frac{i_{1}}{v_{1}}\\right|_{v_{2}=0}=\\text { Input admittance with the output short-circuited }  \\tag{3.3}\\\\\n& y_{12}=\\left.\\frac{i_{1}}{v_{2}}\\right|_{v_{1}=0}=\\text { Reverse transconductance with the input short-circuited }  \\tag{3.4}\\\\\n& y_{21}=\\left.\\frac{i_{2}}{v_{1}}\\right|_{v_{2}=0}=\\text { Forward transconductance with the output short-circuited }  \\tag{3.5}\\\\\n& y_{22}=\\left.\\frac{i_{2}}{v_{2}}\\right|_{v_{1}=0}=\\text { Output admittance with the input short-circuited } \\tag{3.6}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe $y_{12}$ parameter signifies feedback in the amplifier. When signals propagate both backward from the output to the input and forward from the input to the output, the amplifier is termed bilateral. In many practical scenarios, especially at low frequencies, this feedback is negligible, and $y_{12}$ is assumed to be zero, making the amplifier unilateral and characterized by the remaining three parameters. With $y_{12}=0$, the model includes only one transconductance, $y_{21}$, commonly referred to as the short-circuit transconductance, denoted as $G_{m}$ in this book. For a unilateral amplifier, calculating $y_{11}$ is simplified from the expression in (3.3) because the output port connections do not affect the input admittance when $y_{12}=0$.\n\nInstead of calculating $y_{11}$ and $y_{22}$, we often determine their reciprocals, the input and output impedances $Z_{i}=1 / y_{11}$ and $Z_{o}=1 / y_{22}$, as shown in the unilateral two-port model of Fig. 3.5a. Additionally, rather than calculating the short-circuit transconductance $G_{m}=y_{21}$, we sometimes compute the open-circuit voltage gain $a_{v}$. This substitution is justified by converting the Norton-equivalent output model in Fig. 3.5a to the Thévenin-equivalent output model in Fig. 3.5b. Generally, knowing any two of the three parameters—$G_{m}, Z_{o}$, and $a_{v}$—enables determination of the third, as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\na_{v}=\\left.\\frac{v_{2}}{v_{1}}\\right|_{i_{2}=0}=-G_{m} Z_{o} \\tag{3.7}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nOnce two of these parameters and the input impedance are known, it is possible to calculate the effects of loading at the input and output ports. At low frequencies, input and output impedances are predominantly resistive. Therefore, we will characterize the low-frequency behavior of many amplifiers in this book by determining the input and output resistances, $R_{i}$ and $R_{o}$, as well as $G_{m}$ or $a_{v}$.\n\n**Figure 3.5 (a) description:**\n[\nname: Zi, type: Resistor, value: Zi, ports: {N1: V1, N2: GND}\nname: Zo, type: Resistor, value: Zo, ports: {N1: V2, N2: GND}\nname: Gmv1, type: VoltageControlledCurrentSource, value: Gmv1, ports: {Np: V2, Nn: GND}\n]\nextrainfo: This circuit diagram (a) represents a unilateral two-port network with a Norton output model.

    "text": "The depiction of the resistively loaded common-emitter (CE) amplifier can be found in Fig. 3.7. Here, $R_{C}$ denotes the collector load resistor, and the short horizontal line labeled $V_{C C}$ above $R_{C}$ signifies that a voltage source with a value of $V_{C C}$ is connected between that point and ground. This notation will be consistently employed throughout the text. Initially, we compute the dc transfer characteristic of the amplifier by progressively increasing the input voltage in the positive direction from zero. \n\nWe assume the base of the transistor is driven by a voltage source of value $V_{i}$. When $V_{i}$ is zero, the transistor operates in the cutoff state and no collector current flows other than the leakage current $I_{C O}$. As the input voltage rises, the transistor transitions into the forward-active region, and the collector current is determined by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{c}=I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{i}}{V_{T}} \\tag{3.8}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe equivalent circuit for the amplifier when the transistor is in the forward-active region is depicted in Fig. 3.8. Due to the exponential relationship between $I_{c}$ and $V_{b e}$, the collector current remains very small until the input voltage reaches approximately 0.5 V. Provided the transistor operates in the forward-active region, the base current is the collector current divided by $\\beta_{F}$, or\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{b}=\\frac{I_{c}}{\\beta_{F}}=\\frac{I_{S}}{\\beta_{F}} \\exp \\frac{V_{i}}{V_{T}} \\tag{3.9}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe output voltage is the supply voltage, $V_{C C}$, minus the voltage drop across the collector resistor:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{o}=V_{C C}-I_{C} R_{C}=V_{C C}-R_{C} I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{i}}{V_{T}} \\tag{3.10}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAs the output voltage approaches zero, the collector-base junction of the transistor becomes forward biased, and the device enters saturation. Once the transistor is saturated, the output voltage and collector current stabilize at nearly constant values:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{o} & =V_{C E(\\mathrm{sat})}  \\tag{3.11}\\\\\nI_{c} & =\\frac{V_{C C}-V_{C E(\\mathrm{sat})}}{R_{C}} \\tag{3.12}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nConversely, the base current continues to rise with further increases in $V_{i}$. Hence, the forward current gain $I_{c} / I_{b}$ diminishes from $\\beta_{F}$ as the transistor exits the forward-active region and enters saturation. In practice, the current available from the signal source is limited. When the signal source can no longer increase the base current, $V_{i}$ reaches its maximum. The output voltage and the base current are plotted as a function of the input voltage in Fig. 3.9. Note that when the device operates in the forward-active region, minor fluctuations in the input voltage can trigger substantial changes in the output voltage, thereby demonstrating the voltage gain of the circuit. We now proceed to calculate the voltage gain in the forward-active region.\n\nThe small-signal equivalent circuit for the common-emitter amplifier is shown in Fig. 3.10. Here, we have disregarded $r_{b}$, assuming that it is significantly smaller than $r_{\\pi}$. We have also neglected $r_{\\mu}$. This equivalent circuit does not account for the resistance of the load connected to the amplifier output. The collector resistor $R_{C}$ is included because it typically serves as a biasing element. Our aim is to characterize the amplifier independently so that the voltage gain can subsequently be calculated under arbitrary loading conditions at the input and output. Given that the common-emitter amplifier is unilateral when $r_{\\mu}$ is neglected, we will calculate the small-signal input resistance, transconductance, and output resistance of the circuit as detailed in Section 3.2.\n\nThe input resistance is the Thévenin-equivalent resistance observed looking into the input. For the CE amplifier,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{i}=\\frac{v_{i}}{i_{i}}=r_{\\pi}=\\frac{\\beta_{0}}{g_{m}} \\tag{3.13}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe transconductance $G_{m}$ is the change in the short-circuit output current per unit change of input voltage and is expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nG_{m}=\\left.\\frac{i_{o}}{v_{i}}\\right|_{v_{o}=0}=g_{m} \\tag{3.14}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation 3.14 indicates that the transconductance of the CE amplifier is equal to the transconductance of the transistor. The output resistance is the Thevenin-equivalent resistance viewed looking into the output with the input shorted, or\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{o}=\\left.\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{o}}\\right|_{v_{i}=0}=R_{C} \\| r_{o} \\tag{3.15}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe open-circuit, or unloaded, voltage gain is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\na_{v}=\\left.\\frac{v_{o}}{v_{i}}\\right|_{i_{o}=0}=-g_{m}\\left(r_{o} \\| R_{C}\\right) \\tag{3.16}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIf the collector load resistor $R_{C}$ is made very large, then $a_{v}$ becomes\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\lim _{R_{C} \\rightarrow \\infty} a_{v}=-g_{m} r_{o}=-\\frac{I_{C}}{V_{T}} \\frac{V_{A}}{I_{C}}=-\\frac{V_{A}}{V_{T}}=-\\frac{1}{\\eta} \\tag{3.17}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $I_{C}$ is the dc collector current at the operating point, $V_{T}$ is the thermal voltage, $V_{A}$ is the Early voltage, and $\\eta$ is given in (1.114). This gain represents the maximum low-frequency voltage gain achievable from the transistor. It is independent of the collector bias current for bipolar transistors, and the magnitude is approximately 5000 for typical $n p n$ devices.\n\nAnother parameter of interest is the short-circuit current gain $a_{i}$. This parameter is the ratio of $i_{o}$ to $i_{i}$ when the output is shorted. For the CE amplifier,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\na_{i}=\\left.\\frac{i_{o}}{i_{i}}\\right|_{v_{o}=0}=\\frac{G_{m} v_{i}}{\\frac{v_{i}}{R_{i}}}=g_{m} r_{\\pi}=\\beta_{0} \\tag{3.18}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\n(a) Determine the input resistance, output resistance, voltage gain, and current gain of the commonemitter amplifier in Fig. 3.11a.

As the common-emitter amplifier is unilateral when $r_{\\mu}$ is ignored, we calculate the small-signal input resistance, transconductance, and output resistance as detailed in Section 3.2.\n\nThe input resistance is the Thévenin-equivalent resistance viewed from the input, for the CE amplifier:\n\n$$\nR_{i}=\\frac{v_{i}}{i_{i}}=r_{\\pi}=\\frac{\\beta_{0}}{g_{m}}\n$$\n\nThe transconductance $G_{m}$ is the change in short-circuit output current per unit change in input voltage:\n\n$$\nG_{m}=\\left.\\frac{i_{o}}{v_{i}}\\right|_{v_{o}=0}=g_{m}\n$$\n\nThe output resistance is the Thévenin-equivalent resistance seen from the output with the input shorted:\n\n$$\nR_{o}=\\left.\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{o}}\\right|_{v_{i}=0}=R_{C} \\| r_{o}\n$$\n\nThe open-circuit voltage gain is:\n\n$$\na_{v}=\\left.\\frac{v_{o}}{v_{i}}\\right|_{i_{o}=0}=-g_{m}\\left(r_{o} \\| R_{C}\\right)\n$$\n\nIf the collector load resistor $R_{C}$ is very large, then $a_{v}$ becomes:\n\n$$\n\\lim _{R_{C} \\rightarrow \\infty} a_{v}=-g_{m} r_{o}=-\\frac{I_{C}}{V_{T}} \\frac{V_{A}}{I_{C}}=-\\frac{V_{A}}{V_{T}}=-\\frac{1}{\\eta}\n$$\n\nwhere $I_{C}$ is the DC collector current at the operating point, $V_{T}$ is the thermal voltage, $V_{A}$ is the Early voltage, and $\\eta$ is given in (1.114).

    "text": "The resistively loaded common-emitter (CE) amplifier circuit is depicted in Figure 3.7. Here, $R_{C}$ denotes the collector load resistance. The short horizontal line marked $V_{C C}$ above $R_{C}$ signifies that a voltage source with a value of $V_{C C}$ is connected between that point and ground. This notation will be utilized consistently throughout the text. Initially, we determine the dc transfer characteristic of the amplifier by progressively increasing the input voltage in the positive direction from zero. Assuming the base of the transistor is driven by a voltage source of value $V_{i}$, when $V_{i}$ is zero, the transistor is in the cutoff state, and the collector current is negligible, barring any leakage current $I_{C O}$. As the input voltage rises, the transistor transitions into the forward-active region, and the collector current is expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{c}=I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{i}}{V_{T}} \\tag{3.8}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe equivalent circuit for the amplifier when the transistor is in the forward-active region, as derived in Chapter 1, is illustrated in Figure 3.8. Due to the exponential relationship between $I_{c}$ and $V_{b e}$, the collector current is minimal until the input voltage reaches roughly 0.5 V. While the transistor remains in the forward-active region, the base current is the collector current divided by $\\beta_{F}$, or\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{b}=\\frac{I_{c}}{\\beta_{F}}=\\frac{I_{S}}{\\beta_{F}} \\exp \\frac{V_{i}}{V_{T}} \\tag{3.9}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe output voltage is the supply voltage, $V_{C C}$, minus the voltage drop across the collector resistor:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{o}=V_{C C}-I_{C} R_{C}=V_{C C}-R_{C} I_{S} \\exp \\frac{V_{i}}{V_{T}} \\tag{3.10}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWhen the output voltage approaches zero, the collector-base junction of the transistor becomes forward biased, leading the device into saturation. In saturation, the output voltage and collector current approach constant values:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{o} & =V_{C E(\\mathrm{sat})}  \\tag{3.11}\\\\\nI_{c} & =\\frac{V_{C C}-V_{C E(\\mathrm{sat})}}{R_{C}} \\tag{3.12}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nConversely, the base current continues to rise with increasing $V_{i}$. Hence, the forward current gain $I_{c} / I_{b}$ diminishes from $\\beta_{F}$ as the transistor exits the forward-active region and enters saturation. Practically, the signal source's current capacity is finite. When the signal source can no longer augment the base current, $V_{i}$ reaches its peak. The output voltage and base current are graphed against the input voltage in Figure 3.9. It is observed that in the forward-active region, minor fluctuations in the input voltage can induce substantial variations in the output voltage, thereby indicating the voltage gain provided by the circuit. Subsequently, we calculate the voltage gain in the forward-active region.\n\nFigure 3.9 presents two graphs depicting the output voltage ($V_o$) and base current ($I_b$) as functions of the input voltage ($V_i$) for a common-emitter circuit.\n\n1. **Output Voltage vs. Input Voltage Graph (Top Graph):**\n   - **Axes Labels and Units:**\n     - The x-axis indicates the input voltage ($V_i$) in volts (V).\n     - The y-axis represents the output voltage ($V_o$) in volts (V).\n   - **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n     - The graph portrays a steep transition from a high output voltage ($V_{CC}$) to a low output voltage ($V_{CE(sat)}$) as the input voltage escalates.\n     - The curve initiates at a high level ($V_{CC}$) and remains constant until around $V_i = 0.5$ V.\n     - At this juncture, the graph plummets sharply, signifying the shift from the saturation region to the forward-active region.\n     - The output voltage stabilizes at $V_{CE(sat)}$ beyond approximately 1 V of $V_i$, denoting the saturation region.\n   - **Key Features:**\n     - The transition between regions is demarcated by a steep slope, signifying the voltage gain facilitated by the circuit in the forward-active region.\n\n2. **Base Current vs. Input Voltage Graph (Bottom Graph):**\n   - **Axes Labels and Units:**\n     - The x-axis denotes the input voltage ($V_i$) in volts (V).\n     - The y-axis indicates the base current ($I_b$) in amperes (A).\n   - **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n     - The base current remains minimal for input voltages less than roughly 0.5 V, indicating the saturation region.\n     - Beyond 0.5 V of $V_i$, the base current commences to surge steeply, signaling the transition to the forward-active region.\n     - The curve continues to escalate sharply, demonstrating that minor increments in $V_i$ result in significant increases in $I_b$.\n   - **Key Features:**\n     - The sharp escalation in base current corresponds to the forward-active region, where the transistor offers amplification.\n     - The graph delineates the relationship between $V_i$ and $I_b$, accentuating the base current's sensitivity to input voltage changes in the forward-active region.\n\nCollectively, Figure 3.9 elucidates the common-emitter amplifier's behavior, showcasing how the output voltage and base current vary with the input voltage, emphasizing the operational regions and the circuit's amplification attributes.\n\nFigure 3.9 Output voltage and base current as a function of $V_{i}$ for the common-emitter circuit.\n\nWhile parameters like voltage gain can be derived from the large-signal analysis, the computations are simplified by employing the small-signal hybrid- $\\pi$ model for the transistor, as introduced in Chapter 1.

    "text": "The resistively loaded common-source (CS) amplifier configuration, depicted in Fig. 3.12a, utilizes an $n$-channel MOS transistor. The corresponding small-signal equivalent circuit is illustrated in Fig. 3.12b. Similar to the bipolar transistor scenario, the MOS transistor is cutoff when $V_{i}=0$, resulting in $I_{d}=0$ and $V_{o}=V_{D D}$. As $V_{i}$ surpasses the threshold voltage $V_{t}$, a nonzero drain current flows, and the transistor operates in the active region (often referred to as saturation for MOS transistors) provided $V_{o}>V_{G S}-V_{t}$.

It includes a voltage-controlled current source (g_m v_i) representing the transconductance of the NMOS transistor, and resistors r_o and R_D representing the output resistance and load resistance, respectively. The input voltage is vi, and the output voltage is vo.\n\nUsing equations (1.157) alongside (3.19), we derive:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{o} & =V_{D D}-I_{d} R_{D}  \\tag{3.19}\\\\\n& =V_{D D}-\\frac{\\mu_{n} C_{o x}}{2} \\frac{W}{L} R_{D}\\left(V_{i}-V_{t}\\right)^{2} \\tag{3.20}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe output voltage, equivalent to the drain-source voltage, decreases as the input voltage increases. When $V_{o}<V_{G S}-V_{t}$, the transistor enters the triode region, characterized by low output resistance and a significant drop in small-signal voltage gain. In the triode region, the output voltage can be calculated using (1.152) in (3.19). These findings are depicted in the plot of Fig. 3.13. The slope of the transfer characteristic at any operating point represents the small-signal voltage gain at that point. The MOS transistor exhibits a much lower voltage gain in the active region compared to the bipolar transistor, thus the active region for the MOS CS amplifier spans a broader range of $V_{i}$ than in the bipolar common-emitter amplifier.\n\nSince both the source and body of the MOS transistor operate at ac ground, $v_{b s}=0$ in Fig. 1.36, thereby omitting the $g_{m b}$ generator in Fig. 3.12b. Consequently, this circuit is topologically identical to the small-signal equivalent circuit for the common-emitter amplifier shown in Fig. 3.10. The CS amplifier is unilateral due to the absence of feedback, allowing its low-frequency behavior to be characterized by transconductance, input resistance, and output resistance as detailed in Section 3.2.\n\nThe transconductance $G_{m}$ is given by:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nG_{m}=\\left.\\frac{i_{o}}{v_{i}}\\right|_{v_{o}=0}=g_{m} \\tag{3.21}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation 3.21 indicates that the transconductance of the CS amplifier equals the transconductance of the transistor, akin to a common-emitter amplifier. Given that the input of the CS amplifier is connected to the gate of the MOS transistor, the dc input current and its low-frequency, small-signal variation $i_{i}$ are both assumed to be zero. Under this assumption, the input resistance $R_{i}$ is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{i}=\\frac{v_{i}}{i_{i}} \\rightarrow \\infty \\tag{3.22}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis result can also be derived by letting $\\beta_{0} \\rightarrow \\infty$ in (3.13), as MOS transistors behave like bipolar transistors with infinite $\\beta_{0}$. The output resistance, seen looking into the output with the input shorted, is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{o}=\\left.\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{o}}\\right|_{v_{i}=0}=R_{D} \\| r_{o} \\tag{3.23}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe open-circuit, or unloaded, voltage gain is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\na_{v}=\\left.\\frac{v_{o}}{v_{i}}\\right|_{i_{o}=0}=-g_{m}\\left(r_{o} \\| R_{D}\\right) \\tag{3.24}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIf the drain load resistor $R_{D}$ is replaced by a current source, $R_{D} \\rightarrow \\infty$, and $a_{v}$ becomes:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\lim _{R_{D} \\rightarrow \\infty} a_{v}=-g_{m} r_{o} \\tag{3.25}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation 3.25 represents the maximum possible voltage gain of a one-stage CS amplifier, identical to the first part of (3.17) for a common-emitter amplifier. However, in the CS amplifier, $g_{m}$ is proportional to $\\sqrt{I_{D}}$ from (1.180), while $r_{o}$ is inversely proportional to $I_{D}$ from (1.194). Thus, the maximum voltage gain per stage in (3.25) is proportional to $1 / \\sqrt{I_{D}}$. Conversely, the maximum voltage gain in the common-emitter amplifier is independent of current. A plot of the maximum voltage gain versus $I_{D}$ for a typical MOS transistor is shown in Fig. 3.14. At very low currents, the gain approaches a constant value similar to that of a bipolar transistor, a region known as subthreshold where the square-law characteristic in (1.157) is invalid. As explained in Section 1.8, the drain current becomes an exponential function of the gate-source voltage in this region, resembling the collector-current dependence on the base-emitter voltage in a bipolar transistor.\n\n**Image Description (Figure 3.14):**\n- **Graph Details:**\n  - **X-axis:** Drain current (I_D) in amperes (A), logarithmic scale.\n  - **Y-axis:** Maximum MOSFET voltage gain, logarithmic scale.\n  - **Graph Type:** Logarithmic plot showing the relationship between MOSFET voltage gain and bias current.\n  - **Regions:**\n    - **Subthreshold Region:** At low currents (approximately 10^{-8} A to 10^{-6} A), the voltage gain remains relatively constant, indicating subthreshold operation with a high gain value around 10^3.\n    - **Square-law Region:** As the current increases beyond 10^{-6} A, the gain decreases linearly on the logarithmic scale, indicating the transition to the square-law region.\n\n**Figure 3.14:** Typical variation of maximum MOSFET voltage gain with bias current.\n\nUsing (1.194), the limiting gain given by (3.25) can also be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\lim _{R_{D} \\rightarrow \\infty} a_{v}=-g_{m} r_{o}=-\\frac{g_{m}}{I_{D}} I_{D} r_{o}=-\\frac{g_{m}}{I_{D}} V_{A} \\tag{3.26}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn the square-law region in Fig. 3.14, substituting (1.181) into (3.26) yields:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\lim _{R_{D} \\rightarrow \\infty} a_{v}=-\\frac{V_{A}}{\\left(V_{G S}-V_{t}\\right) / 2}=-\\frac{2 V_{A}}{V_{o v}} \\tag{3.27}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $V_{o v}=V_{G S}-V_{t}$ is the gate overdrive. Since the gate overdrive is typically an order of magnitude larger than the thermal voltage $V_{T}$, the magnitude of the maximum gain predicted by (3.27) is usually much smaller than that predicted by (3.17) for the bipolar case. Substituting (1.163) into (3.27) gives:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\lim _{R_{D} \\rightarrow \\infty} a_{v}=-\\frac{2 L_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{V_{G S}-V_{t}}\\left(\\frac{d X_{d}}{d V_{D S}}\\right)^{-1} \\tag{3.28}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n**EXAMPLE:**\n\nDetermine the voltage gain of the common-source amplifier in Fig. 3.12a with the following parameters: $V_{D D}=5 \\mathrm{~V}$, $R_{D}=5 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega, k^{\\prime}=\\mu_{n} C_{o x}=100 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} / \\mathrm{V}^{2}, W=50 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}, L=1 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}, V_{t}=0.8 \\mathrm{~V}, L_{d}=0, X_{d}=0$, and $\\lambda=0$.

Similar to the bipolar transistor scenario, the MOS transistor is cutoff when $V_{i}=0$, resulting in $I_{d}=0$ and $V_{o}=V_{D D}$. As $V_{i}$ surpasses the threshold voltage $V_{t}$, a nonzero drain current flows, and the transistor functions in the active region (often termed saturation for MOS transistors) provided $V_{o}>V_{G S}-V_{t}$.

When $V_{o}<V_{G S}-V_{t}$, the transistor transitions to the triode region, where its output resistance diminishes, and the small-signal voltage gain decreases significantly. In the triode region, the output voltage can be calculated using (1.152) in (3.19). These findings are depicted in the graph of Fig. 3.13. The slope of this transfer characteristic at any operating point represents the small-signal voltage gain at that point. The MOS transistor exhibits a much lower voltage gain in the active region compared to the bipolar transistor, hence the active region for the MOS CS amplifier spans a broader range of $V_{i}$ than in the bipolar common-emitter amplifier.\n\nSince both the source and body of the MOS transistor operate at ac ground, $v_{b s}=0$ in Fig. 1.36; consequently, the $g_{m b}$ generator is omitted in Fig. 3.12b. As a result, this circuit is topologically identical to the small-signal equivalent circuit for the common-emitter amplifier shown in Fig. 3.10. The CS amplifier is unilateral due to the absence of feedback. Therefore, its low-frequency behavior can be characterized using the transconductance, input resistance, and output resistance as detailed in Section 3.2.\n\nThe transconductance $G_{m}$ is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nG_{m}=\\left.\\frac{i_{o}}{v_{i}}\\right|_{v_{o}=0}=g_{m} \\tag{3.21}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation 3.21 indicates that the transconductance of the CS amplifier equals the transconductance of the transistor, similar to a common-emitter amplifier. Given that the input of the CS amplifier is connected to the gate of an MOS transistor, the dc input current and its low-frequency, small-signal variation $i_{i}$ are both assumed to be zero. Under this assumption, the input resistance $R_{i}$ is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{i}=\\frac{v_{i}}{i_{i}} \\rightarrow \\infty \\tag{3.22}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAnother perspective on this result is to consider $\\beta_{0} \\rightarrow \\infty$ in (3.13), as MOS transistors behave like bipolar transistors with infinite $\\beta_{0}$.

This result mirrors the first part of (3.17) for a common-emitter amplifier. However, in the case of the CS amplifier, $g_{m}$ is proportional to $\\sqrt{I_{D}}$ from (1.180), while $r_{o}$ is inversely proportional to $I_{D}$ from (1.194). Thus, (3.25) reveals that the maximum voltage gain per stage is proportional to $1 / \\sqrt{I_{D}}$. In contrast, the maximum voltage gain in the common-emitter amplifier is independent of current. A plot of the maximum voltage gain versus $I_{D}$ for a typical MOS transistor is presented in Fig. 3.14. At very low currents, the gain approaches a constant value similar to that of a bipolar transistor. This region is sometimes referred to as subthreshold, where the transistor operates in weak inversion, and the square-law characteristic in (1.157) is no longer valid. As explained in Section 1.8, the drain current becomes an exponential function of the gate-source voltage in this region, resembling the collector-current dependence on the base-emitter voltage in a bipolar transistor.\n\nimage_name:Figure 3.14\ndescription:The graph in Figure 3.14 shows the variation of maximum MOSFET voltage gain with respect to the bias current (I_D) in amperes.

When $V_{o}<V_{G S}-V_{t}$, the transistor transitions to the triode region, where its output resistance diminishes and the small-signal voltage gain decreases significantly. In the triode region, the output voltage can be computed using (1.152) in (3.19). These findings are illustrated in the plot of Fig. 3.13.

The x-axis measures the input voltage \\( V_i \\) in volts (V), while the y-axis measures the output voltage \\( V_o \\) in volts (V). The graph is segmented into three distinct regions: the cutoff region, the active region, and the triode region.\n\n1. **Cutoff Region:**\n- Located on the left side of the graph, this region occurs when the input voltage \\( V_i \\) is below the threshold voltage \\( V_t \\). Here, the output voltage \\( V_o \\) remains constant at the supply voltage \\( V_{DD} \\). The transistor is off, and no current flows through it.\n\n2. **Active Region:**\n- As the input voltage \\( V_i \\) exceeds \\( V_t \\), the transistor enters the active region. In this region, the output voltage \\( V_o \\) decreases with increasing input voltage, characterized by a negative slope, indicating a negative small-signal voltage gain. The MOSFET operates in saturation, providing amplification.\n\n3. **Triode Region:**\n- With further increases in the input voltage \\( V_i \\), the transistor enters the triode region.

The graph visually demonstrates how the output voltage changes with varying input voltage, highlighting the MOSFET's behavior in different operating regions.\n\nFigure 3.13 Output voltage versus input voltage for the common-source circuit.\nvoltage gain at that point. The MOS transistor exhibits a much lower voltage gain in the active region compared to the bipolar transistor; hence, the active region for the MOS CS amplifier spans a broader range of $V_{i}$ than for the bipolar common-emitter amplifier.\n\nSince both the source and body of the MOS transistor operate at ac ground, $v_{b s}=0$ in Fig. 1.36; consequently, the $g_{m b}$ generator is omitted in Fig. 3.12b. This results in the circuit being topologically identical to the small-signal equivalent circuit for the common-emitter amplifier shown in Fig. 3.10. The CS amplifier is unilateral due to the absence of feedback. Therefore, its low-frequency behavior can be characterized using the transconductance, input resistance, and output resistance as detailed in Section 3.2.\n\nThe transconductance $G_{m}$ is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nG_{m}=\\left.\\frac{i_{o}}{v_{i}}\\right|_{v_{o}=0}=g_{m} \\tag{3.21}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation 3.21 indicates that the transconductance of the CS amplifier equals the transconductance of the transistor, similar to a common-emitter amplifier. Given that the input of the CS amplifier is connected to the gate of the MOS transistor, the dc input current and its low-frequency, small-signal variation $i_{i}$ are both assumed to be zero. Under this assumption, the input resistance $R_{i}$ is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{i}=\\frac{v_{i}}{i_{i}} \\rightarrow \\infty \\tag{3.22}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAnother way to understand this result is to consider $\\beta_{0} \\rightarrow \\infty$ in (3.13), as MOS transistors behave like bipolar transistors with infinite $\\beta_{0}$.

This result mirrors the first part of (3.17) for a common-emitter amplifier. However, in the case of the CS amplifier, $g_{m}$ is proportional to $\\sqrt{I_{D}}$ from (1.180), while $r_{o}$ is inversely proportional to $I_{D}$ from (1.194). Thus, (3.25) reveals that the maximum voltage gain per stage is proportional to $1 / \\sqrt{I_{D}}$. In contrast, the maximum voltage gain in the common-emitter amplifier is independent of current. A graph of the maximum voltage gain versus $I_{D}$ for a typical MOS transistor is presented in Fig. 3.14. At very low currents, the gain approaches a constant value comparable to that of a bipolar transistor, a region sometimes referred to as subthreshold, where the transistor operates in weak inversion and the square-law characteristic in (1.157) is no longer valid. As explained in Section 1.8, the drain current becomes an exponential function of the gate-source voltage in this region, similar to the collector-current dependence on the base-emitter voltage in a bipolar transistor.\nimage_name:Figure 3.14\ndescription:The graph in Figure 3.14 shows the variation of maximum MOSFET voltage gain with respect to the bias current (I_D) in amperes.

Here, the gain is high, around 10^3, similar to that of a bipolar transistor, as the gain approaches a constant value.\n- **Square-law Region:** As the current increases beyond approximately 10^{-6} A, the gain begins to decrease linearly on the logarithmic scale, marking the transition to the square-law region. This region is characterized by a decrease in gain with increasing current.\n\nKey Features and Technical Details\n- The graph clearly distinguishes between the subthreshold and square-law regions, showing a smooth transition between them and highlighting the continuous nature of MOSFET operation across these regions.\n- Annotations on the graph indicate the subthreshold and square-law regions, providing insight into the operational characteristics of MOSFETs at different bias currents.\n- No specific numerical values are marked for key data points, but the logarithmic scale effectively conveys the magnitude of the gain and its dependence on the current.\n\nFigure 3.14 Typical variation of maximum MOSFET voltage gain with bias current.\n\nUsing (1.194), the limiting gain given by (3.25) can also be expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\lim _{R_{D} \\rightarrow \\infty} a_{v}=-g_{m} r_{o}=-\\frac{g_{m}}{I_{D}} I_{D} r_{o}=-\\frac{g_{m}}{I_{D}} V_{A} \\tag{3.26}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn the square-law region in Fig. 3.14, substituting (1.181) into (3.26) yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\lim _{R_{D} \\rightarrow \\infty} a_{v}=-\\frac{V_{A}}{\\left(V_{G S}-V_{t}\\right) / 2}=-\\frac{2 V_{A}}{V_{o v}} \\tag{3.27}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $V_{o v}=V_{G S}-V_{t}$ is the gate overdrive. Since the gate overdrive is typically an order of magnitude larger than the thermal voltage $V_{T}$, the magnitude of the maximum gain predicted by (3.27) is usually much smaller than that predicted by (3.17) for the bipolar case. Substituting (1.163) into (3.27) results in\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\lim _{R_{D} \\rightarrow \\infty} a_{v}=-\\frac{2 L_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{V_{G S}-V_{t}}\\left(\\frac{d X_{d}}{d V_{D S}}\\right)^{-1} \\tag{3.28}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nDetermine the voltage gain of the common-source amplifier shown in Fig $3.12 a$ with $V_{D D}=5 \\mathrm{~V}$, $R_{D}=5 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega, k^{\\prime}=\\mu_{n} C_{o x}=100 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} / \\mathrm{V}^{2}, W=50 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}, L=1 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}, V_{t}=0.8 \\mathrm{~V}, L_{d}=0, X_{d}=0$, and $\\lambda=0$.

    "text": "In the common-base (CB) configuration, the input signal is applied to the emitter of the transistor, and the output is taken from the collector, with the base connected to ac ground. This setup is depicted in Fig. 3.15. Although not as widely employed as the common-emitter amplifier, the common-base configuration possesses certain properties that make it beneficial in specific scenarios. This section focuses on calculating the small-signal characteristics of the common-base stage.\n\nThe hybrid-π model accurately represents the small-signal behavior of the transistor, irrespective of the circuit configuration. However, for the common-base stage, this model can be somewhat unwieldy due to the dependent current source linking the input and output terminals. The analysis can be simplified by modifying the model as illustrated in Fig. 3.16. The small-signal hybrid-π model is shown in Fig. 3.16a. Initially, note that the dependent current source flows from the collector to the emitter. The circuit behavior remains unchanged if this single current source is replaced by two current sources of equal value, one flowing from the collector to the base and the other from the base to the emitter, as shown in Fig. 3.16b. Since the currents entering and leaving the base are equal, the equations describing these circuits are identical. Additionally, the controlled current source between the base and emitter is governed by the voltage across its own terminals. By applying Ohm's law to this branch, this dependent current source can be substituted with a resistor of value \\(1 / g_{m}\\). This resistance appears in parallel with \\(r_{\\pi}\\), and their parallel combination is termed the emitter resistance \\(r_{e}\\).\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nr_{e}=\\frac{1}{g_{m}+\\frac{1}{r_{\\pi}}}=\\frac{1}{g_{m}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{\\beta_{0}}\\right)}=\\frac{\\alpha_{0}}{g_{m}} \\tag{3.29}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe revised equivalent circuit, known as the T model, is presented in Fig. 3.16c. It retains the same terminal properties as the hybrid-π model but is often more convenient for common-base calculations. For dc and low input frequencies, the capacitors \\(C_{\\pi}\\) and \\(C_{\\mu}\\) act as high-impedance elements and can be disregarded. Initially, assume \\(r_{b}=0\\) and \\(r_{o} \\rightarrow \\infty\\), making the circuit unilateral. When \\(r_{\\mu}\\) is also neglected, the model simplifies to the form shown in Fig. 3.16d. Using the T model under these conditions, the small-signal analysis proceeds.\n\nFigure 3.15 illustrates a typical common-base amplifier circuit using an NPN transistor Q1.

It includes an input resistance \\(r_{e}\\), a voltage-controlled current source \\(g_m v_e\\), and an output resistance \\(R_C\\).\n\nUsing Fig. 3.17, the short-circuit transconductance is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nG_{m}=g_{m} \\tag{3.30}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe input resistance is simply \\(r_{e}\\):\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{i}=r_{e} \\tag{3.31}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe output resistance is given by:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{o}=R_{C} \\tag{3.32}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWith these parameters, the open-circuit voltage gain and the short-circuit current gain are:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& a_{v}=G_{m} R_{o}=g_{m} R_{C}  \\tag{3.33}\\\\\n& a_{i}=G_{m} R_{i}=g_{m} r_{e}=\\alpha_{0} \\tag{3.34}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nComparing (3.31) and (3.13) reveals that the input resistance of the common-base configuration is a factor of \\((\\beta_{0}+1)\\) less than that of the common-emitter configuration. Similarly, comparing (3.34) and (3.18) shows that the current gain of the common-base configuration is reduced by a factor of \\((\\beta_{0}+1)\\) compared to the common-emitter configuration.\n\nThus far, we have assumed \\(r_{b}\\) is negligible. In practice, however, the base resistance significantly impacts the transconductance and input resistance at high current levels. To account for \\(r_{b}>0\\), assume the transistor operates in the forward-active region and consider the small-signal model in Fig. 3.18. Here, the transconductance is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nG_{m}=\\left.\\frac{i_{o}}{v_{i}}\\right|_{v_{o}=0}=g_{m}\\left(\\frac{v_{e}}{v_{i}}\\right) \\tag{3.35}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nTo determine the relationship between \\(v_{e}\\) and \\(v_{i}\\), apply Kirchoff's current law (KCL) at the internal base node (node (1)) and Kirchoff's voltage law (KVL) around the input loop. From KCL at node (1):\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ng_{m} v_{e}+\\frac{v_{b}}{r_{b}}-\\frac{v_{e}}{r_{e}}=0 \\tag{3.36}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFigure 3.18 shows the small-signal model of the common-base stage with \\(r_{b}>0\\), including resistors \\(r_{e}\\), \\(r_{b}\\), \\(R_C\\), and a voltage-controlled current source \\(g_m v_e\\). The input voltage is \\(V_i\\) and the output voltage is \\(V_o\\).\n\nFrom KVL around the input loop:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{i}=v_{e}+v_{b} \\tag{3.37}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSolving (3.37) for \\(v_{b}\\), substituting into (3.36), and rearranging yields:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{v_{i}}{v_{e}}=1+\\frac{g_{m}}{\\beta_{0}} r_{b}=1+\\frac{r_{b}}{r_{\\pi}} \\tag{3.38}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSubstituting (3.38) into (3.35) gives:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nG_{m}=\\frac{g_{m}}{1+\\frac{r_{b}}{r_{\\pi}}} \\tag{3.39}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, the input resistance in Fig. 3.18 is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{i}=\\frac{v_{i}}{i_{i}}=\\frac{v_{i}}{v_{e} / r_{e}}=r_{e}\\left(\\frac{v_{i}}{v_{e}}\\right) \\tag{3.40}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSubstituting (3.38) into (3.40) results in:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{i}=r_{e}\\left(1+\\frac{r_{b}}{r_{\\pi}}\\right)=\\frac{\\alpha_{0}}{g_{m}}\\left(1+\\frac{r_{b}}{r_{\\pi}}\\right) \\tag{3.41}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, if the dc collector current is sufficiently high that \\(r_{\\pi}\\) is comparable to \\(r_{b}\\), the effects of base resistance must be considered. For instance, if \\(r_{b}=100 \\Omega\\) and \\(\\beta_{0}=100\\), a collector current of 26 mA makes \\(r_{b}\\) and \\(r_{\\pi}\\) equal.\n\nThe primary reasons for employing common-base stages are twofold. First, the collector-base capacitance does not induce high-frequency feedback from the output to the input, as it does in the common-emitter amplifier. This is crucial for high-frequency amplifier design, as discussed in Chapter 7. Second, as detailed in Chapter 4, the common-base amplifier can achieve a much higher output resistance than the common-emitter stage in the limit where \\(R_{C} \\rightarrow \\infty\\). Consequently, the common-base configuration can serve as a current source whose current is nearly independent of the voltage across it."

This setup is illustrated in Fig. 3.15. Although less commonly used than the common-emitter amplifier, the common-base configuration has specific advantages in certain scenarios. This section focuses on calculating the small-signal characteristics of the common-base stage.\n\nThe hybrid-π model accurately represents the small-signal behavior of a transistor, regardless of the circuit configuration. However, for the common-base stage, this model can be somewhat complex due to the dependent current source linking the input and output terminals. Simplification is possible by modifying the model as shown in Fig. 3.16. The small-signal hybrid-π model is depicted in Fig. 3.16a, where the dependent current source flows from the collector to the emitter. This can be replaced by two equivalent current sources, one from the collector to the base and the other from the base to the emitter, as shown in Fig. 3.16b, without altering the circuit's behavior since the base currents remain balanced. The controlled current source between the base and emitter, governed by the voltage across its terminals, can be substituted with a resistor of value \\(1 / g_{m}\\) using Ohm's law.

    "text": "In the common-base (CB) configuration, the input signal is applied to the emitter of the transistor, and the output is taken from the collector, with the base connected to AC ground. This setup is illustrated in Fig. 3.15. Although not as widely used as the common-emitter amplifier, the common-base configuration has specific properties that make it useful in certain scenarios. This section focuses on calculating the small-signal properties of the common-base stage.\n\nThe hybrid-π model accurately represents the small-signal behavior of the transistor, regardless of the circuit configuration. However, for the common-base stage, this model can be somewhat cumbersome due to the dependent current source connecting the input and output terminals. The analysis can be simplified by modifying the model as shown in Fig. 3.16. The small-signal hybrid-π model is depicted in Fig. 3.16a. Initially, note that the dependent current source flows from the collector to the emitter. The circuit behavior remains unchanged if this single current source is replaced by two current sources of equal value, one from the collector to the base and the other from the base to the emitter, as shown in Fig. 3.16b. Since the currents entering and leaving the base are equal, the equations describing these circuits are identical. Additionally, the controlled current source between the base and emitter is governed by the voltage across its terminals. By applying Ohm's law, this dependent current source can be replaced by a resistor of value $1 / g_{m}$. This resistance appears in parallel with $r_{\\pi}$, and their parallel combination is termed the emitter resistance $r_{e}$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nr_{e}=\\frac{1}{g_{m}+\\frac{1}{r_{\\pi}}}=\\frac{1}{g_{m}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{\\beta_{0}}\\right)}=\\frac{\\alpha_{0}}{g_{m}} \\tag{3.29}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe revised equivalent circuit, known as the T model, is shown in Fig. 3.16c. It has terminal properties equivalent to those of the hybrid-π model but is often more convenient for common-base calculations. For DC and low input frequencies, the capacitors $C_{\\pi}$ and $C_{\\mu}$ act as high-impedance elements and can be disregarded. Initially, assume $r_{b}=0$ and $r_{o} \\rightarrow \\infty$, making the circuit unilateral. When $r_{\\mu}$ is also neglected, the model simplifies to the form shown in Fig. 3.16d. Using the T model under these conditions, the small-signal analysis is facilitated.\n\nFigure 3.15 depicts a typical common-base amplifier circuit using an NPN transistor Q1. The input voltage Vi is applied to the base, and the output voltage Vo is taken from the collector. The resistor RC connects the collector to the positive supply voltage VCC.\n\nFigure 3.16(a) illustrates the hybrid-π model of a transistor, including resistors, capacitors, and a controlled current source to model the transistor's behavior. The input is at the base node B, and the output is at the collector node C.\n\nIn Fig. 3.16(b), the collector current source gmv1 is split into two current sources in series, with the midpoint connected to the base. This modification does not alter the current flowing in the base.\n\nFig. 3.16(c) shows the conversion of the current source between the base and emitter into a resistor of value $1 / g_{m}$.\n\nFig. 3.16(d) represents the transformation of a hybrid-π model of an NPN transistor to a T model for low frequencies, involving the replacement of the current source between the base and emitter with a resistor of value 1/gm.\n\nFigure 3.17 presents a small-signal equivalent circuit of the common-base stage, assuming negligible $r_{o}$, $r_{b}$, and $r_{\\mu}$.

    "text": "In the common-base (CB) configuration, the input signal is applied to the emitter of the transistor, and the output is taken from the collector, with the base connected to ac ground. This setup is illustrated in Fig. 3.15. Although not as widely employed as the common-emitter amplifier, the common-base configuration possesses certain attributes that make it beneficial in specific scenarios. This section focuses on calculating the small-signal characteristics of the common-base stage.\n\nThe hybrid-π model accurately represents the small-signal behavior of a transistor, irrespective of the circuit configuration. However, for the common-base stage, this model can be somewhat unwieldy due to the dependent current source being connected between the input and output terminals. Simplification can be achieved by modifying the model as depicted in Fig. 3.16. The small-signal hybrid-π model is shown in Fig. 3.16a. Initially, note that the dependent current source flows from the collector to the emitter. The circuit behavior remains unchanged if this single current source is replaced by two identical current sources, one flowing from the collector to the base and the other from the base to the emitter, as shown in Fig. 3.16b. Since the currents entering and leaving the base are equal, the equations describing these circuits remain the same. Additionally, the controlled current source between the base and emitter is governed by the voltage across its own terminals. By applying Ohm's law to this branch, this dependent current source can be substituted with a resistor of value \\(1 / g_{m}\\). This resistance appears in parallel with \\(r_{\\pi}\\), and their parallel combination is termed the emitter resistance \\(r_{e}\\).\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\nr_{e}=\\frac{1}{g_{m}+\\frac{1}{r_{\\pi}}}=\\frac{1}{g_{m}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{\\beta_{0}}\\right)}=\\frac{\\alpha_{0}}{g_{m}} \\tag{3.29}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\n\nThe revised equivalent circuit, known as the T model, is presented in Fig. 3.16c. It retains the same terminal properties as the hybrid-π model but is often more convenient for common-base calculations. For dc and low input frequencies, the capacitors \\(C_{\\pi}\\) and \\(C_{\\mu}\\) act as high-impedance elements and can be disregarded. Initially, assume \\(r_{b}=0\\) and \\(r_{o} \\rightarrow \\infty\\), rendering the circuit unilateral. When \\(r_{\\mu}\\) is also neglected, the model simplifies to the form shown in Fig. 3.16d. Using the T model under these conditions, the small-signal analysis proceeds.\n\nFigure 3.15 depicts a typical common-base amplifier circuit using an NPN transistor Q1. The input voltage \\(V_i\\) is applied to the base, and the output voltage \\(V_o\\) is taken from the collector. The resistor \\(R_C\\) is connected between the collector and the positive supply voltage \\(V_{CC}\\).\n\nFigure 3.16(a) illustrates the hybrid-π model, including resistors \\(r_b\\) and \\(r_{\\pi}\\), capacitors \\(C_{\\pi}\\) and \\(C_{\\mu}\\), resistor \\(r_{\\mu}\\), and a controlled current source \\(g_m v_1\\). The input is at the base node B, and the output is at the collector node C.\n\nIn Fig. 3.16(b), the collector current source \\(g_mv_1\\) is split into two current sources in series, with the midpoint connected to the base. This modification does not alter the base current.\n\nFig. 3.16(c) shows the conversion of the current source between the base and emitter into a resistor of value \\(1 / g_{m}\\).\n\nFig. 3.16(d) represents the transformation of the hybrid-π model of an NPN transistor to a T model for low frequencies, involving the replacement of the current source between the base and emitter with a resistor of value \\(1 / g_{m}\\).\n\nFigure 3.17 presents a small-signal equivalent circuit of the common-base stage, assuming negligible \\(r_{o}\\), \\(r_{b}\\), and \\(r_{\\mu}\\). It includes an input resistance \\(r_{e}\\), a voltage-controlled current source \\(g_m v_e\\), and an output resistance \\(R_C\\).\n\nBy examining Fig. 3.17, the short-circuit transconductance is determined as:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\nG_{m}=g_{m} \\tag{3.30}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\n\nThe input resistance is simply the resistance \\(r_{e}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{i}=r_{e} \\tag{3.31}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\n\nThe output resistance is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{o}=R_{C} \\tag{3.32}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\n\nUsing these parameters, the open-circuit voltage gain and the short-circuit current gain are:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n& a_{v}=G_{m} R_{o}=g_{m} R_{C}  \\tag{3.33}\\\\\n& a_{i}=G_{m} R_{i}=g_{m} r_{e}=\\alpha_{0} \\tag{3.34}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nComparing (3.31) and (3.13) reveals that the input resistance of the common-base configuration is a factor of \\(\\left(\\beta_{0}+1\\right)\\) lower than that of the common-emitter configuration. Similarly, comparing (3.34) and (3.18) shows that the current gain of the common-base configuration is reduced by a factor of \\(\\left(\\beta_{0}+1\\right)\\) relative to the common-emitter configuration.\n\nUntil now, the assumption has been that \\(r_{b}\\) is negligible. In practice, however, the base resistance significantly impacts the transconductance and input resistance at high current levels. To recalculate these parameters with \\(r_{b}>0\\), assume the transistor operates in the forward-active region and consider the small-signal model shown in Fig. 3.18. Here, the transconductance is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\nG_{m}=\\left.\\frac{i_{o}}{v_{i}}\\right|_{v_{o}=0}=g_{m}\\left(\\frac{v_{e}}{v_{i}}\\right) \\tag{3.35}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\n\nTo find the relationship between \\(v_{e}\\) and \\(v_{i}\\), apply Kirchoff's current law (KCL) and Kirchoff's voltage law (KVL) at the internal base node (node (1)) and around the input loop, respectively. From KCL at node (1):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\ng_{m} v_{e}+\\frac{v_{b}}{r_{b}}-\\frac{v_{e}}{r_{e}}=0 \\tag{3.36}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\n\nFigure 3.18 depicts the small-signal model of the common-base stage with \\(r_{b}>0\\), including resistors \\(r_{e}\\), \\(r_{b}\\), \\(R_C\\), and a voltage-controlled current source \\(g_m v_e\\). The input voltage is \\(V_i\\) and the output voltage is \\(V_o\\).\n\nFrom KVL around the input loop:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{i}=v_{e}+v_{b} \\tag{3.37}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\n\nSolving (3.37) for \\(v_{b}\\), substituting into (3.36), and rearranging yields:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{v_{i}}{v_{e}}=1+\\frac{g_{m}}{\\beta_{0}} r_{b}=1+\\frac{r_{b}}{r_{\\pi}} \\tag{3.38}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting (3.38) into (3.35) gives:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\nG_{m}=\\frac{g_{m}}{1+\\frac{r_{b}}{r_{\\pi}}} \\tag{3.39}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, the input resistance in Fig. 3.18 is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{i}=\\frac{v_{i}}{i_{i}}=\\frac{v_{i}}{v_{e} / r_{e}}=r_{e}\\left(\\frac{v_{i}}{v_{e}}\\right) \\tag{3.40}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting (3.38) into (3.40) results in:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{i}=r_{e}\\left(1+\\frac{r_{b}}{r_{\\pi}}\\right)=\\frac{\\alpha_{0}}{g_{m}}\\left(1+\\frac{r_{b}}{r_{\\pi}}\\right) \\tag{3.41}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\n\nThus, if the dc collector current is sufficiently high such that \\(r_{\\pi}\\) is comparable to \\(r_{b}\\), the effects of base resistance must be considered. For instance, if \\(r_{b}=100 \\Omega\\) and \\(\\beta_{0}=100\\), a collector current of 26 mA makes \\(r_{b}\\) and \\(r_{\\pi}\\) equal.\n\nThe primary reasons for employing common-base stages are twofold. First, the collector-base capacitance does not cause high-frequency feedback from the output to the input, as it does in the common-emitter amplifier. This is crucial for high-frequency amplifier design, as discussed in Chapter 7. Second, as detailed in Chapter 4, the common-base amplifier can achieve a much higher output resistance than the common-emitter stage in the limit where \\(R_{C} \\rightarrow \\infty\\). Consequently, the common-base configuration can serve as a current source whose current remains nearly independent of the voltage across it."

RD is the load resistor connected to VDD.\n\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:\n[\nname: ro, type: Resistor, value: ro, ports: {N1: S, N2: D}\nname: gmVgs, type: CurrentSource, value: gmVgs, ports: {Np: S, Nn: D}\nname: gmbVbs, type: CurrentSource, value: gmbVbs, ports: {Np: S, Nn: D}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit diagram (a) shows a low-frequency hybrid-π model of an NMOS transistor with two dependent current sources, gmVgs and gmbVbs, paralleled with a resistor ro between the source (S) and drain (D). This setup is used for small-signal analysis of MOSFETs.\nimage_name:(b)\ndescription:\n[\nname: r_o, type: Resistor, value: r_o, ports: {N1: S, N2: D}\nname: (g_m + g_mb) v_sg, type: CurrentSource, value: (g_m + g_mb) v_sg, ports: {Np: S, Nn: D}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit diagram (b) illustrates a simplified model where two dependent current sources are merged into a single source with value (g_m + g_mb) v_sg. This is part of converting a hybrid-π model to a T model for low-frequency analysis.\nimage_name:(c)\ndescription:\n[\nname: ro, type: Resistor, value: ro, ports: {N1: S, N2: D}\nname: (gm+gmb)Vsg, type: CurrentSource, value: (gm+gmb)Vsg, ports: {Np: S, Nn: GND}\nname: (gm+gmb)Vsg, type: CurrentSource, value: (gm+gmb)Vsg, ports: {Np: D, Nn: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit diagram (c) depicts a simplified transistor model combining resistors and current sources. It includes a resistor 'ro' between the source (S) and drain (D), and two dependent current sources labeled '(gm+gmb)Vsg'. One current source connects the source to ground, and the other connects the drain to ground. This forms part of a common-gate amplifier model.\nimage_name:(d)\ndescription:\n[\nname: ro, type: Resistor, value: ro, ports: {N1: S, N2: D}\nname: (gm+gmb)vsg, type: CurrentSource, value: (gm+gmb)vsg, ports: {Np: G(GND), Nn: D}\nname: 1/(gm+gmb), type: Resistor, value: 1/(gm+gmb), ports: {N1: S, N2: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit diagram (d) shows a simplified T model of a transistor with resistors and current sources modeling the transistor's behavior in terms of transconductance and output resistance. The source connects to a resistor and a current source, while the drain connects to another current source, with the gate grounded.\n\nFigure 3.20 Conversion from hybrid-π to T model. (a) Low-frequency hybrid-π model. (b) The two dependent sources are combined. (c) The combined source is split into two sources. (d) The current source between the source and gate is replaced by a resistor.\n\nThus, in Fig. 3.20b, the two dependent current sources are merged. In Fig. 3.20c, the combined current source from the source to the drain is substituted with two current sources: one from the source to the gate and the other from the gate to the drain. Since the gate experiences equal incoming and outgoing currents, the equations describing the circuits in Figs. 3.20b and 3.20c are the same. Ultimately, because the current source from the source to the gate is governed by the voltage across it, it can be replaced by a resistor with a value of $1 /\\left(g_{m}+g_{m b}\\right)$, as shown in Fig. 3.20d.\n\nIf $r_{o}$ is finite, the circuit in Fig. 3.20d becomes bilateral due to feedback via $r_{o}$. Initially, we'll assume $r_{o} \\rightarrow \\infty$, making the circuit unilateral. Under these conditions, using the T model, the small-signal equivalent circuit of the common-gate stage is depicted in Fig. 3.21. By examining Fig. 3.21,\n\n$$\n\\begin{gather*}\nG_{m}=g_{m}+g_{m b}  \\tag{3.42}\\\\\nR_{i}=\\frac{1}{g_{m}+g_{m b}}  \\tag{3.43}\\\\\nR_{o}=R_{D} \\tag{3.44}\n\\end{gather*}\n$$\n\nimage_name:Figure 3.21\ndescription:\n[\nname: 1/gm+gmb, type: Resistor, value: 1/gm+gmb, ports: {N1: vi, N2: GND}\nname: (gm+gmb)vsg, type: CurrentSource, value: (gm+gmb)vsg, ports: {Np: Vo, Nn: GND}\nname: RD, type: Resistor, value: RD, ports: {N1: Vo, N2: vo}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit represents a small-signal equivalent of a common-gate stage with a current source and resistors, assuming ro is negligible for a unilateral circuit. The input is at node vi, and the output is at node vo.\n\nFigure 3.21 Small-signal equivalent circuit of the common-gate stage; $r_{o}$ is assumed negligible.\n\nWith these parameters, the open-circuit voltage gain and the short-circuit current gain are calculated as\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& a_{v}=G_{m} R_{o}=\\left(g_{m}+g_{m b}\\right) R_{D}  \\tag{3.45}\\\\\n& a_{i}=G_{m} R_{i}=1 \\tag{3.46}\n\\end{align*}\n$$"
