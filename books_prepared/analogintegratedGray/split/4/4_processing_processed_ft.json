Function: This circuit is a simple current mirror with a beta helper (Q2) and multiple outputs (Q3, Q4). The beta helper reduces the gain error due to finite beta (βF) by a factor of [βF + 1]. The resistors R1, R3, and R4 are set to zero in this analysis. The gain from input to each output is determined by the area ratios IS3/IS1 and IS4/IS1. The total base current is increased due to the bases of three transistors being connected, which increases the gain error."

These ratios are crucial because they ensure that the output currents are scaled versions of the input current, based on the physical sizes (areas) of the transistors. This allows for precise control over the current distribution in the circuit, which is essential for the accurate operation of the current mirror with multiple outputs."

Routing the gate-source voltage of $M1$ to multiple locations on the IC can lead to mismatches and increased susceptibility to noise, which can affect the accuracy and stability of the bias currents. Additionally, in bipolar technologies, the finite value of $\\beta_{F}$ can lead to gain errors that increase with the number of outputs, although this can be mitigated using a beta-helper configuration."

            "value": "To overcome the problems with voltage routing, the circuit can be built so that $M1 - M3$ are close together physically, and the current outputs $I_{OUT1}$ and $I_{OUT2}$ are routed as required on the IC. This case is referred to as an example of the current routing of bias signals. Here is the netlist of the modified circuit: [name: M1, type: NMOS, ports: {S: GND, D: X0, G: X0}, name: M2, type: NMOS, ports: {S: GND, D: X0, G: X0}, name: M3, type: NMOS, ports: {S: GND, D: X0, G: X0}, name: M4, type: PMOS, ports: {S: VDD, D: X1, G: X1}, name: M5, type: PMOS, ports: {S: VDD, D: X2, G: X2}, name: M6, type: NMOS, ports: {S: GND, D: X2, G: X2}, name: M7, type: NMOS, ports: {S: GND, D: I_OUT1, G: X2}, name: M8, type: PMOS, ports: {S: VDD, D: X3, G: X3}, name: M9, type: PMOS, ports: {S: VDD, D: X4, G: X4}, name: M10, type: NMOS, ports: {S: GND, D: X4, G: X4}, name: M11, type: NMOS, ports: {S: GND, D: I_OUT2, G: X4}, name: IIN, type: CurrentSource, value: IIN, ports: {Np: VDD, Nn: X0}]. The function of the circuit is as follows: The circuit is a bias-distribution circuit utilizing both current and voltage routing. It includes a current routing bus for bias signals, addressing mismatch and supply resistance issues by reducing distances between transistors. The circuit outputs two currents, I_OUT1 and I_OUT2, to separate loads. How does current routing reduce the problems with mismatch and supply resistance compared to voltage routing?"

            "value": "Current routing reduces the problems with mismatch and supply resistance by placing the transistors $M1 - M3$ close together physically, which minimizes the distances between the input and output transistors in the current mirror. This proximity reduces the likelihood of mismatches due to process variations and decreases the impact of supply resistance, leading to more accurate and stable bias currents. By routing the current outputs $I_{OUT1}$ and $I_{OUT2}$ directly to the loads, the circuit avoids the need to route the gate-source voltage, thereby simplifying the signal path and improving overall performance."

            "value": "One disadvantage of current routing is that it requires one node to be routed for each bias signal. Therefore, when the number of bias outputs is large, the die area required for the interconnect to distribute the bias currents can be much larger than that required with voltage routing. Another disadvantage is that current routing can increase the parasitic capacitance on the drains of $M2$ and $M3$. If these nodes are connected to circuits that process high-frequency signals, the increased parasitic capacitance can reduce performance in some ways. For example, if $M2$ and $M3$ act as the tail current sources of differential pairs, the increased parasitic capacitance will increase the common-mode gain and reduce the common-mode rejection ratio of each differential pair at high frequencies."
