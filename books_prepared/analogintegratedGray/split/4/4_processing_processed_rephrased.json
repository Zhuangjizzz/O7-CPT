    "text": "A current mirror is a component featuring at least three terminals, as depicted in Fig. 4.1. The common terminal is linked to a power supply, while the input current source is connected to the input terminal. Ideally, the output current equals the input current multiplied by a specified current gain. If the gain is unity, the input current is mirrored to the output, hence the term \"current mirror.\" Under ideal conditions, the current-mirror gain remains unaffected by the input frequency, and the output current is不受 the voltage between the output and common terminals. Additionally, the voltage between the input and common terminals ideally equals zero, allowing the entire supply voltage to be applied across the input current source, simplifying its transistor-level design. Sometimes, multiple input and/or output terminals are utilized.\n\nIn reality, transistor-level current mirrors exhibit several deviations from this ideal behavior. For instance, the gain of a real current mirror is never entirely independent of the input frequency. Frequency response is discussed in Chapter 7, while this chapter primarily focuses on dc and low-frequency ac signals. The deviations from ideality considered in this chapter are as follows:\n\n1. A significant deviation is the variation of the current-mirror output current with changes in the output terminal voltage. This effect is characterized by the small-signal output resistance, $R_{o}$, of the current mirror. A Norton-equivalent model of the current mirror's output includes $R_{o}$ in parallel with a current source controlled by the input current. The output resistance critically impacts the performance of circuits using current mirrors. For example, the common-mode rejection ratio of differential amplifiers and the gain of active-load circuits depend on this resistance. Increasing the output resistance reduces the output current's dependence on the output voltage, which is desirable. Generally, the output resistance in practical circuits increases as the output current decreases. However, reducing the output current also lowers the maximum operating speed. Therefore, when comparing the output resistance of two current mirrors, they should be evaluated at the same output current.\n\n2. Another key error source is the gain error, which is the deviation of the current mirror's gain from its ideal value. The gain error is divided into two components: (1) systematic gain error and (2) random gain error. The systematic gain error, $\\epsilon$, occurs even with perfectly matched elements in the mirror and will be calculated for each current mirror discussed in this section. The random gain error results from unintended mismatches between matched elements.\n\n3. When the input current source is connected to the input terminal of a real current mirror, it induces a positive voltage drop, $V_{\\text{IN}}$, which decreases the voltage available across the input current source. Minimizing $V_{\\text{IN}}$ is crucial as it simplifies the design of the input current source, especially in low-supply applications. To reduce $V_{\\text{IN}}$, some current mirrors have multiple input terminals. In such cases, we will calculate an input voltage for each terminal. An example is the MOS high-swing cascode current mirror discussed in Section 4.2.5.\n\n4. A positive output voltage, $V_{\\text{OUT}}$, is necessary to ensure the output current primarily depends on the input current. This is summarized by the minimum voltage across the output branch, $V_{\\text{OUT(min)}}$, which allows the output device(s) to operate in the active region. Minimizing $V_{\\text{OUT(min)}}$ maximizes the range of output voltages where the current-mirror output resistance remains nearly constant, crucial for applications using current mirrors as active loads in amplifiers, especially with low power-supply voltages. This topic is covered in Section 4.3. When current mirrors have multiple output terminals, each must be biased above its $V_{\\text{OUT(min)}}$ to ensure the corresponding output current mainly depends on the input current.\n\nLater sections will compare the performance of various current mirrors based on these four parameters: $R_{o}$, $\\epsilon$, $V_{\\text{IN}}$, and $V_{\\text{OUT(min)}}$. \n\n**Block Diagram Descriptions:**\n\n**Figure (a):**\nThis block diagram, labeled \"(a),\" illustrates a current mirror circuit referenced to ground.

The presence of $R_{o}$ highlights non-ideality by introducing a dependency of $I_{OUT}$ on $V_{OUT}$. This setup is common in analog circuits for current replication and biasing, where stable current is vital.\n\n**Figure 4.1:** Current-mirror block diagrams referenced to (a) ground and (b) the positive supply."

    "text": "#### 4.2.2.1 Bipolar\n\nA fundamental current mirror design involves two transistors, and Figure 4.2 illustrates its bipolar version. Transistor $Q_{1}$ has a diode connection, which sets its collector-base voltage to zero. In this configuration, the collector-base junction is inactive, meaning no injection occurs there, and $Q_{1}$ operates in the forward-active region. Assuming $Q_{2}$ also operates in the forward-active region and both transistors exhibit infinite output resistance, the output current $I_{\\text {OUT }}$ is governed by $V_{B E 2}$, which is equivalent to $V_{B E 1}$ as per KVL. The KVL equation is central to the functioning of all current mirrors. Ignoring junction leakage currents,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{B E 2}=V_{T} \\ln \\frac{I_{C 2}}{I_{S 2}}=V_{B E 1}=V_{T} \\ln \\frac{I_{C 1}}{I_{S 1}} \\tag{4.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $V_{T}=k T / q$ represents the thermal voltage, and $I_{S 1}$ and $I_{S 2}$ are the saturation currents of the transistors. From (4.1),\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C 2}=\\frac{I_{S 2}}{I_{S 1}} I_{C 1} \\tag{4.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor identical transistors where $I_{S 1}=I_{S 2}$, equation (4.2) indicates that the current flowing through the collector of $Q_{1}$ is mirrored in the collector of $Q_{2}$. Applying KCL at the collector of $Q_{1}$ results in\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{\\mathrm{IN}}-I_{C 1}-\\frac{I_{C 1}}{\\beta_{F}}-\\frac{I_{C 2}}{\\beta_{F}}=0 \\tag{4.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFigure 4.2 depicts a simple bipolar current mirror consisting of two identical NPN transistors, Q1 and Q2. The input current $I_{IN}$ is mirrored to the output, $I_{OUT}$, under the assumption that $I_{OUT} = I_{C2} = I_{C1}$. The current mirror's gain is approximately unity if the transistors are identical and $\\beta_{F}$ is large.\n\nFor identical transistors,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{\\mathrm{OUT}}=I_{C 2}=I_{C 1}=\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{IN}}}{1+\\frac{2}{\\beta_{F}}} \\tag{4.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWhen $\\beta_{F}$ is large, the base currents are negligible, and\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{\\mathrm{OUT}}=I_{C 1} \\simeq I_{\\mathrm{IN}} \\tag{4.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, for identical devices $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$, the current mirror's gain is approximately unity. This holds true for both DC and low-frequency AC currents. However, above the $3-\\mathrm{dB}$ frequency of the mirror, the base current increases significantly due to the decreased impedance of the base-emitter capacitance, which reduces the gain of the current mirror. Frequency response is examined in Chapter 7. The remainder of this section focuses on DC currents only.\n\nIn practical applications, the devices need not be identical. Then, from (4.2) and (4.3),\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{\\mathrm{OUT}}=\\frac{I_{S 2}}{I_{S 1}} I_{C 1}=\\left(\\frac{I_{S 2}}{I_{S 1}} I_{\\mathrm{IN}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1+\\left(I_{S 2} / I_{S 1}\\right)}{\\beta_{F}}}\\right) \\tag{4.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWhen $I_{S 2}=I_{S 1}$, (4.6) is equivalent to (4.4). Since the saturation current of a bipolar transistor is proportional to its emitter area, the first term in (4.6) indicates that the current mirror's gain can be greater or less than unity by adjusting the emitter areas. If the desired current-mirror gain is a rational number, $M / N$, the area ratio is usually achieved by connecting $M$ identical devices in parallel to form $Q_{2}$ and $N$ devices in parallel to form $Q_{1}$, minimizing mismatch due to lithographic effects in forming the emitter regions. However, area ratios greater than about five to one require a significant die area dominated by the larger device. Therefore, other methods described in later sections are preferred for generating large current ratios. The last term in (4.6) accounts for the error introduced by finite $\\beta_{F}$. Increasing $I_{S 2} / I_{S 1}$ magnifies this error by increasing the base current of $Q_{2}$ relative to $Q_{1}$.\n\nIn deriving (4.1) and (4.2), it was assumed that the collector currents of the transistors are independent of their collector-emitter voltages. If a transistor is biased in the forward-active region, its collector current actually increases slowly with increasing collector-emitter voltage. Figure 4.3 shows an output characteristic for $Q_{2}$. The output resistance of the current mirror at any given operating point is the reciprocal of the slope of the output characteristic at that point. In the forward-active region,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{o}=r_{o 2}=\\frac{V_{A}}{I_{C 2}} \\tag{4.7}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFigure 4.3 illustrates the output characteristic curve for an NPN transistor, specifically for $Q_{2}$. This graph plots the collector current ($I_{OUT} = I_{C2}$) on the vertical axis against the collector-emitter voltage ($V_{OUT} = V_{CE2}$) on the horizontal axis.\n\nThe point where $V_{C E 2}=V_{C E 1}$ and $V_{B E 2}=V_{B E 1}$ is labeled on the characteristic. Since the collector current is controlled by the base-emitter and collector-emitter voltages, $I_{C 2}=$ $\\left(I_{S 2} / I_{S 1}\\right) I_{C 1}$ at this point. If the slope of the characteristic in saturation is constant, the variation in $I_{C 2}$ for changes in $V_{C E 2}$ can be predicted by a straight line that goes through the labeled point. As described in Chapter 1, extrapolation of the output characteristic in the forward-active region back to the $V_{C E 2}$ axis gives an intercept at $-V_{A}$, where $V_{A}$ is the Early voltage. If $V_{A} \\gg V_{C E 1}$, the slope of the straight line is about equal to $\\left(I_{S 2} / I_{S 1}\\right)\\left(I_{C 1} / V_{A}\\right)$. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{\\mathrm{OUT}}=\\frac{I_{S 2}}{I_{S 1}} I_{C 1}\\left(1+\\frac{V_{C E 2}-V_{C E 1}}{V_{A}}\\right)=\\frac{\\frac{I_{S 2}}{I_{S 1}} I_{\\mathrm{IN}}\\left(1+\\frac{V_{C E 2}-V_{C E 1}}{V_{A}}\\right)}{1+\\frac{1+\\left(I_{S 2} / I_{S 1}\\right)}{\\beta_{F}}} \\tag{4.8}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince the ideal gain of the current mirror is $I_{S 2} / I_{S 1}$, the systematic gain error, $\\epsilon$, of the current mirror can be calculated from (4.8).\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\epsilon=\\left(\\frac{1+\\frac{V_{C E 2}-V_{C E 1}}{V_{A}}}{1+\\frac{1+\\left(I_{S 2} / I_{S 1}\\right)}{\\beta_{F}}}\\right)-1 \\simeq \\frac{V_{C E 2}-V_{C E 1}}{V_{A}}-\\frac{1+\\left(I_{S 2} / I_{S 1}\\right)}{\\beta_{F}} \\tag{4.9}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe first term in (4.9) arises from finite output resistance, and the second term from finite $\\beta_{F}$. If $V_{C E 2}>V_{C E 1}$, the polarities of the two terms are opposite. However, since the two terms are independent, cancellation is unlikely in practice. The first term dominates when the difference in the collector-emitter voltages and $\\beta_{F}$ are large. For example, with identical transistors and $V_{A}=130 \\mathrm{~V}$, if the collector-emitter voltage of $Q_{1}$ is held at $V_{B E(\\mathrm{on})}$, and if the collector-emitter voltage of $Q_{2}$ is 30 V , then the systematic gain error $(30-0.6) / 130-2 / 200 \\simeq 0.22$. Thus, for a circuit operating at a power-supply voltage of 30 V , the current-mirror currents can differ by more than 20 percent from those values calculated by assuming that the transistor output resistance and $\\beta_{F}$ are infinite. Although the first term in (4.9) stems from finite output resistance, it does not depend on $r_{o 2}$ directly but instead on the collector-emitter and Early voltages. The Early voltage is independent of the bias current, and\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\mathrm{IN}}=V_{C E 1}=V_{B E 1}=V_{B E(\\mathrm{on})} \\tag{4.10}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince $V_{B E(\\text { on })}$ is proportional to the natural logarithm of the collector current, $V_{\\text {IN }}$ changes little with changes in bias current. Therefore, changing the bias current in a current mirror primarily alters the systematic gain error through changes in $V_{C E 2}$.\n\nFinally, the minimum output voltage required to keep $Q_{2}$ in the forward-active region is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\mathrm{OUT}(\\mathrm{~min})}=V_{\\text {CE2(sat) }} \\tag{4.11}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n#### 4.2.2.2 MOS\n\nFigure 4.4 depicts an MOS version of the simple current mirror. The drain-gate voltage of $M_{1}$ is zero, which means the channel is absent at the drain, and the transistor operates in the saturation or active region if the threshold is positive. Although the principle of operation for MOS transistors does not involve forward biasing any diodes, $M_{1}$ is considered diode-connected, similar to the bipolar case. Assuming $M_{2}$ also operates in the active region and both transistors have infinite output resistance, the drain current $I_{D 2}$ is controlled by $V_{G S 2}$, which is equal to $V_{G S 1}$ as per KVL. The KVL equation is fundamental to the operation of all current mirrors. As described in Section 1.5.3, the gate-source voltage of a MOS transistor is usually divided into two parts: the threshold $V_{t}$ and the overdrive $V_{o v}$. Assuming square-law behavior as in (1.157), the overdrive for $M_{2}$ is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{o v 2}=V_{G S 2}-V_{t}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2 I_{D 2}}{k^{\\prime}(W / L)_{2}}} \\tag{4.12}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince the transconductance parameter $k^{\\prime}$ is proportional to mobility, and mobility decreases with increasing temperature, the overdrive increases with temperature. In contrast, Section 1.5.4 shows that the threshold decreases with increasing temperature. From KVL and (1.157),\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{G S 2}=V_{t}+\\sqrt{\\frac{2 I_{D 2}}{k^{\\prime}(W / L)_{2}}}=V_{G S 1}=V_{t}+\\sqrt{\\frac{2 I_{D 1}}{k^{\\prime}(W / L)_{1}}} \\tag{4.13}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation 4.13 shows that the overdrive of $M_{2}$ is equal to that of $M_{1}$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{o v 2}=V_{o v 1}=V_{o v} \\tag{4.14}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor identical transistors where $(W / L)_{2}=(W / L)_{1}$, then\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{\\mathrm{OUT}}=I_{D 2}=I_{D 1} \\tag{4.15}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation 4.15 shows that the current flowing in the drain of $M_{1}$ is mirrored in the drain of $M_{2}$. Since $\\beta_{F} \\rightarrow \\infty$ for MOS transistors, (4.15) and KCL at the drain of $M_{1}$ yield\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{\\mathrm{OUT}}=I_{D 1}=I_{\\mathrm{IN}} \\tag{4.16}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, for identical devices operating in the active region with infinite output resistance, the gain of the current mirror is unity. This holds true when the gate currents are zero; that is, (4.16) is at least approximately correct for DC and low-frequency AC currents. However, as the input frequency increases, the gate currents of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ increase due to the nonzero gate-source capacitance of each transistor. The portion of the input current that flows into the gate leads does not flow into the drain of $M_{1}$ and is not mirrored to $M_{2}$; therefore, the gain of the current mirror decreases as the frequency of the input current increases. The rest of this section considers DC currents only.\n\nIn practical applications, the devices need not be identical. Then, from (4.13) and (4.16),\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{\\mathrm{OUT}}=\\frac{(W / L)_{2}}{(W / L)_{1}} I_{D 1}=\\frac{(W / L)_{2}}{(W / L)_{1}} I_{\\mathrm{IN}} \\tag{4.17}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation 4.17 shows that the gain of the current mirror can be greater or less than unity by adjusting the transistor sizes. To adjust the transistor sizes, either the widths or the lengths can be made unequal in principle. In practice, however, the lengths of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ are rarely made unequal. The lengths that enter into (4.17) are the effective channel lengths given by (2.35). Equation 2.35 shows that the effective channel length of a given transistor differs from its drawn length due to offset terms stemming from the depletion region at the drain and lateral diffusion at the drain and source. Since the offset terms are independent of the drawn length, a ratio of two effective channel lengths is equal to the drawn ratio only if the drawn lengths are identical. As a result, a ratio of unequal channel lengths depends on process parameters that may not be well controlled in practice. Similarly, Section 2.9.1 shows that the effective width of a given transistor differs from the drawn width due to lateral oxidation resulting in a bird's beak. Therefore, a ratio of unequal channel widths will also be process dependent. In many applications, however, the shortest channel length allowed in a given technology is selected for most transistors to maximize speed and minimize area. In contrast, the drawn channel widths are usually many times larger than the minimum dimensions allowed in a given technology. Therefore, to minimize the effect of the offset terms when the current-mirror gain is designed to differ from unity, the widths are adjusted rather than the lengths in most practical cases. If the desired current-mirror gain is a rational number, $M / N$, the ratio is usually achieved by connecting $M$ identical devices in parallel to form $M_{2}$ and $N$ devices in parallel to form $M_{1}$, minimizing mismatch due to lithographic effects in forming the gate regions. As in the bipolar case, ratios greater than about five to one require a significant die area dominated by the larger device. Therefore, other methods described in later sections are preferred for generating large current ratios.\n\nIn deriving (4.13) and (4.15), it was assumed that the drain currents of the transistors are independent of their drain-source voltages. If a transistor is biased in the active region, its drain current actually increases slowly with increasing drain-source voltage. Figure 4.5 shows an output characteristic for $M_{2}$. The output resistance of the current mirror at any given operating point is the reciprocal of the slope of the output characteristic at that point. In the active region,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{o}=r_{o 2}=\\frac{V_{A}}{I_{D 2}}=\\frac{1}{\\lambda I_{D 2}} \\tag{4.18}\n\\end{equation*"

    "text": "A basic current mirror configuration involves a pair of transistors. Figure 4.2 illustrates a bipolar variant of this mirror. Transistor $Q_{1}$ is connected as a diode, causing its collector-base voltage to drop to zero. In this configuration, the collector-base junction is inactive as there is no injection occurring there, and $Q_{1}$ functions in the forward-active region. Presuming that $Q_{2}$ also operates in the forward-active region and that both transistors exhibit infinite output resistance, the output current $I_{\\text {OUT }}$ is dictated by $V_{B E 2}$, which, according to Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL), equals $V_{B E 1}$. A KVL equation forms the basis of all current mirror operations. Ignoring junction leakage currents, the equation is as follows:\n\n$$\nV_{B E 2}=V_{T} \\ln \\frac{I_{C 2}}{I_{S 2}}=V_{B E 1}=V_{T} \\ln \\frac{I_{C 1}}{I_{S 1}} \\tag{4.1}\n$$\n\nHere, $V_{T}=k T / q$ denotes the thermal voltage, and $I_{S 1}$ and $I_{S 2}$ represent the saturation currents of the transistors.

Beyond the $3-\\mathrm{dB}$ frequency of the mirror, the base current increases significantly due to the decreased impedance of the base-emitter capacitance, which reduces the mirror's gain. Frequency response is discussed in Chapter 7, whereas this section focuses on dc currents only.\n\nIn practical scenarios, the devices need not be identical. Combining equations (4.2) and (4.3) yields:\n\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{OUT}}=\\frac{I_{S 2}}{I_{S 1}} I_{C 1}=\\left(\\frac{I_{S 2}}{I_{S 1}} I_{\\mathrm{IN}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1+\\left(I_{S 2} / I_{S 1}\\right)}{\\beta_{F}}}\\right) \\tag{4.6}\n$$\n\nWhen $I_{S 2}=I_{S 1}$, equation (4.6) aligns with equation (4.4).

However, area ratios exceeding approximately five to one lead to a significant die area dominated by the larger device, making alternative methods described later more suitable for generating large current ratios. The last term in (4.6) accounts for errors introduced by finite $\\beta_{F}$.

However, in the forward-active region, the collector current of a transistor actually increases gradually with increasing collector-emitter voltage. Figure 4.3 displays an output characteristic for $Q_{2}$. The output resistance of the current mirror at any operating point is the reciprocal of the slope of the output characteristic at that point. In the forward-active region:\n\n$$\nR_{o}=r_{o 2}=\\frac{V_{A}}{I_{C 2}} \\tag{4.7}\n$$\n\nRefer to Figure 4.3 for the npn output characteristic.\n\nThe point where $V_{C E 2}=V_{C E 1}$ and $V_{B E 2}=V_{B E 1}$ is indicated on the characteristic. Since the collector current is governed by the base-emitter and collector-emitter voltages, $I_{C 2}=$ $\\left(I_{S 2} / I_{S 1}\\right) I_{C 1}$ at this point. If the slope of the characteristic in saturation is constant, the variation in $I_{C 2}$ with $V_{C E 2}$ can be predicted by a straight line passing through the labeled point. As explained in Chapter 1, extrapolating the output characteristic in the forward-active region back to the $V_{C E 2}$ axis yields an intercept at $-V_{A}$, where $V_{A}$ is the Early voltage. If $V_{A} \\gg V_{C E 1}$, the slope of the straight line is approximately $\\left(I_{S 2} / I_{S 1}\\right)\\left(I_{C 1} / V_{A}\\right)$. Hence:\n\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{OUT}}=\\frac{I_{S 2}}{I_{S 1}} I_{C 1}\\left(1+\\frac{V_{C E 2}-V_{C E 1}}{V_{A}}\\right)=\\frac{\\frac{I_{S 2}}{I_{S 1}} I_{\\mathrm{IN}}\\left(1+\\frac{V_{C E 2}-V_{C E 1}}{V_{A}}\\right)}{1+\\frac{1+\\left(I_{S 2} / I_{S 1}\\right)}{\\beta_{F}}} \\tag{4.8}\n$$\n\nGiven that the ideal gain of the current mirror is $I_{S 2} / I_{S 1}$, the systematic gain error, $\\epsilon$, can be calculated from (4.8) as:\n\n$$\n\\epsilon=\\left(\\frac{1+\\frac{V_{C E 2}-V_{C E 1}}{V_{A}}}{1+\\frac{1+\\left(I_{S 2} / I_{S 1}\\right)}{\\beta_{F}}}\\right)-1 \\simeq \\frac{V_{C E 2}-V_{C E 1}}{V_{A}}-\\frac{1+\\left(I_{S 2} / I_{S 1}\\right)}{\\beta_{F}} \\tag{4.9}\n$$\n\nThe first term in (4.9) originates from finite output resistance, and the second term from finite $\\beta_{F}$. If $V_{C E 2}>V_{C E 1}$, the polarities of the two terms are opposite. Although theoretically possible, practical cancellation is unlikely. The first term prevails when the difference in collector-emitter voltages and $\\beta_{F}$ is substantial. For instance, with identical transistors and $V_{A}=130 \\mathrm{~V}$, if the collector-emitter voltage of $Q_{1}$ is maintained at $V_{B E(\\mathrm{on})}$, and that of $Q_{2}$ is 30 V, the systematic gain error is approximately 0.22. Thus, for a circuit operating at a 30 V power-supply voltage, the current-mirror currents can deviate by over 20 percent from values calculated under the assumption of infinite transistor output resistance and $\\beta_{F}$. Although the first term in (4.9) arises from finite output resistance, it depends on the collector-emitter and Early voltages rather than directly on $r_{o 2}$. Since the Early voltage is independent of the bias current:\n\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{IN}}=V_{C E 1}=V_{B E 1}=V_{B E(\\mathrm{on})} \\tag{4.10}\n$$\n\nAs $V_{B E(\\text { on })}$ is proportional to the natural logarithm of the collector current, $V_{\\text {IN }}$ exhibits minimal change with bias current variations. Therefore, altering the bias current in a current mirror primarily affects systematic gain error through changes in $V_{C E 2}$.\n\nThe minimum output voltage necessary to maintain $Q_{2}$ in the forward-active region is:\n\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{OUT}(\\mathrm{~min})}=V_{\\text {CE2(sat) }} \\tag{4.11}\n$$\n\n#### 4.2.2.2 MOS\n\nFigure 4.4 depicts an MOS variant of the simple current mirror. The drain-gate voltage of $M_{1}$ is zero, meaning the channel is absent at the drain, and the transistor operates in the saturation or active region if the threshold voltage is positive. Although the operating principle of MOS transistors does not involve forward-biasing diodes, $M_{1}$ is considered diode-connected, similar to the bipolar case. Assuming $M_{2}$ also operates in the active region and both transistors possess infinite output resistance, the drain current $I_{D 2}$ is controlled by $V_{G S 2}$, which equals $V_{G S 1}$ due to KVL. A KVL equation underpins the functioning of all current mirrors. As detailed in Section 1.5.3, the gate-source voltage of a MOS transistor is typically divided into the threshold $V_{t}$ and the overdrive $V_{o v}$. Assuming square-law behavior as per (1.157), the overdrive for $M_{2}$ is:\n\n$$\nV_{o v 2}=V_{G S 2}-V_{t}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2 I_{D 2}}{k^{\\prime}(W / L)_{2}}} \\tag{4.12}\n$$\n\nSince the transconductance parameter $k^{\\prime}$ is proportional to mobility, and mobility decreases with increasing temperature, the overdrive increases with temperature. Conversely, Section 1.5.4 shows that the threshold voltage decreases with increasing temperature. From KVL and (1.157):\n\n$$\nV_{G S 2}=V_{t}+\\sqrt{\\frac{2 I_{D 2}}{k^{\\prime}(W / L)_{2}}}=V_{G S 1}=V_{t}+\\sqrt{\\frac{2 I_{D 1}}{k^{\\prime}(W / L)_{1}}} \\tag{4.13}\n$$\n\nEquation 4.13 indicates that the overdrive of $M_{2}$ matches that of $M_{1}$:\n\n$$\nV_{o v 2}=V_{o v 1}=V_{o v} \\tag{4.14}\n$$\n\nFor identical transistors where $(W / L)_{2}=(W / L)_{1}$:\n\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{OUT}}=I_{D 2}=I_{D 1} \\tag{4.15}\n$$\n\nEquation 4.15 shows that the current flowing through the drain of $M_{1}$ is mirrored in the drain of $M_{2}$. Since $\\beta_{F} \\rightarrow \\infty$ for MOS transistors, equation (4.15) and KCL at the drain of $M_{1}$ yield:\n\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{OUT}}=I_{D 1}=I_{\\mathrm{IN}} \\tag{4.16}\n$$\n\nThus, for identical devices operating in the active region with infinite output resistance, the current mirror's gain is unity. This holds true when gate currents are negligible, meaning equation (4.16) is at least approximately correct for dc and low-frequency ac currents. However, as the input frequency rises, the gate currents of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ increase due to the transistors' non-zero gate-source capacitance. The portion of the input current flowing into the gate does not reach the drain of $M_{1}$ and is not mirrored to $M_{2}$, causing the current mirror's gain to decrease with increasing input current frequency. This section exclusively considers dc currents.\n\nIn practice, the devices need not be identical. Combining equations (4.13) and (4.16) gives:\n\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{OUT}}=\\frac{(W / L)_{2}}{(W / L)_{1}} I_{D 1}=\\frac{(W / L)_{2}}{(W / L)_{1}} I_{\\mathrm{IN}} \\tag{4.17}\n$$\n\nEquation 4.17 shows that the current mirror's gain can be greater or less than unity by adjusting the transistor sizes. To alter the transistor sizes, either the widths or lengths can be modified in theory. However, in practice, the lengths of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ are seldom unequal. The lengths that enter into (4.17) are the effective channel lengths per (2.35). Equation 2.35 shows that the effective channel length of a transistor differs from its drawn length due to the depletion region at the drain and lateral diffusion at the drain and source. Since the offset terms are independent of the drawn length, a ratio of two effective channel lengths equals the drawn ratio only if the drawn lengths are the same. Consequently, a ratio of unequal channel lengths depends on process parameters that may not be precisely controlled in practice. Similarly, Section 2.9.1 demonstrates that the effective width of a transistor differs from the drawn width due to lateral oxidation, creating a bird's beak. Thus, a ratio of unequal channel widths will also be process-dependent. However, in many applications, the shortest channel length permitted in a given technology is chosen for most transistors to maximize speed and minimize area. In contrast, the drawn channel widths are usually much larger than the minimum dimensions allowed in a given technology. Therefore, to minimize the impact of offset terms when the current-mirror gain is intended to deviate from unity, widths are typically adjusted rather than lengths in most practical scenarios. To achieve a desired current-mirror gain of $M / N$, it is common to connect $M$ identical devices in parallel to form $M_{2}$ and $N$ devices in parallel to form $M_{1}$, minimizing mismatches due to lithographic effects during the gate region formation. As with the bipolar case, ratios exceeding approximately five to one result in a substantial die area dominated by the larger device, making alternative methods described later more suitable for generating large current ratios.\n\nIn deriving equations (4.13) and (4.15), it was assumed that the drain currents are independent of the drain-source voltages. However, in the active region, the drain current of a transistor actually increases gradually with increasing drain-source voltage. Figure 4.5 shows an output characteristic for $M_{2}$. The output resistance of the current mirror at any operating point is the reciprocal of the slope of the output characteristic at that point. In the active region:\n\n$$\nR_{o}=r_{o 2}=\\frac{V_{A}}{I_{D 2}}=\\frac{1}{\\lambda I_{D 2}} \\tag{4.18}\n$$\n\nThe point where $V_{D S 2}=V_{D S 1}$ and $V_{G S 2}=V_{G S 1}$ is indicated on the characteristic. Since the drain current is controlled by the gate-source and drain-source voltages, $I_{D 2}=$ $\\left[(W / L)_{2} /(W / L)_{1}\\right] I_{D 1}$ at this point. If the slope of the characteristic in saturation is constant, the variation in $I_{D 2}$ with $V_{D S 2}$ can be predicted by a straight line passing through the labeled point. As explained in Chapter 1, extrapolating the output characteristic in the active region back to the $V_{D S 2}$ axis yields an intercept at $-V_{A}=-1 / \\lambda$, where $V_{A}$ is the Early voltage. If $V_{A} \\gg V_{D S 1}$, the slope of the straight line is approximately $\\left[(W / L)_{2} /(W / L)_{1}\\right]\\left[I_{D 1} / V_{A}\\right]$. Therefore:\n\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{OUT}}=\\frac{(W / L)_{2}}{(W / L)_{1}} I_{\\mathrm{IN}}\\left(1+\\frac{V_{D S 2}-V_{D S 1}}{V_{A}}\\right) \\tag{4.19}\n$$\n\nGiven that the ideal gain of the current mirror is $(W / L)_{2} /(W / L)_{1}$, the systematic gain error, $\\epsilon$, can be calculated from (4.19) as:\n\n$$\n\\epsilon=\\frac{V_{D S 2}-V_{D S 1}}{V_{A}} \\tag{4.20}\n$$\n\nFor example, if the drain-source voltage of $M_{1}$ is held at 1.2 V, and that of $M_{2}$ is 5 V, the systematic"

Combining equations (4.2) and (4.3) yields:\n\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{OUT}}=\\frac{I_{S 2}}{I_{S 1}} I_{C 1}=\\left(\\frac{I_{S 2}}{I_{S 1}} I_{\\mathrm{IN}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1+\\left(I_{S 2} / I_{S 1}\\right)}{\\beta_{F}}}\\right) \\tag{4.6}\n$$\n\nWhen $I_{S 2}=I_{S 1}$, equation (4.6) aligns with (4.4). Since the saturation current of a bipolar transistor is proportional to its emitter area, the first term in (4.6) indicates that the current mirror's gain can exceed or fall short of unity by adjusting the emitter areas. To achieve a desired current-mirror gain of $M / N$, $M$ identical devices are connected in parallel to form $Q_{2}$, and $N$ devices for $Q_{1}$, minimizing mismatches due to lithographic effects. However, area ratios exceeding five to one require a substantial die area, dominated by the larger device. Consequently, alternative methods, discussed later, are preferred for generating large current ratios. The last term in (4.6) accounts for errors due to finite $\\beta_{F}$. Increasing $I_{S 2} / I_{S 1}$ amplifies this error by boosting the base current of $Q_{2}$ relative to $Q_{1}$.\n\nIn deriving (4.1) and (4.2), we assumed the collector currents are independent of the collector-emitter voltages. However, if a transistor is biased in the forward-active region, its collector current gradually increases with the collector-emitter voltage. Figure 4.3 illustrates an output characteristic for $Q_{2}$. The current mirror's output resistance at any operating point is the inverse of the characteristic's slope at that point. In the forward-active region, the output resistance is:\n\n$$\nR_{o}=r_{o 2}=\\frac{V_{A}}{I_{C 2}} \\tag{4.7}\n$$\n\nFigure 4.3 shows an output characteristic curve for an NPN transistor, specifically $Q_{2}$. This graph plots the collector current ($I_{OUT} = I_{C2}$) against the collector-emitter voltage ($V_{OUT} = V_{CE2}$).\n\nThe graph displays a typical characteristic curve for a transistor in the forward-active region. As $V_{OUT}$ rises from negative values, $I_{OUT}$ remains low and constant, representing the cutoff region. Upon reaching a threshold ($V_{CE1}$), $I_{OUT}$ begins to climb, signaling the active region. In this region, the curve is linear, indicating that $I_{OUT}$ increases with $V_{OUT}$, albeit at a slower pace.\n\nKey points on the graph include the labeled point where $V_{BE2} = V_{BE1}$ and $V_{CE2} = V_{CE1}$, defining $I_{C2}$ as $\\left(\\frac{I_{S2}}{I_{S1}}\\right) I_{C1}$. The slope of the characteristic line in the active region correlates with the output resistance of the current mirror, calculated as $R_{o}=\\frac{V_{A}}{I_{C2}}$. A dashed line extends from the origin through the active region, representing the linear approximation of $I_{C2}$ versus $V_{CE2}$ changes.\n\nThe graph provides a visual representation of the transistor's behavior across different operating regions, emphasizing the transition from cutoff to active regions and the linear relationship in the forward-active region.\n\nAt the labeled point on the characteristic where $V_{CE2}=V_{CE1}$ and $V_{BE2}=V_{BE1}$, the collector current $I_{C2}$ is defined as $\\left(I_{S2} / I_{S1}\\right) I_{C1}$. If the slope in saturation is constant, the variation in $I_{C2}$ with $V_{CE2}$ changes can be predicted by a straight line through this point. Extrapolating the output characteristic in the forward-active region back to the $V_{CE2}$ axis yields an intercept at $-V_{A}$, where $V_{A}$ is the Early voltage. If $V_{A} \\gg V_{CE1}$, the straight line's slope approximates $\\left(I_{S2} / I_{S1}\\right)\\left(I_{C1} / V_{A}\\right)$. Hence:\n\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{OUT}}=\\frac{I_{S 2}}{I_{S 1}} I_{C 1}\\left(1+\\frac{V_{CE 2}-V_{CE 1}}{V_{A}}\\right)=\\frac{\\frac{I_{S 2}}{I_{S 1}} I_{\\mathrm{IN}}\\left(1+\\frac{V_{CE 2}-V_{CE 1}}{V_{A}}\\right)}{1+\\frac{1+\\left(I_{S 2} / I_{S 1}\\right)}{\\beta_{F}}} \\tag{4.8}\n$$\n\nGiven the ideal gain of the current mirror as $I_{S 2} / I_{S 1}$, the systematic gain error, $\\epsilon$, can be calculated from (4.8):\n\n$$\n\\epsilon=\\left(\\frac{1+\\frac{V_{CE 2}-V_{CE 1}}{V_{A}}}{1+\\frac{1+\\left(I_{S 2} / I_{S 1}\\right)}{\\beta_{F}}}\\right)-1 \\simeq \\frac{V_{CE 2}-V_{CE 1}}{V_{A}}-\\frac{1+\\left(I_{S 2} / I_{S 1}\\right)}{\\beta_{F}} \\tag{4.9}\n$$\n\nThe first term in (4.9) arises from finite output resistance, and the second from finite $\\beta_{F}$. If $V_{CE 2}>V_{CE 1}$, the polarities of these terms differ. However, since they are independent, cancellation is unlikely in practice. The first term prevails when the difference in collector-emitter voltages and $\\beta_{F}$ are substantial. For instance, with identical transistors and $V_{A}=130 \\mathrm{~V}$, if the collector-emitter voltage of $Q_{1}$ is maintained at $V_{B E(\\mathrm{on})}$, and $Q_{2}$'s at 30 V, the systematic gain error is approximately 0.22. Thus, for a circuit operating at a 30 V power-supply voltage, the current-mirror currents can deviate by over 20 percent from values calculated assuming infinite output resistance and $\\beta_{F}$. Although the first term in (4.9) stems from finite output resistance, it depends on the collector-emitter and Early voltages, not directly on $r_{o 2}$. The Early voltage is independent of the bias current, and:\n\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{IN}}=V_{C E 1}=V_{B E 1}=V_{B E(\\mathrm{on})} \\tag{4.10}\n$$\n\nSince $V_{B E(\\text { on })}$ is proportional to the natural logarithm of the collector current, $V_{\\text {IN }}$ exhibits minimal change with bias current variations. Hence, altering the bias current in a current mirror primarily affects systematic gain error through changes in $V_{C E 2}$.\n\nThe minimum output voltage required to maintain $Q_{2}$ in the forward-active region is:\n\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{OUT}(\\mathrm{~min})}=V_{\\text {CE2(sat) }} \\tag{4.11}\n$$\n\n#### 4.2.2.2 MOS\n\nFigure 4.4 presents an MOS variant of the simple current mirror. The drain-gate voltage of $M_{1}$ is zero, meaning the channel is absent at the drain, and the transistor operates in the saturation or active region if the threshold is positive. Despite the lack of forward-biased diodes in MOS operation, $M_{1}$ is considered diode-connected, analogous to the bipolar case. Assuming $M_{2}$ also operates in the active region and both transistors have infinite output resistance, the drain current $I_{D 2}$ is controlled by $V_{G S 2}$, which equals $V_{G S 1}$ by KVL. KVL underpins the operation of all current mirrors. As described in Section 1.5.3, the gate-source voltage of a MOS transistor typically consists of the threshold $V_{t}$ and the overdrive $V_{o v}$. Assuming square-law behavior as per (1.157), the overdrive for $M_{2}$ is:\n\n$$\nV_{o v 2}=V_{G S 2}-V_{t}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2 I_{D 2}}{k^{\\prime}(W / L)_{2}}} \\tag{4.12}\n$$\n\nSince the transconductance parameter $k^{\\prime}$ is proportional to mobility, and mobility decreases with temperature, the overdrive increases with temperature. Conversely, Section 1.5.4 demonstrates that the threshold decreases with temperature. From KVL and (1.157):\n\n$$\nV_{G S 2}=V_{t}+\\sqrt{\\frac{2 I_{D 2}}{k^{\\prime}(W / L)_{2}}}=V_{G S 1}=V_{t}+\\sqrt{\\frac{2 I_{D 1}}{k^{\\prime}(W / L)_{1}}} \\tag{4.13}\n$$\n\nEquation 4.13 shows that the overdrive of $M_{2}$ matches that of $M_{1}$:\n\n$$\nV_{o v 2}=V_{o v 1}=V_{o v} \\tag{4.14}\n$$\n\nFor identical transistors, where $(W / L)_{2}=(W / L)_{1}$:\n\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{OUT}}=I_{D 2}=I_{D 1} \\tag{4.15}\n$$\n\nEquation 4.15 indicates that the current flowing through the drain of $M_{1}$ is mirrored to the drain of $M_{2}$. With $\\beta_{F} \\rightarrow \\infty$ for MOS transistors, (4.15) and KCL at the drain of $M_{1}$ result in:\n\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{OUT}}=I_{D 1}=I_{\\mathrm{IN}} \\tag{4.16}\n$$\n\nThus, for identical devices operating in the active region with infinite output resistance, the current mirror's gain is unity. This holds true when gate currents are zero, meaning (4.16) is approximately correct for DC and low-frequency AC currents. However, as the input frequency rises, the gate currents of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ increase due to their nonzero gate-source capacitances. The portion of the input current flowing into the gate leads does not reach the drain of $M_{1}$ and is not mirrored to $M_{2}$, causing the current mirror's gain to decrease with increasing input current frequency. This section focuses exclusively on DC currents.\n\nIn practice, the devices need not be identical. From (4.13) and (4.16), we obtain:\n\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{OUT}}=\\frac{(W / L)_{2}}{(W / L)_{1}} I_{D 1}=\\frac{(W / L)_{2}}{(W / L)_{1}} I_{\\mathrm{IN}} \\tag{4.17}\n$$\n\nEquation 4.17 shows that the current mirror's gain can exceed or fall short of unity by adjusting the transistor sizes. In principle, either the widths or lengths can be altered to achieve size ratios. However, in practice, the lengths of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ are seldom different. The lengths in (4.17) are effective channel lengths, as defined by (2.35). Equation 2.35 shows that the effective channel length of a transistor differs from its drawn length due to the depletion region at the drain and lateral diffusion at the drain and source. Since the offset terms are independent of the drawn length, a ratio of two effective channel lengths equals the drawn ratio only if the lengths are identical. As a result, a ratio of unequal channel lengths becomes process-dependent. Similarly, Section 2.9.1 shows that the effective width of a transistor differs from the drawn width due to lateral oxidation, leading to a bird's beak. Hence, a ratio of unequal channel widths is also process-dependent. In many applications, the shortest channel length permitted in a given technology is chosen for most transistors to maximize speed and minimize area. In contrast, the drawn channel widths are usually much larger than the minimum dimensions allowed in a given technology. Therefore, to minimize the impact of offset terms when designing a current-mirror gain different from unity, widths are typically adjusted rather than lengths in practical scenarios. To achieve a desired current-mirror gain of $M / N$, $M$ identical devices, referred to as units, are connected in parallel to form $M_{2}$, and $N$ units for $M_{1}$, minimizing mismatches due to lithographic effects. As in the bipolar case, ratios exceeding five to one necessitate a large die area, dominated by the larger device. Therefore, alternative methods, discussed later, are preferred for generating large current ratios.\n\nIn deriving (4.13) and (4.15), we assumed the drain currents are independent of the drain-source voltages. However, if a transistor is biased in the active region, its drain current gradually increases with the drain-source voltage. Figure 4.5 shows an output characteristic for $M_{2}$. The current mirror's output resistance at any operating point is the inverse of the characteristic's slope at that point. In the active region:\n\n$$\nR_{o}=r_{o 2}=\\frac{V_{A}}{I_{D 2}}=\\frac{1}{\\lambda I_{D 2}} \\tag{4.18}\n$$\n\nFigure 4.5 depicts the output characteristic of a simple MOS current mirror. This graph shows the relationship between the output current, $I_{OUT} = I_{D2}$, and the output voltage, $V_{OUT} = V_{DS2}$.\n\nThe graph starts with a sharp increase in current as the voltage rises from zero, indicating the initial linear region. After the initial surge, the curve reaches a saturation region where the current remains relatively constant despite further voltage increases. The curve is generally flat in the saturation region, demonstrating that the current is stable and controlled by the gate-source voltage.\n\nKey points on the graph include the labeled point where the curve transitions from the linear region to the saturation region, showing the intersection at $V_{DS1}$. The current at this point is given by $\\frac{(W/L)_2}{(W/L)_1} I_{D1}$, illustrating the scaling of current"

This conclusion applies to both dc and low-frequency ac currents. However, above the $3-\\mathrm{dB}$ frequency of the mirror, the base current increases significantly due to the reduced impedance of the base-emitter capacitance, diminishing the gain of the current mirror. Frequency response is explored in Chapter 7. The remainder of this section focuses exclusively on dc currents.\n\nIn practical applications, the devices need not be identical.

Since the saturation current of a bipolar transistor is proportional to its emitter area, the first term in (4.6) demonstrates that the current mirror's gain can exceed or fall short of unity due to the ratio of emitter areas. If the desired current-mirror gain is a rational number, $M / N$, the area ratio is typically achieved by connecting $M$ identical devices, termed units, in parallel to form $Q_{2}$ and $N$ units in parallel to form $Q_{1}$, minimizing mismatches stemming from lithographic effects during the formation of the emitter regions. However, area ratios exceeding approximately five to one occupy a substantial die area, dominated by the larger of the two devices. Consequently, other methods outlined in subsequent sections are favored for generating large current ratios. The final term in (4.6) accounts for errors introduced by finite $\\beta_{F}$.

If the slope of the characteristic in saturation is constant, the variation in $I_{C 2}$ for changes in $V_{C E 2}$ can be predicted by a straight line that passes through the annotated point. As detailed in Chapter 1, extrapolating the output characteristic in the forward-active region back to the $V_{C E 2}$ axis yields an intercept at $-V_{A}$, where $V_{A}$ is the Early voltage.

The first term prevails when the discrepancy in collector-emitter voltages and $\\beta_{F}$ is significant. For instance, with identical transistors and $V_{A}=130 \\mathrm{~V}$, if the collector-emitter voltage of $Q_{1}$ is maintained at $V_{B E(\\mathrm{on})}$, and the collector-emitter voltage of $Q_{2}$ is 30 V, the systematic gain error is $(30-0.6) / 130-2 / 200 \\simeq 0.22$. Consequently, for a circuit operating at a power-supply voltage of 30 V, the current-mirror currents can deviate by over 20 percent from the values calculated by assuming infinite transistor output resistance and $\\beta_{F}$.

The drain-gate voltage of $M_{1}$ is zero, precluding the channel's existence at the drain and necessitating operation in the saturation or active region if the threshold is positive. Despite the lack of forward-biased diodes in MOS transistors, $M_{1}$ is considered diode-connected, analogous to the bipolar case. Assuming $M_{2}$ also operates in the active region and both transistors possess infinite output resistance, the drain current $I_{D 2}$ is governed by $V_{G S 2}$, which, as per KVL, equals $V_{G S 1}$. A KVL equation is pivotal to the operation of all current mirrors. As described in Section 1.5.3, the gate-source voltage of a MOS transistor is commonly divided into two components: the threshold $V_{t}$ and the overdrive $V_{o v}$. Assuming square-law behavior as in (1.157), the overdrive for $M_{2}$ is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{o v 2}=V_{G S 2}-V_{t}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2 I_{D 2}}{k^{\\prime}(W / L)_{2}}} \\tag{4.12}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince the transconductance parameter $k^{\\prime}$ is proportional to mobility, and mobility decreases with increasing temperature, the overdrive increases with temperature. Conversely, Section 1.5.4 demonstrates that the threshold decreases with increasing temperature.

Considering that $\\beta_{F} \\rightarrow \\infty$ for MOS transistors, equations (4.15) and KCL at the drain of $M_{1}$ yield\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{\\mathrm{OUT}}=I_{D 1}=I_{\\mathrm{IN}} \\tag{4.16}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, for identical devices operating in the active region with infinite output resistance, the current mirror's gain is unity. This conclusion holds when gate currents are negligible; that is, (4.16) is at least approximately accurate for dc and low-frequency ac currents. However, as the input frequency rises, the gate currents of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ increase due to the non-zero gate-source capacitance of each transistor. The portion of the input current flowing into the gate leads does not reach the drain of $M_{1}$ and is not mirrored to $M_{2}$; hence, the current mirror's gain diminishes with increasing input current frequency. The subsequent discussion in this section is limited to dc currents.\n\nIn practical scenarios, the devices need not be identical.

    "text": "#### 4.2.2.1 Bipolar\n\nA basic current mirror design involves two transistors. As illustrated in Fig. 4.2, a bipolar variant of this mirror is depicted. Transistor $Q_{1}$ is configured as a diode, which drives its collector-base voltage to zero. This configuration turns off the collector-base junction, precluding any injection from occurring there, and ensures that $Q_{1}$ functions in the forward-active region. Assuming that $Q_{2}$ also operates in the forward-active region and both transistors exhibit infinite output resistance, the output current $I_{\\text {OUT }}$ is dictated by $V_{B E 2}$, which is equivalent to $V_{B E 1}$ due to Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL). KVL is fundamental to the operation of all current mirrors.

Applying Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at the collector of $Q_{1}$ results in\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{\\mathrm{IN}}-I_{C 1}-\\frac{I_{C 1}}{\\beta_{F}}-\\frac{I_{C 2}}{\\beta_{F}}=0 \\tag{4.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFig. 4.2 depicts a simple bipolar current mirror, featuring two identical NPN transistors, Q1 and Q2. The input current $I_{\\mathrm{IN}}$ is mirrored to the output, $I_{\\mathrm{OUT}}$, under the assumption that $I_{\\mathrm{OUT}} = I_{C2} = I_{C1}$. The current mirror's gain is approximately unity when the transistors are identical and $\\beta_F$ is large.\n\nFor identical transistors,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{\\mathrm{OUT}}=I_{C 2}=I_{C 1}=\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{IN}}}{1+\\frac{2}{\\beta_{F}}} \\tag{4.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWhen $\\beta_{F}$ is large, the base currents are negligible, and\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{\\mathrm{OUT}}=I_{C 1} \\simeq I_{\\mathrm{IN}} \\tag{4.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHence, for identical devices $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$, the current mirror's gain is approximately unity. This holds true for both DC and low-frequency AC currents. Beyond the $3-\\mathrm{dB}$ frequency of the mirror, however, the base current increases significantly due to the decreased impedance of the base-emitter capacitance, which diminishes the gain of the current mirror. Frequency response is discussed in Chapter 7. The remainder of this section focuses solely on DC currents.\n\nIn practical applications, the devices do not need to be identical. Using equations (4.2) and (4.3),\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{\\mathrm{OUT}}=\\frac{I_{S 2}}{I_{S 1}} I_{C 1}=\\left(\\frac{I_{S 2}}{I_{S 1}} I_{\\mathrm{IN}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1+\\left(I_{S 2} / I_{S 1}\\right)}{\\beta_{F}}}\\right) \\tag{4.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWhen $I_{S 2}=I_{S 1}$, equation (4.6) is equivalent to (4.4). Given that the saturation current of a bipolar transistor is proportional to its emitter area, the first term in (4.6) suggests that the gain of the current mirror can exceed or fall short of unity by adjusting the emitter areas. If a rational current-mirror gain of $M / N$ is desired, the area ratio is typically achieved by connecting $M$ identical devices in parallel to form $Q_{2}$ and $N$ devices in parallel to form $Q_{1}$, thereby minimizing mismatch due to lithographic variations in the emitter regions. However, area ratios greater than approximately five to one necessitate a significant die area, dominated by the larger of the two devices. Consequently, other methods detailed in subsequent sections are favored for generating large current ratios. The final term in (4.6) accounts for the error introduced by finite $\\beta_{F}$. Increasing $I_{S 2} / I_{S 1}$ magnifies this error by enhancing the base current of $Q_{2}$ relative to that of $Q_{1}$.\n\nIn deriving equations (4.1) and (4.2), it was assumed that the collector currents of the transistors are independent of their collector-emitter voltages. In reality, if a transistor is biased in the forward-active region, its collector current gradually increases with increasing collector-emitter voltage. Fig. 4.3 presents an output characteristic for $Q_{2}$. The output resistance of the current mirror at any given operating point is the reciprocal of the slope of the output characteristic at that point. In the forward-active region,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{o}=r_{o 2}=\\frac{V_{A}}{I_{C 2}} \\tag{4.7}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFig. 4.3 illustrates an output characteristic curve for an NPN transistor, specifically for $Q_{2}$. This curve plots the collector current ($I_{OUT} = I_{C2}$) on the vertical axis against the collector-emitter voltage ($V_{OUT} = V_{CE2}$) on the horizontal axis.\n\nThe key point where $V_{C E 2}=V_{C E 1}$ and $V_{B E 2}=V_{B E 1}$ is marked on the characteristic. Since the collector current is governed by the base-emitter and collector-emitter voltages, $I_{C 2}=$ $\\left(I_{S 2} / I_{S 1}\\right) I_{C 1}$ at this point. If the slope of the characteristic in saturation is constant, the variation in $I_{C 2}$ with changes in $V_{C E 2}$ can be approximated by a straight line that passes through the labeled point. As explained in Chapter 1, extrapolating the output characteristic in the forward-active region back to the $V_{C E 2}$ axis yields an intercept at $-V_{A}$, where $V_{A}$ is the Early voltage. If $V_{A} \\gg V_{C E 1}$, the slope of the straight line is approximately equal to $\\left(I_{S 2} / I_{S 1}\\right)\\left(I_{C 1} / V_{A}\\right)$. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{\\mathrm{OUT}}=\\frac{I_{S 2}}{I_{S 1}} I_{C 1}\\left(1+\\frac{V_{C E 2}-V_{C E 1}}{V_{A}}\\right)=\\frac{\\frac{I_{S 2}}{I_{S 1}} I_{\\mathrm{IN}}\\left(1+\\frac{V_{C E 2}-V_{C E 1}}{V_{A}}\\right)}{1+\\frac{1+\\left(I_{S 2} / I_{S 1}\\right)}{\\beta_{F}}} \\tag{4.8}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince the ideal gain of the current mirror is $I_{S 2} / I_{S 1}$, the systematic gain error, $\\epsilon$, of the current mirror can be derived from equation (4.8).\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\epsilon=\\left(\\frac{1+\\frac{V_{C E 2}-V_{C E 1}}{V_{A}}}{1+\\frac{1+\\left(I_{S 2} / I_{S 1}\\right)}{\\beta_{F}}}\\right)-1 \\simeq \\frac{V_{C E 2}-V_{C E 1}}{V_{A}}-\\frac{1+\\left(I_{S 2} / I_{S 1}\\right)}{\\beta_{F}} \\tag{4.9}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe first term in (4.9) originates from finite output resistance, while the second term stems from finite $\\beta_{F}$. If $V_{C E 2}>V_{C E 1}$, the polarities of the two terms are opposite. Nonetheless, cancellation is improbable in practice due to their independence. The first term prevails when the disparity in collector-emitter voltages and $\\beta_{F}$ is substantial. For instance, with identical transistors and $V_{A}=130 \\mathrm{~V}$, if the collector-emitter voltage of $Q_{1}$ is maintained at $V_{B E(\\mathrm{on})}$, and the collector-emitter voltage of $Q_{2}$ is 30 V, the systematic gain error becomes $(30-0.6) / 130-2 / 200 \\simeq 0.22$. Thus, for a circuit operating at a power-supply voltage of 30 V, the current-mirror currents can deviate by over 20 percent from those values calculated under the assumption of infinite transistor output resistance and $\\beta_{F}$. Although the first term in (4.9) is attributed to finite output resistance, it does not directly depend on $r_{o 2}$ but rather on the collector-emitter and Early voltages. The Early voltage is independent of the bias current, and\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\mathrm{IN}}=V_{C E 1}=V_{B E 1}=V_{B E(\\mathrm{on})} \\tag{4.10}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince $V_{B E(\\text { on })}$ is proportional to the natural logarithm of the collector current, $V_{\\text {IN }}$ exhibits minimal change with variations in bias current. Consequently, altering the bias current in a current mirror primarily affects systematic gain error through changes in $V_{C E 2}$.\n\nThe minimum output voltage required to maintain $Q_{2}$ in the forward-active region is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\mathrm{OUT}(\\mathrm{~min})}=V_{\\text {CE2(sat) }} \\tag{4.11}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n#### 4.2.2.2 MOS\n\nFig. 4.4 showcases an MOS variant of the simple current mirror. The drain-gate voltage of $M_{1}$ is zero, precluding the formation of a channel at the drain and causing the transistor to operate in the saturation or active region, provided the threshold voltage is positive. Although the operating principle for MOS transistors does not involve forward-biasing any diodes, $M_{1}$ is considered diode-connected, analogous to the bipolar case. Assuming that $M_{2}$ also operates in the active region and both transistors possess infinite output resistance, the drain current $I_{D 2}$ is governed by $V_{G S 2}$, which is equivalent to $V_{G S 1}$ due to KVL. KVL is integral to the functioning of all current mirrors. As detailed in Section 1.5.3, the gate-source voltage of a MOS transistor is typically partitioned into two components: the threshold $V_{t}$ and the overdrive $V_{o v}$.

This holds true when the gate currents are negligible; that is, equation (4.16) is at least approximately accurate for DC and low-frequency AC currents. However, as the input frequency rises, the gate currents of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ increase due to the non-zero gate-source capacitance of each transistor.

    "text": "### 4.2.2.1 Bipolar\n\nAt its most basic, a current mirror consists just two transistors. Figure 4.2 illustrates a bipolar current mirror. Here, transistor $Q_{1}$ is configured in a diode connection, resulting in a zero collector-to-base voltage. This configuration ensures that the collector-to-base junction is inactive, precluding any current injection, and that $Q_{1}$ operates within the forward-active region. Under the assumption that $Q_{2}$ also operates in the forward-active region and that both transistors exhibit infinite output resistance, the output current $I_{\\text {OUT }}$ is governed by the base-to-emitter voltage $V_{B E 2}$, which, according to Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL), is equivalent to $V_{B E 1}$. The KVL equation is fundamental to the functioning of all current mirrors. Ignoring any junction leakage currents, the following equation holds:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{B E 2}=V_{T} \\ln \\frac{I_{C 2}}{I_{S 2}}=V_{B E 1}=V_{T} \\ln \\frac{I_{C 1}}{I_{S 1}} \\tag{4.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHere, $V_{T}=k T / q$ denotes the thermal voltage, and $I_{S 1}$ and $I_{S 2}$ represent the saturation currents of the transistors. From equation (4.1), we derive:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C 2}=\\frac{I_{S 2}}{I_{S 1}} I_{C 1} \\tag{4.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor identical transistors, where $I_{S 1}=I_{S 2}$, equation (4.2) indicates that the current flowing through the collector of $Q_{1}$ is precisely mirrored in the collector of $Q_{2}$. Applying Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at the collector of $Q_{1}$ yields:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{\\mathrm{IN}}-I_{C 1}-\\frac{I_{C 1}}{\\beta_{F}}-\\frac{I_{C 2}}{\\beta_{F}}=0 \\tag{4.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nRefer to Figure 4.2 for a schematic of the simple bipolar current mirror circuit.\n\nHence, for identical transistors,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{\\mathrm{OUT}}=I_{C 2}=I_{C 1}=\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{IN}}}{1+\\frac{2}{\\beta_{F}}} \\tag{4.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWhen $\\beta_{F}$ is large, the base currents are negligible, and\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{\\mathrm{OUT}}=I_{C 1} \\simeq I_{\\mathrm{IN}} \\tag{4.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nConsequently, for identical devices $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$, the current mirror's gain is approximately unity. This conclusion applies to both direct current (dc) and low-frequency alternating current (ac) currents. Beyond the $3-\\mathrm{dB}$ frequency of the mirror, however, the base current increases significantly due to the decreased impedance of the base-emitter capacitance, which in turn diminishes the current mirror's gain. The frequency response is explored in Chapter 7, while the remainder of this section focuses exclusively on dc currents.\n\nIn practical applications, the devices do not need to be identical. By leveraging equations (4.2) and (4.3), we obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{\\mathrm{OUT}}=\\frac{I_{S 2}}{I_{S 1}} I_{C 1}=\\left(\\frac{I_{S 2}}{I_{S 1}} I_{\\mathrm{IN}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1+\\left(I_{S 2} / I_{S 1}\\right)}{\\beta_{F}}}\\right) \\tag{4.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWhen $I_{S 2}=I_{S 1}$, equation (4.6) is equivalent to (4.4). Given that the saturation current of a bipolar transistor is proportional to its emitter area, the first term in (4.6) reveals that the current mirror's gain can exceed or fall short of unity by adjusting the emitter area ratios. To achieve a desired current-mirror gain of $M / N$, where $M$ and $N$ are integers, $M$ identical devices, referred to as units, are connected in parallel to form $Q_{2}$, and $N$ units are connected in parallel to form $Q_{1}$, thereby minimizing mismatches stemming from lithographic effects during the fabrication of the emitter regions. However, area ratios exceeding approximately five to one necessitate a substantial die area, predominantly occupied by the larger of the two devices. Consequently, alternative methods outlined in subsequent sections are preferred for generating large current ratios. The final term in (4.6) accounts for the error introduced by the finite $\\beta_{F}$. An increase in $I_{S 2} / I_{S 1}$ magnifies this error by augmenting the base current of $Q_{2}$ relative to that of $Q_{1}$.\n\nIn deriving equations (4.1) and (4.2), we assumed that the collector currents of the transistors are independent of their collector-to-emitter voltages. In reality, if a transistor is biased in the forward-active region, its collector current gradually increases with increasing collector-to-emitter voltage. Figure 4.3 depicts an output characteristic for $Q_{2}$. The output resistance of the current mirror at any given operating point is the reciprocal of the slope of the output characteristic at that point. Within the forward-active region,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{o}=r_{o 2}=\\frac{V_{A}}{I_{C 2}} \\tag{4.7}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nRefer to Figure 4.3 for the output characteristic curve of an NPN transistor.\n\nThe point where $V_{C E 2}=V_{C E 1}$ and $V_{B E 2}=V_{B E 1}$ is annotated on the characteristic. Since the collector current is dictated by the base-to-emitter and collector-to-emitter voltages, $I_{C 2}=$ $\\left(I_{S 2} / I_{S 1}\\right) I_{C 1}$ at this juncture. If the slope of the characteristic in saturation is constant, the variation in $I_{C 2}$ in response to changes in $V_{C E 2}$ can be anticipated by a straight line that passes through the annotated point.

The first term prevails when the discrepancy in collector-to-emitter voltages and $\\beta_{F}$ is significant. For instance, with identical transistors and $V_{A}=130 \\mathrm{~V}$, if the collector-to-emitter voltage of $Q_{1}$ is maintained at $V_{B E(\\mathrm{on})}$, and the collector-to-emitter voltage of $Q_{2}$ is 30 V, the systematic gain error is approximately 0.22.

The drain-to-gate voltage of $M_{1}$ is zero, meaning that the channel is absent at the drain, and the transistor operates in either the saturation or active region, provided the threshold voltage is positive. Despite the fact that the operating principle of MOS transistors does not involve forward-biasing diodes, $M_{1}$ is deemed diode-connected in a manner analogous to the bipolar case. Assuming that $M_{2}$ also operates in the active region and that both transistors possess infinite output resistance, the drain current $I_{D 2}$ is controlled by the gate-to-source voltage $V_{G S 2}$, which, according to KVL, is equal to $V_{G S 1}$. A KVL equation forms the core of the operation of all current mirrors. As detailed in Section 1.5.3, the gate-to-source voltage of a MOS transistor is typically divided into two components: the threshold $V_{t}$ and the overdrive $V_{o v}$. Assuming square-law behavior as in (1.157), the overdrive for $M_{2}$ is expressed as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{o v 2}=V_{G S 2}-V_{t}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2 I_{D 2}}{k^{\\prime}(W / L)_{2}}} \\tag{4.12}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nGiven that the transconductance parameter $k^{\\prime}$ is proportional to mobility, and mobility decreases with increasing temperature, the overdrive increases with temperature. Conversely, as shown in Section 1.5.4, the threshold voltage decreases with increasing temperature. From KVL and (1.157),\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{G S 2}=V_{t}+\\sqrt{\\frac{2 I_{D 2}}{k^{\\prime}(W / L)_{2}}}=V_{G S 1}=V_{t}+\\sqrt{\\frac{2 I_{D 1}}{k^{\\prime}(W / L)_{1}}} \\tag{4.13}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation (4.13) indicates that the overdrive of $M_{2}$ is equal to that of $M_{1}$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{o v 2}=V_{o v 1}=V_{o v} \\tag{4.14}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor identical transistors, where $(W / L)_{2}=(W / L)_{1}$, we obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{\\mathrm{OUT}}=I_{D 2}=I_{D 1} \\tag{4.15}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation (4.15) demonstrates that the current flowing through the drain of $M_{1}$ is precisely mirrored in the drain of $M_{2}$. Since $\\beta_{F} \\rightarrow \\infty$ for MOS transistors, equations (4.15) and KCL at the drain of $M_{1}$ lead to:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{\\mathrm{OUT}}=I_{D 1}=I_{\\mathrm{IN}} \\tag{4.16}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, for identical devices operating in the active region with infinite output resistance, the current mirror's gain is unity. This conclusion holds when the gate currents are negligible; that is, equation (4.16) is at least approximately accurate for dc and low-frequency ac currents. However, as the input frequency rises, the gate currents of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ increase due to the non-zero gate-to-source capacitance of each transistor. The portion of the input current that flows into the gate does not reach the drain of $M_{1}$ and is therefore not mirrored to $M_{2}$; as a result, the current mirror's gain diminishes with increasing input current frequency. The remainder of this section focuses solely on dc currents.\n\nIn practical scenarios, the devices need not be identical. By utilizing equations (4.13) and (4.16), we derive:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{\\mathrm{OUT}}=\\frac{(W / L)_{2}}{(W / L)_{1}} I_{D 1}=\\frac{(W / L)_{2}}{(W / L)_{1}} I_{\\mathrm{IN}} \\tag{4.17}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation (4.17) demonstrates that the current mirror's gain can be greater than or less than unity by adjusting the transistor dimensions. To alter the transistor sizes, either the widths or the lengths can be modified in principle. In practice, however, the lengths of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ are seldom made unequal. The lengths that enter into (4.17) are the effective channel lengths as defined by (2.35). Equation (2.35) shows that the effective channel length of a given transistor differs from its drawn length due to offset terms related to the depletion region at the drain and lateral diffusion at the drain and source. Since the offset terms are independent of the drawn length, a ratio of two effective channel lengths is equal to the drawn ratio only if the drawn lengths are identical. Consequently, a ratio of unequal channel lengths is contingent upon process parameters that may not be meticulously controlled in practice. Similarly, Section 2.9.1 demonstrates that the effective width of a given transistor differs from the drawn width due to lateral oxidation, resulting in a bird's beak. Therefore, a ratio of unequal channel widths will also be process-dependent. In many applications, the shortest channel length permitted in a given technology is chosen for the majority of transistors to maximize speed and minimize area. In contrast, the drawn channel widths are typically much larger than the minimum dimensions allowed in a given technology. Hence, to minimize the impact of the offset terms when the current-mirror gain is intended to deviate from unity, the widths are adjusted rather than the lengths in most practical scenarios. To achieve a desired current-mirror gain of $M / N$, where $M$ and $N$ are integers, $M$ identical devices, referred to as units, are connected in parallel to form $M_{2}$, and $N$ units are connected in parallel to form $M_{1}$, thereby minimizing mismatches arising from lithographic effects during the fabrication of the gate regions. Similar to the bipolar case, ratios exceeding approximately five to one necessitate a substantial die area, predominantly occupied by the larger of the two devices. Consequently, alternative methods outlined in subsequent sections are preferred for generating large current ratios.\n\nIn deriving equations (4.13) and (4.15), we assumed that the drain currents of the transistors are independent of their drain-to-source voltages. In reality, if a transistor is biased in the active region, its drain current gradually increases with increasing drain-to-source voltage. Figure 4.5 exhibits an output characteristic for $M_{2}$. The output resistance of the current mirror at any given operating point is the reciprocal of the slope of the output characteristic at that point.

    "text": "#### 4.2.4.1 Bipolar\n\nEnhancing the simple bipolar transistor current mirror depicted in Fig. 4.6 can be achieved by incorporating emitter degeneration, as illustrated in Fig. 4.7 for a current mirror featuring two independent outputs. The emitter resistors serve a dual purpose. Firstly, Appendix A.4.1 demonstrates that the alignment between $I_{\\mathrm{IN}}$ and the outputs $I_{C 3}$ and $I_{C 4}$ can be significantly refined through emitter degeneration. Secondly, as outlined in Section 3.3.8, the application of emitter degeneration enhances the output resistance of each current mirror output. Transistors $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ collectively present a minimal resistance at the bases of $Q_{3}$ and $Q_{4}$. Consequently, from (3.99), the small-signal output resistance observed at the collectors of $Q_{3}$ and $Q_{4}$ is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{o} \\simeq r_{o}\\left(1+g_{m} R_{E}\\right) \\tag{4.29}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nprovided $r_{\\pi} \\gg R_{E}$. Taking $Q_{3}$ as a case study and utilizing $g_{m 3}=I_{C 3} / V_{T}$, we derive\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{o} \\simeq r_{o 3}\\left(1+\\frac{I_{C 3} R_{3}}{V_{T}}\\right) \\tag{4.30}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis elevation in output resistance for a specified output current concurrently reduces the systematic gain error component attributable to finite output resistance by the same magnitude. From (4.9) and (4.30), assuming infinite $\\beta_{F}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\epsilon \\simeq \\frac{V_{C E 2}-V_{C E 1}}{V_{A}\\left(1+\\frac{I_{C 3} R_{3}}{V_{T}}\\right)} \\tag{4.31}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe term $I_{C 3} R_{3}$ represents the dc voltage drop across $R_{3}$. For instance, if this value is 260 mV, then $R_{o}$ approximates $10 r_{o}$ at room temperature, and $\\epsilon$ diminishes by roughly elevenfold. However, this enhancement in $R_{o}$ is constrained by corresponding rises in the input and minimum output voltages of the mirror:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\mathrm{IN}} \\simeq V_{B E 1(\\mathrm{on})}+V_{B E 2(\\mathrm{on})}+I_{\\mathrm{IN}} R_{1} \\tag{4.32}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\mathrm{OUT}(\\mathrm{~min})}=V_{C E 3(\\mathrm{sat})}+I_{C 3} R_{3} \\tag{4.33}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe emitter areas of $Q_{1}, Q_{3}$, and $Q_{4}$ can be matched or proportioned. For example, to achieve $I_{\\text {OUT } 1}=I_{\\mathrm{IN}}$ and $I_{\\text {OUT2 }}=2 I_{\\mathrm{IN}}$, $Q_{3}$ would be made identical to $Q_{1}$, and $Q_{4}$ would comprise two parallel $Q_{1}$ units, ensuring $I_{S 4}=2 I_{S 1}$.

    "text": "#### 4.2.5.1 Bipolar\n\nSection 3.4.2 demonstrates that the cascode configuration achieves a very high output resistance, making it a natural choice for enhancing high-performance current mirrors. A bipolar-transistor current mirror based on the cascode connection is illustrated in Fig. 4.8. Transistors $Q_{3}$ and $Q_{1}$ constitute a basic current mirror, with the option to add emitter resistances for improved matching. Transistor $Q_{2}$ serves as the common-base part of the cascode, transferring $Q_{1}$'s collector current to the output while maintaining a high output resistance. Transistor $Q_{4}$ functions as a diode level shifter, biasing $Q_{2}$'s base to keep $Q_{1}$ in the forward-active region with $V_{C E 1} \\simeq V_{C E 3}=V_{B E 3(\\text { on })}$. Assuming the small-signal resistances of diodes $Q_{3}$ and $Q_{4}$ are minimal, applying (3.98) directly with $R_{E}=r_{o 1}$ yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{o}=r_{o 2}\\left(1+\\frac{g_{m 2} r_{o 1}}{1+\\frac{g_{m 2} r_{o 1}}{\\beta_{0}}}\\right) \\simeq \\beta_{0} r_{o 2} \\tag{4.37}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\ndue to $g_{m 2} r_{o 1} \\simeq g_{m 1} r_{o 1} \\gg \\beta_{0}$. This calculation presumes that most of the small-signal current into $Q_{2}$'s collector exits via its base, given the higher small-signal resistance at $Q_{2}$'s emitter compared to its base. However, this approach overlooks the impact of the simple current mirror formed by $Q_{3}$ and $Q_{1}$. Let $i_{b 2}$ and $i_{e 2}$ denote the increases in base and emitter currents from $Q_{2}$ due to rising output voltage. The simple mirror ensures $i_{e 2} \\simeq i_{b 2}$, causing the variation in $Q_{2}$'s collector current to split evenly, with half flowing through $r_{\\pi 2}$. A small-signal analysis reveals that $R_{o}$ in (4.37) is halved to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{o} \\simeq \\frac{\\beta_{0} r_{o 2}}{2} \\tag{4.38}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, the cascode configuration increases the output resistance by roughly $\\beta_{0} / 2$. For $\\beta_{0}=100, V_{A}=130 \\mathrm{~V}$, and $I_{C 2}=1 \\mathrm{~mA}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{o}=\\frac{\\beta_{0} V_{A}}{2 I_{C 2}}=\\frac{100(130)}{2 \\mathrm{~mA}}=6.5 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega \\tag{4.39}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn this output resistance calculation, the effects of $r_{\\mu}$ are neglected. While this assumption is justified for a simple current mirror, it warrants reevaluation here due to the high output resistance. The collector-base resistance $r_{\\mu}$ arises from the modulation of the base-recombination current due to the Early effect, as detailed in Chapter 1. For a transistor where the base current is entirely base-recombination current, the percentage change in base current with varying $V_{C E}$ at constant $V_{B E}$ matches that of the collector current, making $r_{\\mu}$ equal to $\\beta_{0} r_{0}$. In this scenario, $r_{\\mu}$ would reduce the cascode current mirror's output resistance in (4.38) by a factor of 1.5.\n\nIn actual integrated-circuit npn transistors, only a minor fraction of the base current results from base recombination. Since only this fraction is modulated by the Early effect, observed $r_{\\mu}$ values are at least 10 times greater than $\\beta_{0} r_{o}$, rendering $r_{\\mu}$'s effect negligible. Conversely, for lateral pnp transistors, $r_{\\mu}$ is much smaller due to the predominance of base-region recombination in the base current. The actual $r_{\\mu}$ value depends on various process and device-geometry factors, but observed values range from 2 to 5 times $\\beta_{0} r_{0}$. Thus, in cascode current mirrors using lateral pnp transistors, $r_{\\mu}$ significantly impacts the output resistance. Additionally, when considering current mirrors with output resistances exceeding $\\beta_{0} r_{o}$, $r_{\\mu}$'s effects must be considered.\n\nIn the cascode current mirror, $Q_{1}$'s base connects to a low-resistance point due to $Q_{3}$'s diode connection, significantly attenuating feedback from $r_{\\mu 1}$ and minimizing its impact on output resistance. Conversely, increasing the resistance from $Q_{1}$'s base to ground while keeping other parameters constant enhances local feedback from $r_{\\mu 1}$, affecting $Q_{1}$'s base-emitter voltage and reducing output resistance. In the extreme case where this resistance becomes infinite, $Q_{1}$ behaves like a diode-connected transistor. Local feedback is discussed in Chapter 8.\n\nThe cascode current mirror's input voltage is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\mathrm{IN}}=V_{B E 3}+V_{B E 4}=2 V_{B E(\\text { on })} \\tag{4.40}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAlthough $V_{\\text {IN }}$ is higher than in (4.10) for a simple current mirror, this increase becomes a limitation only if the power-supply voltage approaches two diode drops.\n\nThe minimum output voltage for which (4.38) applies must allow both $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ to operate in the forward-active region.

However, a key limitation of the cascode current mirror is its higher systematic gain error due to finite $\\beta_{F}$ compared to a simple current mirror.

    "text": "#### 4.2.5.1 Bipolar\n\nSection 3.4.2 demonstrates that the cascode configuration achieves a very high output resistance, making it a natural choice for enhancing high-performance current mirrors. Figure 4.8 illustrates a bipolar-transistor current mirror based on the cascode connection. Transistors $Q_{3}$ and $Q_{1}$ constitute a basic current mirror, with emitter resistances optionally added to improve matching. Transistor $Q_{2}$ functions as the common-base part of the cascode, transferring $Q_{1}$'s collector current to the output while maintaining a high output resistance. Transistor $Q_{4}$ serves as a diode level shifter, biasing $Q_{2}$'s base to keep $Q_{1}$ in the forward-active region with $V_{C E 1} \\approx V_{C E 3} = V_{B E 3(\\text{on})}$. Assuming negligible small-signal resistances for diodes $Q_{3}$ and $Q_{4}$, applying (3.98) with $R_{E} = r_{o 1}$ yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{o} = r_{o 2}\\left(1 + \\frac{g_{m 2} r_{o 1}}{1 + \\frac{g_{m 2} r_{o 1}}{\\beta_{0}}}\\right) \\approx \\beta_{0} r_{o 2} \\tag{4.37}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\ndue to $g_{m 2} r_{o 1} \\approx g_{m 1} r_{o 1} \\gg \\beta_{0}$. This calculation assumes most of the small-signal current into $Q_{2}$'s collector exits via its base, given the higher small-signal resistance at $Q_{2}$'s emitter compared to its base. However, this approach overlooks the simple current mirror formed by $Q_{3}$ and $Q_{1}$. Let $i_{b 2}$ and $i_{e 2}$ denote increases in $Q_{2}$'s base and emitter currents due to rising output voltage. The simple mirror forces $i_{e 2} \\approx i_{b 2}$, splitting the variation in $Q_{2}$'s collector current equally, with half flowing through $r_{\\pi 2}$. A small-signal analysis reveals that $R_{o}$ in (4.37) is halved to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{o} \\approx \\frac{\\beta_{0} r_{o 2}}{2} \\tag{4.38}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, the cascode configuration increases the output resistance by roughly $\\beta_{0} / 2$.

While justifiable for a simple current mirror, this assumption needs reevaluation here due to the high output resistance. The collector-base resistance $r_{\\mu}$ arises from the Early effect's modulation of the base-recombination current, as detailed in Chapter 1. For a transistor with base current entirely from base-recombination, the percentage change in base current with varying $V_{C E}$ at constant $V_{B E}$ equals that of the collector current, making $r_{\\mu} = \\beta_{0} r_{0}$. In such a case, $r_{\\mu}$ would reduce the cascode current mirror's output resistance in (4.38) by a factor of 1.5.\n\nIn actual npn integrated-circuit transistors, only a minor fraction of the base current results from base recombination. Since only this fraction is modulated by the Early effect, observed $r_{\\mu}$ values are 10 times or more greater than $\\beta_{0} r_{o}$, rendering $r_{\\mu}$'s effect negligible. Conversely, for lateral pnp transistors, $r_{\\mu}$ is much smaller due to most base current arising from base-region recombination. The actual $r_{\\mu}$ value depends on various process and geometry factors, with observed values between 2 to 5 times $\\beta_{0} r_{0}$. Thus, in lateral pnp transistor-based cascode current mirrors, $r_{\\mu}$ significantly impacts output resistance. Additionally, for current mirrors with output resistances exceeding $\\beta_{0} r_{o}$, $r_{\\mu}$'s effects must be considered.\n\nIn the cascode current mirror, $Q_{1}$'s base connects to a low-resistance point due to $Q_{3}$'s diode connection, significantly attenuating $r_{\\mu 1}$ feedback and its impact on output resistance. Conversely, increasing the resistance from $Q_{1}$'s base to ground, with other parameters constant, enhances $r_{\\mu 1}$'s local feedback, affecting $Q_{1}$'s base-emitter voltage and reducing output resistance. If the base-to-ground resistance becomes infinite, $Q_{1}$ behaves like a diode-connected transistor. Local feedback is discussed in Chapter 8.\n\nThe cascode current mirror's input voltage is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\mathrm{IN}} = V_{B E 3} + V_{B E 4} = 2 V_{B E(\\text{on})} \\tag{4.40}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAlthough $V_{\\mathrm{IN}}$ exceeds that in (4.10) for a simple current mirror, this increase limits performance only if the power-supply voltage approaches two diode drops.\n\nThe minimum output voltage for (4.38)'s output resistance requires both $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ to be in the forward-active region. Given $V_{C E 1} \\approx V_{C E 3} = V_{B E(\\text{on})}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\mathrm{OUT}(\\min)} = V_{C E 1} + V_{C E 2(\\mathrm{sat})} \\approx V_{B E(\\mathrm{on})} + V_{C E 2(\\mathrm{sat})} \\tag{4.41}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nComparing (4.41) and (4.11) shows the cascode current mirror's minimum output voltage is higher by a diode drop, posing a significant limitation on the minimum supply voltage when used as an amplifier's active load.\n\nSince $V_{C E 1} \\approx V_{C E 3}$ and $I_{C 1} \\approx I_{C 3}$, the systematic gain error from finite transistor output resistance is nearly zero.

    "text": "#### 4.2.5.1 Bipolar\n\nSection 3.4.2 demonstrates that the cascode configuration achieves a very high output resistance, making it a natural choice for enhancing high-performance current mirrors. A bipolar-transistor current mirror utilizing the cascode connection is depicted in Fig. 4.8. Transistors $Q_{3}$ and $Q_{1}$ constitute a basic current mirror, with emitter resistances optionally added to improve matching. Transistor $Q_{2}$ functions as the common-base segment of the cascode, transferring $Q_{1}$'s collector current to the output while maintaining a high output resistance. Transistor $Q_{4}$ serves as a diode level shifter, biasing $Q_{2}$'s base to ensure $Q_{1}$ operates in the forward-active region with $V_{C E 1} \\simeq V_{C E 3}=V_{B E 3(\\text { on })}$. Assuming the small-signal resistances of diodes $Q_{3}$ and $Q_{4}$ are negligible, applying (3.98) with $R_{E}=r_{o 1}$ yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{o}=r_{o 2}\\left(1+\\frac{g_{m 2} r_{o 1}}{1+\\frac{g_{m 2} r_{o 1}}{\\beta_{0}}}\\right) \\simeq \\beta_{0} r_{o 2} \\tag{4.37}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\ndue to $g_{m 2} r_{o 1} \\simeq g_{m 1} r_{o 1} \\gg \\beta_{0}$. This calculation presumes most of the small-signal current into $Q_{2}$'s collector exits via its base, given the higher small-signal resistance at $Q_{2}$'s emitter compared to its base. However, this approach overlooks the impact of the simple current mirror formed by $Q_{3}$ and $Q_{1}$. Let $i_{b 2}$ and $i_{e 2}$ denote the increases in base and emitter currents of $Q_{2}$ due to rising output voltage. The simple mirror ensures $i_{e 2} \\simeq i_{b 2}$, causing the variation in $Q_{2}$'s collector current to split equally, with half flowing through $r_{\\pi 2}$. A small-signal analysis reveals that $R_{o}$ in (4.37) is halved to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{o} \\simeq \\frac{\\beta_{0} r_{o 2}}{2} \\tag{4.38}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, the cascode configuration increases the output resistance by roughly $\\beta_{0} / 2$. For $\\beta_{0}=100, V_{A}=130 \\mathrm{~V}$, and $I_{C 2}=1 \\mathrm{~mA}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{o}=\\frac{\\beta_{0} V_{A}}{2 I_{C 2}}=\\frac{100(130)}{2 \\mathrm{~mA}}=6.5 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega \\tag{4.39}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn this output resistance calculation, the effects of $r_{\\mu}$ are neglected. While this assumption is justified for a simple current mirror, it merits reevaluation here due to the high output resistance. The collector-base resistance $r_{\\mu}$ arises from the modulation of base-recombination current due to the Early effect, as detailed in Chapter 1. For a transistor with base current entirely from base-recombination, the percentage change in base current with varying $V_{C E}$ at constant $V_{B E}$ equals that of the collector current, making $r_{\\mu}$ equal to $\\beta_{0} r_{0}$. In such a scenario, $r_{\\mu}$ would reduce the cascode current mirror's output resistance in (4.38) by a factor of 1.5.\n\nIn actual npn integrated-circuit transistors, only a minor fraction of the base current results from base recombination. Since only this fraction is modulated by the Early effect, observed $r_{\\mu}$ values are at least ten times $\\beta_{0} r_{o}$, rendering $r_{\\mu}$'s effect negligible. Conversely, for lateral pnp transistors, $r_{\\mu}$ is much smaller due to the dominance of base-region recombination in the base current. The actual $r_{\\mu}$ value depends on various process and device-geometry factors, with observed values ranging from 2 to 5 times $\\beta_{0} r_{0}$. Hence, for cascode current mirrors using lateral pnp transistors, $r_{\\mu}$ significantly impacts the output resistance. Additionally, when considering current mirrors with output resistances exceeding $\\beta_{0} r_{o}$, $r_{\\mu}$'s effects must be considered.\n\nIn the cascode current mirror, $Q_{1}$'s base connects to a low-resistance point due to $Q_{3}$'s diode connection, greatly attenuating feedback from $r_{\\mu 1}$ and having a negligible effect on output resistance. Conversely, increasing the resistance from $Q_{1}$'s base to ground, while keeping other parameters constant, significantly impacts $Q_{1}$'s base-emitter voltage via local feedback from $r_{\\mu 1}$, reducing output resistance. In the extreme case where this resistance becomes infinite, $Q_{1}$ behaves like a diode-connected transistor. Local feedback is discussed in Chapter 8.\n\nThe cascode current mirror's input voltage is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\mathrm{IN}}=V_{B E 3}+V_{B E 4}=2 V_{B E(\\text { on })} \\tag{4.40}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAlthough $V_{\\text {IN }}$ is higher here than in (4.10) for a simple current mirror, this increase becomes a limitation only if the power-supply voltage approaches two diode drops.\n\nThe minimum output voltage for which (4.38) applies must allow both $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ to operate in the forward-active region.

    "text": "#### 4.2.5.1 Bipolar\n\nSection 3.4.2 demonstrates that the cascode configuration yields a very high output resistance, a trait highly desirable for current mirrors. Naturally, this leads to the exploration of cascodes for high-performance current mirrors. A bipolar-transistor current mirror utilizing the cascode connection is depicted in Fig. 4.8. Transistors $Q_{3}$ and $Q_{1}$ constitute a basic current mirror, and adding emitter resistances can enhance matching. Transistor $Q_{2}$ functions as the common-base component of the cascode, transferring $Q_{1}$'s collector current to the output while maintaining a high output resistance. Transistor $Q_{4}$ serves as a diode level shifter, biasing $Q_{2}$'s base to keep $Q_{1}$ in the forward-active region with $V_{C E 1} \\simeq V_{C E 3}=V_{B E 3(\\text { on })}$. Assuming the small-signal resistances of diodes $Q_{3}$ and $Q_{4}$ are minimal, applying (3.98) directly with $R_{E}=r_{o 1}$ yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{o}=r_{o 2}\\left(1+\\frac{g_{m 2} r_{o 1}}{1+\\frac{g_{m 2} r_{o 1}}{\\beta_{0}}}\\right) \\simeq \\beta_{0} r_{o 2} \\tag{4.37}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\ndue to $g_{m 2} r_{o 1} \\simeq g_{m 1} r_{o 1} \\gg \\beta_{0}$. This calculation presumes that most of the small-signal current entering $Q_{2}$'s collector exits via its base, as the small-signal resistance at $Q_{2}$'s emitter significantly exceeds that at its base. However, this calculation overlooks the impact of the simple current mirror formed by $Q_{3}$ and $Q_{1}$. Let $i_{b 2}$ and $i_{e 2}$ denote the increases in base and emitter currents of $Q_{2}$ due to rising output voltage. The simple mirror enforces $i_{e 2} \\simeq i_{b 2}$, causing the variation in $Q_{2}$'s collector current to split evenly, with half flowing through $r_{\\pi 2}$. A small-signal analysis reveals that $R_{o}$ in (4.37) is halved to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{o} \\simeq \\frac{\\beta_{0} r_{o 2}}{2} \\tag{4.38}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, the cascode configuration increases the output resistance by roughly $\\beta_{0} / 2$. For $\\beta_{0}=100, V_{A}=130 \\mathrm{~V}$, and $I_{C 2}=1 \\mathrm{~mA}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{o}=\\frac{\\beta_{0} V_{A}}{2 I_{C 2}}=\\frac{100(130)}{2 \\mathrm{~mA}}=6.5 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega \\tag{4.39}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn this output resistance calculation, the effects of $r_{\\mu}$ are neglected. While this assumption is reasonable for a simple current mirror, it warrants reevaluation here due to the high output resistance. The collector-base resistance $r_{\\mu}$ arises from the modulation of the base-recombination current due to the Early effect, as discussed in Chapter 1. For a transistor where the base current is entirely base-recombination current, the percentage change in base current with varying $V_{C E}$ at constant $V_{B E}$ equals that of the collector current, making $r_{\\mu}$ equal to $\\beta_{0} r_{0}$. In this scenario, $r_{\\mu}$ would reduce the cascode current mirror's output resistance in (4.38) by a factor of 1.5.\n\nIn actual npn integrated-circuit transistors, only a small fraction of the base current results from base recombination. Since only this fraction is modulated by the Early effect, observed $r_{\\mu}$ values are over 10 times $\\beta_{0} r_{o}$, rendering $r_{\\mu}$'s effect negligible. Conversely, for lateral pnp transistors, $r_{\\mu}$ is much smaller than for npn transistors because most base current stems from base-region recombination. The actual $r_{\\mu}$ value depends on various process and device-geometry factors, but observed values range from 2 to 5 times $\\beta_{0} r_{0}$. Thus, in cascode current mirrors using lateral pnp transistors, $r_{\\mu}$ significantly impacts output resistance. Additionally, when considering current mirrors with output resistances exceeding $\\beta_{0} r_{o}$, $r_{\\mu}$ effects must be considered.\n\nIn the cascode current mirror, $Q_{1}$'s base connects to a low-resistance point due to $Q_{3}$'s diode connection, greatly attenuating feedback from $r_{\\mu 1}$ and having a negligible effect on output resistance. Conversely, increasing the resistance from $Q_{1}$'s base to ground, while keeping other parameters constant, significantly impacts $Q_{1}$'s base-emitter voltage and reduces output resistance. If the resistance from $Q_{1}$'s base to ground becomes infinite, $Q_{1}$ behaves like a diode-connected transistor.

Furthermore, the body effect increases the threshold of all transistors with $V_{S B}>0$. These factors collectively complicate the design of the input current source for low power-supply voltages.\n\nWhen $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ both operate in the active region, $V_{D S 1} \\simeq V_{D S 3}=V_{G S 3}$. For $M_{2}$ to operate in the active region, $V_{D S 2}>V_{o v 2}$ is necessary.

These results are illustrated in Fig. $4.9 b$.\n\nAlthough the overdrive term in (4.59) can be minimized by using large values of $W$ for a given current, the threshold term represents a significant loss of voltage swing when the current mirror is used as an active load in an amplifier. The threshold term in (4.59) arises from the biasing of the drain-source voltage of $M_{1}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{D S 1}=V_{\\mathrm{IN}}-V_{G S 2} \\tag{4.60}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIgnoring the body effect and assuming $M_{1}-M_{4}$ all operate in the active region with equal overdrives,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{D S 1}=V_{t}+V_{o v} \\tag{4.61}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, the drain-source voltage of $M_{1}$ is a threshold larger than necessary to operate $M_{1}$ in the active region.

These results are graphically depicted in Fig. $4.9 b$.\n\nAlthough the overdrive term in (4.59) can be minimized by using large values of $W$ for a given current, the threshold term represents a significant loss of voltage swing when the current mirror is used as an active load in an amplifier. The threshold term in (4.59) arises from the biasing of the drain-source voltage of $M_{1}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{D S 1}=V_{\\mathrm{IN}}-V_{G S 2} \\tag{4.60}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nNeglecting the body effect and assuming $M_{1}-M_{4}$ all operate in the active region with equal overdrives,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{D S 1}=V_{t}+V_{o v} \\tag{4.61}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, the drain-source voltage of $M_{1}$ is a threshold larger than necessary to operate $M_{1}$ in the active region.

Thus, increasing the drain-source voltage of $M_{1}$ by a few hundred millivolts above $V_{o v 1}$ is usually necessary to achieve the incremental output resistance as predicted by (4.50). Second, although the body effect was not considered in this analysis, it tends to reduce the drain-source voltage on $M_{1}$, which is determined by the following KVL loop:\n\n$$\nV_{D S 1}=V_{G S 3}+V_{G S 4}-V_{G S 5}-V_{G S 2} \\tag{4.66}\n$$\n\nEach of the gate-source voltage terms in (4.66) contains a threshold component. Since the source-body voltage of $M_{5}$ is higher than that of $M_{4}, V_{t 5}>V_{t 4}$. Also, $V_{t 2}>V_{t 3}$ because the source-body voltage of $M_{2}$ is higher than that of $M_{3}$. High-accuracy simulations are usually required to find the optimum $(W / L)_{4}$.\n\nOne drawback of the current mirror in Fig. 4.11 is that the input current is mirrored to a new branch to perform the level shift. Combining the input branches eliminates the possibility of mismatch between the two branch currents and may reduce the power dissipation. In a single combined input branch, some element must provide a voltage drop equal to the desired difference between the gate voltages of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$. To bias $M_{1}$ at the edge of the active region, the required voltages from the gates $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ to ground are $V_{t}+V_{o v}$ and $V_{t}+2 V_{o v}$, respectively. Therefore, the desired difference in the gate voltages is $V_{o v}$. This voltage difference can be developed across the drain to the source of a transistor deliberately operated in the triode region, as shown in Fig. 4.12a. ${ }^{7}$ Since $M_{6}$ is diode connected, it operates\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:\n[\nname: M5, type: NMOS, ports: {S: GND, D: d5s6, G: g5g6d6}\nname: M6, type: NMOS, ports: {S: d5s6, D: g5g6d6, G: g5g6d6}\nname: IIN, type: CurrentSource, ports: {Np: g5g6d6, Nn: VDD}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit forces M5 to operate in the triode region using M6, which is diode-connected.
