# 5. Output Stages

## 5.1 Introduction

The output stage of an amplifier must satisfy a number of special requirements. One of the most important requirements is to deliver a specified amount of signal power to a load with acceptably low levels of signal distortion. Another common objective of output-stage design is to minimize the output impedance so that the voltage gain is relatively unaffected by the value of load impedance. A well-designed output stage should achieve these performance specifications while consuming low quiescent power and, in addition, should not be a major limitation on the frequency response of the amplifier.

In this chapter, several output-stage configurations will be considered to satisfy the above requirements. The simplest output-stage configurations are the emitter and source followers. More complex output stages employing multiple output devices are also treated, and comparisons are made of power-output capability and efficiency.

Because of their excellent current-handling capability, bipolar transistors are the preferred devices for use in output stages. Although parasitic bipolar transistors can be used in some CMOS output stages, output stages in CMOS technologies are usually constructed without bipolar transistors and are also described in this chapter.

## 5.2 The Emitter Follower as an Output Stage

An emitter-follower output stage is shown in Fig. 5.1. To simplify the analysis, positive and negative bias supplies of equal magnitude $V_{C C}$ are assumed, although these supplies may have different values in practice. When output voltage $V_{o}$ is zero, output current $I_{o}$ is also zero. The emitter-follower output device $Q_{1}$ is biased to a quiescent current $I_{Q}$ by current source $Q_{2}$. The output stage is driven by voltage $V_{i}$, which has a quiescent dc value of $V_{b e 1}$ for $V_{o}=0 \mathrm{~V}$. The bias components $R_{1}, R_{3}$, and $Q_{3}$ can be those used to bias other stages in the circuit. Since the quiescent current $I_{Q}$ in $Q_{2}$ will usually be larger than the reference current $I_{R}$, resistor $R_{2}$ is usually smaller than $R_{1}$ to accommodate this difference.

This circuit topology can also be implemented in CMOS technologies using an MOS current source for bias and the parasitic bipolar-transistor emitter follower available in standard CMOS processes. Because any large current flow to the substrate can initiate the pnpn latch-up phenomenon described in Chapter 2, however, this configuration should be used carefully in CMOS technologies with lightly doped substrates. Extensive substrate taps in the vicinity of the emitter follower are essential to collect the substrate current flow.

### 5.2.1 Transfer Characteristics of the Emitter-Follower

The circuit of Fig. 5.1 must handle large signal amplitudes; that is, the current and voltage swings resulting from the presence of signals may be a large fraction of the bias values. As

Figure 5.1 Emitter-follower output stage with current-mirror bias.
a result, the small-signal analyses that have been used extensively up to this point must be used with care in this situation. For this reason, we first determine the dc transfer characteristic of the emitter follower. This characteristic allows calculation of the gain of the circuit and also gives important information on the linearity and thus on the distortion performance of the stage.

Consider the circuit of Fig. 5.1. The large-signal transfer characteristic can be derived as follows:

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{i}=V_{b e 1}+V_{o} \tag{5.1}
\end{equation*}
$$

In this case, the base-emitter voltage $V_{b e 1}$ of $Q_{1}$ cannot be assumed constant but must be expressed in terms of the collector current $I_{c 1}$ of $Q_{1}$ and the saturation current $I_{S}$. If the load resistance $R_{L}$ is small compared with the output resistance of the transistors,

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{b e 1}=\frac{k T}{q} \ln \left(\frac{I_{c 1}}{I_{S}}\right) \tag{5.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

if $Q_{1}$ is in the forward-active region. Also

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{c 1}=I_{Q}+\frac{V_{o}}{R_{L}} \tag{5.3}
\end{equation*}
$$

if $Q_{2}$ is in the forward-active region and $\beta_{F}$ is assumed large. Substitution of (5.3) and (5.2) in (5.1) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{i}=\frac{k T}{q} \ln \left(\frac{I_{Q}+\frac{V_{o}}{R_{L}}}{I_{S}}\right)+V_{o} \tag{5.4}
\end{equation*}
$$

Equation 5.4 is a nonlinear equation relating $V_{o}$ and $V_{i}$ if both $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ are in the forwardactive region.

The transfer characteristic from (5.4) has been plotted in Fig. 5.2. First, consider the case where $R_{L}$ is large, which is labeled $R_{L 1}$. In this case, the first term on the right-hand side of (5.4), which represents the base-emitter voltage $V_{b e 1}$ of $Q_{1}$, is almost constant as $V_{o}$ changes. This result stems from the observation that the current in the load is small for a large $R_{L}$;
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_69320962b1b525ebcc55g-043.jpg?height=658&width=1072&top_left_y=205&top_left_x=376)

Figure 5.2 Transfer characteristic of the circuit of Fig. 5.1 for a low $\left(R_{L 2}\right)$ and a high ( $R_{L 1}$ ) value of load resistance.
therefore, the current in $Q_{1}$ and $V_{b e 1}$ are both almost constant as $V_{o}$ changes in this case. As a result, the center part of the transfer characteristic for $R_{L}=R_{L 1}$ is nearly a straight line with unity slope that is offset on the $V_{i}$ axis by $V_{B E 1}$, the quiescent value of $V_{b e 1}$. This near-linear region depends on both $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ being in the forward-active region. However, as $V_{i}$ is made large positive or negative, one of these devices saturates and the transfer characteristic abruptly changes slope.

Consider $V_{i}$ made large and positive. Output voltage $V_{o}$ follows $V_{i}$ until $V_{o}=V_{C C}-$ $V_{C E 1 \text { (sat) }}$ at which point $Q_{1}$ saturates. The collector-base junction of $Q_{1}$ is then forward biased and large currents flow from base to collector. In practice, the transistor base resistance (and any source resistance present) limit the current in the forward-biased collector-base junction and prevent the voltage at the internal transistor base from rising appreciably higher. Further increases in $V_{i}$ thus produce little change in $V_{o}$ and the characteristic flattens out, as shown in Fig. 5.2. The value of $V_{i}$ required to cause this behavior is slightly larger than the supply voltage because $V_{b e 1}$ is larger than the saturation voltage $V_{C E(\text { sat })}$. Consequently, the preceding stage often limits the maximum positive output voltage in a practical circuit because a voltage larger than $V_{C C}$ usually cannot be generated at the base of the output stage. (The portion of the curve for $V_{i}$ large positive where $Q_{1}$ is saturated actually has a positive slope if the effect of the collector series resistance $r_{c}$ of $Q_{1}$ is included. In any event, this portion of the transfer characteristic must be avoided, because the saturation of $Q_{1}$ results in large nonlinearity and a major reduction of power gain.)

Now consider $V_{i}$ made large and negative. The output voltage follows the input until $V_{o}=-V_{C C}+V_{C E 2 \text { (sat) }}$, at which point $Q_{2}$ saturates. (The voltage drop across $R_{2}$ is assumed small and is neglected. It could be lumped in with the saturation voltage $V_{C E 2 \text { (sat) }}$ of $Q_{2}$ if necessary.) When $Q_{2}$ saturates, another discontinuity in the transfer curve occurs, and the slope abruptly decreases. For acceptable distortion performance in the circuit, the voltage swing must be limited to the region between these two break points. As mentioned above, the driver stage supplying $V_{i}$ usually cannot produce values of $V_{i}$ that have a magnitude exceeding $V_{C C}$ (if it is connected to the same supply voltages) and the driver itself then sets the upper limit.

Next consider the case where $R_{L}$ in Fig. 5.1 has a relatively small value. Then when $V_{o}$ is made large and negative, the first term in (5.4) can become large. In particular, this term
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_69320962b1b525ebcc55g-044.jpg?height=1045&width=795&top_left_y=198&top_left_x=269)

Figure 5.3 (a) ac input signals applied to the circuit of Fig. 5.1. (b) ac output waveforms corresponding to the inputs in (a) with $R_{L}=R_{L 2}$.
approaches minus infinity when $V_{o}$ approaches the critical value

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{o}=-I_{Q} R_{L} \tag{5.5}
\end{equation*}
$$

In this situation, the current drawn from the load $\left(-V_{o} / R_{L}\right)$ is equal to the current $I_{Q}$, and device $Q_{1}$ cuts off, leaving $Q_{2}$ to draw the current $I_{Q}$ from the load. Further decreases in $V_{i}$ produce no change in $V_{o}$, and the transfer characteristic is the one labeled $R_{L 2}$ in Fig. 5.2. The transfer characteristic for positive $V_{i}$ is similar for both cases.

For the case $R_{L}=R_{L 2}$, the stage will produce severe waveform distortion if $V_{i}$ is a sinusoid with amplitude exceeding $I_{Q} R_{L 2}$. Consider the two sinusoidal waveforms in Fig. 5.3a. Waveform (1) has an amplitude $V_{1}<I_{Q} R_{L 2}$ and waveform (2) has an amplitude $V_{2}>I_{Q} R_{L 2}$. If these signals are applied as inputs at $V_{i}$ in Fig. 5.1 (together with a bias voltage), the output waveforms that result are as shown in Fig. $5.3 b$ for $R_{L}=R_{L 2}$. For the smaller input signal, the circuit acts as a near-linear amplifier and the output is near sinusoidal. The output waveform distortion, which is apparent for the larger input, is termed "clipping" and must be avoided in normal operation of the circuit as a linear output stage. For a given $I_{Q}$ and $R_{L}$, the onset of clipping limits the maximum signal that can be handled. Note that if $I_{Q} R_{L}$ is larger than $V_{C C}$, the situation shown for $R_{L}=R_{L 1}$ in Fig. 5.2 holds, and the output voltage can swing almost to the positive and negative supply voltages before excessive distortion occurs.

### 5.2.2 Power Output and Efficiency

Further insight into the operation of the circuit of Fig. 5.1 can be obtained from Fig. 5.4 where three different load lines are drawn on the $I_{c}-V_{c e}$ characteristics of $Q_{1}$. The equation for the
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_69320962b1b525ebcc55g-045.jpg?height=972&width=945&top_left_y=198&top_left_x=444)

Figure 5.4 Load lines in the $I_{c 1}-V_{c e 1}$ plane for emitter follower $Q_{1}$ of Fig. 5.1.
load lines can be written from Fig. 5.1 and is

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{c e 1}=V_{C C}-\left(I_{c 1}-I_{Q}\right) R_{L} \tag{5.6}
\end{equation*}
$$

when both $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ are in the forward-active region. The values of $V_{c e 1}$ and $I_{c 1}$ are related by (5.6) for any value of $V_{i}$ and the line includes the quiescent point $Q$, where $I_{c 1}=I_{Q}$ and $V_{c e 1}=V_{C C}$. Equation 5.6 is plotted in Fig. 5.4 for load resistances $R_{L 1}, R_{L 2}$, and $R_{L 3}$ and the device operating point moves up and down these lines as $V_{i}$ varies. As $V_{i}$ increases and $V_{c e 1}$ decreases, $Q_{1}$ eventually saturates, as was illustrated in Fig. 5.2. As $V_{i}$ decreases and $V_{c e 1}$ increases, there are two possibilities as described above. If $R_{L}$ is large ( $\left.R_{L 1}\right), V_{o}$ decreases and $V_{c e 1}$ increases until $Q_{2}$ saturates. Thus the maximum possible value that $V_{c e 1}$ can attain is [ $\left.2 V_{C C}-V_{C E 2 \text { (sat) }}\right]$ and this value is marked on Fig. 5.4. However, if $R_{L}$ is small $\left(R_{L 2}\right)$, the maximum negative value of $V_{o}$ as illustrated in Fig. 5.2 is $-I_{Q} R_{L 2}$ and the maximum possible value of $V_{c e 1}$ is $\left(V_{C C}+I_{Q} R_{L 2}\right)$.

Thus far no mention has been made of the maximum voltage limitations of the output stage. As described in Chapter 1, avalanche breakdown of a bipolar transistor occurs for $V_{c e}=B V_{C E O}$ in the common-emitter configuration, which is the worst case for breakdown voltage. In a conservative design, the value of $V_{c e}$ in the circuit of Fig. 5.1 should always be less than $B V_{C E O}$ by an appropriate safety margin. In the preceding analysis, the maximum value that $V_{c e 1}$ can attain in this circuit for any load resistance was calculated as approximately $2 V_{C C}$, and thus $B V_{C E O}$ must be greater than this value.

Consider now the power relationships in the circuit. When sinusoidal signals are present, the power dissipated in various elements varies with time. We are concerned both with the instantaneous power dissipated and with the average power dissipated. Instantaneous power
is important when considering transistor dissipation with low-frequency or dc signals. The junction temperature of the transistor will tend to rise and fall with the instantaneous power dissipated in the device, limiting the maximum allowable instantaneous power dissipation for safe operation of any device.

Average power levels are important because the power delivered to a load is usually specified as an average value. Also note that if an output stage handles only high-frequency signals, the transistor junction temperature will not vary appreciably over a cycle and the average device power dissipation will then be the limiting quantity.

Consider the output signal power that can be delivered to load $R_{L}$ when a sinusoidal input is applied at $V_{i}$. Assuming that $V_{o}$ is approximately sinusoidal, the average output power delivered to $R_{L}$ is

$$
\begin{equation*}
P_{L}=\frac{1}{2} \hat{V}_{o} \hat{I}_{o} \tag{5.7}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\hat{V}_{o}$ and $\hat{I}_{o}$ are the amplitudes (zero to peak) of the output sinusoidal voltage and current. As described previously, the maximum output signal amplitude that can be attained before clipping occurs depends on the value of $R_{L}$. If $\left.P_{L}\right|_{\max }$ is the maximum value of $P_{L}$ that can be attained before clipping occurs with sinusoidal signals, then

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left.P_{L}\right|_{\max }=\frac{1}{2} \hat{V}_{o m} \hat{I}_{o m} \tag{5.7a}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\hat{V}_{o m}$ and $\hat{I}_{o m}$ are the maximum values of $\hat{V}_{o}$ and $\hat{I}_{o}$ that can be attained before clipping.
Consider the case of the large load resistance, $R_{L 1}$. Figures 5.2 and 5.4 show that clipping occurs symmetrically in this case, and we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
\hat{V}_{o m}=V_{C C}-V_{C E(\mathrm{sat})} \tag{5.8}
\end{equation*}
$$

assuming equal saturation voltages in $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$. The corresponding sinusoidal output current amplitude is $\hat{I}_{o m}=\hat{V}_{o m} / R_{L 1}$. The maximum average power that can be delivered to $R_{L 1}$ is calculated by substituting these values in (5.7a). This value of power can be interpreted geometrically as the area of the triangle $A$ in Fig. 5.4 since the base of the triangle equals $\hat{V}_{o m}$ and its height is $\hat{I}_{o m}$. As $R_{L 1}$ is increased, the maximum average output power that can be delivered diminishes because the triangle becomes smaller. The maximum output voltage amplitude remains essentially the same but the current amplitude decreases as $R_{L 1}$ increases.

If $R_{L}=R_{L 2}$ in Fig. 5.4, the maximum output voltage swing before clipping occurs is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\hat{V}_{o m}=I_{Q} R_{L 2} \tag{5.9}
\end{equation*}
$$

The corresponding current amplitude is $\hat{I}_{o m}=I_{Q}$. Using (5.7a), the maximum average output power $\left.P_{L}\right|_{\text {max }}$ that can be delivered is given by the area of triangle $B$, shown in Fig. 5.4. As $R_{L 2}$ is decreased, the maximum average power that can be delivered is diminished.

An examination of Fig. 5.4 shows that the power-output capability of the stage is maxi$\operatorname{mized}$ for $R_{L}=R_{L 3}$, which can be calculated from (5.6) and Fig. 5.4 as

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{L 3}=\frac{V_{C C}-V_{C E(\mathrm{sat})}}{I_{Q}} \tag{5.10}
\end{equation*}
$$

This load line gives the triangle of largest area $(C)$ and thus the largest average output power. In this case, $\hat{V}_{o m}=\left[V_{C C}-V_{C E(\mathrm{sat})}\right]$ and $\hat{I}_{o m}=I_{Q}$. Using (5.7a), we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left.P_{L}\right|_{\max }=\frac{1}{2} \hat{V}_{o m} \hat{I}_{o m}=\frac{1}{2}\left[V_{C C}-V_{C E(\mathrm{sat})}\right] I_{Q} \tag{5.11}
\end{equation*}
$$

To calculate the efficiency of the circuit, the power drawn from the supply voltages must now be calculated. The current drawn from the positive supply is the collector current of $Q_{1}$,
which is assumed sinusoidal with an average value $I_{Q}$. The current flowing in the negative supply is constant and equal to $I_{Q}$ (neglecting bias current $I_{R}$ ). Since the supply voltages are constant, the average power drawn from the supplies is constant and independent of the presence of sinusoidal signals in the circuit. The total power drawn from the two supplies is thus

$$
\begin{equation*}
P_{\text {supply }}=2 V_{C C} I_{Q} \tag{5.12}
\end{equation*}
$$

The power conversion efficiency $\left(\eta_{C}\right)$ of the circuit at an arbitrary output power level is defined as the ratio of the average power delivered to the load to the average power drawn from the supplies.

$$
\begin{equation*}
\eta_{C}=\frac{P_{L}}{P_{\text {supply }}} \tag{5.13}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since the power drawn from the supplies is constant in this circuit, the efficiency increases as the output power increases. Also, since the previous analysis shows that the power-output capability of the circuit depends on the value of $R_{L}$, the efficiency also depends on $R_{L}$. The best efficiency occurs for $R_{L}=R_{L 3}$ since this value gives maximum average power output. If $R_{L}=R_{L 3}$ and $\hat{V}_{o}=\hat{V}_{o m}$, then substitution of (5.11) and (5.12) in (5.13) gives for the maximum possible efficiency

$$
\begin{equation*}
\eta_{\max }=\frac{1}{4}\left(1-\frac{V_{C E(\mathrm{sat})}}{V_{C C}}\right) \tag{5.14}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus if $V_{C E(\text { sat })} \ll V_{C C}$, the maximum efficiency of the stage is $1 / 4$ or 25 percent.
Another important aspect of circuit performance is the power dissipated in the active device. The current and voltage waveforms in $Q_{1}$ at maximum signal swing and with $R_{L}=R_{L 3}$ are shown in Fig. 5.5 (assuming $V_{C E(\text { sat })} \simeq 0$ for simplicity) together with their product, which
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_69320962b1b525ebcc55g-047.jpg?height=969&width=805&top_left_y=1310&top_left_x=259)

Figure 5.5 Waveforms for the transistor $Q_{1}$ of Figure 5.1 at full output with $R_{L}=R_{L 3}$. (a) Collector-emitter voltage waveform. (b) Collector current waveform. (c) Collector power dissipation waveform.
is the instantaneous power dissipation in the transistor. The curve of instantaneous power dissipation in $Q_{1}$ as a function of time varies at twice the signal frequency and has an average value of one-half the quiescent value. This result can be shown analytically as follows. The instantaneous power dissipation in $Q_{1}$ is

$$
\begin{equation*}
P_{c 1}=V_{c e 1} I_{c 1} \tag{5.15}
\end{equation*}
$$

At maximum signal swing with a sinusoidal signal, $P_{c 1}$ can be expressed as (from Fig. 5.5)

$$
\begin{equation*}
P_{c 1}=V_{C C}(1+\sin \omega t) I_{Q}(1-\sin \omega t)=\frac{V_{C C} I_{Q}}{2}(1+\cos 2 \omega t) \tag{5.15a}
\end{equation*}
$$

The average value of $P_{c 1}$ from (5.15a) is $V_{C C} I_{Q} / 2$. Thus at maximum output the average power dissipated in $Q_{1}$ is half its quiescent value, and the average device temperature when delivering power with $R_{L}=R_{L 3}$ is less than its quiescent value.

Further information on the power dissipated in $Q_{1}$ can be obtained by plotting curves of constant device dissipation in the $I_{c}-V_{c e}$ plane. Equation 5.15 indicates that such curves are hyperbolas, which are plotted in Fig. 5.6 for constant transistor instantaneous power dissipation values $P_{1}, P_{2}$, and $P_{3}$ (where $P_{1}<P_{2}<P_{3}$ ). The power hyperbola of value $P_{2}$ passes through the quiescent point $Q$, and the equation of this curve can be calculated from (5.15) as

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{c 1}=\frac{P_{2}}{V_{c e 1}} \tag{5.16}
\end{equation*}
$$

The slope of the curve is

$$
\frac{d I_{c 1}}{d V_{c e 1}}=-\frac{P_{2}}{V_{c e 1}^{2}}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_69320962b1b525ebcc55g-048.jpg?height=820&width=1060&top_left_y=1338&top_left_x=392)

and substitution of (5.16) in this equation gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d I_{c 1}}{d V_{c e 1}}=-\frac{I_{c 1}}{V_{c e 1}} \tag{5.17}
\end{equation*}
$$

At the quiescent point $Q$, we have $I_{c 1}=I_{Q}$ and $V_{c e 1}=V_{C C}$. Thus the slope is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left.\frac{d I_{c 1}}{d V_{c e 1}}\right|_{Q}=-\frac{I_{Q}}{V_{C C}} \tag{5.18}
\end{equation*}
$$

From (5.6), the slope of the load line with $R_{L}=R_{L 3}$ is $-\left(1 / R_{L 3}\right)$. Using (5.10) for $R_{L 3}$ gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
-\frac{1}{R_{L 3}} \simeq-\frac{I_{Q}}{V_{C C}} \tag{5.19}
\end{equation*}
$$

Comparing (5.18) with (5.19) shows that the load line with $R_{L}=R_{L 3}$ is tangent to the power hyperbola passing through the quiescent point, since both curves have the same slope at that point. This result is illustrated in Fig. 5.6. As the operating point leaves the quiescent point and moves on the load line with $R_{L}=R_{L 3}$, the load line then intersects constant-power hyperbolas representing lower power values; therefore, the instantaneous device power dissipation decreases. This point of view is consistent with the power waveform shown in Fig. 5.5.

The load line for $R_{L} \rightarrow \infty$ (open-circuit load) is also shown in Fig. 5.6. In that case, the transistor collector current does not vary over a period but is constant. For values of $V_{c e 1}$ greater than the quiescent value, the instantaneous device power dissipation increases. The maximum possible value of $V_{c e 1}$ is ( $\left.2 V_{C C}-V_{C E 2(\text { sat })}\right)$. At this value, the instantaneous power dissipation in $Q_{1}$ is approximately $2 V_{C C} I_{Q}$ if $V_{C E 2(\text { sat })} \ll V_{C C}$. This dissipation is twice the quiescent value of $V_{C C} I_{Q}$, and this possibility should be taken into account when considering the power-handling requirements of $Q_{1}$. At the other extreme of the swing where $V_{c e 1} \simeq 0$, the power dissipation in $Q_{2}$ is also $2 V_{C C} I_{Q}$.

A situation that is potentially even more damaging can occur if the load is short circuited. In that case, the load line is vertical through the quiescent point, as shown in Fig. 5.6. With large input signals, the collector current (and thus the device power dissipation) of $Q_{1}$ can become quite large. The limit on collector current is set by the ability of the driver to supply the base current to $Q_{1}$, and also by the high-current fall-off in $\beta_{F}$ of $Q_{1}$, described in Chapter 1 . In practice, these limits may be sufficient to prevent burnout of $Q_{1}$, but current-limiting circuitry may be necessary. An example of such protection is given in Section 5.4.6.

A useful general result can be derived from the calculations above involving load lines and constant-power hyperbolas. Figure 5.6 shows that the maximum instantaneous device power dissipation for $R_{L}=R_{L 3}$ occurs at the quiescent point $Q$ (since $P_{1}<P_{2}<P_{3}$ ), which is the midpoint of the load line if $V_{C E 2(\text { sat })} \ll V_{C C}$. (The midpoint of the load line is assumed to be midway between its intersections with the $I_{c}$ and $V_{c e}$ axes.) It can be seen from (5.17) that any load line tangent to a power hyperbola makes contact with the hyperbola at the midpoint of the load line. Consequently, the midpoint is the point of maximum instantaneous device power dissipation with any load line. For example, in Fig. 5.4 with $R_{L}=R_{L 2}$, the maximum instantaneous device power dissipation occurs at the midpoint of the load line where $V_{c e 1}=\frac{1}{2}\left(V_{C C}+I_{Q} R_{L 2}\right)$.

An output stage of the type described in this section, where the output device always conducts appreciable current, is called a Class $A$ output stage. This type of operation can be realized with different transistor configurations but always has a maximum efficiency of 25 percent.

Finally, the emitter follower in this analysis was assumed to have a current source $I_{Q}$ in its emitter as a bias element. In practice, the current source is sometimes replaced by a resistor connected to the negative supply, and such a configuration will give some deviations from the above calculations. In particular, the output power available from the circuit will be reduced.

#### EXAMPLE

An output stage such as shown in Fig. 5.1 has the following parameters: $V_{C C}=10 \mathrm{~V}$, $R_{3}=5 \mathrm{k} \Omega, R_{1}=R_{2}=0, V_{C E(\mathrm{sat})}=0.2 \mathrm{~V}, R_{L}=1 \mathrm{k} \Omega$. Assume that the dc input voltage is adjusted so that the dc output voltage is 0 volts.
(a) Calculate the maximum average output power that can be delivered to $R_{L}$ before clipping occurs, and the corresponding efficiency. What is the maximum possible efficiency with this stage and what value of $R_{L}$ is required to achieve this efficiency? Assume the signals are sinusoidal.
(b) Calculate the maximum possible instantaneous power dissipation in $Q_{1}$. Also calculate the average power dissipation in $Q_{1}$ when $\hat{V}_{o}=1.5 \mathrm{~V}$ and the output voltage is sinusoidal.

The solution proceeds as follows.
(a) The bias current $I_{Q}$ is first calculated.

$$
I_{Q}=I_{R}=\frac{V_{C C}-V_{B E 3}}{R_{3}}=\frac{10-0.7}{5} \mathrm{~mA}=1.86 \mathrm{~mA}
$$

The product, $I_{Q} R_{L}$, is given by

$$
I_{Q} R_{L}=1.86 \times 1=1.86 \mathrm{~V}
$$

Since the dc output voltage is assumed to be 0 volts, and since $I_{Q} R_{L}$ is less than $V_{C C}$, the maximum sinusoidal output voltage swing is limited to 1.86 V by clipping on negative voltage swings and the situation corresponds to $R_{L}=R_{L 2}$ in Fig. 5.4. The maximum output voltage and current swings are thus $\hat{V}_{o m}=1.86 \mathrm{~V}$ and $\hat{I}_{o m}=1.86 \mathrm{~mA}$. The maximum average output power available from the circuit for sinusoidal signals can be calculated from (5.7a) as

$$
\left.P_{L}\right|_{\max }=\frac{1}{2} \hat{V}_{o m} \hat{I}_{o m}=\frac{1}{2} \times 1.86 \times 1.86 \mathrm{~mW}=1.73 \mathrm{~mW}
$$

The power drawn from the supplies is calculated from (5.12) as

$$
P_{\text {supply }}=2 V_{C C} I_{Q}=2 \times 10 \times 1.86 \mathrm{~mW}=37.2 \mathrm{~mW}
$$

The efficiency of the circuit at the output power level calculated above can be determined from (5.13)

$$
\eta_{C}=\frac{\left.P_{L}\right|_{\max }}{P_{\text {supply }}}=\frac{1.73}{37.2}=0.047
$$

The efficiency of 4.7 percent is quite low and is due to the limitation on the negative voltage swing.

The maximum possible efficiency with this stage occurs for $R_{L}=R_{L 3}$ in Fig. 5.4, and $R_{L 3}$ is given by (5.10) as

$$
R_{L 3}=\frac{V_{C C}-V_{C E(\mathrm{sat})}}{I_{Q}}=\frac{10-0.2}{1.86} \mathrm{k} \Omega=5.27 \mathrm{k} \Omega
$$

In this instance, the maximum average power that can be delivered to the load before clipping occurs is found from (5.11) as

$$
\left.P_{L}\right|_{\max }=\frac{1}{2}\left[V_{C C}-V_{C E(\mathrm{sat})}\right] I_{Q}=\frac{1}{2}(10-0.2) 1.86 \mathrm{~mW}=9.11 \mathrm{~mW}
$$

The corresponding efficiency using (5.14) is

$$
\eta_{\max }=\frac{1}{4}\left[1-\frac{V_{C E(\mathrm{sat})}}{V_{C C}}\right]=\frac{1}{4}\left(1-\frac{0.2}{10}\right)=0.245
$$

This result is close to the theoretical maximum of 25 percent.
(b) The maximum possible instantaneous power dissipation in $Q_{1}$ occurs at the midpoint of the load line. Reference to Fig. 5.4 and the load line $R_{L}=R_{L 2}$ shows that this occurs for

$$
V_{c e 1}=\frac{1}{2}\left(V_{C C}+I_{Q} R_{L}\right)=\frac{1}{2}(10+1.86)=5.93 \mathrm{~V}
$$

The corresponding collector current in $Q_{1}$ is $I_{c 1}=5.93 / R_{L}=5.93 \mathrm{~mA}$ since $R_{L}=1 \mathrm{k} \Omega$. Thus the maximum instantaneous power dissipation in $Q_{1}$ is

$$
P_{c 1}=I_{c 1} V_{c e 1}=35.2 \mathrm{~mW}
$$

This power dissipation occurs for $V_{c e 1}=5.93 \mathrm{~V}$, which represents a signal swing beyond the linear limits of the circuit [clipping occurs when the output voltage reaches -1.86 V as calculated in (a)]. However, this condition could easily occur if the circuit is overdriven by a large input signal.

The average power dissipation in $Q_{1}$ can be calculated by noting that for sinusoidal signals, the average power drawn from the two supplies is constant and independent of the presence of signals. Since the power input to the circuit from the supplies is constant, the total average power dissipated in $Q_{1}, Q_{2}$, and $R_{L}$ must be constant and independent of the presence of sinusoidal signals. The average power dissipated in $Q_{2}$ is constant because $I_{Q}$ is constant, and thus the average power dissipated in $Q_{1}$ and $R_{L}$ together is constant. Thus as $\hat{V}_{o}$ is increased, the average power dissipated in $Q_{1}$ decreases by the same amount as the average power in $R_{L}$ increases. With no input signal, the quiescent power dissipated in $Q_{1}$ is

$$
P_{C Q}=V_{C C} I_{Q}=10 \times 1.86 \mathrm{~mW}=18.6 \mathrm{~mW}
$$

For $\hat{V}_{o}=1.5 \mathrm{~V}$, the average power delivered to the load is

$$
P_{L}=\frac{1}{2} \frac{\hat{V}_{o}^{2}}{R_{L}}=\frac{1}{2} \frac{2.25}{1} \mathrm{~mW}=1.13 \mathrm{~mW}
$$

Thus the average power dissipated in $Q_{1}$ when $\hat{V}_{o}=1.5 \mathrm{~V}$ with a sinusoidal signal is

$$
P_{a v}=P_{C Q}-P_{L}=17.5 \mathrm{~mW}
$$

### 5.2.3 Emitter-Follower Drive Requirements

The calculations above have been concerned with the performance of the emitter-follower output stage when driven by a sinusoidal input voltage. The stage preceding the output stage is called the driver stage, and in practice it may introduce additional limitations on the circuit performance. For example, it was shown that to drive the output voltage $V_{o}$ of the emitter follower to its maximum positive value required an input voltage slightly greater than the supply voltage. Since the driver stage is connected to the same supplies as the output stage in most cases, the driver stage generally cannot produce voltages greater than the supply, further reducing the possible output voltage swing.

The above limitations stem from the observation that the emitter follower has a voltage gain of unity and thus the driver stage must handle the same voltage swing as the output. However, the driver can be a much lower power stage than the output stage because the current it must
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_69320962b1b525ebcc55g-052.jpg?height=464&width=807&top_left_y=170&top_left_x=268)

Figure 5.7 Low-frequency, smallsignal equivalent circuit for the emitter follower of Fig. 5.1.
deliver is the base current of the emitter follower, which is about $1 / \beta_{F}$ times the emitter current. Consequently, the driver bias current can be much lower than the output-stage bias current, and a smaller geometry can be used for the driver device. Although it has only unity voltage gain, the emitter follower has substantial power gain, which is a requirement of any output stage.

### 5.2.4 Small-Signal Properties of the Emitter Follower

A simplified low-frequency, small-signal equivalent circuit of the emitter follower of Fig. 5.1 is shown in Fig. 5.7. As described in Chapter 7, the emitter follower is an extremely wideband circuit and rarely is a source of frequency limitation in the small-signal gain of an amplifier. Thus the equivalent circuit of Fig. 5.7 is useful over a wide frequency range and an analysis of this circuit shows that the voltage gain $A_{v}$ and the output resistance $R_{o}$ can be expressed approximately for $\beta_{0} \gg 1$ as

$$
\begin{align*}
A_{v}=\frac{v_{o}}{v_{i}} & \simeq \frac{R_{L}}{R_{L}+\frac{1}{g_{m}}+\frac{R_{S}}{\beta_{0}}}  \tag{5.20}\\
R_{o} & =\frac{1}{g_{m}}+\frac{R_{S}}{\beta_{0}} \tag{5.21}
\end{align*}
$$

These quantities are small-signal quantities, and since $g_{m}=q I_{C} / \mathrm{k} T$ is a function of bias point, both $A_{v}$ and $R_{o}$ are functions of $I_{C}$. Since the emitter follower is being considered here for use as an output stage where the signal swing may be large, (5.20) and (5.21) must be applied with caution. However, for small to moderate signal swings, these equations may be used to estimate the average gain and output resistance of the stage if quiescent bias values are used for transistor parameters in the equations. Equation 5.20 can also be used as a means of estimating the nonlinearity ${ }^{1}$ in the stage by recognizing that it gives the incremental slope of the large-signal characteristic of Fig. 5.2 at any point. If this equation is evaluated at the extremes of the signal swing, an estimate of the curvature of the characteristic is obtained, as illustrated in the following example.

#### EXAMPLE

Calculate the incremental slope of the transfer characteristic of the circuit of Fig. 5.1 as the quiescent point and at the extremes of the signal swing with a peak sinusoidal output of 0.6 V . Use data as in the previous example and assume that $R_{S}=0$.

From (5.20) the small-signal gain with $R_{S}=0$ is

$$
\begin{equation*}
A_{v}=\frac{R_{L}}{R_{L}+\frac{1}{g_{m}}} \tag{5.22}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since $I_{Q}=1.86 \mathrm{~mA}, 1 / g_{m}=14 \Omega$ at the quiescent point and the quiescent gain is

$$
A_{v} Q=\frac{1000}{1000+14}=0.9862
$$

Since the output voltage swing is 0.6 V , the output current swing is

$$
\hat{I}_{o}=\frac{\hat{V}_{o}}{R_{L}}=\frac{0.6}{1000}=0.6 \mathrm{~mA}
$$

Thus at the positive signal peak, the transistor collector current is

$$
I_{Q}+\hat{I}_{o}=1.86+0.6=2.46 \mathrm{~mA}
$$

At this current, $1 / g_{m}=10.6 \Omega$ and use of (5.22) gives the small-signal gain as

$$
A_{v}^{+}=\frac{1000}{1010.6}=0.9895
$$

This gain is 0.3 percent more than the quiescent value. At the negative signal peak, the transistor collector current is

$$
I_{Q}-\hat{I}_{o}=1.86-0.6=1.26 \mathrm{~mA}
$$

At this current, $1 / g_{m}=20.6 \Omega$ and use of (5.22) gives the small-signal gain as

$$
A_{v}^{-}=\frac{1000}{1020.6}=0.9798
$$

This gain is 0.7 percent less than the quiescent value. Although the collector-current signal amplitude is one-third of the bias current in this example, the small-signal gain variation is extremely small. This circuit thus has a high degree of linearity. Since the nonlinearity is small, the resulting distortion can be determined from the three values of the small-signal gain calculated in this example. See Problem 5.8.

## 5.3 The Source Follower as an Output Stage

The small-signal properties of the source follower are calculated in Chapter 3. Since this circuit has low output resistance, it is often used as an output stage. The large signal properties of the source follower are considered next.

### 5.3.1 Transfer Characteristics of the Source Follower

A source-follower output stage is shown in Fig. 5.8 with equal magnitude positive and negative power supplies for simplicity. The large-signal transfer characteristic can be derived as follows:

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{i}=V_{o}+V_{g s 1}=V_{o}+V_{t 1}+V_{o v 1} \tag{5.23}
\end{equation*}
$$

If the threshold and overdrive terms are exactly constant, the output voltage follows the input voltage with a constant difference. In practice, however, the body effect changes the threshold voltage. Also, the overdrive is not constant mainly because the drain current is not constant.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_69320962b1b525ebcc55g-054.jpg?height=521&width=778&top_left_y=198&top_left_x=270)

Figure 5.8 Source-follower output stage with current-mirror bias.

Substituting (1.140) with $V_{s b}=V_{o}+V_{D D}$ and (1.166) with $I_{d 1}=I_{Q}+V_{o} / R_{L}$ into (5.23) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{i}=V_{o}+V_{t 0}+\gamma\left(\sqrt{2 \phi_{f}+V_{o}+V_{D D}}-\sqrt{2 \phi_{f}}\right)+\sqrt{\frac{2\left(I_{Q}+\frac{V_{o}}{R_{L}}\right)}{k^{\prime}(W / L)_{1}}} \tag{5.24}
\end{equation*}
$$

This equation is valid provided that $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ operate in the active region with output resistances much larger than $R_{L}$.

The transfer characteristic is plotted in Fig. 5.9. It intersects the $x$ axis at the input-referred offset voltage, which is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left.V_{i}\right|_{V_{o}=0}=V_{t 0}+\gamma\left(\sqrt{2 \phi_{f}+V_{D D}}-\sqrt{2 \phi_{f}}\right)+\sqrt{\frac{2 I_{Q}}{k^{\prime}(W / L)_{1}}} \tag{5.25}
\end{equation*}
$$

The slope at this point is the incremental gain calculated in (3.80). With $r_{o} \rightarrow \infty$, the slope is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{o}}{v_{i}}=\frac{g_{m} R_{L}}{1+\left(g_{m}+g_{m b}\right) R_{L}} \tag{5.26}
\end{equation*}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_69320962b1b525ebcc55g-054.jpg?height=648&width=1045&top_left_y=1549&top_left_x=397)

Figure 5.9 Transfer characteristic of the circuit of Fig. 5.8 for a low $\left(R_{L 2}\right)$ and a high $\left(R_{L 1}\right)$ value of load resistance.

When $R_{L} \rightarrow \infty$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{o}}{v_{i}}=\frac{g_{m}}{g_{m}+g_{m b}}=\frac{1}{1+\chi} \tag{5.27}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since $\chi$ is typically in the range of 0.1 to 0.3 , the slope typically ranges from about 0.7 to 0.9 . In contrast, the slope of the emitter-follower transfer characteristic is unity under these conditions. Furthermore, $(1.200)$ shows that $\chi$ depends on the source-body voltage, which is $V_{o}+V_{D D}$ in Fig. 5.8. Therefore, the slope calculated in (5.27) changes as $V_{o}$ changes even when $M_{1}$ operates in the active region, causing distortion. Fig. 5.9 ignores this variation in the slope, but it is considered in Section 5.3.2.

When the output voltage rises within an overdrive of the positive supply, $M_{1}$ enters the triode region, dramatically reducing the slope of the transfer characteristic. The overdrive at this break point is calculated using the total drain current, which exceeds $I_{Q}$ if $R_{L}$ is finite. Therefore, the location of the break point depends on $R_{L}$, but this effect is not shown in Fig. 5.9. Unlike in the emitter follower, the output can pull up asymptotically to the supply voltage with unlimited input voltage. In practice, however, the input must be larger than $V_{D D}$ by at least the threshold voltage to bias $M_{1}$ in the triode region. If the input voltage is limited to $V_{D D}, M_{1}$ never reaches the triode region.

For negative input voltages, the minimum value of the output voltage depends on $R_{L}$, as in the emitter follower. If $I_{Q} R_{L}>V_{D D}$, the slope of the transfer characteristic is approximately constant until $M_{2}$ enters the triode region, which happens when

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{o}=-V_{D D}+V_{o v 2}=-V_{D D}+\sqrt{\frac{2 I_{Q}}{k^{\prime}(W / L)_{2}}} \tag{5.28}
\end{equation*}
$$

This case is labeled as $R_{L 1}$ in Fig. 5.9. On the other hand, if $I_{Q} R_{L}<V_{D D}$, the slope is almost constant until $M_{1}$ turns off. The corresponding minimum output voltage is

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{o}=-I_{Q} R_{L} \tag{5.29}
\end{equation*}
$$

This case is labeled as $R_{L 2}$ in Fig. 5.9. From a design standpoint, $I_{Q} R_{L}$ is usually set larger than $V_{D D}$, so that the situation shown for $R_{L}=R_{L 1}$ in Fig. 5.9 holds. Under this condition, the output voltage can swing almost to the positive and negative supply voltages before excessive distortion occurs.

### 5.3.2 Distortion in the Source Follower

The transfer function of the source-follower stage was calculated in (5.23), where $V_{i}$ is expressed as a function of $V_{o}$. The calculation of signal distortion from a nonlinear transfer function will now be illustrated using the source-follower stage as an example.

Using a Taylor series, the input voltage can be written as

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{i}=V_{I}+v_{i}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}\left(V_{o}=V_{O}\right)\left(V_{o}-V_{O}\right)^{n}}{n!} \tag{5.30}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $f^{(n)}$ represents the $n^{\text {th }}$ derivative of $f$. Since $v_{o}=V_{o}-V_{O}$, (5.30) can be rewritten as

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{i}=V_{I}+v_{i}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} b_{n}\left(v_{o}\right)^{n} \tag{5.31}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $b_{n}=f^{(n)}\left(V_{o}=V_{O}\right) /(n!)$. For simplicity, assume that $R_{L} \rightarrow \infty$. From (1.140) and (5.23),

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{i}=f\left(V_{o}\right)=V_{o}+V_{t 0}+\gamma\left(\sqrt{V_{o}+V_{D D}+2 \phi_{f}}-\sqrt{2 \phi_{f}}\right)+V_{o v 1} \tag{5.32}
\end{equation*}
$$

Then

$$
\begin{align*}
f^{\prime}\left(V_{o}\right) & =1+\frac{\gamma}{2}\left(V_{o}+V_{D D}+2 \phi_{f}\right)^{-1 / 2}  \tag{5.33}\\
f^{\prime \prime}\left(V_{o}\right) & =-\frac{\gamma}{4}\left(V_{o}+V_{D D}+2 \phi_{f}\right)^{-3 / 2}  \tag{5.34}\\
f^{\prime \prime \prime}\left(V_{o}\right) & =\frac{3 \gamma}{8}\left(V_{o}+V_{D D}+2 \phi_{f}\right)^{-5 / 2} \tag{5.35}
\end{align*}
$$

Therefore,

$$
\begin{align*}
& b_{0}=f\left(V_{o}=V_{O}\right)=V_{O}+V_{t 0}+\gamma\left(\sqrt{V_{O}+V_{D D}+2 \phi_{f}}-\sqrt{2 \phi_{f}}\right)+V_{o v 1}  \tag{5.36}\\
& b_{1}=f^{\prime}\left(V_{o}=V_{O}\right)=1+\frac{\gamma}{2}\left(V_{O}+V_{D D}+2 \phi_{f}\right)^{-1 / 2}  \tag{5.37}\\
& b_{2}=\frac{f^{\prime \prime}\left(V_{o}=V_{O}\right)}{2}=-\frac{\gamma}{8}\left(V_{O}+V_{D D}+2 \phi_{f}\right)^{-3 / 2}  \tag{5.38}\\
& b_{3}=\frac{f^{\prime \prime \prime}\left(V_{o}=V_{O}\right)}{3!}=\frac{\gamma}{16}\left(V_{O}+V_{D D}+2 \phi_{f}\right)^{-5 / 2} \tag{5.39}
\end{align*}
$$

Since the constant $b_{0}$ is the dc input voltage $V_{I},(5.31)$ can be rewritten as

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{i}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_{n}\left(v_{o}\right)^{n}=b_{1} v_{o}+b_{2} v_{o}^{2}+b_{3} v_{o}^{3}+\ldots \tag{5.40}
\end{equation*}
$$

To find the distortion, we would like to rearrange this equation into the following form

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{o}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n}\left(v_{i}\right)^{n}=a_{1} v_{i}+a_{2} v_{i}^{2}+a_{3} v_{i}^{3}+\ldots \tag{5.41}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substituting (5.41) into (5.40) gives

$$
\begin{align*}
v_{i}= & b_{1}\left(a_{1} v_{i}+a_{2} v_{i}^{2}+a_{3} v_{i}^{3}+\ldots\right)+b_{2}\left(a_{1} v_{i}+a_{2} v_{i}^{2}+a_{3} v_{i}^{3}+\ldots\right)^{2} \\
& +b_{3}\left(a_{1} v_{i}+a_{2} v_{i}^{2}+a_{3} v_{i}^{3}+\ldots\right)^{3}+\ldots \\
= & b_{1} a_{1} v_{i}+\left(b_{1} a_{2}+b_{2} a_{1}^{2}\right) v_{i}^{2}+\left(b_{1} a_{3}+2 b_{2} a_{1} a_{2}+b_{3} a_{1}^{3}\right) v_{i}^{3}+\ldots \tag{5.42}
\end{align*}
$$

Matching coefficients in (5.42) shows that

$$
\begin{align*}
& 1=b_{1} a_{1}  \tag{5.43}\\
& 0=b_{1} a_{2}+b_{2} a_{1}^{2}  \tag{5.44}\\
& 0=b_{1} a_{3}+2 b_{2} a_{1} a_{2}+b_{3} a_{1}^{3} \tag{5.45}
\end{align*}
$$

From (5.43),

$$
\begin{equation*}
a_{1}=\frac{1}{b_{1}} \tag{5.46}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substituting (5.46) into (5.44) and rearranging gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
a_{2}=-\frac{b_{2}}{b_{1}^{3}} \tag{5.47}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substituting (5.46) and (5.47) into (5.45) and rearranging gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
a_{3}=\frac{2 b_{2}^{2}}{b_{1}^{5}}-\frac{b_{3}}{b_{1}^{4}} \tag{5.48}
\end{equation*}
$$

For the source follower, substituting (5.37) into (5.46) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
a_{1}=\frac{1}{1+\frac{\gamma}{2}\left(V_{O}+V_{D D}+2 \phi_{f}\right)^{-1 / 2}} \tag{5.49}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substituting (5.37) and (5.38) into (5.47) and rearranging gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
a_{2}=\frac{\frac{\gamma}{8}\left(V_{O}+V_{D D}+2 \phi_{f}\right)^{-3 / 2}}{\left(1+\frac{\gamma}{2}\left(V_{O}+V_{D D}+2 \phi_{f}\right)^{-1 / 2}\right)^{3}} \tag{5.50}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substituting (5.37), (5.38), and (5.39) into (5.48) and rearranging gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
a_{3}=-\frac{\frac{\gamma}{16}\left(V_{O}+V_{D D}+2 \phi_{f}\right)^{-5 / 2}}{\left(1+\frac{\gamma}{2}\left(V_{O}+V_{D D}+2 \phi_{f}\right)^{-1 / 2}\right)^{5}} \tag{5.51}
\end{equation*}
$$

Equations $5.41,5.49,5.50$, and 5.51 can be used to calculate the distortion of the sourcefollower stage. For small values of $v_{i}$ such that $a_{2} v_{i}^{2} \ll a_{1} v_{i}$, the first term on the right-hand side of (5.41) dominates and the circuit is essentially linear. However, as $v_{i}$ becomes comparable to $a_{1} / a_{2}$, other terms become significant and distortion products are generated, as is illustrated next. A common method of describing the nonlinearity of an amplifier is the specification of harmonic distortion, which is defined for a single sinusoidal input applied to the amplifier. Thus let

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{i}=\hat{v}_{i} \sin \omega t \tag{5.52}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substituting (5.52) into (5.41) gives

$$
\begin{align*}
v_{o} & =a_{1} \hat{v}_{i} \sin \omega t+a_{2} \hat{v}_{i}^{2} \sin ^{2} \omega t+a_{3} \hat{v}_{i}^{3} \sin ^{3} \omega t+\ldots \\
& =a_{1} \hat{v}_{i} \sin \omega t+\frac{a_{2} \hat{v}_{i}^{2}}{2}(1-\cos 2 \omega t)+\frac{a_{3} \hat{v}_{i}^{3}}{4}(3 \sin \omega t-\sin 3 \omega t)+\ldots \tag{5.53}
\end{align*}
$$

Equation 5.53 shows that the output voltage contains frequency components at the fundamental frequency, $\omega$ (the input frequency), and also at harmonic frequencies $2 \omega, 3 \omega$, and so on. The latter terms represent distortion products that are not present in the input signal. Secondharmonic distortion $\mathrm{HD}_{2}$ is defined as the ratio of the amplitude of the output-signal component at frequency $2 \omega$ to the amplitude of the first harmonic (or fundamental) at frequency $\omega$. For small distortion, the term (3/4) $a_{3} \hat{v}_{i}^{3} \sin \omega t$ in (5.53) is small compared to $a_{1} \hat{v}_{i} \sin \omega t$, and the amplitude of the fundamental is approximately $a_{1} \hat{v}_{i}$. Again for small distortion, higher-order terms in (5.53) may be neglected and

$$
\begin{equation*}
H D_{2}=\frac{a_{2} \hat{v}_{i}^{2}}{2} \frac{1}{a_{1} \hat{v}_{i}}=\frac{1}{2} \frac{a_{2}}{a_{1}} \hat{v}_{i} \tag{5.54}
\end{equation*}
$$

Under these assumptions, $H D_{2}$ varies linearly with the peak signal level $\hat{v}_{i}$. The value of $H D_{2}$ can be expressed in terms of known parameters by substituting (5.49) and (5.50) in (5.54) to give

$$
\begin{equation*}
H D_{2}=\frac{\gamma}{16} \frac{\left(V_{O}+V_{D D}+2 \phi_{f}\right)^{-3 / 2}\left(\hat{v}_{i}\right)}{\left(1+\frac{\gamma}{2}\left(V_{O}+V_{D D}+2 \phi_{f}\right)^{-1 / 2}\right)^{2}} \tag{5.55}
\end{equation*}
$$

If $\gamma \ll 2 \sqrt{V_{O}+V_{D D}+2 \phi_{f}}$, then

$$
\begin{equation*}
H D_{2} \simeq \frac{\gamma}{16}\left(V_{O}+V_{D D}+2 \phi_{f}\right)^{-3 / 2} \hat{v}_{i} \tag{5.56}
\end{equation*}
$$

This equation shows that the second-harmonic distortion can be reduced by increasing the dc output voltage $V_{O}$. This result is reasonable because this distortion stems from the body effect. Therefore, increasing $V_{O}$ decreases the variation of the source-body voltage compared to its dc value caused by an input with fixed peak amplitude. ${ }^{2}$ Equation 5.56 also shows that the second-harmonic distortion is approximately proportional to $\gamma$, neglecting the effect of $\gamma$ on $V_{O}$.

Similarly, third-harmonic distortion $\mathrm{HD}_{3}$ is defined as the ratio of the output signal component at frequency $3 \omega$ to the first harmonic. From (5.53) and assuming small distortion,

$$
\begin{equation*}
H D_{3}=\frac{a_{3} \hat{v}_{i}^{3}}{4} \frac{1}{a_{1} \hat{v}_{i}}=\frac{1}{4} \frac{a_{3}}{a_{1}} \hat{v}_{i}^{2} \tag{5.57}
\end{equation*}
$$

Under these assumptions, $H D_{3}$ varies as the square of the signal amplitude. The value of $H D_{3}$ can be expressed in terms of known parameters by substituting (5.49) and (5.51) in (5.57) to give

$$
\begin{equation*}
H D_{3}=-\frac{\gamma}{64} \frac{\left(V_{O}+V_{D D}+2 \phi_{f}\right)^{-5 / 2}\left(\hat{v}_{i}^{2}\right)}{\left(1+\frac{\gamma}{2}\left(V_{O}+V_{D D}+2 \phi_{f}\right)^{-1 / 2}\right)^{4}} \tag{5.58}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since the distortion calculated above stems from the body effect, it can be eliminated by placing the source follower in an isolated well and connecting the source to the well. However, this approach specifies the type of source-follower transistor because it must be opposite the type of the doping in the well. Also, this approach adds the well-substrate parasitic capacitance to the output load of the source follower, reducing its bandwidth.

#### EXAMPLE

Calculate second- and third-harmonic distortion in the circuit of Fig. 5.8 for a peak sinusoidal input voltage $\hat{v}_{i}=0.5 \mathrm{~V}$. Assume that $V_{I}=0, V_{D D}=2.5 \mathrm{~V}, I_{Q}=1 \mathrm{~mA}$, and $R_{L} \rightarrow \infty$. Also, assume that $(W / L)_{1}=1000, k^{\prime}=200 \mu \mathrm{~A} / \mathrm{V}^{2}, V_{t 0}=0.7 \mathrm{~V}, \phi_{f}=0.3 \mathrm{~V}$, and $\gamma=0.5 \mathrm{~V}^{1 / 2}$.

First, the dc output voltage $V_{O}$ is

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{O}=V_{I}-V_{t 0}-\gamma\left(\sqrt{V_{O}+V_{D D}+2 \phi_{f}}-\sqrt{2 \phi_{f}}\right)-V_{o v 1} \tag{5.59}
\end{equation*}
$$

Rearranging (5.59) gives

$$
\begin{align*}
\left(V_{O}+V_{D D}+2 \phi_{f}\right) & +\gamma \sqrt{V_{O}+V_{D D}+2 \phi_{f}} \\
& -V_{I}+V_{o v 1}+V_{t 0}-\gamma \sqrt{2 \phi_{f}}-V_{D D}-2 \phi_{f}=0 \tag{5.60}
\end{align*}
$$

This quadratic equation can be solved for $\sqrt{V_{O}+V_{D D}+2 \phi_{f}}$. Since the result must be positive,

$$
\begin{align*}
\sqrt{V_{O}+V_{D D}+2 \phi_{f}} & = \\
-\frac{\gamma}{2} & +\sqrt{\left(\frac{\gamma}{2}\right)^{2}+V_{I}-V_{o v 1}-V_{t 0}+\gamma \sqrt{2 \phi_{f}}+V_{D D}+2 \phi_{f}} \tag{5.61}
\end{align*}
$$

Squaring both sides and rearranging gives

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{O}= & -V_{D D}-2 \phi_{f} \\
& +\left(-\frac{\gamma}{2}+\sqrt{\left(\frac{\gamma}{2}\right)^{2}+V_{I}-V_{o v 1}-V_{t 0}+\gamma \sqrt{2 \phi_{f}}+V_{D D}+2 \phi_{f}}\right)^{2} \tag{5.62}
\end{align*}
$$

In this example,

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{o v 1}=\sqrt{\frac{2 I_{Q}}{k^{\prime}(W / L)_{1}}}=\sqrt{\frac{2(1000)}{200(1000)}} \mathrm{V}=0.1 \mathrm{~V} \tag{5.63}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since $V_{D D}+2 \phi_{f}=3.1 \mathrm{~V}$ and $V_{I}-V_{o v 1}-V_{t 0}=-0.8 \mathrm{~V}$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
V_{O} & =-3.1 \mathrm{~V}+\left(-0.25+\sqrt{(0.25)^{2}-0.8+0.5 \sqrt{0.6}+3.1}\right)^{2} \mathrm{~V} \\
& =-1.117 \mathrm{~V}
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore,

$$
V_{O}+V_{D D}+2 \phi_{f}=(-1.117+2.5+0.6) \mathrm{V}=1.983 \mathrm{~V}
$$

From (5.55),

$$
\begin{equation*}
H D_{2}=\frac{0.5}{16} \frac{(1.983)^{-3 / 2}(0.5)}{\left(1+\frac{0.5}{2}(1.983)^{-1 / 2}\right)^{2}}=0.0040 \tag{5.64}
\end{equation*}
$$

From (5.58),

$$
\begin{equation*}
H D_{3}=-\frac{0.5}{64} \frac{(1.983)^{-5 / 2}(0.5)^{2}}{\left(1+\frac{0.5}{2}(1.983)^{-1 / 2}\right)^{4}}=-1.8 \times 10^{-4} \tag{5.65}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus the second-harmonic distortion is 0.40 percent and the third-harmonic distortion is 0.018 percent. In practice, the second-harmonic distortion is usually dominant. ${ }^{3}$

## 5.4 Class B Push-Pull Output Stage ${ }^{4,5}$

The major disadvantage of Class A output stages is that large power dissipation occurs even for no ac input. In many applications of power amplifiers, the circuit may spend long periods of time in a standby condition with no input signal, or with intermittent inputs as in the case of voice signals. Power dissipated in these standby periods is wasted, which is important for two reasons. First, in battery-operated equipment, supply power must be conserved to extend the battery life. Second, any power wasted in the circuit is dissipated in the active devices, increasing their operating temperatures and thus the chance of failure. Furthermore, the power dissipated in the devices affects the physical size of device required, and larger devices are more expensive in terms of silicon area.

A Class B output stage alleviates this problem by having essentially zero power dissipation with zero input signal. Two active devices are used to deliver the power instead of one, and each device conducts for alternate half cycles. This behavior is the origin of the name push-pull. Another advantage of Class B output stages is that the efficiency is much higher than for a Class A output stage (ideally 78.6 percent at full output power).

Figure 5.10 Simple integrated-circuit Class B output stage.

A typical integrated-circuit realization of the Class B output stage is shown in Fig. 5.10 in bipolar technology. This circuit uses both $p n p$ and $n p n$ devices and is known as a complementary output stage. The pnp transistor is usually a substrate $p n p$. Note that the load resistance $R_{L}$ is connected to the emitters of the active devices; therefore, the devices act as emitter followers.

### 5.4.1 Transfer Characteristic of the Class B Stage

The transfer characteristic of the circuit of Fig. 5.10 is shown in Fig. 5.11. For $V_{i}$ equal to zero, $V_{o}$ is also zero and both devices are off with $V_{b e}=0$. As $V_{i}$ is made positive, the base-emitter voltage of $Q_{1}$ increases until it reaches the value $V_{B E(\mathrm{on})}$, when appreciable current will start to flow in $Q_{1}$. At this point, $V_{o}$ is still approximately zero, but further increases in $V_{i}$ will cause similar increases in $V_{o}$ because $Q_{1}$ acts as an emitter follower. When $V_{i}>0, Q_{2}$ is off with a reverse bias of $V_{B E(\text { on })}$ across its base-emitter junction. As $V_{i}$ is made even more positive, $Q_{1}$ eventually saturates (for $V_{i}=V_{C C}+V_{b e 1}-V_{C E 1(\text { sat })}$ ), and the characteristic flattens out as for the conventional emitter follower considered earlier.

As $V_{i}$ is taken negative from $V_{i}=0$, a similar characteristic is obtained except that $Q_{2}$ now acts as an emitter follower for $V_{i}$ more negative than $-V_{B E(\mathrm{on})}$. In this region, $Q_{1}$ is held in the off condition with a reverse bias of $V_{B E(\text { on })}$ across its base-emitter junction.

Figure 5.12 Output waveforms for various amplitude input signals applied to the Class B circuit of Fig. 5.10.

The characteristic of Fig. 5.11 shows a notch (or deadband) of $2 V_{B E(\text { on })}$ in $V_{i}$ centered around $V_{i}=0$. This deadband is common in Class B output stages and gives rise to crossover distortion, which is illustrated in Fig. 5.12, where the output waveforms from the circuit are shown for various amplitude input sinusoidal signals. In this circuit, the distortion is high for small input signals with amplitudes somewhat larger than $V_{B E(\text { on })}$. The effect of this source of distortion diminishes as the input signal becomes larger and the deadband represents a smaller fraction of the signal amplitude. Eventually, for very large signals, saturation of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ occurs and distortion rises sharply again due to clipping. This behavior is characteristic of Class B output stages and is why distortion figures are often quoted for both low and high output power operation.

The crossover distortion described above can be reduced by using Class $A B$ operation of the circuit. In this scheme, the active devices are biased so that each conducts a small quiescent current for $V_{i}=0$. Such biasing can be achieved as shown in Fig. 5.13, where the current source $I_{Q}$ forces bias current in diodes $Q_{3}$ and $Q_{4}$. Since the diodes are connected in parallel with the base-emitter junctions of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$, the output transistors are biased on with a current that is dependent on the area ratios of $Q_{1}, Q_{2}, Q_{3}$, and $Q_{4}$. A typical transfer characteristic for this circuit is shown in Fig. 5.14, and the deadband has been effectively eliminated. The remaining nonlinearities due to crossover in conduction from $Q_{1}$ to $Q_{2}$ can be reduced by using negative feedback, as described in Chapter 8.

The operation of the circuit in Fig. 5.13 is quite similar to that of Fig. 5.11. As $V_{i}$ is taken negative from its quiescent value, emitter follower $Q_{2}$ forces $V_{o}$ to follow. The load current flows through $Q_{2}$, whose base-emitter voltage will increase slightly. Since the diodes maintain a constant total bias voltage across the base-emitter junctions of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$, the base-emitter voltage of $Q_{1}$ will decrease by the same amount that $Q_{2}$ increased. Thus during the negative output voltage excursion, $Q_{1}$ stays on but conducts little current and plays no part in delivering
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_69320962b1b525ebcc55g-062.jpg?height=599&width=560&top_left_y=208&top_left_x=269)

Figure 5.14 Transfer characteristic of the circuit of Fig. 5.13.
output power. For $V_{i}$ taken positive, the opposite occurs, and $Q_{1}$ acts as the emitter follower delivering current to $R_{L}$ with $Q_{2}$ conducting only a very small current. In this case, the current source $I_{Q}$ supplies the base-current drive to $Q_{1}$.

In the derivation of the characteristics of Figures 5.11 and 5.14, we assumed that the magnitude of the input voltage $V_{i}$ was unlimited. In the characteristic of Fig. 5.11, the magnitude of $V_{i}$ required to cause saturation of $Q_{1}$ or $Q_{2}$ exceeds the supply voltage $V_{C C}$. However, as in the case of the single emitter follower described earlier, practical driver stages generally cannot produce values of $V_{i}$ exceeding $V_{C C}$ if they are connected to the same supply voltages as the output stage. For example, the current source $I_{Q}$ in Fig. 5.13 is usually realized with a pnp transistor and thus the voltage at the base of $Q_{1}$ cannot exceed $\left(V_{C C}-V_{C E(\mathrm{sat})}\right)$, at which point saturation of the current-source transistor occurs. Consequently, the positive and negative limits of $V_{o}$ where clipping occurs are generally somewhat less than shown in Fig. 5.11 and Fig. 5.14, and the limitation usually occurs in the driver stage. This point will be investigated further when practical output stages are considered in later sections.

### 5.4.2 Power Output and Efficiency of the Class B Stage

The method of operation of a Class B stage can be further appreciated by plotting the collector current waveforms in the two devices, as in Fig. 5.15, where crossover distortion is ignored. Note that each transistor conducts current to $R_{L}$ for half a cycle.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_69320962b1b525ebcc55g-063.jpg?height=1266&width=692&top_left_y=203&top_left_x=262)

Figure 5.15 Voltage and current waveforms for a Class B output stage. (a) Input voltage. (b) Output voltage. (c) $Q_{1}$ collector current. (d) $Q_{2}$ collector current.

The collector current waveforms of Fig. 5.15 also represent the waveforms of the current drawn from the two supplies. If the waveforms are assumed to be half-sinusoids, then the average current drawn from the $+V_{C C}$ supply is

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{\text {supply }}=\frac{1}{T} \int_{0}^{T} I_{c 1}(t) d t=\frac{1}{T} \int_{0}^{T / 2} \frac{\hat{V}_{o}}{R_{L}} \sin \left(\frac{2 \pi t}{T}\right) d t=\frac{1}{\pi} \frac{\hat{V}_{o}}{R_{L}}=\frac{1}{\pi} \hat{I}_{o} \tag{5.66}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $T$ is the period of the input signal. Also, $\hat{V}_{o}$ and $\hat{I}_{o}$ are the zero-to-peak amplitudes of the output sinusoidal voltage and current. Since each supply delivers the same current magnitude, the total average power drawn from the two supplies is

$$
\begin{equation*}
P_{\text {supply }}=2 V_{C C} I_{\text {supply }}=\frac{2}{\pi} \frac{V_{C C}}{R_{L}} \hat{V}_{o} \tag{5.67}
\end{equation*}
$$

where (5.66) has been substituted. Unlike in the Class A case, the average power drawn from the supplies does vary with signal level for a Class B stage, and is directly proportional to $\hat{V}_{o}$.

The average power delivered to $R_{L}$ is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
P_{L}=\frac{1}{2} \frac{\hat{V}_{o}^{2}}{R_{L}} \tag{5.68}
\end{equation*}
$$

From the definition of circuit efficiency in (5.13),

$$
\begin{equation*}
\eta_{C}=\frac{P_{L}}{P_{\text {supply }}}=\frac{\pi}{4} \frac{\hat{V}_{o}}{V_{C C}} \tag{5.69}
\end{equation*}
$$

where (5.67) and (5.68) have been substituted. Equation 5.69 shows that $\eta$ for a Class B stage is independent of $R_{L}$ but increases linearly as the output voltage amplitude $\hat{V}_{o}$ increases.

The maximum value that $\hat{V}_{o}$ can attain before clipping occurs with the characteristic of Fig. 5.14 is $\hat{V}_{o m}=\left(V_{C C}-V_{C E(\text { sat })}\right)$ and thus the maximum average signal power that can be delivered to $R_{L}$ for sinusoidal signals can be calculated from (5.68) as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left.P_{L}\right|_{\max }=\frac{1}{2} \frac{\left[V_{C C}-V_{C E(\mathrm{sat})}\right]^{2}}{R_{L}} \tag{5.70}
\end{equation*}
$$

From (5.69), the corresponding maximum efficiency is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\eta_{\max }=\frac{\pi}{4}\left(\frac{V_{C C}-V_{C E(\mathrm{sat})}}{V_{C C}}\right) \tag{5.71}
\end{equation*}
$$

If $V_{C E(\text { sat })}$ is small compared with $V_{C C}$, the circuit has a maximum efficiency of 0.786 or 78.6 percent. This maximum efficiency is much higher than the value of 25 percent achieved in Class A circuits. In addition, the standby power dissipation is essentially zero in the Class B circuit. These advantages explain the widespread use of Class B and Class AB output stages.

The load line for one device in a Class B stage is shown in Fig. 5.16. For values of $V_{c e}$ less than the quiescent value (which is $V_{C C}$ ), the load line has a slope of $\left(-1 / R_{L}\right)$. For values of $V_{c e}$ greater than $V_{C C}$, the load line lies along the $V_{c e}$ axis because the device under consideration turns off and the other device conducts. As a result, the $V_{c e}$ of the device under consideration increases while its collector current is zero. The maximum value of $V_{c e}$ is $\left(2 V_{C C}-V_{C E(\mathrm{sat})}\right)$. As in the case of a Class A stage, a geometrical interpretation of the average power $P_{L}$ delivered to $R_{L}$ can be obtained by noting that $P_{L}=\frac{1}{2} \hat{I}_{o} \hat{V}_{o}$, where $\hat{I}_{o}$ and $\hat{V}_{o}$ are the peak sinusoidal current and voltage delivered to $R_{L}$. Thus $P_{L}$ is the area of the triangle in Fig. 5.16 between the $V_{c e}$ axis and the portion of the load line traversed by the operating point.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_69320962b1b525ebcc55g-064.jpg?height=680&width=981&top_left_y=1552&top_left_x=431)

Figure 5.16 Load line for one device in a Class B stage.

Consider the instantaneous power dissipated in one device:

$$
\begin{equation*}
P_{c}=V_{c e} I_{c} \tag{5.72}
\end{equation*}
$$

But

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{c e}=V_{C C}-I_{c} R_{L} \tag{5.73}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substitution of (5.73) in (5.72) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
P_{c}=I_{c}\left(V_{C C}-I_{c} R_{L}\right)=I_{c} V_{C C}-I_{c}^{2} R_{L} \tag{5.74}
\end{equation*}
$$

Differentiation of (5.74) shows that $P_{c}$ reaches a peak for

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{c}=\frac{V_{C C}}{2 R_{L}} \tag{5.75}
\end{equation*}
$$

This peak lies on the load line midway between the $I_{c}$ and $V_{c e}$ axis intercepts and agrees with the result derived earlier for the Class A stage. As in that case, the load line in Fig. 5.16 is tangent to a power hyperbola at the point of peak dissipation. Thus, in a Class B stage, maximum instantaneous device dissipation occurs for an output voltage equal to about half the maximum swing. Since the quiescent device power dissipation is zero, the operating temperature of a Class B device always increases when nonzero signal is applied.

The instantaneous device power dissipation as a function of time is shown in Fig. 5.17, where collector current, collector-emitter voltage, and their product are displayed for one device in a Class B stage at maximum output. (Crossover distortion is ignored, and $V_{C E(\mathrm{sat})}=0$ is assumed.) When the device conducts, the power dissipation varies at twice the signal frequency. The device power dissipation is zero for the half cycle when the device is cut off. For an open-circuited load, the load line in Fig. 5.16 lies along the $V_{c e}$ axis and the device has zero

dissipation. As in the case of Class A stage, the load line in Fig. 5.16 becomes vertical through the quiescent point for a short-circuited load, and the instantaneous device power dissipation can then become excessive. Methods of protection against such a possibility are described in Section 5.4.6.

#### EXAMPLE

A Class B stage of the type shown in Fig. 5.10 drives a load $R_{L}=500 \Omega$. If the positive and negative supplies have magnitudes of 15 V , calculate the maximum average power that is delivered to $R_{L}$ for $\hat{V}_{o}=14.4 \mathrm{~V}$, the corresponding efficiency, and the maximum instantaneous device dissipation. Assume that $V_{o}$ is sinusoidal.

From (5.66), the average of supply current is

$$
I_{\text {supply }}=\frac{1}{\pi} \frac{\hat{V}_{o}}{R_{L}}=\frac{1}{\pi} \frac{14.4}{500}=9.17 \mathrm{~mA}
$$

Use of (5.67) gives the average power drawn from the supplies as

$$
P_{\text {supply }}=I_{\text {supply }} \times 2 V_{C C}=9.17 \times 30 \mathrm{~mW}=275 \mathrm{~mW}
$$

From (5.68), the average power delivered to $R_{L}$ is

$$
P_{L}=\frac{1}{2} \frac{\hat{V}_{o}^{2}}{R_{L}}=\frac{1}{2} \frac{14.4^{2}}{500}=207 \mathrm{~mW}
$$

From (5.13), the corresponding efficiency is

$$
\eta_{C}=\frac{P_{L}}{P_{\text {supply }}}=\frac{207}{275}=75.3 \text { percent }
$$

This result is close to the theoretical maximum of 78.6 percent. From (5.75), the maximum instantaneous device power dissipation occurs when

$$
I_{c}=\frac{V_{C C}}{2 R_{L}}=\frac{15 \mathrm{~V}}{1000 \Omega}=15 \mathrm{~mA}
$$

The corresponding value of $V_{c e}$ is $V_{C C} / 2=7.5 \mathrm{~V}$ and thus the maximum instantaneous device dissipation is

$$
P_{c}=I_{c} V_{c e}=15 \times 7.5 \mathrm{~mW}=112.5 \mathrm{~mW}
$$

By conservation of power, the average power dissipated per device is

$$
P_{\mathrm{av}}=\frac{1}{2}\left(P_{\text {supply }}-P_{L}\right)=\frac{1}{2}(275-207) \mathrm{mW}=34 \mathrm{~mW}
$$

### 5.4.3 Practical Realizations of Class B Complementary Output Stages ${ }^{6}$

The practical aspects of Class B output-stage design will now be illustrated by considering two examples. One of the simplest realizations is the output stage of the 709 op amp , and a simplified schematic of this is shown in Fig. 5.18. Transistor $Q_{3}$ acts as a common-emitter driver stage for output devices $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$.

The transfer characteristic of this stage can be calculated as follows. In the quiescent condition, $V_{o}=0$ and $V_{1}=0$. Since $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ are then off, there is no base current in these devices. Therefore, for $V_{C C}=10 \mathrm{~V}$, the bias current in $Q_{3}$ is

$$
I_{C 3}=\frac{V_{C C}-V_{1}}{R_{1}}=\frac{V_{C C}}{R_{1}}=\frac{10 \mathrm{~V}}{20 \mathrm{k} \Omega}=0.50 \mathrm{~mA}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_69320962b1b525ebcc55g-067.jpg?height=742&width=771&top_left_y=200&top_left_x=257)

Figure 5.18 Simplified schematic of the output stage of the 709 op amp.

The limiting values that $V_{o}$ can take are determined by the driver stage. When $V_{i}$ is taken large positive, $V_{1}$ decreases until $Q_{3}$ saturates, at which point the negative voltage limit $V_{o}^{-}$is reached:

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{o}^{-}=-V_{C C}+V_{C E 3(\mathrm{sat})}-V_{b e 2} \tag{5.76}
\end{equation*}
$$

For values of $V_{1}$ between $\left(-V_{C C}+V_{C E 3(\mathrm{sat})}\right)$ and $\left(-V_{B E(\mathrm{on})}\right)$, both $Q_{3}$ and $Q_{2}$ are in the forward-active region, and $V_{o}$ follows $V_{1}$ with $Q_{2}$ acting as an emitter follower.

As $V_{i}$ is taken negative, the current in $Q_{3}$ decreases and $V_{1}$ rises, turning $Q_{1}$ on. The positive voltage limit $V_{o}^{+}$is reached when $Q_{3}$ cuts off and the base of $Q_{1}$ is simply fed from the positive supply via $R_{1}$. Then

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{C C}=I_{b 1} R_{1}+V_{b e 1}+V_{o}^{+} \tag{5.77}
\end{equation*}
$$

If $\beta_{F 1}$ is large then

$$
V_{o}^{+}=I_{c 1} R_{L}=\beta_{F 1} I_{b 1} R_{L}
$$

where $\beta_{F 1}$ is the current gain of $Q_{1}$. Thus

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{b 1}=\frac{V_{o}^{+}}{\beta_{F 1} R_{L}} \tag{5.78}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substituting (5.78) in (5.77) and rearranging gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{o}^{+}=\frac{V_{C C}-V_{b e 1}}{1+\frac{R_{1}}{\beta_{F 1} R_{L}}} \tag{5.79}
\end{equation*}
$$

For $R_{L}=10 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ and $\beta_{F 1}=100$, (5.79) gives

$$
V_{o}^{+}=0.98\left(V_{C C}-V_{b e 1}\right)
$$

In this case, the limit on $V_{o}$ is similar for positive and negative swings. However, if $R_{L}=1 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ and $\beta_{F 1}=100$, (5.79) gives

$$
V_{o}^{+}=0.83\left(V_{C C}-V_{b e 1}\right)
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_69320962b1b525ebcc55g-068.jpg?height=778&width=955&top_left_y=199&top_left_x=439)

Figure 5.19 SPICE-generated transfer characteristic for the circuit of Fig. 5.18 with $V_{C C}=10 \mathrm{~V}$ and $R_{L}=1 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ and $10 \mathrm{k} \Omega$.

For this lower value of $R_{L}$, the maximum positive value of $V_{o}$ is reduced, and clipping on a sine wave occurs first for $V_{o}$ going positive.

Computer-generated transfer curves using SPICE for this circuit with $V_{C C}=10 \mathrm{~V}$ are shown in Fig. 5.19 for $R_{L}=1 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ and $R_{L}=10 \mathrm{k} \Omega$. ( $\beta_{F}=100$ is assumed for all devices.) The reduced positive voltage capability for $R_{L}=1 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ is apparent, as is the deadband present in the transfer characteristic. The curvature in the characteristic is due to the exponential nonlinearity of the driver $Q_{3}$. In practice, the transfer characteristic may be even more nonlinear than shown in Fig. 5.19 because $\beta_{F}$ for the $n p n$ transistor $Q_{1}$ is generally larger than $\beta_{F}$ for the pnp transistor $Q_{2}$, causing the positive and negative sections of the characteristic to differ significantly. This behavior can be seen by calculating the small-signal gain $\Delta V_{o} / \Delta V_{i}$ for positive and negative $V_{o}$. In the actual 709 integrated circuit, negative feedback is applied around this output stage to reduce these nonlinearities in the transfer characteristic.

A second example of a practical Class B output stage is shown Fig. 5.20, where SPICEcalculated bias currents are included. This circuit is a simplified schematic of the 741 op amp output circuitry. The output devices $Q_{14}$ and $Q_{20}$ are biased to a collector current of about 0.17 mA by the diodes $Q_{18}$ and $Q_{19}$. The value of the bias current in $Q_{14}$ and $Q_{20}$ depends on the effective area ratio between diodes $Q_{18}$ and $Q_{19}$ and the output devices. ( $Q_{18}$ and $Q_{19}$ are implemented with transistors in practice.) The output stage is driven by lateral $p n p$ emitter-follower $Q_{23}$, which is driven by common-emitter stage $Q_{17}$ biased to 0.68 mA by current source $Q_{13 \mathrm{~B}}$.

The diodes in Fig. 5.20 essentially eliminate crossover distortion in the circuit, which can be seen in the SPICE-generated transfer characteristic of Fig. 5.21. The linearity of this stage is further improved by the fact that the output devices are driven from a low resistance provided by the emitter follower $Q_{23}$. Consequently, differences in $\beta_{F}$ between $Q_{14}$ and $Q_{20}$ produce little effect on the transfer characteristic because small-signal gain $\Delta V_{o} / \Delta V_{1} \simeq 1$ for any practical value of $\beta_{F}$ with either $Q_{14}$ or $Q_{20}$ conducting.

The limits on the output voltage swing shown in Fig. 5.21 can be determined as follows. As $V_{i}$ is taken positive, the voltage $V_{1}$ at the base of $Q_{23}$ goes negative, and voltages $V_{2}$ and

$V_{o}$ follow with $Q_{20}$ drawing current from $R_{L}$. When $Q_{17}$ saturates, the output voltage limit for negative excursions is reached at

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{o}^{-}=-V_{C C}+V_{C E 17(\mathrm{sat})}-V_{b e 23}-V_{b e 20} \tag{5.80}
\end{equation*}
$$

This limit is about 1.4 V more positive than the negative supply. Thus $V_{o}^{-}$is limited by saturation in $Q_{17}$, which is the stage preceding driver stage $Q_{23}$.

As $V_{i}$ is taken negative from its quiescent value (where $V_{o}=0$ ), voltage $V_{1}$ rises and voltages $V_{2}$ and $V_{o}$ follow with $Q_{14}$ delivering current to the load. The positive output voltage

Figure 5.21 SPICE-generated transfer curve for the circuit of Fig. $5.20 a$ with $V_{C C}=15 \mathrm{~V}$ and $R_{L}=1 \mathrm{k} \Omega$.
limit $V_{o}^{+}$is reached when current source $Q_{13 \mathrm{~A}}$ saturates and

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{o}^{+}=V_{C C}+V_{C E 13 \mathrm{~A}(\mathrm{sat})}-V_{b e 14} \tag{5.81}
\end{equation*}
$$

This limit is about 0.8 V below the positive supply because $V_{C E 13 \mathrm{~A}(\mathrm{sat})} \simeq-0.1 \mathrm{~V}$ for the $p n p$ device. Thus $V_{o}^{+}$is also limited by the driver stage.

The power requirements of the driver circuits in a configuration such as shown in Fig. 5.20 require some consideration. The basic requirement of the driver is to supply sufficient drive to the output stage so that it can supply the desired power to $R_{L}$. As $V_{o}$ is taken negative, $Q_{23}$ draws current from the base of $Q_{20}$ with essentially no limit. In fact, the circuit must be protected in case of a short-circuited load. Otherwise in this case, a large input signal could cause $Q_{23}$ and $Q_{20}$ to conduct such heavy currents that they burn out. As explained before, the negative voltage limit is reached when $Q_{17}$ saturates and can no longer drive the base of $Q_{23}$ negative.

As $V_{o}$ is taken positive (by $V_{i}$ going negative and $V_{1}$ going positive), $Q_{23}$ conducts less, and current source $Q_{13 \mathrm{~A}}$ supplies base current to $Q_{14}$. The maximum output current is limited by the current of 0.22 mA available for driving $Q_{14}$. As $V_{1}, V_{2}$, and $V_{o}$ go positive, the current in $Q_{14}$ increases, and the current in $Q_{13 \mathrm{~A}}$ is progressively diverted to the base of $Q_{14}$. The maximum possible output current delivered by $Q_{14}$ is thus

$$
I_{o}=\beta_{F 14} \times 0.22 \mathrm{~mA}
$$

If $\beta_{F 14}=100$, the maximum output current is 22 mA . The driver stage may thus limit the maximum positive current available from the output stage. However, this output current level is only reached if $R_{L}$ is small enough so that $Q_{13 \mathrm{~A}}$ does not saturate on the positive voltage excursion.

The stage preceding the driver in this circuit is $Q_{17}$. As mentioned above, the negative voltage limit of $V_{o}$ is reached when $Q_{17}$ saturates. The bias current of 0.68 mA in $Q_{17}$ is much greater than the base current of $Q_{23}$, and thus $Q_{23}$ produces very little loading on $Q_{17}$. Consequently, voltage $V_{1}$ at the base of $Q_{23}$ can be driven to within $V_{C E(\text { sat })}$ of either supply voltage with only a very small fractional change in the collector current of $Q_{17}$.

Finally, we will now examine the detail of the fabrication of diodes $Q_{18}$ and $Q_{19}$ in the 741. The actual circuit is shown in Fig. $5.20 b$ with the output protection circuitry omitted. Diode $Q_{19}$ conducts only a current equal to the base current of $Q_{18}$ plus the bleed current in pinch resistor $R_{10}$. Transistor $Q_{18}$ thus conducts most of the bias current of current source $Q_{13 \mathrm{~A}}$. This arrangement is used for two reasons. First, the basic aim of achieving a voltage drop equal to two base-emitter voltages is achieved. Since $Q_{18}$ and $Q_{19}$ have common collectors, however, they can be placed in the same isolation region, reducing die area. Second, since $Q_{19}$ conducts only a small current, the bias voltage produced by $Q_{18}$ and $Q_{19}$ across the bases of $Q_{14}$ and $Q_{20}$ is less than would result from a connection as shown in Fig. 5.20a. This observation is important because output transistors $Q_{14}$ and $Q_{20}$ generally have emitter areas larger than the standard device geometry (typically four times larger or more) so that they can maintain high $\beta_{F}$ while conducting large output currents. Thus in the circuit of Fig. 5.20a, the bias current in $Q_{14}$ and $Q_{20}$ would be about four times the current in $Q_{18}$ and $Q_{19}$, which would be excessive in a 741-type circuit. However, the circuit of Fig. 5.20b can be designed to bias $Q_{14}$ and $Q_{20}$ to a current comparable to the current in the diodes, even though the output devices have a large area. The basic reason for this result is that the small bias current in $Q_{19}$ in Fig. 5.20 b gives it a smaller base-emitter voltage than for the same device in Fig. 5.20a, reducing the total bias voltage between the bases of $Q_{14}$ and $Q_{20}$.

The results described above can be illustrated quantitatively by calculating the bias currents in $Q_{14}$ and $Q_{20}$ of Fig. 5.20b. From KVL,

$$
V_{B E 19}+V_{B E 18}=V_{B E 14}+\left|V_{B E 20}\right|
$$

and thus

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{T} \ln \frac{I_{C 19}}{I_{S 19}}+V_{T} \ln \frac{I_{C 18}}{I_{S 18}}=V_{T} \ln \frac{I_{C 14}}{I_{S 14}}+V_{T} \ln \left|\frac{I_{C 20}}{I_{S 20}}\right| \tag{5.82}
\end{equation*}
$$

If we assume that the circuit is biased for $V_{o}=0 \mathrm{~V}$ and also that $\beta_{F 14} \gg 1$ and $\beta_{F 20} \gg 1$, then $\left|I_{C 14}\right|=\left|I_{C 20}\right|$ and (5.82) becomes

$$
\frac{I_{C 19} I_{C 18}}{I_{S 18} I_{S 19}}=\frac{I_{C 14}^{2}}{I_{S 14} I_{S 20}}
$$

from which

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{C 14}=-I_{C 20}=\sqrt{I_{C 19} I_{C 18}} \sqrt{\frac{I_{S 14} I_{S 20}}{I_{S 18} I_{S 19}}} \tag{5.83}
\end{equation*}
$$

Equation 5.83 may be used to calculate the output bias current in circuits of the type shown in Fig. 5.20b. The output-stage bias current from (5.83) is proportional to $\sqrt{I_{C 18}}$ and $\sqrt{I_{C 19}}$. For this specific example, the collector current in $Q_{19}$ is approximately equal to the current in $R_{10}$ if $\beta_{F}$ is large and thus

$$
I_{C 19} \simeq \frac{V_{B E 18}}{R_{10}} \simeq \frac{0.6}{40} \mathrm{~mA}=15 \mu \mathrm{~A}
$$

If the base currents of $Q_{14}$ and $Q_{20}$ are neglected, the collector current of $Q_{18}$ is

$$
I_{C 18} \simeq\left|I_{C 13 \mathrm{~A}}\right|-I_{C 19}=(220-15) \mu \mathrm{A}=205 \mu \mathrm{~A}
$$

To calculate the output-stage bias currents from (5.83), values for the various reverse saturation currents are required. These values depend on the particular IC process used, but typical values are $I_{S 18}=I_{S 19}=2 \times 10^{-15} \mathrm{~A}, I_{S 14}=4 I_{S 18}=8 \times 10^{-15} \mathrm{~A}$, and $I_{S 20}=4 \times 10^{-15} \mathrm{~A}$. Substitution of these data in (5.83) gives $I_{C 14}=-I_{C 20}=0.16 \mathrm{~mA}$.

#### EXAMPLE

For the output stage of Fig. 5.20a, calculate bias currents in all devices for $V_{o}=+10 \mathrm{~V}$. Assume that $V_{C C}=15 \mathrm{~V}, R_{L}=2 \mathrm{k} \Omega$, and $\beta_{F}=100$. For simplicity, assume all devices have equal area and for each device

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|I_{C}\right|=10^{-14} \exp \left|\frac{V_{b e}}{V_{T}}\right| \tag{5.84}
\end{equation*}
$$

Assuming that $Q_{14}$ supplies the load current for positive output voltages, we have

$$
I_{c 14}=\frac{V_{o}}{R_{L}}=\frac{10 \mathrm{~V}}{2 \mathrm{k} \Omega}=5 \mathrm{~mA}
$$

Substitution in (5.84) and rearranging gives

$$
V_{b e 14}=(26 \mathrm{mV}) \ln \left(\frac{5 \times 10^{-3}}{10^{-14}}\right)=700 \mathrm{mV}
$$

Also

$$
I_{b 14}=\frac{I_{c 14}}{\beta_{F 14}}=\frac{5 \mathrm{~mA}}{100}=0.05 \mathrm{~mA}
$$

Thus

$$
I_{c 19} \simeq I_{c 18} \simeq-I_{c 23}=(0.22-0.05) \mathrm{mA}=0.17 \mathrm{~mA}
$$

Substitution in (5.84) and rearranging gives

$$
V_{b e 19}=V_{b e 18}=-V_{b e 23}=(26 \mathrm{mV}) \ln \left(\frac{0.17 \times 10^{-3}}{10^{-14}}\right)=613 \mathrm{mV}
$$

Thus

$$
V_{b e 20}=-\left(V_{b e 19}+V_{b e 18}-V_{b e 14}\right)=-525 \mathrm{mV}
$$

Use of (5.84) gives

$$
I_{c 20}=-5.9 \mu \mathrm{~A}
$$

and the collector current in $Q_{20}$ is quite small as predicted. Finally

$$
I_{c 17}=0.68 \mathrm{~mA}-\frac{I_{c 23}}{\beta_{F 23}}=\left(0.68-\frac{0.17}{100}\right) \mathrm{mA}=0.68 \mathrm{~mA}
$$

and also

$$
V_{2}=V_{o}-\left|V_{b e 20}\right|=(10-0.525) \mathrm{V}=9.475 \mathrm{~V}
$$

and

$$
V_{1}=V_{2}-\left|V_{b e 23}\right|=(9.475-0.613) \mathrm{V}=8.862 \mathrm{~V}
$$

### 5.4.4 All-npn Class B Output Stage ${ }^{7,8,9}$

The Class B circuits described above are adequate for many integrated-circuit applications where the output power to be delivered to the load is of the order of several hundred milliwatts or less. However, if output-power levels of several watts or more are required, these circuits are inadequate because the substrate $p n p$ transistors used in the output stage have a limited current-carrying capability. This limit stems from the fact that the doping levels in the emitter, base, and collector of these devices are not optimized for pnp structures because the $n p n$ devices in the circuit have conflicting requirements.

A circuit design that uses high-power npn transistors in both halves of a Class B configuration is shown in Fig. 5.22. In this circuit, common-emitter transistor $Q_{1}$ delivers power to the load during the negative half-cycle, and emitter follower $Q_{2}$ delivers power during the positive half-cycle.

To examine the operation of this circuit, consider $V_{i}$ taken negative from its quiescent value so that $Q_{1}$ is off and $I_{c 1}=0$. Then diodes $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$ must both be off and all of the collector current of $Q_{3}$ is delivered to the base of $Q_{2}$. The output voltage then has its maximum positive value $V_{o}^{+}$. If $R_{L}$ is big enough, $Q_{3}$ saturates and

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{o}^{+}=V_{C C}-\left|V_{C E 3(\mathrm{sat})}\right|-V_{b e 2} \tag{5.85}
\end{equation*}
$$

To attain this maximum positive value, transistor $Q_{3}$ must saturate in this extreme condition. In contrast, $Q_{2}$ in this circuit cannot saturate because the collector of $Q_{2}$ is connected to the positive supply and the base voltage of $Q_{2}$ cannot exceed the positive supply voltage. The condition for $Q_{3}$ to be saturated is that the nominal collector bias current $I_{Q 3}$ in $Q_{3}$ (when $Q_{3}$ is not saturated) should be larger than the required base current of $Q_{2}$ when $V_{o}=V_{o}^{+}$. Thus we require

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{Q 3}>I_{b 2} \tag{5.86}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since $Q_{2}$ supplies the current to $R_{L}$ for $V_{o}>0$, we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{o}^{+}=-I_{e 2} R_{L}=\left(\beta_{2}+1\right) I_{b 2} R_{L} \tag{5.87}
\end{equation*}
$$

Figure 5.22 All-npn Class B output stage.

Substitution of (5.87) and (5.85) in (5.86) gives the requirement on the bias current of $Q_{3}$ as

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{Q 3}>\frac{V_{C C}-V_{C E 3(\mathrm{sat})}-V_{b e 2}}{\left(\beta_{2}+1\right) R_{L}} \tag{5.88}
\end{equation*}
$$

Equation 5.88 also applies to the circuit of Fig. 5.20a. It gives limits on $I_{C 3}, \beta_{2}$, and $R_{L}$ for $V_{o}$ to be able to swing close to the positive supply. If $I_{Q 3}$ is less than the value given by (5.88), $V_{o}$ will begin clipping at a positive value less than that given by (5.85) and $Q_{3}$ will never saturate.

Now consider $V_{i}$ made positive to turn $Q_{1}$ on and produce nonzero $I_{c 1}$. Since the base of $Q_{2}$ is more positive than its emitter, diode $D_{1}$ will turn on in preference to $D_{2}$, which will be off with zero volts across its junction. The current $I_{c 1}$ will flow through $D_{1}$ and will be drawn from $Q_{3}$, which is assumed saturated at first. As $I_{c 1}$ increases, $Q_{3}$ will eventually come out of saturation, and voltage $V_{2}$ at the base of $Q_{2}$ will then be pulled down. Since $Q_{2}$ acts as an emitter follower, $V_{o}$ will follow $V_{2}$ down. This behavior occurs during the positive half of the cycle, and $Q_{1}$ acts as a driver with $Q_{2}$ as the output device.

When $V_{o}$ is reduced to 0 V , the load current is zero and $I_{c 2}=0$. This point corresponds to $I_{c 1}=\left|I_{C 3}\right|$, and all of the bias current in $Q_{3}$ passes through $D_{1}$ to $Q_{1}$. If $I_{c 1}$ is increased further, $V_{o}$ stays constant at 0 V while $V_{2}$ is reduced to 0 V also. Therefore, $V_{1}$ is negative by an amount equal to the diode voltage drop of $D_{1}$, and thus power diode $D_{2}$ turns on. Since the current in $D_{1}$ is essentially fixed by $Q_{3}$, further increases in $I_{c 1}$ cause increasing current to flow through $D_{2}$. The negative half of the cycle consists of $Q_{1}$ acting as the output device and feeding $R_{L}$ through $D_{2}$. The maximum negative voltage occurs when $Q_{1}$ saturates and is

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{o}^{-}=-V_{C C}+V_{C E 1(\mathrm{sat})}+V_{d 2} \tag{5.89}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $V_{d 2}$ is the forward voltage drop across $D_{2}$.
The sequence just described gives rise to a highly nonlinear transfer characteristic, as shown in Fig. 5.23, where $V_{o}$ is plotted as a function of $I_{c 1}$ for convenience. When $V_{o}$ is positive, the current $I_{c 1}$ feeds into the base of $Q_{2}$ and the small-signal gain is

$$
\frac{\Delta V_{o}}{\Delta I_{c 1}} \simeq \frac{\Delta V_{2}}{\Delta I_{c 1}}=r_{o 1}\left\|r_{o 3}\right\|\left[r_{\pi 2}+\left(\beta_{2}+1\right) R_{L}\right]
$$

Figure 5.23 Transfer characteristic of the circuit of Fig. 5.22 from $I_{c 1}$ to $V_{o}$.
where the impedance of $D_{1}$ is assumed negligible. That is, the impedance at the base of $Q_{2}$ is equal to the parallel combination of the output resistances of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{3}$ and the input resistance of emitter follower $Q_{2}$.

When $V_{o}$ in Fig. 5.22 is negative, $I_{c 1}$ feeds $R_{L}$ directly and the small-signal gain is

$$
\frac{\Delta V_{o}}{\Delta I_{c 1}} \simeq r_{o 1} \| R_{L}
$$

where the impedance of $D_{2}$ is assumed negligible.
Note the small deadband in Fig. 5.23 where diode $D_{2}$ turns on. This deadband can be eliminated by adding a second diode in series with $D_{1}$. In practice, negative feedback must be used around this circuit to linearize the transfer characteristic, and such feedback will reduce any crossover effects. The transfer characteristic of the circuit from $V_{i}$ to $V_{o}$ is even more nonlinear than shown in Fig. 5.23 because it includes the exponential nonlinearity of $Q_{1}$.

In integrated-circuit fabrication of the circuit of Fig. 5.22, devices $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ are identical large-power transistors. In high-power circuits (delivering several watts or more), they may occupy 50 percent of the whole die. Diode $D_{2}$ is a large-power diode that also occupies considerable area. These features are illustrated in Fig. 5.24, which is a die photo of the 791 high-power op amp. This circuit can dissipate 10 W of power and can deliver 15 W of output power into an $8-\Omega$ load. The large power transistors in the output stage can be seen on the right-hand side of the die.

Finally, the power and efficiency results derived previously for the complementary Class B stage apply equally to the all- $\boldsymbol{n p n}$ Class B stage if allowance is made for the voltage drop in $D_{2}$. Thus the ideal maximum efficiency is 79 percent.

### 5.4.5 Quasi-Complementary Output Stages ${ }^{10}$

The all-npn stage described above is one solution to the problem of the limited power-handling capability of the substrate pnp. Another solution is shown in Fig. 5.25, where a composite pnp has been made from a lateral pnp $Q_{3}$ and a high-power $n p n$ transistor $Q_{4}$. This circuit is called a quasi-complementary output stage.

The operation of the circuit of Fig. 5.25 is almost identical to that of Fig. 5.20. The pair $Q_{3}-Q_{4}$ is equivalent to a $p n p$ transistor as shown in Fig. 5.26, and the collector current of $Q_{3}$ is

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{C 3}=-I_{S} \exp \left(-\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}\right) \tag{5.90}
\end{equation*}
$$

The composite collector current $I_{C}$ is the emitter current of $Q_{4}$, which is

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{C}=\left(\beta_{F 4}+1\right) I_{C 3}=-\left(\beta_{F 4}+1\right) I_{S} \exp \left(-\frac{V_{B E}}{V_{T}}\right) \tag{5.91}
\end{equation*}
$$

The composite device thus shows the standard relationship between $I_{C}$ and $V_{B E}$ for a pnp transistor. However, most of the current is carried by the high-power npn transistor. Note that the magnitude of the saturation voltage of the composite device is $\left(\left|V_{C E 3 \text { (sat) }}\right|+V_{B E 4}\right)$. This

Figure 5.27 Compound high-current PMOS connection.
magnitude is higher than normal because saturation occurs when $Q_{3}$ saturates, and $V_{B E 4}$ must be added to this voltage.

The major problem with the configuration of Fig. 5.25 is potential instability of the local feedback loop formed by $Q_{3}$ and $Q_{4}$, particularly with capacitive loads on the amplifier. The stability of feedback loops is considered in Chapter 9 .

The quasi-complementary Class B stage can also be effectively implemented in BiCMOS technology. In the circuit of Fig. 5.25, the compound bipolar device $Q_{3}-Q_{4}$ can be replaced by the MOS-bipolar combination ${ }^{11}$ of Fig. 5.27, where $Q_{4}$ is a large-area high-current bipolar device. The overall transfer characteristic is

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{D}=\left(\beta_{F 4}+1\right) I_{D 3}=-\left(\beta_{F 4}+1\right) \frac{\mu_{n} C_{o x}}{2}\left(\frac{W}{L}\right)_{3}\left(V_{G S}-V_{t}\right)^{2} \tag{5.92}
\end{equation*}
$$

Equation 5.92 shows that the composite PMOS device appears to have a $W / L$ ratio $\left(\beta_{F 4}+1\right)$ times larger than the physical PMOS device $M_{3}$. With this circuit, one of the diodes $Q_{5}$ or $Q_{6}$ in Fig. 5.25 would now be replaced by a diode-connected PMOS transistor to set up a temperature-stable standby current in the output stage. A bias bleed resistor can be connected from the base to the emitter of $Q_{4}$ to optimize the bias current in $M_{3}$ and to speed up the turnoff of $Q_{4}$ in high-frequency applications by allowing reverse base current to remove the base charge. Such a resistor can also be connected from the base to the emitter of $Q_{4}$ in Fig. 5.25.

### 5.4.6 Overload Protection

The most common type of overload protection in integrated-circuit output stages is short-circuit current protection. As an example, consider the 741 output stage shown in Fig. 5.28 with partial short-circuit protection included. Initially assume that $R_{6}=0$ and ignore $Q_{15}$. The maximum positive drive delivered to the output stage occurs for $V_{i}$ large positive. If $R_{L}=0$ then $V_{o}$ is held at zero volts and $V_{a}$ in Fig. 5.28 is equal to $V_{b e 14}$. Thus, as $V_{i}$ is taken positive, $Q_{23}, Q_{18}$, and $Q_{19}$ will cut off and all of the current of $Q_{13 \mathrm{~A}}$ is fed to $Q_{14}$. If this is a high- $\beta_{F}$ device, then the output current can become destructively large:

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{c 14}=\beta_{F 14}\left|I_{C 13 \mathrm{~A}}\right| \tag{5.93}
\end{equation*}
$$

If

$$
\beta_{F 14}=500
$$

then

$$
I_{c 14}=500 \times 0.22=110 \mathrm{~mA}
$$

Figure 5.28 Schematic of the 741 op amp showing partial short-circuit protection.

If $V_{C C}=15 \mathrm{~V}$, this current level gives a power dissipation in $Q_{14}$ of

$$
P_{c 14}=V_{c e} I_{c}=15 \times 110 \mathrm{~mW}=1.65 \mathrm{~W}
$$

which is sufficient to destroy the device. Thus the current under short-circuit conditions must be limited, and this objective is achieved using $R_{6}$ and $Q_{15}$ for positive $V_{o}$.

The short-circuit protection operates by sensing the output current with resistor $R_{6}$ of about $25 \Omega$. The voltage developed across $R_{6}$ is the base-emitter voltage of $Q_{15}$, which is normally off. When the current through $R_{6}$ reaches about 20 mA (the maximum safe level), $Q_{15}$ begins to conduct appreciably and diverts any further drive away from the base of $Q_{14}$. The drive current is thus harmlessly passed to the output instead of being multiplied by the $\beta_{F}$ of $Q_{14}$.

The operation of this circuit can be seen by calculating the transfer characteristic of $Q_{14}$ when driving a short-circuit load. This can be done using Fig. 5.29.

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{i} & =I_{b 14}+I_{c 15}  \tag{5.94}\\
I_{c 15} & =I_{S 15} \exp \frac{V_{b e 15}}{V_{T}} \tag{5.95}
\end{align*}
$$

Also

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{b e 15} \simeq I_{c 14} R \tag{5.96}
\end{equation*}
$$

From (5.94)

$$
I_{b 14}=I_{i}-I_{c 15}
$$

But

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{c 14}=\beta_{F 14} I_{b 14}=\beta_{F 14}\left(I_{i}-I_{c 15}\right) \tag{5.97}
\end{equation*}
$$

Figure 5.30 Transfer characteristic of the circuit of Fig. 5.29 with and without protection transistor $Q_{15}\left(\beta_{F 14}=500\right)$.

Substitution of (5.95) and (5.96) in (5.97) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{c 14}+\beta_{F 14} I_{S 15} \exp \frac{I_{c 14} R}{V_{T}}=\beta_{F 14} I_{i} \tag{5.98}
\end{equation*}
$$

The second term on the left side of (5.98) stems from $Q_{15}$. If this term is negligible, then $I_{c 14}=\beta_{F 14} I_{i}$ as expected. The transfer characteristic of the stage is plotted from (5.98) in Fig. 5.30, using $\beta_{F 14}=500, I_{S 15}=10^{-14} \mathrm{~A}$, and $R=25 \Omega$. For a maximum drive of $I_{i}=0.22 \mathrm{~mA}$, the value of $I_{c 14}$ is effectively limited to 24 mA . For values of $I_{c 14}$ below $20 \mathrm{~mA}, Q_{15}$ has little effect on circuit operation.

Similar protection for negative output voltages in Fig. 5.29 is achieved by sensing the voltage across $R_{7}$ and diverting the base drive away from one of the preceding stages.

## 5.5 CMOS Class AB Output Stages

The classical Class AB topology of Fig. 5.13 can also be implemented in standard CMOS technology. However, the output swing of the resulting circuit is usually much worse than in the bipolar case. Although the swing can be improved using a common-source configuration, this circuit suffers from poor control of the quiescent current in the output devices. These issues are described below.

### 5.5.1 Common-Drain Configuration

Figure 5.31 shows the common-drain Class AB output configuration. From KVL,

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{S G 5}+V_{G S 4}=V_{g s 1}+V_{s g 2} \tag{5.99}
\end{equation*}
$$

Ignoring the body effect, $V_{S G 5}+V_{G S 4}$ is constant if the bias current from $M_{3}$ is constant. Under these conditions, increasing $V_{g s 1}$ decreases $V_{s g 2}$ and vice versa.

For simplicity, assume at first that a short circuit is connected from the drain of $M_{4}$ to the drain of $M_{5}$. Then $V_{S G 5}+V_{G S 4}=0$ and $V_{g s 1}=V_{g s 2}$ from (5.99). For $M_{1}$ to conduct nonzero drain current, $V_{g s 1}>V_{t 1}$ is required. Similarly, $V_{g s 2}<V_{t 2}$ is required for $M_{2}$ to conduct nonzero drain current. With standard enhancement-mode devices, $V_{t 1}>0$ and $V_{t 2}<0$. Therefore, $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ do not both conduct simultaneously under these conditions, which is a characteristic of a Class B output stage. When $V_{o}>0, M_{1}$ operates as a source follower and $M_{2}$ is off. Similarly, $M_{2}$ operates as a source follower and $M_{1}$ is off when $V_{o}<0$.

In Fig. 5.31, however, $V_{S G 5}+V_{G S 4}>0$ and both $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ are biased to conduct nonzero drain current when $V_{o}=0$, which is a characteristic of a Class AB output stage. If $V_{t 1}=V_{t 4}$ and $V_{t 2}=V_{t 5}$, using (1.157) in (5.99) with $I_{D 5}=-I_{D 4}$ gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\sqrt{\frac{2 I_{D 4}}{k_{p}^{\prime}(W / L)_{5}}}+\sqrt{\frac{2 I_{D 4}}{k_{n}^{\prime}(W / L)_{4}}}=\sqrt{\frac{2 I_{d 1}}{k_{n}^{\prime}(W / L)_{1}}}+\sqrt{\frac{2\left|I_{d 2}\right|}{k_{p}^{\prime}(W / L)_{2}}} \tag{5.100}
\end{equation*}
$$

If $V_{o}=0$, then $I_{d 2}=-I_{d 1}$ and (5.100) can be rearranged to give

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{D 1}=I_{D 4} \frac{\left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{k_{n}^{\prime}(W / L)_{4}}}+\sqrt{\frac{1}{k_{p}^{\prime}(W / L)_{5}}}\right)^{2}}{\left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{k_{n}^{\prime}(W / L)_{1}}}+\sqrt{\frac{1}{k_{p}^{\prime}(W / L)_{2}}}\right)^{2}} \tag{5.101}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $I_{D 1}=I_{d 1}$ with $V_{o}=0$. The key point of this equation is that the quiescent current in the output transistors is well controlled with respect to the bias current that flows in the diode-connected transistors, as in the bipolar case.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_69320962b1b525ebcc55g-080.jpg?height=700&width=716&top_left_y=1574&top_left_x=272)

Figure 5.31 Complementary sourcefollower CMOS output stage based on traditional bipolar implementation.

An important problem with this circuit is that its output swing can be much less than the corresponding bipolar circuit with equal supply voltages. For $V_{o}>0, V_{g s 1}>V_{t 1}$ and $M_{1}$ acts as a source follower. Therefore,

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{o}=V_{D D}-V_{s d 3}-V_{g s 1} \tag{5.102}
\end{equation*}
$$

The minimum $V_{s d 3}$ required to operate $M_{3}$ as a current source is $\left|V_{o v 3}\right|=\left|V_{G S 3}-V_{t 3}\right|$. From (5.102), the maximum output voltage $V_{o}^{+}$is

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{o}^{+}=V_{D D}-\left|V_{o v 3}\right|-V_{g s 1} \tag{5.103}
\end{equation*}
$$

The minimum output voltage can be found by similar reasoning. (See Problem 5.21.) Although (5.103) appears to be quite similar to (5.81) if $V_{C C}$ in Fig. 5.20 is equal to $V_{D D}$ in Fig. 5.31, the limit in (5.103) is usually much less than in (5.81) for three reasons. First, the gate-source voltage includes a threshold component that is absent in the base-emitter voltage. Second, the body effect increases the threshold voltage $V_{t 1}$ as $V_{o}$ increases. Finally, the overdrive part of the gate-source voltage rises more steeply with increasing current than the entire base-emitter voltage because the overdrive is proportional to the square root of the current and the baseemitter voltage is proportional to the logarithm of the current. In practice, the output voltage swing can be increased by increasing the $W / L$ ratios of the output devices to reduce their overdrives. However, the required transistor sizes are sometimes so large that the parasitic capacitances associated with the output devices can dominate the overall performance at high frequencies. Thus the circuit of Fig. 5.31 is generally limited to much smaller currents than its bipolar equivalent.

#### EXAMPLE

An output stage such as shown in Fig. 5.31 is required to produce a maximum output voltage of 0.7 V with $R_{L}=35 \Omega$ and $V_{D D}=V_{S S}=1.5 \mathrm{~V}$. Using the transistor parameters in Table 2.4, find the required $W / L$ of $M_{1}$. Assume $\left|V_{o v 3}\right|=100 \mathrm{mV}$, and ignore the body effect.

From (5.103),

$$
V_{g s 1}=V_{D D}-\left|V_{o v 3}\right|-V_{o}^{+}=(1.5-0.1-0.7) \mathrm{V}=0.7 \mathrm{~V}
$$

Since Table 2.4 gives $V_{t 1}=0.6 \mathrm{~V}$,

$$
V_{o v 1}=V_{g s 1}-V_{t 1}=(0.7-0.6) \mathrm{V}=0.1 \mathrm{~V}
$$

With $V_{o}=0.7 \mathrm{~V}$, the current in the load is $(0.7 \mathrm{~V}) /(35 \Omega)=20 \mathrm{~mA}$. If $I_{d 2}=0$ under these conditions, $I_{d 1}=20 \mathrm{~mA}$. Rearranging (1.157) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left(\frac{W}{L}\right)_{1}=\frac{2 I}{k_{n}^{\prime} V_{o v 1}{ }^{2}}=\frac{2(20000)}{194(0.1)^{2}} \simeq 20,000 \tag{5.104}
\end{equation*}
$$

which is a very large transistor.

### 5.5.2 Common-Source Configuration with Error Amplifiers

Another alternative is the use of quasi-complementary configurations. In this case, a common-source transistor together with an error amplifier replaces an output source-follower device. A circuit with this substitution for both output transistors is shown conceptually in Fig. 5.32. ${ }^{12,13,14}$ The combination of the error amplifier and the common-source device mimics the behavior of a source follower with high dc transconductance. The function of the amplifiers is to sense the voltage difference between the input and the output of the stage and drive the gates of the output transistors so as to make the difference as small as possible. This
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_69320962b1b525ebcc55g-082.jpg?height=1112&width=921&top_left_y=199&top_left_x=265)

Figure 5.32 A complementary Class AB output stage using embedded common-source output devices.

Figure 5.33 Small-signal model of the output stage in Fig. 5.32 used to find $R_{0}$.
operation can be viewed as negative feedback. A key advantage of the use of negative feedback here is that it reduces the output resistance. Since negative feedback is covered in Chapter 8 , we will analyze this structure with straightforward circuit analysis.

To find the output resistance, consider the small-signal model of this output stage shown in Fig. 5.33. The current $i_{t}$ is

$$
\begin{equation*}
i_{t}=\frac{v_{t}}{r_{o 1}}+\frac{v_{t}}{r_{o 2}}+g_{m 1} A v_{t}+g_{m 2} A v_{t} \tag{5.105}
\end{equation*}
$$

Rearranging this equation to solve for $v_{t} / i_{t}$ gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{o}=\left.\frac{v_{t}}{i_{t}}\right|_{v_{i}=0}=\frac{1}{\left(g_{m 1}+g_{m 2}\right) A}\left\|r_{o 1}\right\| r_{o 2} \tag{5.106}
\end{equation*}
$$

This equation shows that increasing the gain $A$ of the error amplifiers reduces $R_{o}$ and that $R_{o}$ is much less than the drain-source resistance of $M_{1}$ or $M_{2}$ because of the negative feedback.

To find the transfer characteristic, consider the dc model of the output stage shown in Fig. 5.34. The model includes the input-referred offset voltages of the error amplifiers as voltage sources. Assume $k_{p}^{\prime}(W / L)_{1}=k_{n}^{\prime}(W / L)_{2}=k^{\prime}(W / L)$ and $-V_{t 1}=V_{t 2}=V_{t}$. Also assume that the error amplifiers are designed so that $-I_{D 1}=I_{D 2}=I_{Q}$ when $V_{i}=0, V_{O S P}=0$, and $V_{O S N}=0$. Under these conditions, $V_{o}=0$ and

$$
\begin{align*}
& V_{g s 1}=-V_{t}-V_{o v}  \tag{5.107}\\
& V_{g s 2}=V_{t}+V_{o v} \tag{5.108}
\end{align*}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_69320962b1b525ebcc55g-083.jpg?height=455&width=926&top_left_y=209&top_left_x=265)

Figure 5.34 A dc model of the output stage in Fig. 5.32 used to find the transfer characteristic.
where

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{o v}=\sqrt{\frac{2 I_{Q}}{k^{\prime}(W / L)}} \tag{5.109}
\end{equation*}
$$

With nonzero input and offsets, the output may not be zero. As a result, the differential input to the top error amplifier changes from zero to $V_{o}-\left(V_{i}-V_{O S P}\right)$. Similarly, the differential input to the bottom error amplifier changes from zero to $V_{o}-\left(V_{i}-V_{O S N}\right)$. Assuming that the output of each error amplifier changes by its gain $A$ times the change in its input,

$$
\begin{align*}
& V_{g s 1}=-V_{t}-V_{o v}+A\left[V_{o}-\left(V_{i}-V_{O S P}\right)\right]  \tag{5.110}\\
& V_{g s 2}=V_{t}+V_{o v}+A\left[V_{o}-\left(V_{i}-V_{O S N}\right)\right] \tag{5.111}
\end{align*}
$$

If $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ operate in the active region,

$$
\begin{gather*}
I_{d 1}=-\frac{k_{p}^{\prime}}{2}\left(\frac{W}{L}\right)_{1}\left(V_{g s 1}-V_{t 1}\right)^{2}=-\frac{k^{\prime}}{2} \frac{W}{L}\left(V_{g s 1}+V_{t}\right)^{2}  \tag{5.112}\\
I_{d 2}=\frac{k_{n}^{\prime}}{2}\left(\frac{W}{L}\right)_{2}\left(V_{g s 2}-V_{t 2}\right)^{2}=\frac{k^{\prime}}{2} \frac{W}{L}\left(V_{g s 2}-V_{t}\right)^{2} \tag{5.113}
\end{gather*}
$$

Also,

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{o}=\frac{V_{o}}{R_{L}} \tag{5.114}
\end{equation*}
$$

From KCL at the output,

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{o}+I_{d 1}+I_{d 2}=0 \tag{5.115}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substituting (5.110)-(5.114) into (5.115) and rearranging gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{o}=\frac{V_{i}-\frac{V_{O S P}+V_{O S N}}{2}}{1+\frac{1}{k^{\prime} \frac{W}{L} A\left[2 V_{o v}-A\left(V_{O S P}-V_{O S N}\right)\right] R_{L}}} \tag{5.116}
\end{equation*}
$$

If $V_{O S P}=V_{O S N}=0$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{o}=\frac{V_{i}}{1+\frac{1}{k^{\prime} \frac{W}{L} A 2 V_{o v} R_{L}}}=\frac{V_{i}}{1+\frac{1}{2 A g_{m} R_{L}}} \simeq V_{i}\left(1-\frac{1}{2 A g_{m} R_{L}}\right) \tag{5.117}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $g_{m}=k^{\prime}(W / L) V_{o v}$ as shown in (1.180). The term $\left(2 A g_{m} R_{L}\right)$ is the gain around the feedback loop or the loop gain and is usually chosen to be high enough to make the slope of the transfer characteristic to be unity within an allowable gain error. (The concept of loop gain is described in Chapter 8.) The gain error here is approximately $1 /\left(2 A g_{m} R_{L}\right)$. The key point is that the error is reduced if $A, g_{m}$, or $R_{L}$ are increased.

With nonzero offsets, (5.116) shows that the circuit also displays an offset error. If $A\left(V_{O S P}-V_{O S N}\right) \ll 2 V_{o v}$ and $2 A g_{m} R_{L} \gg 1$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{o} \simeq \frac{V_{i}-\frac{V_{O S P}+V_{O S N}}{2}}{1+\frac{1}{k^{\prime} \frac{W}{L} A 2 V_{O V} R_{L}}}=\frac{V_{i}-\frac{V_{O S P}+V_{O S N}}{2}}{1+\frac{1}{2 A g_{m} R_{L}}} \simeq V_{i}-\frac{V_{O S P}+V_{O S N}}{2} \tag{5.118}
\end{equation*}
$$

Therefore, the input offset voltage of the buffer is about $-\left(V_{O S P}+V_{O S N}\right) / 2$.
Equation 5.116 is valid as long as both $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ operate in the active region. If the magnitude of the output voltage is large enough, however, one of the two output transistors turns off. For example, when $V_{i}$ increases, $V_{o}$ also increases but the gain is slightly less than unity. As a result, the differential inputs to the error amplifiers both decrease, decreasing $V_{g s 1}$ and $V_{g s 2}$. In turn, these changes increase $\left|I_{d 1}\right|$ but reduce $I_{d 2}$, and $M_{2}$ turns off for large enough $V_{i}$. To find the portion of the transfer characteristic with $M_{1}$ in the active region but $M_{2}$ off, the above analysis can be repeated with $I_{d 2}=0$. See Problem 5.23.

The primary motivation for using the quasi-complementary configuration is to increase the output swing. If the output transistors are not allowed to operate in the triode region, the output voltage can pull within an overdrive of either supply. This result is an improvement compared to the limit given in (5.103) for the common-drain output stage mostly because the threshold voltages of the output transistors do not limit the output swing in the common-source configuration.

Although quasi-complementary circuits improve the output swing, they suffer from two main problems. First, the error amplifiers must have large bandwidth to prevent crossover distortion problems for high input frequencies. Unfortunately, increasing the bandwidth of the error amplifiers worsens the stability margins, especially in the presence of large capacitive loads. As a result, these circuits present difficult design problems in compensation. The topics of stability and compensation are covered in Chapter 9. Second, nonzero offset voltages in the error amplifiers change the quiescent current flowing in the output transistors. From a design standpoint, the quiescent current is chosen to be barely high enough to limit crossover distortion to an acceptable level. Although further increases in the quiescent current reduce the crossover distortion, such increases also increase the power dissipation and reduce the output swing. Therefore, proper control of the quiescent current with nonzero offsets is also a key design constraint.

One way to control the quiescent current is to sense and feedback a copy of the current. ${ }^{12}$ This method is not considered further here. Another way to limit the variation in the quiescent current is to design the error amplifiers to have low gain. ${ }^{13,14}$ The concept is that the quiescent current is controlled by the gate-source voltages on the output transistors, which in turn are controlled by the outputs of the error amplifiers. Therefore, reducing the error-amplifier gain reduces the variation of gate-source voltages and the quiescent current for a given variation in the offset voltages.

To study this situation quantitatively, define the quiescent current in the output devices as the common-mode component of the current flowing from $V_{D D}$ to $-V_{S S}$ with $V_{i}=0$. Then

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{Q}=\frac{I_{D 2}-I_{D 1}}{2} \tag{5.119}
\end{equation*}
$$

Subtraction is used in the above equation because the drain current of each transistor is defined as positive when it flows into the transistor. Substituting (5.110)-(5.113) into (5.119) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{Q}=\frac{k^{\prime}}{4} \frac{W}{L}\left(\left(V_{o v}+A\left[V_{o}+V_{O S N}\right]\right)^{2}+\left(-V_{o v}+A\left[V_{o}+V_{O S P}\right]\right)^{2}\right) \tag{5.120}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since $V_{o}=0$ if $V_{O S P}=V_{O S N}=0,(5.120)$ shows that

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left.I_{Q}\right|_{\substack{V_{O S P}=0 \\ V_{O S N}=0}}=\frac{k^{\prime}}{4} \frac{W}{L}\left(\left(V_{o v}\right)^{2}+\left(-V_{o v}\right)^{2}\right)=\frac{k^{\prime}}{2} \frac{W}{L}\left(V_{o v}\right)^{2} \tag{5.121}
\end{equation*}
$$

From (5.118) with $V_{i}=0$,

$$
\begin{align*}
& V_{o}+V_{O S P} \simeq \frac{V_{O S P}-V_{O S N}}{2}  \tag{5.122}\\
& V_{o}+V_{O S N} \simeq-\frac{V_{O S P}-V_{O S N}}{2} \tag{5.123}
\end{align*}
$$

Substituting (5.122) and (5.123) into (5.120) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{Q}=\frac{k^{\prime}}{2} \frac{W}{L}\left(V_{o v}-A\left[\frac{V_{O S P}-V_{O S N}}{2}\right]\right)^{2} \tag{5.124}
\end{equation*}
$$

Define $\Delta I_{Q}$ as the change in $I_{Q}$ caused by nonzero offsets; that is,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta I_{Q}=\left.I_{Q}\right|_{\substack{V_{O S P}=0 \\ V_{O S N}=0}}-I_{Q} \tag{5.125}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substituting (5.124) and (5.121) into (5.125) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta I_{Q}=\frac{k^{\prime}}{2} \frac{W}{L} A\left(V_{O S P}-V_{O S N}\right)\left[V_{o v}-A\left(\frac{V_{O S P}-V_{O S N}}{4}\right)\right] \tag{5.126}
\end{equation*}
$$

To evaluate the magnitude of $\Delta I_{Q}$, we will compare it to the quiescent current with zero offsets by dividing ( 5.126 ) by (5.121). The result is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\Delta I_{Q}}{\left.I_{Q}\right|_{\substack{V O S P=0 \\ V_{O S N}=0}}}=A\left(\frac{V_{O S P}-V_{O S N}}{V_{o v}}\right)\left[1-A\left(\frac{V_{O S P}-V_{O S N}}{4 V_{o v}}\right)\right] \tag{5.127}
\end{equation*}
$$

If $A\left(V_{O S P}-V_{O S N}\right) \ll 4 V_{o v}$,

Therefore, to keep the fractional change in the quiescent current less than a given amount, the maximum error-amplifier gain is

$$
\begin{equation*}
A<\left(\frac{V_{o v}}{V_{O S P}-V_{O S N}}\right)\left(\frac{\Delta I_{Q}}{\left.I_{Q}\right|_{\substack{V_{O S P}=0 \\ V_{O S N}=0}}}\right) \tag{5.129}
\end{equation*}
$$

For example, if $V_{o v}=200 \mathrm{mV}, V_{O S P}-V_{O S N}=5 \mathrm{mV}$, and up to 20 percent variation in the quiescent current is allowed, (5.129) shows that the error amplifier gain should be less than about $8 .{ }^{13,14}$

Figure 5.35 shows a schematic of the top error amplifier and $M_{1}$ from Fig. 5.32. ${ }^{14} \mathrm{~A}$ complementary structure used to drive $M_{2}$ is not shown. The difference between $V_{i}$ and $V_{o}$ is sensed by the differential pair $M_{11}$ and $M_{12}$, which is biased by the tail current source $I_{\text {TAIL }}$. The load of the differential pair consists of two parts: current mirror $M_{13}$ and $M_{14}$ and commondrain transistors $M_{15}$ and $M_{16}$. The purpose of the common-drain transistors is to reduce the

output resistance of the error amplifier to set its gain to a well-defined low value. The gates of the common-drain transistors are biased by a negative feedback loop including $M_{13}, M_{17}, I_{\mathrm{BIAS}}$, and $M_{15}$. This circuit adjusts the voltage at the gate of $M_{15}$ so that $M_{17}$ operates in the active region and conducts $I_{\text {BIAS }}$. Although negative feedback is studied in Chapter 8 , the basic idea can be understood here as follows. If $\left|I_{D 17}\right|$ is less than $I_{\mathrm{BIAS}}$, current source $I_{\mathrm{BIAS}}$ pulls the gate voltage of $M_{15}$ down. Since $M_{15}$ operates as a source follower, the source of $M_{15}$ is pulled down, increasing $\left|I_{D 13}\right|$. Because $M_{13}$ and $M_{17}$ together form a current mirror, $\left|I_{D 17}\right|$ also increases until $\left|I_{D 17}\right|=I_{\text {BIAS }}$. Similar reasoning shows that this equality is established when $\left|I_{D 17}\right|$ is initially greater than $I_{\text {BIAS }}$. If $M_{15}$ and $M_{17}$ are enhancement-mode devices, $M_{17}$ operates in the active region because $V_{G D 17}=V_{S G 15}=\left|V_{t 15}\right|+\left|V_{o v 15}\right|>0>V_{t 17}$; therefore, the channel does not exist at the drain of $M_{17}$.

Since $M_{13}$ and $M_{17}$ form a current mirror,

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{D 13}=I_{D 17} \frac{(W / L)_{13}}{(W / L)_{17}}=-I_{\mathrm{BIAS}} \frac{(W / L)_{13}}{(W / L)_{17}} \tag{5.130}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since $M_{13}$ and $M_{14}$ also form a current mirror, and since $(W / L)_{14}=(W / L)_{13}$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{D 14}=I_{D 13}=-I_{\mathrm{BIAS}} \frac{(W / L)_{13}}{(W / L)_{17}} \tag{5.131}
\end{equation*}
$$

With $V_{i}=V_{o}$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{D 11}=I_{D 12}=\frac{I_{\mathrm{TAIL}}}{2} \tag{5.132}
\end{equation*}
$$

From KCL,

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{D 16}=I_{D 14}+I_{D 11} \tag{5.133}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substituting (5.131) and (5.132) into (5.133) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{D 16}=-I_{\mathrm{BIAS}} \frac{(W / L)_{13}}{(W / L)_{17}}+\frac{I_{\mathrm{TAIL}}}{2} \tag{5.134}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since $I_{D 15}=I_{D 16}$ when $I_{D 11}=I_{D 12}$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{S D 14}=V_{S D 13}=V_{S G 13}=V_{S G 1} \tag{5.135}
\end{equation*}
$$

Therefore, ignoring channel-length modulation,

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{D 1}=I_{D 13} \frac{(W / L)_{1}}{(W / L)_{13}} \tag{5.136}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substituting (5.130) into (5.136) and rearranging gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{D 1}=-I_{\mathrm{BIAS}} \frac{(W / L)_{1}}{(W / L)_{17}} \tag{5.137}
\end{equation*}
$$

This equation shows that the drain current in $M_{1}$ is controlled by $I_{\text {BIAS }}$ and a ratio of transistor sizes if the offset voltage of the error amplifier is zero so that $V_{o}=0$ when $V_{i}=0$. In practice, $(W / L)_{1} \gg(W / L)_{17}$ so that little power is dissipated in the bias circuits.

Another design consideration comes out of these equations. To keep the gain of the error amplifier low under all conditions, $M_{16}$ must never cut off. Therefore, from (5.133), $\left|I_{D 14}\right|$ should be greater than the maximum value of $I_{D 11}$. Since the maximum value of $I_{D 11}$ is $I_{\text {TAIL }}$, (5.131) and (5.133) show that

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|I_{D 14}\right|=I_{\mathrm{BIAS}} \frac{(W / L)_{13}}{(W / L)_{17}}>I_{\mathrm{TAIL}} \tag{5.138}
\end{equation*}
$$

To find the gain of the error amplifier, the key observation is that the small-signal resistance looking into the source of of $M_{15}$ is zero, ignoring channel-length modulation. This result stems from the operation of the same negative feedback loop that biases the gate of $M_{15}$. If the small-signal voltage at the source of $M_{15}$ changes, the negative feedback loop works to undo the change. For example, suppose that the source voltage of $M_{15}$ increases. This change reduces the gate voltage of $M_{15}$ because $M_{17}$ operates as a common-source amplifier. Then the source voltage of $M_{15}$ falls because $M_{15}$ operates as a source follower. Ignoring channel-length modulation, the source voltage of $M_{15}$ must be held exactly constant because $i_{d 17}=0$ if $I_{\text {BIAS }}$ is constant. Therefore, the small-signal resistance looking into the source of $M_{15}$ is zero. As a result, none of the small-signal drain current from $M_{12}$ flows in $M_{13}$. Instead, it all flows in the source of $M_{15}$. To calculate the transconductance of the error amplifier, the output at the drain of $M_{16}$ is connected to a small-signal ground. Since $M_{15}$ and $M_{16}$ share the same gate connection, and since their sources each operate at small-signal grounds, the small-signal current in $M_{15}$ is copied to $M_{16}$. Therefore, the entire small-signal current from the differential pair flows at the error-amplifier output and the transconductance is

$$
\begin{equation*}
G_{m}=g_{m 11}=g_{m 12} \tag{5.139}
\end{equation*}
$$

Ignoring channel-length modulation, the output resistance is set by common-drain transistor $M_{16}$. From (3.84),

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{o}=\frac{1}{g_{m 16}+g_{m b 16}} \tag{5.140}
\end{equation*}
$$

Therefore, the gain of the error amplifier is

$$
\begin{equation*}
A=G_{m} R_{o}=\frac{g_{m 11}}{g_{m 16}+g_{m b 16}} \tag{5.141}
\end{equation*}
$$

### 5.5.3 Alternative Configurations

The main potential advantage of the common-source output stage described in the last section is that it can increase the output swing compared to the common-drain case. However, the common-source configuration suffers from an increase in harmonic distortion, especially at high frequencies, for two main reasons. First, the bandwidth of the error amplifiers is usually limited, to avoid stability problems. Second, the gain of these amplifiers is limited to establish adequate control on the quiescent output current.

#### 5.5.3.1 Combined Common-Drain Common-Source Configuration

One way to overcome this problem is to use a combination of the common-drain and commonsource configurations shown in Fig. 5.31 and Fig. 5.32. ${ }^{15}$ The combined schematic is shown in Fig. 5.36. The key aspect of this circuit is that it uses two buffers connected to the output: a Class AB common-drain buffer ( $M_{1}-M_{2}$ ) and a Class B quasi-complementary common-source buffer ( $M_{11}-M_{12}$ and the error amplifiers $A$ ). The common-source buffer is dominant when the output swing is maximum, but off with zero output. On the other hand, the commondrain buffer controls the quiescent output current and improves the frequency response, as described next.

From KVL,

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{o}=V_{1}+V_{g s 4}-V_{g s 1} \tag{5.142}
\end{equation*}
$$

If $V_{t 1}=V_{t 4}$, this equation can be rewritten as

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{o}=V_{1}+V_{o v 4}-V_{o v 1} \tag{5.143}
\end{equation*}
$$

Therefore, when $V_{i}$ is adjusted so that $V_{1}=0, M_{1}-M_{5}$ force $V_{o}=0$ if $V_{o v 1}=V_{o v 4}$. From (1.166), $V_{o v 1}=V_{o v 4}$ if

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{I_{D 1}}{(W / L)_{1}}=\frac{I_{D 4}}{(W / L)_{4}} \tag{5.144}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substituting (5.101) into (5.144) and rearranging shows that $V_{o v 1}=V_{o v 4}$ if

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{(W / L)_{1}}{(W / L)_{2}}=\frac{(W / L)_{4}}{(W / L)_{5}} \tag{5.145}
\end{equation*}
$$

Figure 5.36 Combined common-drain, common-source output stage.

We will assume that this condition holds so that $V_{o}=0$ when $V_{1}=0$. In this case, $M_{11}$ and $M_{12}$ are designed to be cut off. This characteristic stems from small offsets designed into the error amplifiers. These offsets are shown as voltage sources $V_{O S}$ in Fig. 5.36 and can be introduced by intentionally mismatching the input differential pair in each error amplifier. With $V_{1}=V_{o}=0$ and $V_{O S}>0$, the error amplifiers are designed to give $V_{g s 11}>V_{t 11}$ and $V_{g s 12}<V_{t 12}$ so that $M_{11}$ and $M_{12}$ are off. As a result, the quiescent output current is controlled by the common-drain stage and its biasing circuit $M_{1}-M_{5}$, as shown in (5.101).

As $V_{i}$ decreases from the value that forces $V_{1}=0, V_{1}$ increases and $V_{o}$ follows but with less than unity gain if $R_{L}$ is finite. Therefore $V_{1}-V_{o}$ increases, and both $V_{g s 11}$ and $V_{g s 12}$ decrease, eventually turning on $M_{11}$ but keeping $M_{12}$ off. After $M_{11}$ turns on, both $I_{d 1}$ and $\left|I_{d 11}\right|$ increase as $V_{o}$ rises until $V_{g s 1}-V_{t 1}$ reaches its maximum value. Such a maximum occurs when the output swing from the common-source stage is greater than that of the common-drain stage. As $V_{o}$ rises beyond this point, $\left|I_{d 11}\right|$ increases but $I_{d 1}$ decreases, and the common-source stage becomes dominant.

From (5.103), the output swing allowed by the common-drain stage in Fig. 5.31 is limited in part by $V_{g s 1}$, which includes a threshold component. On the other hand, the output swing limitation of common-source stage in Fig. 5.32 does not include a threshold term, and this circuit can swing within an overdrive of the positive supply. So with proper design, we expect the common-source stage to have a larger output swing than the common-drain stage. When the two circuits are combined as in Fig. 5.36, however, the output swing is limited by the driver stage that produces $V_{1}$. Define $V_{1}^{+}$as the maximum value of $V_{1}$ for which $M_{3}$ operates in the active region. Then

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{1}^{+}=V_{D D}-\left|V_{o v 3}\right|-V_{g s 4} \tag{5.146}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since $V_{1}$ is the input to the common-source stage, the maximum output $V_{o}^{+}$can be designed to be

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{o}^{+} \simeq V_{1}^{+}=V_{D D}-\left|V_{o v 3}\right|-V_{g s 4} \tag{5.147}
\end{equation*}
$$

Comparing (5.147) with (5.103) shows that the positive swing of the combined output stage in Fig. 5.36 exceeds that of the common-drain output stage in Fig. 5.31 provided that $V_{g s 4}<V_{g s 1}$ when $V_{o}=V_{o}^{+}$. This condition is usually satisfied because $I_{d 4} \ll I_{d 1}$ when the output is maximum with finite $R_{L}$. Therefore, the circuit in Fig. 5.36 can be designed to increase the output swing.

Since the common-source stage in Fig. 5.36 is not responsible for establishing the quiescent output current, the gain of the error amplifiers in Fig. 5.36 is not limited as in (5.129). In practice, the error amplifiers are often designed as one-stage amplifiers with a gain related to the product of $g_{m}$ and $r_{o}$ that can be achieved in a given technology. This increase in gain reduces the harmonic distortion because it reduces the error between the input and the output of the common-source stage.

Finally, we will consider the frequency response of the circuit in Fig. 5.36 qualitatively. The circuit has two paths from $V_{1}$ to the output. The path through the common-source transistors $M_{11}$ and $M_{12}$ may be slow because of the need to limit the bandwidth of the error amplifiers to guarantee that the circuit is stable. (Stability is studied in Chapter 9.) On the other hand, the path through the common-drain transistors $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ is fast because source followers are high-bandwidth circuits, as shown in Chapter 7. Since the circuit sums the current from the common-drain and common-source stages in the load to produce the output voltage, the fast path will dominate for high-frequency signals. This technique is called feedforward, and other instances are described in Chapter 9. It causes the circuit to take on the characteristics of the source followers for high frequencies, reducing the phase shift that would otherwise be introduced by the slow error amplifiers. As a result, the design required
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_69320962b1b525ebcc55g-090.jpg?height=619&width=1136&top_left_y=208&top_left_x=349)

Figure 5.37 Combined common-drain, common-source output stage with improved swing.
to guarantee stability is simplified, ${ }^{15}$ and the harmonic distortion for high-frequency signals is reduced.

#### 5.5.3.2 Combined Common-Drain Common-Source Configuration with High Swing

Although the swing of the circuit in Fig. 5.36 is improved compared to the circuit in Fig. 5.31, it can be improved even further. As shown in (5.147), the main limitation to the positive swing in Fig. 5.36 stems from $V_{g s 4}$. This voltage includes a threshold component, which increases with increasing $V_{1}$ and $V_{o}$ because of the body effect. Similarly, the negative swing is limited by $V_{g s 5}$, whose threshold component increases in magnitude as $V_{1}$ and $V_{o}$ decrease. In practice, these terms alone reduce the available output swing by about 1.5 V to 2 V .

Figure 5.37 shows a circuit that overcomes this limitation. ${ }^{16}$ The circuit is the same as in Fig. 5.36 except that one extra branch is included. The new branch consists of transistors $M_{7}$ and $M_{8}$ and operates in parallel with the branch containing $M_{3}-M_{6}$ to produce voltage $V_{1}$. The swing of $V_{1}$ in Fig. 5.36 is limited by the threshold voltages of $M_{4}$ and $M_{5}$ as described above. In contrast, the new branch in Fig. 5.37 can drive $V_{1}$ within an overdrive of either supply while $M_{7}$ and $M_{8}$ operate in the active region. Since the output swing in Fig. 5.36 is limited by the swing of $V_{1}$, improving the swing of $V_{1}$ as in Fig. 5.37 also improves the output swing.

#### 5.5.3.3 Parallel Common-Source Configuration

Another circuit that overcomes the problem described in the introduction of Section 5.5.3 is shown in Fig. 5.38. ${ }^{17}$ Like the circuit in Fig. 5.37, this circuit combines two buffers in parallel at the output. The error amplifiers with gain $A_{1}$ along with $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ form one buffer, which controls the operation of the output stage with $V_{i}=0$. The error amplifiers with gain $A_{2}$ together with $M_{11}$ and $M_{12}$ form the other buffer, which dominates the operation of the output stage for large-magnitude output voltages.

This behavior stems from small offset voltages intentionally built into the $A_{1}$ amplifiers. These offsets are shown as voltage sources $V_{O S}$ in Fig. 5.38 and are introduced in practice by intentionally mismatching the input differential pairs in the $A_{1}$ amplifiers. At first, assume that these offsets have little effect on the drain currents of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ because $A_{1}$ is intentionally chosen to be small. Therefore, $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ operate in the active region when $V_{i}=0$, and the buffer that includes these transistors operates in a Class AB mode. On the other hand, the offsets force $M_{11}$ and $M_{12}$ to operate in cutoff when $V_{i}=0$ because the gates of these transistors

Figure 5.39 Schematic of the top $A_{1}$ amplifier and output transistor $M_{1}$.
are driven by the outputs of the $A_{2}$ amplifiers, which in turn are driven by the differential outputs of the $A_{1}$ amplifiers. In particular, the product $V_{O S} A_{1} A_{2}$ is chosen by design to be big enough to force $V_{g s 11}>V_{t 11}$ and $V_{g s 12}<V_{t 12}$ so that $M_{11}$ and $M_{12}$ are off when $V_{i}=0$. As a result, the quiescent output current of this output stage is controlled by $M_{1}, M_{2}$, and the $A_{1}$ amplifiers.

Figure 5.39 shows a schematic of the top $A_{1}$ amplifier and $M_{1}$ from Fig. 5.38. ${ }^{17}$ A complementary configuration is used for the bottom $A_{1}$ amplifier but is not shown for simplicity. The difference between $V_{i}$ and $V_{o}$ is sensed by the differential pair $M_{3}$ and $M_{4}$. The load of the differential pair consists of two parts: diode-connected transistors $M_{5}$ and $M_{6}$ and current sources $I_{\text {BIAS }}$, which are implemented by the outputs of $p$-channel current mirrors in practice. The purpose of the diode-connected transistors is to limit the gain of the error amplifier to a small value so that the output quiescent current is well controlled. Ignoring channel-length modulation, the gain of this error amplifier is

$$
\begin{equation*}
A_{1}=\frac{g_{m 3}}{g_{m 5}} \tag{5.148}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $A_{1}$ is the gain from the differential input to the differential output of the error amplifier. This equation shows that the gain is determined by the ratios of the transconductance of a differential-pair transistor to that of a load transistor. Substituting (1.180) into (5.148) for each transistor, and rearranging gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
A_{1}=\sqrt{\frac{k_{n}^{\prime}}{k_{p}^{\prime}} \frac{(W / L)_{3}}{(W / L)_{5}} \frac{I_{D 3}}{\left|I_{D 5}\right|}} \tag{5.149}
\end{equation*}
$$

This equation shows that the gain is determined by the product of the ratios of the transconductance parameters, the transistor sizes, and the bias currents. From KCL at the drain of $M_{5}$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
-I_{D 5}=I_{D 3}-I_{\mathrm{BIAS}} \tag{5.150}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $I_{D 3}>I_{\text {BIAS }}$. Substituting (5.150) into (5.149) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
A_{1}=\sqrt{\frac{k_{n}^{\prime}}{k_{p}^{\prime}} \frac{(W / L)_{3}}{(W / L)_{5}}\left(\frac{I_{D 3}}{I_{D 3}-I_{\mathrm{BIAS}}}\right)} \tag{5.151}
\end{equation*}
$$

This equation shows that the purpose of the $I_{\text {BIAS }}$ current sources is to allow the bias current in a transistor in the differential pair to exceed that in a diode-connected load. As a result, the term in parentheses in (5.151) is greater than unity and contributes to the required gain.

Now consider the effect of the offset $V_{O S}$ in Fig. 5.38. In practice, the offset is implemented in Fig. 5.39 by choosing the width of $M_{3}$ to be less than the width of $M_{4}$ by about 20 percent. ${ }^{17}$ Assume that $V_{o}=0$ when $V_{i}=0$. Increasing $V_{O S}$ reduces $I_{D 3}$, making $\left|I_{D 5}\right|$ less than the value given in (5.150). Since $M_{5}$ and $M_{1}$ form a current mirror, a positive offset reduces $\left|I_{D 1}\right|$. Under the assumption that $V_{o}=0$ when $V_{i}=0$, the differential pair in the error amplifier operates with $V_{g s 3}=V_{g s 4}$. Therefore, if $V_{t 3}=V_{t 4}, V_{o v 3}=V_{o v 4}$. From (1.166),

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{I_{D 3}}{(W / L)_{3}}=\frac{I_{D 4}}{(W / L)_{4}} \tag{5.152}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substituting $I_{D 3}+I_{D 4}=I_{\text {TAIL }}$ into (5.152) and rearranging gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{D 3}=\frac{(W / L)_{3}}{(W / L)_{3}+(W / L)_{4}} I_{\mathrm{TAIL}} \tag{5.153}
\end{equation*}
$$

when $V_{o}=V_{i}=0$. Similarly, a positive offset in the bottom $A_{1}$ amplifier as labeled in Fig. 5.38 reduces $I_{D 2}$. If the tail and bias current in the top $A_{1}$ amplifier are identical to the corresponding values in the bottom $A_{1}$ amplifier, and if the fractional mismatches in the differential pairs are identical, the reductions in $\left|I_{D 1}\right|$ and $I_{D 2}$ caused by the mismatches intentionally introduced into the differential pairs are equal and $V_{o}=0$ when $V_{i}=0$ is assumed. In other words, the offset of the entire output stage shown in Fig. 5.38 is zero even with nonzero $V_{O S}$ in the error amplifiers.

Because a design goal is to bias $M_{1}$ in the active region when $V_{i}=0$, the offset must be chosen to be small enough that $I_{D 3}>0$ when $V_{o}=V_{i}=0$. Also, the error amplifiers contain some unintentional mismatches stemming from random effects in practice. Because another design goal is to bias $M_{11}$ in cutoff, the random component must not be allowed to be larger than the systematic offset in magnitude and opposite in polarity. Therefore, $V_{O S}$ is chosen to be bigger than the expected random offset.

Since the quiescent output current is controlled by the $A_{1}$ error amplifiers along with $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$, the gain of the $A_{2}$ error amplifiers driving $M_{11}$ and $M_{12}$ need not be small. With large $A_{2}, M_{11}$ or $M_{12}$ becomes the dominant output device for large output magnitudes if the aspect ratios of $M_{11}$ and $M_{12}$ are at least as big as $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$, respectively. Furthermore, increasing $A_{2}$ has the advantage of increasing the loop gain when $M_{11}$ or $M_{12}$ turns on. This loop gain
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_69320962b1b525ebcc55g-093.jpg?height=628&width=856&top_left_y=235&top_left_x=263)

Figure 5.40 Schematic of the top $A_{2}$ amplifier.
is related to the product of $A_{2}, g_{m 11}$ or $g_{m 12}$, and $R_{L}$. Increasing the loop gain reduces the error between the input and output, as shown in Chapter 8. If $M_{11}$ conducts, increasing $A_{2}$ allows the output stage to drive reduced loads with constant $g_{m 11}$ and error. If the load is fixed, increasing $A_{2}$ allows the transconductance to be reduced, which in turn allows $(W / L)_{11}$ to be reduced. One potential concern here is that reducing the transistor sizes also reduces the range of outputs for which the devices operate in the active region. If $M_{11}$ operates in the triode region, its drain-source resistance $r_{o 11}$ is finite, and the loop gain is proportional to the product $A_{2} g_{m 11}\left(r_{o 11} \| R_{L}\right)$. Thus, operation of $M_{11}$ in the triode region increases the error by reducing $g_{m 11}$ and $r_{o 11}$. However, increasing $A_{2}$ compensates for this effect. Therefore, a key advantage of the output-stage configuration shown in Fig. 5.38 is that it allows the output swing with a given level of nonlinearity to be increased by allowing the dominant transistor to operate in the triode region.

The $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ amplifiers together form the two-stage error amplifiers that drive $M_{11}$ and $M_{12}$. The $A_{2}$ amplifiers operate on the differential outputs of the $A_{1}$ amplifiers. Since the common-mode components of the outputs of the $A_{1}$ amplifiers are well controlled by diode-connected loads, differential pairs are not required at the inputs of the $A_{2}$ amplifiers. Figure 5.40 shows a schematic of the top $A_{2}$ amplifier. ${ }^{17}$ A complementary configuration used for the bottom $A_{2}$ amplifier is not shown for simplicity. The inputs are applied to the gates of common-source transistors $M_{21}$ and $M_{22}$. The cascode current mirror $M_{23}-M_{26}$ then converts the differential signal into a single-ended output. Because the output resistance of the cascode-current mirror is large compared to the output resistance of the common-source transistor $M_{22}$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
A_{2} \simeq g_{m 22} r_{o 22} \tag{5.154}
\end{equation*}
$$

and $A_{2} \simeq 70$ in Ref. 17 .
To determine the range of input voltages for which $M_{11}$ and $M_{12}$ are both off, let $V_{g 11}$ represent the voltage from the gate of $M_{11}$ to ground. Assuming that the gains $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ are constant,

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{g 11}=\left[V_{o}-\left(V_{i}-V_{O S}\right)\right] A_{1} A_{2}+K \tag{5.155}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $K$ is a constant. If the differential input voltage to the top $A_{2}$ amplifier shown in Fig. 5.40 is zero, $V_{g 11}=-V_{S S}+V_{t 25}+V_{o v 25}$ so that $I_{d 21}=I_{d 22}$. Substituting this boundary condition
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_69320962b1b525ebcc55g-094.jpg?height=488&width=624&top_left_y=207&top_left_x=264)

Figure 5.41 Graphical interpretation of $V_{i(\min )}$, which is the minimum $V_{i}$ needed to turn on $M_{11}$ in Fig. 5.38.
into (5.155) gives $K=-V_{S S}+V_{t 25}+V_{o v 25}$; therefore,

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{g 11}=\left[V_{o}-\left(V_{i}-V_{O S}\right)\right] A_{1} A_{2}-V_{S S}+V_{t 25}+V_{o v 25} \tag{5.156}
\end{equation*}
$$

Also, (5.117) with $g_{m}=g_{m 1}=g_{m 2}$ gives $V_{o}$ in terms of $V_{i}$ for the output stage in Fig. 5.38 as long as the random offset is negligible, both $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ operate in the active region, and $M_{11}$ and $M_{12}$ are off. Since the gates of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ are each driven by only one output of the corresponding $A_{1}$ amplifiers, $A=A_{1} / 2$. With these substitutions, (5.117) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{o}=\frac{V_{i}}{1+\frac{1}{A_{1} g_{m 1} R_{L}}} \tag{5.157}
\end{equation*}
$$

To turn $M_{11}$ on, $V_{g 11}<V_{D D}-\left|V_{t 11}\right|$. Substituting this condition and (5.157) into (5.156) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{i(\mathrm{~min})}=V_{O S}\left(1+A_{1} g_{m 1} R_{L}\right)-\frac{\left(V_{D D}+V_{S S}-\left|V_{t 11}\right|-V_{t 25}-V_{o v 25}\right)\left(1+A_{1} g_{m 1} R_{L}\right)}{A_{1} A_{2}} \tag{5.158}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $V_{i(\min )}$ is the minimum value of $V_{i}$ for which $M_{11}$ conducts nonzero drain current. To interpret this result, let $A_{2} \rightarrow \infty$. Then to turn $M_{11}$ on, the required differential input voltage of the top $A_{2}$ amplifier $V_{2 t}=0$. Therefore, the required differential input of the top $A_{1}$ amplifier is zero; that is,

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{o}=V_{i}-V_{O S} \tag{5.159}
\end{equation*}
$$

This equation and (5.157) are both plotted in Fig. 5.41. As the input voltage increases, the output voltage follows with a slope less than unity if $R_{L}$ is finite, as shown by the solid plot. Therefore, as $V_{i}$ increases, $V_{i}-V_{o}$ also increases. To turn $M_{11}$ barely on, this difference must be equal to $V_{O S}$ so that the circuit operates at the intersection of the two lines in Fig. 5.41. Substituting (5.157) into (5.159) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{i(\min )}=V_{O S}\left(1+A_{1} g_{m 1} R_{L}\right) \tag{5.160}
\end{equation*}
$$

This equation agrees with the result that would be obtained by allowing $A_{2} \rightarrow \infty$ in (5.158). The term in parentheses in (5.160) is equal to the reciprocal of the difference in the slopes of the two lines in Fig. 5.41.

#### EXAMPLE

Find the minimum input voltage in Fig. 5.38 for which $M_{11}$ turns on, assuming at first that $A_{2} \rightarrow \infty$ and then that $A_{2}=70$. Let $V_{O S}=10 \mathrm{mV}, A_{1}=8, g_{m 1}=5 \mathrm{~mA} / \mathrm{V}, R_{L}=60 \Omega$, $V_{D D}=V_{S S}=2.5 \mathrm{~V}, V_{t 11}=-0.7 \mathrm{~V}, V_{t 25}=0.7 \mathrm{~V}$, and $V_{o v 25}=0.1 \mathrm{~V}$.

From (5.160),

$$
V_{i(\min )}=10 \mathrm{mV}[1+8(0.005)(60)]=34 \mathrm{mV}
$$

when $A_{2} \rightarrow \infty$. On the other hand, when $A_{2}=70,(5.158)$ shows that

$$
V_{i(\min )}=10 \mathrm{mV}[1+8(0.005)(60)]-\frac{3.5[1+8(0.005)(60)]}{8(70)} \simeq 0.13 \mathrm{mV}
$$

This example shows that the minimum input voltage required to turn on $M_{11}$ is reduced from the value given in (5.160) when $A_{2}$ is finite, because the fractional term in (5.158) is - positive.

The key point of this analysis is that $M_{11}$ and $M_{12}$ in Fig. 5.38 remain off for only a small range of input voltages. Therefore, the nonlinearity introduced by turning on $M_{11}$ or $M_{12}$ occurs when $\left|V_{i}\right|$ is small. As a result, this circuit is well suited for the ISDN (Integrated Service Digital Network) line-driving application for which it was designed because the required four-level output code does not include zero, avoiding distortion that would be introduced by turning $M_{11}$ and $M_{12}$ on or off ${ }^{17}$ if a zero-level output pulse were required.
