As $V_o$ goes negative, $Q_{23}$ draws current from the base of $Q_{20}$ with essentially no limit, and the circuit must be protected against a short-circuited load. Conversely, as $V_o$ goes positive, the maximum output current is limited by the current of 0.22 mA available for driving $Q_{14}$. This limitation arises because the current source $Q_{13 \\text{A}}$ supplies base current to $Q_{14}$, and as $V_1$, $V_2$, and $V_o$ go positive, the current in $Q_{14}$ increases, progressively diverting current from $Q_{13 \\text{A}}$.
