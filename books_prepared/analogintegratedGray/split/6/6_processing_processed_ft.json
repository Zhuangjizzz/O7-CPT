As a result, we can assume that no current flows into the op-amp's input terminals, and the input current from the source (Vs) through R1 is equal to the current through R2.

In Equation 6.49, these gains represent the sensitivity of the op-amp's output to variations in the positive (v_dd) and negative (v_ss) power supplies. In Equation 6.50, these gains are used to express the power-supply variations as equivalent differential inputs, leading to the definition of PSRR as PSRR^+ = A_dm / A^+ and PSRR^- = A_dm / A^-. This shows that A^+ and A^- directly influence the PSRR values, which in turn determine the op-amp's ability to reject power-supply noise."

If the two signal paths are identical, the coupling from power-supply variations to one quantity will be the same as to the other, ideally canceling out the variations in the difference signal. This inherent cancellation mechanism reduces the circuit's sensitivity to power-supply variations, enhancing its stability and performance. However, practical limitations like mismatches and nonlinearity can affect the effectiveness of this cancellation."

If $Q_{74}$ begins to saturate, its collector-base junction becomes forward biased, causing the collector-base junction of $Q_{72}$ to also become forward biased. Since the voltage from node 25 to ground is level shifted down about 0.7 V by $Q_{64}$ and up about the same amount by $Q_{65}$, $V_{EB72} \\simeq 0$. Therefore, $Q_{72}$ operates in the reverse-active mode, pulling current into its collector and out its emitter to node 25, raising the voltage from node 25 to ground and reducing the output voltage and the extent of $Q_{74}$ saturation. Similarly, when $Q_{75}$ begins to saturate, $Q_{73}$ operates in the reverse-active region, pulling current out of node 26 to reduce the voltage from node 26 to ground and limit the extent of $Q_{75}$ saturation. This limitation is important to avoid filling the base region of the output transistors with minority carriers, reducing the delay required to drive the output in the other direction and minimizing crossover distortion."
