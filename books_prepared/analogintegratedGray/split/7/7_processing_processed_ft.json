This is because complex poles result in a frequency response with a high-frequency peak, causing the step response to exhibit oscillatory behavior before settling to the final value. Such a response is typical in underdamped systems and is generally undesirable in pulse amplifiers due to potential instability and inaccuracies."

Nonlinear effects can cause distortion, saturation, and other nonideal behaviors that are not captured by the linear transfer function. This is particularly important in practical applications where signal amplitudes can vary widely, necessitating careful design to ensure linear operation within the desired signal range."

This relationship indicates that a higher -3-dB frequency corresponds to a shorter time constant, meaning the circuit responds more quickly to changes in the input signal."

The presence of additional poles, especially complex poles, can lead to a more oscillatory and potentially unstable response, making the circuit's behavior more challenging to predict and control."
