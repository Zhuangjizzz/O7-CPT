    "text": "- The input signal $S_i$ is fed into the differencing node, where it is reduced by the feedback signal $S_{fb}$, producing the error signal $S_\\epsilon$.\n- This error signal undergoes amplification by the basic amplifier, resulting in the output signal $S_o$.\n- The output signal then passes through the feedback network, creating the feedback signal $S_{fb}$.\n- The feedback signal is subsequently returned to the differencing node, impacting the subsequent amplification cycle.\n\nOverall System Function:\nThe core function of this system is to deliver controlled amplification of the input signal while ensuring stability via negative feedback. The feedback lowers the system's overall gain to $A = \\frac{a}{1 + af}$, termed the closed-loop gain, which aids in stabilizing the amplifier and minimizing distortion and noise.\n\nFigure 8.1 Ideal feedback configuration.\n\nSubstituting (8.2) into (8.3) yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nS_{\\epsilon}=S_{i}-f S_{o} \\tag{8.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nInserting (8.4) into (8.1) results in\n\n$$\nS_{o}=a S_{i}-a f S_{o}\n$$\n\ntherefore\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{S_{o}}{S_{i}}=A=\\frac{a}{1+a f} \\tag{8.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation 8.5 is the key equation for negative feedback circuits, where $A$ represents the overall gain with feedback applied. ($A$ is commonly referred to as the closed-loop gain.)\n\nIt is beneficial to define a parameter $T$ known as the loop gain, such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nT=a f \\tag{8.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{S_{o}}{S_{i}}=A=\\frac{a}{1+T} \\tag{8.7}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n$T$ represents the total gain around the feedback loop. If $T \\gg 1$, then, from (8.5), the gain $A$ is approximated by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nA \\simeq \\frac{1}{f} \\tag{8.8}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, for substantial loop gain $T$, the amplifier's overall gain is governed by the feedback transfer function $f$.

When feedback is introduced, the overall gain will still be governed by (8.5), but the appropriate value of $a$ must be selected based on the region of Fig. 8.2 being examined. Consequently, the overall transfer characteristic with feedback will also feature two regions of differing slopes, as illustrated in Fig. 8.3.

This scale adjustment is necessary because negative feedback reduces the gain. The gain reduction by the factor $(1+T)$, associated with negative feedback, poses minimal significant issues, as the gain can be readily compensated by adding a preamplifier before the feedback amplifier. Since the preamplifier processes much smaller signals than the output amplifier, distortion is typically not a concern in that stage.\n\nAnother point to note about Figs. 8.2 and 8.3 is that both exhibit hard saturation of the output amplifier (i.e., the output becomes independent of the input) at an output signal level of $S_{o 2}$. Given that the incremental slope $a_{3}=0$ in that region, negative feedback cannot enhance the situation, as $A_{3}=0$ as well, using (8.5)."

    "text": "Imagine the task is to design a feedback amplifier that ensures a consistent voltage transfer function, meaning a specific input voltage should yield a predictable proportional output voltage. This necessitates sampling the output voltage and feeding back a proportional voltage for comparison with the input voltage. This setup is depicted schematically in Fig. 8.4. The core amplifier has a gain of $a$, and the feedback network, a two-port device with a transfer function $f$, connects to the output of the core amplifier to sample $v_{0}$. Ideally, the impedance $z_{22 f}$ is infinite, meaning the feedback network does not load the core amplifier. The feedback voltage $v_{f b}$ is串联 with the input to enable comparison with $v_{i}$, and ideally, $z_{11 f}$ is zero. The signal $v_{\\epsilon}$, which is the difference between $v_{i}$ and $v_{f b}$, is fed to the core amplifier. Both the core amplifier and feedback circuits are assumed to be unilateral, meaning the core amplifier only transmits from $v_{\\epsilon}$ to $v_{o}$, and the feedback network only transmits from $v_{o}$ to $v_{f b}$. This aspect will be discussed later.\n\nThis type of feedback is termed series-shunt feedback because the feedback network is in series with the input and shunts the output.\nimage_name:Figure 8.4 Series-shunt feedback configuration\ndescription:The diagram titled \"Figure 8.4 Series-shunt feedback configuration\" illustrates a feedback amplifier system comprising two main components: a core amplifier and a feedback network.\n\n1. **Primary Components:**\n- **Core Amplifier:** This block, marked with the gain 'a', is responsible for amplifying the input signal. It takes the input voltage difference, \\( v_{\\epsilon} \\), and produces an amplified output signal, \\( v_{o} \\).\n- **Feedback Network:** This block, labeled with the feedback factor 'f', receives the output voltage \\( v_{o} \\) from the core amplifier and generates a feedback voltage \\( v_{fb} \\) that is returned to the input.\n\n2. **Signal Flow and Control:**\n- The input voltage \\( v_{i} \\) enters the system, where it is compared with the feedback voltage \\( v_{fb} \\) to create the error signal \\( v_{\\epsilon} \\) (\\( v_{\\epsilon} = v_{i} - v_{fb} \\)).\n- The error signal \\( v_{\\epsilon} \\) is then fed into the core amplifier, which outputs the amplified voltage \\( v_{o} = a \\cdot v_{\\epsilon} \\).\n- The output voltage \\( v_{o} \\) is subsequently directed to the feedback network, which scales it by the feedback factor 'f' to produce the feedback voltage \\( v_{fb} = f \\cdot v_{o} \\).\n- The feedback network is arranged in a series-shunt configuration, meaning it is in series with the input and shunts the output.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n- The diagram indicates that \\( z_{11f} = 0 \\), signifying zero input impedance of the feedback network, and \\( z_{22f} = \\infty \\), indicating infinite output impedance of the feedback network.\n- The polarities of the voltages \\( v_{i}, v_{\\epsilon}, v_{o}, \\) and \\( v_{fb} \\) are clearly marked to indicate the direction of signal flow and feedback.\n\n4. **System Function Overview:**\n- The main function of this configuration is to stabilize and control the amplifier's gain through feedback. The series-shunt feedback setup enhances the input and output impedance characteristics and stabilizes the gain despite variations in the amplifier's properties. The feedback loop aids in reducing distortion and increasing bandwidth, thereby making the amplifier more robust and reliable.\n\nFigure 8.4 Series-shunt feedback configuration.\nimage_name:Figure 8.5 Series-shunt configuration fed from a finite source impedance.\ndescription:The circuit is a series-shunt feedback configuration where the output voltage 'vo' is fed back to the input 'vi' through a feedback network 'f'. The amplifier 'a' stabilizes the gain and improves the impedance characteristics.\n\nFigure 8.5 Series-shunt configuration fed from a finite source impedance.\n\nFrom Fig. 8.4\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv_{o} & =a v_{\\epsilon}  \\tag{8.15}\\\\\nv_{f b} & =f v_{o}  \\tag{8.16}\\\\\nv_{\\epsilon} & =v_{i}-v_{f b} \\tag{8.17}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nFrom (8.15), (8.16), and (8.17),\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{v_{o}}{v_{i}}=\\frac{a}{1+a f} \\tag{8.18}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, the ideal feedback equation is applicable. Equation 8.18 shows that the stabilized transfer function is $v_{o} / v_{i}$, as intended. If the circuit is powered by a high source impedance, as illustrated in Fig. 8.5, the ratio $v_{o} / v_{i}$ remains stabilized [as given by (8.18)], but now $v_{i}$ is defined by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{i}=\\frac{Z_{i}}{Z_{i}+z_{s}} v_{s} \\tag{8.19}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $Z_{i}$ is the input impedance seen by $v_{i}$. If $z_{s}$ is approximately equal to $Z_{i}$, then $v_{i}$ depends on $Z_{i}$, which is often not well-defined due to its reliance on active-device parameters. Consequently, the overall gain $v_{o} / v_{s}$ will not be stabilized. Therefore, the full benefits of gain stabilization for a series-shunt feedback amplifier are realized when the source impedance is low relative to the input impedance of the closed-loop amplifier. The ideal driving source is a voltage source.\n\nNow, consider the impact of series-shunt feedback on the amplifier's terminal impedances. Assume the core amplifier has input and output impedances $z_{i}$ and $z_{o}$, as shown in Fig. 8.6. Again, assume the feedback network is ideal and provides a feedback voltage $f v_{o}$ as depicted. Both networks are unilateral. The applied voltage $v_{i}$ generates input current $i_{i}$ and output voltage $v_{o}$.

This necessitates sampling the output voltage and feeding back a proportional voltage for comparison with the input voltage. This setup is depicted schematically in Fig. 8.4. The core amplifier has a gain of $a$, and the feedback network, a two-port with a transfer function $f$, taps the output of the core amplifier to sample $v_{0}$. Ideally, the impedance $z_{22 f}$ is infinite, ensuring the feedback network does not load the core amplifier. The feedback voltage $v_{f b}$ is串联 with the input for comparison with $v_{i}$, and ideally, $z_{11 f}$ is zero. The signal $v_{\\epsilon}$, the difference between $v_{i}$ and $v_{f b}$, is fed to the core amplifier. Both the core amplifier and feedback circuits are assumed to be unilateral, meaning the core amplifier only transmits from $v_{\\epsilon}$ to $v_{o}$, and the feedback network only transmits from $v_{o}$ to $v_{f b}$.

The series-shunt feedback setup enhances the input and output impedance characteristics and stabilizes the gain despite variations in the amplifier's properties. The feedback loop aids in reducing distortion and increasing bandwidth, thereby making the amplifier more robust and reliable.\n\nFigure 8.4 Series-shunt feedback configuration.\nimage_name:Figure 8.5 Series-shunt configuration fed from a finite source impedance.\ndescription:The circuit is a series-shunt feedback configuration where the output voltage 'vo' is fed back to the input 'vi' through a feedback network 'f'.

Equation 8.18 shows that the stabilized transfer function is $v_{o} / v_{i}$, as intended. If the circuit is powered by a high source impedance, as depicted in Fig. 8.5, the ratio $v_{o} / v_{i}$ remains stabilized [as per (8.18)], but now $v_{i}$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{i}=\\frac{Z_{i}}{Z_{i}+z_{s}} v_{s} \\tag{8.19}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $Z_{i}$ is the input impedance seen by $v_{i}$.

The series-shunt feedback setup enhances the input and output impedance characteristics and stabilizes the gain despite variations in the amplifier's properties. The feedback loop aids in reducing distortion and expanding bandwidth, making the amplifier more robust and reliable.\n\nFigure 8.4 Series-shunt feedback configuration.\nimage_name:Figure 8.5 Series-shunt configuration fed from a finite source impedance.\ndescription:The circuit is a series-shunt feedback configuration where the output voltage 'vo' is returned to the input 'vi' via a feedback network 'f'.

Equation 8.18 shows that the stabilized transfer function is $v_{o} / v_{i}$, as intended. If the circuit is powered by a high source impedance, as depicted in Fig. 8.5, the ratio $v_{o} / v_{i}$ remains stabilized [as given by (8.18)], but now $v_{i}$ is defined by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{i}=\\frac{Z_{i}}{Z_{i}+z_{s}} v_{s} \\tag{8.19}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $Z_{i}$ is the input impedance seen by $v_{i}$. If $z_{s} \\approx Z_{i}$, then $v_{i}$ depends on $Z_{i}$, which is often not well-defined due to its reliance on active-device parameters. Consequently, the overall gain $v_{o} / v_{s}$ will not be stabilized. Therefore, the full advantages of gain stabilization for a series-shunt feedback amplifier are realized when the source impedance is low relative to the input impedance of the closed-loop amplifier. The ideal driving source is a voltage source.\n\nNow, consider the impact of series-shunt feedback on the amplifier's terminal impedances. Assume the core amplifier has input and output impedances $z_{i}$ and $z_{o}$, as shown in Fig. 8.6. Again, assume the feedback network is ideal and returns a voltage $f v_{o}$ as depicted. Both networks are unilateral. The applied voltage $v_{i}$ generates input current $i_{i}$ and output voltage $v_{o}$. From Fig. 8.6\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv_{o} & =a v_{\\epsilon}  \\tag{8.20}\\\\\nv_{i} & =v_{\\epsilon}+f v_{o} \\tag{8.21}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nimage_name:Figure 8.6\ndescription:This circuit depicts a series-shunt feedback amplifier configuration.

The input voltage is removed (the input is shorted), and a voltage $v$ is applied at the output. From Fig. 8.7\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& v_{\\epsilon}+f v=0  \\tag{8.26}\\\\\n& i=\\frac{v-a v_{\\epsilon}}{z_{o}} \\tag{8.27}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSubstituting (8.26) in (8.27) gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni=\\frac{v+a f v}{z_{o}} \\tag{8.28}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFrom (8.28), the output impedance $Z_{o}$ with feedback applied is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nZ_{o}=\\frac{v}{i}=\\frac{z_{o}}{1+T} \\tag{8.29}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nShunt feedback at the output consistently reduces the output impedance by $(1+T)$. This enhances the output as a better voltage source, making series-shunt feedback ideal for producing a good voltage amplifier. It stabilizes $v_{o} / v_{i}$, increases $Z_{i}$, and decreases $Z_{o}$.\n\nThe initial series-shunt feedback amplifier of Fig. 8.6 can now be represented as shown in Fig. 8.8a using (8.18), (8.25), and (8.29).

The impact of non-ideal networks is considered as illustrated in Fig. 8.13a, incorporating finite input and output admittances in both the forward and feedback paths, including reverse transmission in each. Finite source and load admittances, $y_{S}$ and $y_{L}$, are assumed. The most suitable two-port representation in this scenario is the short-circuit admittance parameters, or $y$ parameters, as utilized in Fig. 8.13a. This choice is due to the parallel connection of the basic amplifier and the feedback network at the input and output, resulting in identical terminal voltages. The $y$ parameters define a network's response by relating terminal currents to terminal voltages.\n\nFig. 8.13a illustrates a shunt-shunt feedback configuration using $y$-parameters. It comprises a basic amplifier and a feedback network connected in parallel, sharing the same terminal voltages. This configuration simplifies calculations by expressing terminal currents in terms of terminal voltages.\n\nFig. 8.13b depicts a redrawn version of the circuit in Fig. 8.13a, omitting generators $y_{21 f} v_{i}$ and $y_{12 a} v_{o}$.\n\nThe $y$-parameter representation is further illustrated in Fig. 8.14, which shows a two-port network using the admittance model.

    "text": "In examining the shunt-shunt feedback amplifier depicted in Fig. 8.9, it's crucial to account for the influence of non-ideal networks, as demonstrated in Fig. 8.13a. Here, we consider finite input and output admittances within both the forward and feedback paths, as well as the reverse transmission in each. We assume the presence of finite source and load admittances, denoted as $y_{S}$ and $y_{L}$. For this configuration, the most suitable two-port representation is the short-circuit admittance parameters, or $y$ parameters, which are utilized in Fig. 8.13a. This representation is chosen because the fundamental amplifier and the feedback network are connected in parallel at the input and output, leading to identical voltages at their respective terminals. The $y$ parameters define a network's response by expressing terminal currents as functions of terminal voltages, resulting in straightforward calculations when two networks share identical terminal voltages. This simplicity will become apparent in subsequent circuit calculations. The $y$-parameter representation is further illustrated in Fig. 8.14.\n\nIn Fig. 8.13a, at the input, the current $i_{s}$ is given by the equation:\n\n$$\ni_{s}=\\left(y_{S}+y_{11 a}+y_{11 f}\\right) v_{i}+\\left(y_{12 a}+y_{12 f}\\right) v_{o} \\tag{8.46}\n$$\n\nThe diagram labeled \"Figure 8.14\" portrays a two-port network utilizing the y-parameter (admittance) model. It features a block symbolizing the two-port network with four terminals, labeled with voltages and currents. The model's primary function is to describe the relationship between input and output voltages and currents through the y-parameters. These parameters define how the input current $i_1$ and output current $i_2$ depend on the input voltage $v_1$ and output voltage $v_2$, respectively. This representation is beneficial for simplifying the analysis and design of circuits involving interconnected networks into linear equations.\n\nThe summation of currents at the output yields:\n\n$$\n0=\\left(y_{21 a}+y_{21 f}\\right) v_{i}+\\left(y_{L}+y_{22 a}+y_{22 f}\\right) v_{o} \\tag{8.47}\n$$\n\nIt is helpful to define:\n\n$$\ny_{i}=y_{S}+y_{11 a}+y_{11 f}  \\tag{8.48}\n$$\n\n$$\ny_{o}=y_{L}+y_{22 a}+y_{22 f} \\tag{8.49}\n$$\n\nSolving equations (8.46) and (8.47) using (8.48) and (8.49) results in:\n\n$$\n\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{s}}=\\frac{-\\left(y_{21 a}+y_{21 f}\\right)}{y_{i} y_{o}-\\left(y_{21 a}+y_{21 f}\\right)\\left(y_{12 a}+y_{12 f}\\right)} \\tag{8.50}\n$$\n\nThe equation can be transformed into the ideal feedback equation of (8.35) by dividing by $y_{i} y_{o}$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{s}}=\\frac{\\frac{-\\left(y_{21 a}+y_{21 f}\\right)}{y_{i} y_{o}}}{1+\\frac{-\\left(y_{21 a}+y_{21 f}\\right)}{y_{i} y_{o}}\\left(y_{12 a}+y_{12 f}\\right)} \\tag{8.51}\n$$\n\nComparison of (8.51) with (8.35) yields:\n\n$$\na=-\\frac{y_{21 a}+y_{21 f}}{y_{i} y_{o}}  \\tag{8.52}\n$$\n\n$$\nf=y_{12 a}+y_{12 f} \\tag{8.53}\n$$\n\nAt this juncture, several approximations can be made to significantly simplify calculations. Initially, we assume that the signal transmitted by the basic amplifier is much greater than the signal fed forward by the feedback network. Given that the former has gain (usually substantial) while the latter has loss, this is typically a valid assumption. This implies:\n\n$$\n\\left|y_{21 a}\\right| \\gg\\left|y_{21 f}\\right| \\tag{8.54}\n$$\n\nSecondly, we assume that the signal fed back by the feedback network is much greater than the signal fed back through the basic amplifier. Since most active devices exhibit very small reverse transmission, the basic amplifier shares a similar characteristic, and this assumption is generally quite accurate. This assumption indicates:\n\n$$\n\\left|y_{12 a}\\right| \\ll\\left|y_{12 f}\\right| \\tag{8.55}\n$$\n\nApplying (8.54) and (8.55) to (8.51) results in:\n\n$$\n\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{s}}=A \\simeq \\frac{\\frac{-y_{21 a}}{y_{i} y_{o}}}{1+\\left(\\frac{-y_{21 a}}{y_{i} y_{o}}\\right) y_{12 f}} \\tag{8.56}\n$$\n\nComparison of (8.56) with (8.35) yields:\n\n$$\na=-\\frac{y_{21 a}}{y_{i} y_{o}}  \\tag{8.57}\n$$\n\n$$\nf=y_{12 f} \\tag{8.58}\n$$\n\nA circuit representation of (8.57) and (8.58) can be derived as follows. Equations 8.54 and 8.55 imply that in Fig. 8.13a, the feedback generator of the basic amplifier and the forward transmission generator of the feedback network can be disregarded. By doing so, the circuit can be redrawn as in Fig. 8.13b, where the terminal admittances $y_{11 f}$ and $y_{22 f}$ of the feedback network have been incorporated into the basic amplifier, along with source and load impedances $y_{S}$ and $y_{L}$. The new basic amplifier thus encompasses the loading effect of the original feedback network, and the new feedback network is an ideal one, as used in Fig. 8.9. If the transfer function of the basic amplifier of Fig. 8.13b is calculated (by initially removing the feedback network), the result given in (8.57) is obtained. Similarly, the transfer function of the feedback network of Fig. 8.13b is provided by (8.58). Thus, Fig. 8.13b serves as a circuit representation of (8.57) and (8.58).\n\nSince Fig. $8.13 b$ aligns directly with Fig. 8.9, all the results derived in Section 8.4.2 for Fig. 8.9 can now be applied. The loading effect of the feedback network on the basic amplifier is now included by simply shunting input and output with $y_{11 f}$ and $y_{22 f}$, respectively. As depicted in Fig. 8.14, these terminal admittances of the feedback network are calculated with the other port of the network short-circuited. In practice, the loading term $y_{11 f}$ is obtained by shorting the output node of the amplifier and calculating the feedback circuit input admittance. Similarly, term $y_{22 f}$ is determined by shorting the input node in the amplifier and calculating the feedback circuit output admittance. The feedback transfer function $f$ given by (8.58) is the short-circuit reverse transfer admittance of the feedback network and is defined in Fig. 8.14. This is readily calculated in practice and is often obtained by inspection. Note that the use of $y$ parameters in further calculations is not necessary. Once the circuit of Fig. $8.13 b$ is established, any convenient network analysis method may be used to calculate the gain $a$ of the basic amplifier. We have simply used the two-port representation as a general means of illustrating how loading effects may be included in the calculations.\n\nFor instance, consider the common shunt-shunt feedback circuit using an op amp as depicted in Fig. 8.15a. The equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. $8.15 b$ and is redrawn in $8.15 c$ to account for the loading of the feedback network on the basic amplifier. The $y$ parameters of the feedback network can be derived from Fig. 8.15d.\n\n$$\ny_{11 f}=\\left.\\frac{i_{1}}{v_{1}}\\right|_{v_{2}=0}=\\frac{1}{R_{F}}  \\tag{8.59}\n$$\n\n$$\ny_{22 f}=\\left.\\frac{i_{2}}{v_{2}}\\right|_{v_{1}=0}=\\frac{1}{R_{F}}  \\tag{8.60}\n$$\n\n$$\ny_{12 f}=\\left.\\frac{i_{1}}{v_{2}}\\right|_{v_{1}=0}=-\\frac{1}{R_{F}}=f \\tag{8.61}\n$$\n\nUsing (8.54), we neglect $y_{21 f}$.\nThe basic-amplifier gain $a$ can be calculated from Fig. 8.15 c by setting $i_{f b}=0$ to give:\n\n$$\nv_{1} =\\frac{z_{i} R_{F}}{z_{i}+R_{F}} i_{i}  \\tag{8.62}\n$$\n\n$$\nv_{o} =-\\frac{R}{R+z_{o}} a_{\\nu} v_{1} \\tag{8.63}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n\n$$\nR=R_{F} \\| R_{L} \\tag{8.64}\n$$\n\nSubstituting (8.62) into (8.63) yields:\n\n$$\n\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{i}}=a=-\\frac{R}{R+z_{o}} a_{v} \\frac{z_{i} R_{F}}{z_{i}+R_{F}} \\tag{8.65}\n$$\n\nUsing the formulas derived in Section 8.4.2, we can now calculate all parameters of the feedback circuit. The input and output impedances of the basic amplifier now include the effect of feedback loading, and it is these impedances that are divided by $(1+T)$ as described in Section 8.4.2. Thus, the input impedance of the basic amplifier of Fig. 8.15c is:\n\n$$\nz_{i a}=R_{F} \\| z_{i}=\\frac{R_{F} z_{i}}{R_{F}+z_{i}} \\tag{8.66}\n$$\n\nWith feedback applied, the input impedance becomes:\n\n$$\nZ_{i}=\\frac{z_{i a}}{1+T} \\tag{8.67}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, for the output impedance of the basic amplifier:\n\n$$\nz_{o a}=z_{o}\\left\\|R_{F}\\right\\| R_{L} \\tag{8.68}\n$$\n\nWith feedback applied, this becomes:\n\n$$\nZ_{o}=\\frac{z_{o}\\left\\|R_{F}\\right\\| R_{L}}{1+T} \\tag{8.69}\n$$\n\nIt's important to note that these calculations can be performed using the circuit of Fig. 8.15c without further need for two-port $y$ parameters.\n\nSince the loop gain $T$ is of significant interest, it is now calculated using (8.61) and (8.65):\n\n$$\nT=a f=\\frac{R_{F} R_{L}}{R_{F} R_{L}+z_{o} R_{F}+z_{o} R_{L}} a_{v} \\frac{z_{i}}{z_{i}+R_{F}} \\tag{8.70}\n$$\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nSuppose the circuit of Fig. $8.15 a$ is implemented with a NE5234 op amp with $R_{F}=1 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega$ and $R_{L}=10 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$. Calculate the terminal impedances, loop gain, and overall gain of the feedback amplifier at low frequencies. The NE5234 data are $z_{i}=170 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega, z_{o}=15 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$, and $a_{v}=130,000$.\n\nFrom (8.66), the low-frequency input impedance of the basic amplifier, including loading, is:\n\n$$\nz_{i a}=\\frac{10^{6} \\times 170 \\times 10^{3}}{10^{6}+170 \\times 10^{3}} \\Omega=145 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega \\tag{8.71}\n$$\n\nFrom (8.68), the low-frequency output impedance of the basic amplifier is:\n\n$$\nz_{o a}=15 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega\\|1 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega\\| 10 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega \\simeq 5.96 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega \\tag{8.72}\n$$\n\nThe low-frequency loop gain can be calculated from (8.70) as:\n\n$$\nT=\\frac{10^{6} \\times 10^{4}}{10^{6} \\times 10^{4}+15 \\times 10^{3} \\times 10^{6}+15 \\times 10^{3} \\times 10^{4}} \\times 130,000 \\times \\frac{170 \\times 10^{3}}{170 \\times 10^{3}+10^{6}} =7510 \\tag{8.73}\n$$\n\nIn this case, the loop gain is substantial. Note that a finite source resistance at the input could significantly reduce this value.\n\nThe input impedance with feedback applied is found by substituting (8.71) and (8.73) into (8.67) to give:\n\n$$\nZ_{i}=\\frac{145 \\times 10^{3}}{7511} \\Omega=19.3 \\Omega\n$$\n\nThe output impedance with feedback applied is found by substituting (8.72) and (8.73) into (8.69) to give:\n\n$$\nZ_{o}=\\frac{5.96 \\times 10^{3}}{7511} \\Omega=0.794 \\Omega\n$$\n\nIn practice, second-order effects in the circuit may result in a larger value of $Z_{o}$.\nThe overall transfer function with feedback can be approximately determined from (8.8) as:\n\n$$\n\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{i}}=A \\simeq \\frac{1}{f} \\tag{8.74}\n$$\n\nUsing (8.61) in (8.74) gives:\n\n$$\n\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{i}}=A \\simeq-R_{F}\n$$\n\nSubstituting for $R_{F}$ yields:\n\n$$\n\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{i}}=A \\simeq-1 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega \\tag{8.75}\n$$\n\nA more precise value of $A$ can be calculated from (8.5). Since the loop gain is high in this example, it is useful to transform (8.5) as follows:\n\n$$\nA=\\frac{1}{f} \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1}{a f}}  \\tag{8.76}\n$$\n\n$$\nA=\\frac{1}{f} \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1}{T}} \\tag{8.77}\n$$\n\nGiven the high $T$ value in this example, $A$ differs only slightly from $1 / f$. Substituting $T=7510$ and $1 / f=$ $-1 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega$ into (8.77) yields:\n\n$$\nA=-999,867 \\Omega \\tag{8.78}\n$$\n\nFor most practical purposes, (8.75) is sufficiently accurate."

The feedback network's loading effect on the basic amplifier is incorporated by simply shunting the input and output with $y_{11 f}$ and $y_{22 f}$, respectively. As shown in Fig. 8.14, these terminal admittances of the feedback network are calculated with the other port of the network short-circuited. In practice, the loading term $y_{11 f}$ is obtained by shorting the output node of the amplifier and calculating the feedback circuit's input admittance. Similarly, term $y_{22 f}$ is determined by shorting the input node in the amplifier and calculating the feedback circuit's output admittance. The feedback transfer function $f$ given by (8.58) is the short-circuit reverse transfer admittance of the feedback network, as defined in Fig. 8.14. This is readily calculable in practice and often discernible by inspection. It is important to note that the use of $y$ parameters in further calculations is unnecessary. Once the circuit of Fig. 8.13b is established, any convenient network analysis method may be employed to calculate the gain $a$ of the basic amplifier. We have merely utilized the two-port representation as a general means of illustrating how loading effects may be incorporated into calculations.\n\nFor instance, consider the common shunt-shunt feedback circuit employing an op amp, as shown in Fig. 8.15a. The equivalent circuit is depicted in Fig. 8.15b and is reconfigured in Fig. 8.15c to account for the feedback network's loading on the basic amplifier. The $y$ parameters of the feedback network can be derived from Fig. 8.15d.\n\n$$\ny_{11 f}=\\left.\\frac{i_{1}}{v_{1}}\\right|_{v_{2}=0}=\\frac{1}{R_{F}}  \\tag{8.59}\n$$\n\n$$\ny_{22 f}=\\left.\\frac{i_{2}}{v_{2}}\\right|_{v_{1}=0}=\\frac{1}{R_{F}}  \\tag{8.60}\n$$\n\n$$\ny_{12 f}=\\left.\\frac{i_{1}}{v_{2}}\\right|_{v_{1}=0}=-\\frac{1}{R_{F}}=f \\tag{8.61}\n$$\n\nUsing (8.54), we can disregard $y_{21 f}$.\n\nThe basic amplifier gain $a$ can be calculated from Fig. 8.15c by setting $i_{f b}=0$:\n\n$$\nv_{1}=\\frac{z_{i} R_{F}}{z_{i}+R_{F}} i_{i}  \\tag{8.62}\n$$\n\n$$\nv_{o}=-\\frac{R}{R+z_{o}} a_{\\nu} v_{1} \\tag{8.63}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nR=R_{F} \\| R_{L} \\tag{8.64}\n$$\n\nSubstituting (8.62) into (8.63) yields:\n\n$$\n\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{i}}=a=-\\frac{R}{R+z_{o}} a_{v} \\frac{z_{i} R_{F}}{z_{i}+R_{F}} \\tag{8.65}\n$$\n\nWith the formulas derived in Section 8.4.2, we can now compute all parameters of the feedback circuit. The input and output impedances of the basic amplifier now encompass the feedback loading effect, and these impedances are divided by $(1+T)$ as outlined in Section 8.4.2. Thus, the input impedance of the basic amplifier in Fig. 8.15c is:\n\n$$\nz_{i a}=R_{F} \\| z_{i}=\\frac{R_{F} z_{i}}{R_{F}+z_{i}} \\tag{8.66}\n$$\n\nWith feedback applied, the input impedance becomes:\n\n$$\nZ_{i}=\\frac{z_{i a}}{1+T} \\tag{8.67}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, for the output impedance of the basic amplifier:\n\n$$\nz_{o a}=z_{o}\\left\\|R_{F}\\right\\| R_{L} \\tag{8.68}\n$$\n\nWith feedback applied, this transforms into:\n\n$$\nZ_{o}=\\frac{z_{o}\\left\\|R_{F}\\right\\| R_{L}}{1+T} \\tag{8.69}\n$$\n\nIt is important to note that these calculations can be performed using the circuit of Fig. 8.15c without any further need for two-port $y$ parameters.\n\nSince the loop gain $T$ is of significant interest, it is now calculated using (8.61) and (8.65):\n\n$$\nT=a f=\\frac{R_{F} R_{L}}{R_{F} R_{L}+z_{o} R_{F}+z_{o} R_{L}} a_{v} \\frac{z_{i}}{z_{i}+R_{F}} \\tag{8.70}\n$$\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nAssuming the circuit in Fig. 8.15a is realized with a NE5234 op amp, where $R_{F}=1 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega$ and $R_{L}=10 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$, calculate the terminal impedances, loop gain, and overall gain of the feedback amplifier at low frequencies. The NE5234 op amp specifications are $z_{i}=170 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$, $z_{o}=15 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$, and $a_{v}=130,000$.\n\nUsing (8.66), the low-frequency input impedance of the basic amplifier, including loading, is:\n\n$$\nz_{i a}=\\frac{10^{6} \\times 170 \\times 10^{3}}{10^{6}+170 \\times 10^{3}} \\Omega=145 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega \\tag{8.71}\n$$\n\nFrom (8.68), the low-frequency output impedance of the basic amplifier is:\n\n$$\nz_{o a}=15 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega\\|1 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega\\| 10 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega \\simeq 5.96 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega \\tag{8.72}\n$$\n\nThe low-frequency loop gain can be calculated from (8.70) as:\n\n$$\nT=\\frac{10^{6} \\times 10^{4}}{10^{6} \\times 10^{4}+15 \\times 10^{3} \\times 10^{6}+15 \\times 10^{3} \\times 10^{4}} \\times 130,000 \\times \\frac{170 \\times 10^{3}}{170 \\times 10^{3}+10^{6}} =7510 \\tag{8.73}\n$$\n\nIn this instance, the loop gain is substantial. It is worth noting that a finite source resistance at the input could significantly diminish this value.\n\nThe input impedance with feedback applied is calculated by substituting (8.71) and (8.73) into (8.67):\n\n$$\nZ_{i}=\\frac{145 \\times 10^{3}}{7511} \\Omega=19.3 \\Omega\n$$\n\nThe output impedance with feedback applied is obtained by substituting (8.72) and (8.73) into (8.69):\n\n$$\nZ_{o}=\\frac{5.96 \\times 10^{3}}{7511} \\Omega=0.794 \\Omega\n$$\n\nIn practical applications, second-order effects in the circuit may result in a higher value of $Z_{o}$.\n\nThe overall transfer function with feedback can be approximately determined from (8.8) as:\n\n$$\n\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{i}}=A \\simeq \\frac{1}{f} \\tag{8.74}\n$$\n\nUsing (8.61) in (8.74) gives:\n\n$$\n\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{i}}=A \\simeq-R_{F}\n$$\n\nSubstituting for $R_{F}$ yields:\n\n$$\n\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{i}}=A \\simeq-1 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega \\tag{8.75}\n$$\n\nA more precise value of $A$ can be calculated from (8.5). Since the loop gain is high in this case, it is beneficial to rearrange (8.5) as follows:\n\n$$\nA=\\frac{1}{f} \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1}{a f}}  \\tag{8.76}\n$$\n\n$$\nA=\\frac{1}{f} \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1}{T}} \\tag{8.77}\n$$\n\nGiven the high $T$ value in this example, $A$ is nearly equivalent to $1 / f$. Substituting $T=7510$ and $1 / f=-1 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega$ in (8.77) results in:\n\n$$\nA=-999,867 \\Omega \\tag{8.78}\n$$\n\nFor most practical purposes, (8.75) provides sufficient accuracy."

The influence of non-ideal networks is incorporated as displayed in Fig. 8.13a, where finite input and output admittances are considered in both the forward and feedback paths, along with reverse transmission in each. Finite source and load admittances, denoted as $y_{S}$ and $y_{L}$, are assumed. In this scenario, the most suitable two-port representation is the short-circuit admittance parameters, or $y$ parameters, as depicted in Fig. 8.13a. This is due to the fact that the fundamental amplifier and the feedback network are connected in parallel at the input and output, hence sharing identical terminal voltages. The $y$ parameters define a network's response by expressing terminal currents as functions of terminal voltages.\n\nThe circuit in Fig. 8.13a represents a shunt-shunt feedback configuration utilizing $y$-parameters. It consists of a basic amplifier and a feedback network connected in parallel, with matching terminal voltages. The circuit is structured to simplify calculations by expressing terminal currents in terms of terminal voltages.\n\nThe diagram in Fig. 8.13b portrays a shunt-shunt feedback configuration using $y$-parameters. It illustrates a new configuration of the basic amplifier and feedback network, with parallel connections at the input and output terminals.\n\nFigure 8.13 (a) illustrates the shunt-shunt feedback configuration using the $y$-parameter representation. Figure 8.13 (b) is a redrawn version of (a), omitting generators $y_{21 f} v_{i}$ and $y_{12 a} v_{o}$.\n\nThe $y$-parameter representation simplifies calculations significantly when two networks share identical terminal voltages, as will be demonstrated in subsequent circuit calculations. The $y$-parameter representation is depicted in Fig. 8.14.\n\nReferencing Fig. 8.13a, at the input, the equation is:\n\n$$\ni_{s}=\\left(y_{S}+y_{11 a}+y_{11 f}\\right) v_{i}+\\left(y_{12 a}+y_{12 f}\\right) v_{o} \\tag{8.46}\n$$\n\nThe diagram labeled \"Figure 8.14\" represents a two-port network utilizing the y-parameter (admittance) model. It consists of a block symbolizing the two-port network with four terminals. The key components and their functions are as follows:\n\n1. **Main Components:**\n   - The block represents the two-port network characterized by the admittance parameters (y-parameters).\n   - There are two input terminals on the left side, labeled with voltage \\( v_1 \\) and current \\( i_1 \\).\n   - There are two output terminals on the right side, labeled with voltage \\( v_2 \\) and current \\( i_2 \\).\n\n2. **Flow of Information or Control:**\n   - The input current \\( i_1 \\) flows into the network at the left side, and the output current \\( i_2 \\) flows out of the network at the right side.\n   - The voltages \\( v_1 \\) and \\( v_2 \\) are applied across the input and output terminals, respectively.\n   - The direction of the current flow is indicated by arrows, with \\( i_1 \\) entering the network and \\( i_2 \\) exiting.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n   - The terminals are clearly labeled with their respective voltages and currents, \\( v_1, i_1 \\) for the input and \\( v_2, i_2 \\) for the output.\n   - The positive and negative signs next to the voltage labels indicate the polarity of the voltages across the terminals.\n\n4. **Overall System Function:**\n   - The primary function of this two-port network is to relate the input and output voltages and currents through the y-parameters. The y-parameters define how the input current \\( i_1 \\) and output current \\( i_2 \\) depend on the input voltage \\( v_1 \\) and output voltage \\( v_2 \\). This representation is useful for analyzing and designing circuits involving interconnected networks by simplifying complex interactions into linear equations.\n\nThe equations for the two-port network are:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\ni_{1}=y_{11} v_{1}+y_{12} v_{2} & \\\\\ni_{2}=y_{21} v_{1}+y_{22} v_{2} & \\\\\ny_{11}=\\left.\\frac{i_{1}}{v_{1}}\\right|_{v_{2}=0} & y_{12}=\\left.\\frac{i_{1}}{v_{2}}\\right|_{v_{1}=0} \\\\\ny_{21}=\\left.\\frac{i_{2}}{v_{1}}\\right|_{v_{2}=0} & y_{22}=\\left.\\frac{i_{2}}{v_{2}}\\right|_{v_{1}=0}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nFigure 8.14 depicts the $y$-parameter representation of a two-port network.\n\nThe summation of currents at the output yields:\n\n$$\n0=\\left(y_{21 a}+y_{21 f}\\right) v_{i}+\\left(y_{L}+y_{22 a}+y_{22 f}\\right) v_{o} \\tag{8.47}\n$$\n\nIt is beneficial to define:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gather*}\ny_{i}=y_{S}+y_{11 a}+y_{11 f}  \\tag{8.48}\\\\\ny_{o}=y_{L}+y_{22 a}+y_{22 f} \\tag{8.49}\n\\end{gather*}\n$$\n\nSolving equations (8.46) and (8.47) using (8.48) and (8.49) gives:\n\n$$\n\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{s}}=\\frac{-\\left(y_{21 a}+y_{21 f}\\right)}{y_{i} y_{o}-\\left(y_{21 a}+y_{21 f}\\right)\\left(y_{12 a}+y_{12 f}\\right)} \\tag{8.50}\n$$\n\nThe equation can be transformed into the ideal feedback equation of (8.35) by dividing by $y_{i} y_{o}$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{s}}=\\frac{\\frac{-\\left(y_{21 a}+y_{21 f}\\right)}{y_{i} y_{o}}}{1+\\frac{-\\left(y_{21 a}+y_{21 f}\\right)}{y_{i} y_{o}}\\left(y_{12 a}+y_{12 f}\\right)} \\tag{8.51}\n$$\n\nComparing (8.51) with (8.35) yields:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& a=-\\frac{y_{21 a}+y_{21 f}}{y_{i} y_{o}}  \\tag{8.52}\\\\\n& f=y_{12 a}+y_{12 f} \\tag{8.53}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nAt this juncture, several approximations can be made to greatly simplify the calculations. Firstly, we assume that the signal transmitted by the basic amplifier is much greater than the signal fed forward by the feedback network. Given that the former has gain (usually large) while the latter has loss, this assumption is typically valid. This implies that:\n\n$$\n\\left|y_{21 a}\\right| \\gg\\left|y_{21 f}\\right| \\tag{8.54}\n$$\n\nSecondly, we assume that the signal fed back by the feedback network is much greater than the signal fed back through the basic amplifier. Since most active devices have very small reverse transmission, the basic amplifier exhibits a similar characteristic, and this assumption is typically quite accurate. This assumption means that:\n\n$$\n\\left|y_{12 a}\\right| \\ll\\left|y_{12 f}\\right| \\tag{8.55}\n$$\n\nUsing (8.54) and (8.55) in (8.51) results in:\n\n$$\n\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{s}}=A \\simeq \\frac{\\frac{-y_{21 a}}{y_{i} y_{o}}}{1+\\left(\\frac{-y_{21 a}}{y_{i} y_{o}}\\right) y_{12 f}} \\tag{8.56}\n$$\n\nComparing (8.56) with (8.35) yields:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\na & =-\\frac{y_{21 a}}{y_{i} y_{o}}  \\tag{8.57}\\\\\nf & =y_{12 f} \\tag{8.58}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nA circuit representation of (8.57) and (8.58) can be derived as follows. Equations 8.54 and 8.55 imply that in Fig. 8.13a, the feedback generator of the basic amplifier and the forward transmission generator of the feedback network may be neglected. If this is done, the circuit may be redrawn as in Fig. 8.13b, where the terminal admittances $y_{11 f}$ and $y_{22 f}$ of the feedback network have been absorbed into the basic amplifier, along with source and load impedances $y_{S}$ and $y_{L}$. The new basic amplifier thus incorporates the loading effect of the original feedback network, and the new feedback network is an ideal one as used in Fig. 8.9. If the transfer function of the basic amplifier of Fig. 8.13 b is calculated (by first removing the feedback network), the result given in (8.57) is obtained. Similarly, the transfer function of the feedback network of Fig. 8.13 b is given by (8.58). Thus Fig. 8.13 b is a circuit representation of (8.57) and (8.58).\n\nSince Fig. $8.13 b$ has a direct correspondence with Fig. 8.9, all the results derived in Section 8.4.2 for Fig. 8.9 can now be applied. The loading effect of the feedback network on the basic amplifier is now included by simply shunting input and output with $y_{11 f}$ and $y_{22 f}$, respectively. As shown in Fig. 8.14, these terminal admittances of the feedback network are calculated with the other port of the network short-circuited. In practice, loading term $y_{11 f}$ is simply obtained by shorting the output node of the amplifier and calculating the feedback circuit input admittance. Similarly, term $y_{22 f}$ is calculated by shorting the input node in the amplifier and calculating the feedback circuit output admittance. The feedback transfer function $f$ given by (8.58) is the short-circuit reverse transfer admittance of the feedback network and is defined in Fig. 8.14. This is readily calculated in practice and is often obtained by inspection. Note that the use of $y$ parameters in further calculations is not necessary. Once the circuit of Fig. $8.13 b$ is established, any convenient network analysis method may be used to calculate gain $a$ of the basic amplifier. We have simply used the two-port representation as a general means of illustrating how loading effects may be included in the calculations.\n\nFor instance, consider the common shunt-shunt feedback circuit using an op amp as shown in Fig. 8.15a. The equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. $8.15 b$ and is redrawn in $8.15 c$ to account for the loading of the feedback network on the basic amplifier. The $y$ parameters of the feedback network can be determined from Fig. 8.15d.\n\nThe equations for the feedback network are:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& y_{11 f}=\\left.\\frac{i_{1}}{v_{1}}\\right|_{v_{2}=0}=\\frac{1}{R_{F}}  \\tag{8.59}\\\\\n& y_{22 f}=\\left.\\frac{i_{2}}{v_{2}}\\right|_{v_{1}=0}=\\frac{1}{R_{F}}  \\tag{8.60}\\\\\n& y_{12 f}=\\left.\\frac{i_{1}}{v_{2}}\\right|_{v_{1}=0}=-\\frac{1}{R_{F}}=f \\tag{8.61}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nUsing (8.54), we neglect $y_{21 f}$.\nThe basic-amplifier gain $a$ can be calculated from Fig. 8.15 c by setting $i_{f b}=0$ to give:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv_{1} & =\\frac{z_{i} R_{F}}{z_{i}+R_{F}} i_{i}  \\tag{8.62}\\\\\nv_{o} & =-\\frac{R}{R+z_{o}} a_{\\nu} v_{1} \\tag{8.63}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n\n$$\nR=R_{F} \\| R_{L} \\tag{8.64}\n$$\n\nThe circuit diagrams (a), (b), (c), and (d) represent various configurations of a shunt-shunt feedback amplifier using an operational amplifier as the gain element, with a feedback network implemented using a resistor RF. The input current source ii is connected to the inverting input of the op-amp, and the output voltage vo is fed back to the input through RF. The circuit is grounded at multiple points, and the output is taken across the load resistor RL.\n\nSubstituting (8.62) into (8.63) yields:\n\n$$\n\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{i}}=a=-\\frac{R}{R+z_{o}} a_{v} \\frac{z_{i} R_{F}}{z_{i}+R_{F}} \\tag{8.65}\n$$\n\nUsing the formulas derived in Section 8.4.2, we can now calculate all parameters of the feedback circuit. The input and output impedances of the basic amplifier now include the effect of feedback loading, and it is these impedances that are divided by $(1+T)$ as described in Section 8.4.2. Thus, the input impedance of the basic amplifier of Fig. 8.15c is:\n\n$$\nz_{i a}=R_{F} \\| z_{i}=\\frac{R_{F} z_{i}}{R_{F}+z_{i}} \\tag{8.66}\n$$\n\nWhen feedback is applied, the input impedance becomes:\n\n$$\nZ_{i}=\\frac{z_{i a}}{1+T} \\tag{8.67}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, for the output impedance of the basic amplifier:\n\n$$\nz_{o a}=z_{o}\\left\\|R_{F}\\right\\| R_{L} \\tag{8.68}\n$$\n\nWhen feedback is applied, this becomes:\n\n$$\nZ_{o}=\\frac{z_{o}\\left\\|R_{F}\\right\\| R_{L}}{1+T} \\tag{8.69}\n$$\n\nIt is important to note that these calculations can be made using the circuit of Fig. 8.15c without further need for two-port $y$ parameters.\n\nSince the loop gain $T$ is of considerable interest, it is now calculated using (8.61) and (8.65):\n\n$$\nT=a f=\\frac{R_{F} R_{L}}{R_{F} R_{L}+z_{o} R_{F}+z_{o} R_{L}} a_{v} \\frac{z_{i}}{z_{i}+R_{F}} \\tag{8.70}\n$$\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nAssuming that the circuit of Fig. $8.15 a$ is realized using a NE5234 op amp with $R_{F}=1 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega$ and $R_{L}=10 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$, calculate the terminal impedances, loop gain, and overall gain of the feedback amplifier at low frequencies.

This representation is useful for analyzing and designing circuits involving interconnected networks by simplifying complex interactions into linear equations.\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\ni_{1}=y_{11} v_{1}+y_{12} v_{2} & \\\\\ni_{2}=y_{21} v_{1}+y_{22} v_{2} & \\\\\ny_{11}=\\left.\\frac{i_{1}}{v_{1}}\\right|_{v_{2}=0} & y_{12}=\\left.\\frac{i_{1}}{v_{2}}\\right|_{v_{1}=0} \\\\\ny_{21}=\\left.\\frac{i_{2}}{v_{1}}\\right|_{v_{2}=0} & y_{22}=\\left.\\frac{i_{2}}{v_{2}}\\right|_{v_{1}=0}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nFigure 8.14 The $y$-parameter representation of a two-port.\n\nSummation of currents at the output gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n0=\\left(y_{21 a}+y_{21 f}\\right) v_{i}+\\left(y_{L}+y_{22 a}+y_{22 f}\\right) v_{o} \\tag{8.47}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIt is useful to define\n\n$$\n\\begin{gather*}\ny_{i}=y_{S}+y_{11 a}+y_{11 f}  \\tag{8.48}\\\\\ny_{o}=y_{L}+y_{22 a}+y_{22 f} \\tag{8.49}\n\\end{gather*}\n$$\n\nSolving (8.46) and (8.47) by using (8.48) and (8.49) gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{s}}=\\frac{-\\left(y_{21 a}+y_{21 f}\\right)}{y_{i} y_{o}-\\left(y_{21 a}+y_{21 f}\\right)\\left(y_{12 a}+y_{12 f}\\right)} \\tag{8.50}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe equation can be put in the form of the ideal feedback equation of (8.35) by dividing by $y_{i} y_{o}$ to give\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{s}}=\\frac{\\frac{-\\left(y_{21 a}+y_{21 f}\\right)}{y_{i} y_{o}}}{1+\\frac{-\\left(y_{21 a}+y_{21 f}\\right)}{y_{i} y_{o}}\\left(y_{12 a}+y_{12 f}\\right)} \\tag{8.51}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nComparing (8.51) with (8{.35) gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& a=-\\frac{y_{21 a}+y_{21 f}}{y_{i} y_{o}}  \\tag{8.52}\\\\\n& f=y_{12 a}+y_{12 f} \\tag{8.53}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nAt this point, a number of approximations can be made that greatly simplify the calculations. First, we assume that the signal transmitted by the basic amplifier is much greater than the signal fed forward by the feedback network. Since the former has gain (usually large) while the latter has loss, this is almost invariably a valid assumption. This means that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left|y_{21 a}\\right| \\gg\\left|y_{21 f}\\right| \\tag{8.54}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSecond, we assume that the signal fed back by the feedback network is much greater than the signal fed back through the basic amplifier. Since most active devices have very small reverse transmission, the basic amplifier has a similar characteristic, and this assumption is almost invariably quite accurate. This assumption means that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left|y_{12 a}\\right| \\ll\\left|y_{12 f}\\right| \\tag{8.55}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nUsing (8.54) and (8.55) in (8.51) gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{s}}=A \\simeq \\frac{\\frac{-y_{21 a}}{y_{i} y_{o}}}{1+\\left(\\frac{-y_{21 a}}{y_{i} y_{o}}\\right) y_{12 f}} \\tag{8.56}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nComparing (8.56) with (8.35) gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\na & =-\\frac{y_{21 a}}{y_{i} y_{o}}  \\tag{8.57}\\\\\nf & =y_{12 f} \\tag{8.58}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nA circuit representation of (8.57) and (8.58) can be found as follows. Equations 8.54 and 8.55 mean that in Fig. 8.13a the feedback generator of the basic amplifier and the forwardtransmission generator of the feedback network may be neglected. If this is done the circuit may be redrawn as in Fig. 8.13b, where the terminal admittances $y_{11 f}$ and $y_{22 f}$ of the feedback network have been absorbed into the basic amplifier, together with source and load impedances $y_{S}$ and $y_{L}$. The new basic amplifier thus includes the loading effect of the original feedback network, and the new feedback network is an ideal one as used in Fig. 8.9. If the transfer function of the basic amplifier of Fig. 8.13 b is calculated (by first removing the feedback network), the result given in (8.57) is obtained. Similarly, the transfer function of the feedback network of Fig. 8.13 b is given by (8.58). Thus Fig. 8.13 b is a circuit representation of (8.57) and (8.58).\n\nSince Fig. $8.13 b$ has a direct correspondence with Fig. 8.9, all the results derived in Section 8.4.2 for Fig. 8.9 can now be used. The loading effect of the feedback network on the basic amplifier is now included by simply shunting input and output with $y_{11 f}$ and $y_{22 f}$, respectively. As shown in Fig. 8.14, these terminal admittances of the feedback network are calculated with the other port of the network short-circuited. In practice, loading term $y_{11 f}$ is simply obtained by shorting the output node of the amplifier and calculating the feedback circuit input admittance. Similarly, term $y_{22 f}$ is calculated by shorting the input node in the amplifier and calculating the feedback circuit output admittance. The feedback transfer function $f$ given by (8.58) is the short-circuit reverse transfer admittance of the feedback network and is defined in Fig. 8.14. This is readily calculated in practice and is often obtained by inspection. Note that the use of $y$ parameters in further calculations is not necessary. Once the circuit of Fig. $8.13 b$ is established, any convenient network analysis method may be used to calculate gain $a$ of the basic amplifier. We have simply used the two-port representation as a general means of illustrating how loading effects may be included in the calculations.\n\nFor example, consider the common shunt-shunt feedback circuit using an op amp as shown in Fig. 8.15a. The equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. $8.15 b$ and is redrawn in $8.15 c$ to allow for loading of the feedback network on the basic amplifier. The $y$ parameters of the feedback network can be found from Fig. 8.15d.\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& y_{11 f}=\\left.\\frac{i_{1}}{v_{1}}\\right|_{v_{2}=0}=\\frac{1}{R_{F}}  \\tag{8.59}\\\\\n& y_{22 f}=\\left.\\frac{i_{2}}{v_{2}}\\right|_{v_{1}=0}=\\frac{1}{R_{F}}  \\tag{8.60}\\\\\n& y_{12 f}=\\left.\\frac{i_{1}}{v_{2}}\\right|_{v_{1}=0}=-\\frac{1}{R_{F}}=f \\tag{8.61}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nUsing (8.54), we neglect $y_{21 f}$.\nThe basic-amplifier gain $a$ can be calculated from Fig. 8.15 c by putting $i_{f b}=0$ to give\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv_{1} & =\\frac{z_{i} R_{F}}{z_{i}+R_{F}} i_{i}  \\tag{8.62}\\\\\nv_{o} & =-\\frac{R}{R+z_{o}} a_{\\nu} v_{1} \\tag{8.63}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR=R_{F} \\| R_{L} \\tag{8.64}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:\n[\nname: RF, type: Resistor, value: RF, ports: {N1: In(A0), N2: vo}\nname: A0, type: OpAmp, value: A0, ports: {InP: GND, InN: In(A0), OutP: vo, OutN: GND}\nname: ii, type: CurrentSource, value: ii, ports: {Np: In(A0), Nn: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit diagram (a) represents a shunt-shunt feedback amplifier using an operational amplifier as the gain element.

    "text": "The shunt-shunt feedback amplifier depicted in Fig. 8.9 is analyzed, considering non-ideal network effects as displayed in Fig. 8.13a. This figure incorporates finite input and output admittances within both the forward and feedback paths, acknowledging reverse transmission in each. It assumes specific source and load admittances, denoted as $y_{S}$ and $y_{L}$. For this setup, the most suitable two-port representation is the short-circuit admittance parameters, or $y$ parameters, as demonstrated in Fig. 8.13a. This choice is due to the parallel connection of the amplifier and feedback network at the input and output, sharing the same terminal voltages. The $y$ parameters describe a network's response by relating terminal currents to terminal voltages, leading to straightforward calculations when terminal voltages are the same across networks. This simplicity will become apparent in subsequent circuit calculations. The $y$-parameter representation is further illustrated in Fig. 8.14.\n\nReferring to Fig. 8.13a, the input relation is given by:\n\n$$\ni_{s}=\\left(y_{S}+y_{11 a}+y_{11 f}\\right) v_{i}+\\left(y_{12 a}+y_{12 f}\\right) v_{o} \\tag{8.46}\n$$\n\nFigure 8.14 presents a two-port network depicted using the y-parameter model.

This results in Fig. 8.13b, where the terminal admittances of the feedback network are incorporated into the basic amplifier, along with source and load impedances. The new basic amplifier now includes the loading effect of the original feedback network, and the new feedback network is ideal, as shown in Fig. 8.9.\n\nThe transfer functions of the basic amplifier and feedback network in Fig. 8.13b correspond to (8.57) and (8.58), respectively. As Fig. 8.13b aligns with Fig. 8.9, the results derived for Fig. 8.9 in Section 8.4.2 can be applied.

The feedback transfer function $f$ given by (8.58) is the short-circuit reverse transfer admittance of the feedback network. Once the circuit of Fig. 8.13b is established, any convenient network analysis method can be used to calculate the gain $a$ of the basic amplifier.\n\nFor instance, consider the common shunt-shunt feedback circuit using an op amp as shown in Fig. 8.15a.

    "text": "Examine the shunt-shunt feedback amplifier depicted in Fig. 8.9. Incorporating the influence of non-ideal networks is demonstrated in Fig. 8.13a, where finite input and output admittances are considered within both the forward and feedback paths, along with reverse transmission for each. The admittances of the source and load, denoted as $y_{S}$ and $y_{L}$, are taken into account. For this scenario, the most suitable two-port representation is the short-circuit admittance parameters, or $y$ parameters, as depicted in Fig. 8.13a.

Equations 8.54 and 8.55 suggest that in Fig. 8.13a, the feedback generator of the basic amplifier and the forward transmission generator of the feedback network can be disregarded. With this simplification, the circuit can be redrawn as in Fig. 8.13b, where the terminal admittances $y_{11 f}$ and $y_{22 f}$ of the feedback network are incorporated into the basic amplifier, along with source and load impedances $y_{S}$ and $y_{L}$. The new basic amplifier thus encompasses the loading effect of the original feedback network, and the new feedback network is an ideal one as depicted in Fig. 8.9. If the transfer function of the basic amplifier of Fig. 8.13 b is computed (by first removing the feedback network), the result given in (8.57) is obtained. Similarly, the transfer function of the feedback network of Fig. 8.13 b is provided by (8.58). Thus Fig. 8.13 b represents a circuit depiction of (8.57) and (8.58).\n\nSince Fig. $8.13 b$ aligns directly with Fig. 8.9, all the results derived in Section 8.4.2 for Fig. 8.9 are now applicable. The loading effect of the feedback network on the basic amplifier is now accounted for by simply shunting input and output with $y_{11 f}$ and $y_{22 f}$, respectively. As shown in Fig. 8.14, these terminal admittances of the feedback network are determined with the other port of the network short-circuited. In practice, the loading term $y_{11 f}$ is obtained by shorting the output node of the amplifier and calculating the feedback circuit input admittance. Similarly, the term $y_{22 f}$ is calculated by shorting the input node in the amplifier and determining the feedback circuit output admittance. The feedback transfer function $f$ given by (8.58) is the short-circuit reverse transfer admittance of the feedback network, as defined in Fig. 8.14. This is readily calculated in practice and is often ascertained by inspection. It is important to note that the use of $y$ parameters in further calculations is not mandatory. Once the circuit of Fig. $8.13 b$ is established, any convenient network analysis method may be employed to compute the gain $a$ of the basic amplifier. We have simply utilized the two-port representation as a general means of illustrating how loading effects may be incorporated into the calculations.\n\nFor instance, consider the typical shunt-shunt feedback circuit using an op amp, as shown in Fig. 8.15a. The equivalent circuit is presented in Fig. $8.15 b$ and is redrawn in $8.15 c$ to account for the loading of the feedback network on the basic amplifier. The $y$ parameters of the feedback network can be determined from Fig. 8.15d.\n\n$$\ny_{11 f}=\\left.\\frac{i_{1}}{v_{1}}\\right|_{v_{2}=0}=\\frac{1}{R_{F}}  \\tag{8.59}\n$$\n\n$$\ny_{22 f}=\\left.\\frac{i_{2}}{v_{2}}\\right|_{v_{1}=0}=\\frac{1}{R_{F}}  \\tag{8.60}\n$$\n\n$$\ny_{12 f}=\\left.\\frac{i_{1}}{v_{2}}\\right|_{v_{1}=0}=-\\frac{1}{R_{F}}=f \\tag{8.61}\n$$\n\nUsing (8.54), we neglect $y_{21 f}$.\nThe gain $a$ of the basic amplifier can be calculated from Fig. 8.15 c by setting $i_{f b}=0$, leading to\n\n$$\nv_{1}=\\frac{z_{i} R_{F}}{z_{i}+R_{F}} i_{i}  \\tag{8.62}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nv_{o}=-\\frac{R}{R+z_{o}} a_{\\nu} v_{1} \\tag{8.63}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nR=R_{F} \\| R_{L} \\tag{8.64}\n$$\n\nSubstituting (8.62) into (8.63) yields\n\n$$\n\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{i}}=a=-\\frac{R}{R+z_{o}} a_{v} \\frac{z_{i} R_{F}}{z_{i}+R_{F}} \\tag{8.65}\n$$\n\nUtilizing the formulas derived in Section 8.4.2, we can now compute all parameters of the feedback circuit. The input and output impedances of the basic amplifier now include the effect of feedback loading, and these are the impedances that are divided by $(1+T)$ as outlined in Section 8.4.2. Thus, the input impedance of the basic amplifier of Fig. 8.15c is\n\n$$\nz_{i a}=R_{F} \\| z_{i}=\\frac{R_{F} z_{i}}{R_{F}+z_{i}} \\tag{8.66}\n$$\n\nWith feedback applied, the input impedance becomes\n\n$$\nZ_{i}=\\frac{z_{i a}}{1+T} \\tag{8.67}\n$$\n\nLikewise, for the output impedance of the basic amplifier\n\n$$\nz_{o a}=z_{o}\\left\\|R_{F}\\right\\| R_{L} \\tag{8.68}\n$$\n\nWith feedback applied, this transforms into\n\n$$\nZ_{o}=\\frac{z_{o}\\left\\|R_{F}\\right\\| R_{L}}{1+T} \\tag{8.69}\n$$\n\nIt is worth noting that these calculations can be performed using the circuit of Fig. 8.15c without any further need for two-port $y$ parameters.\n\nSince the loop gain $T$ is of significant interest, it is now calculated using (8.61) and (8.65):\n\n$$\nT=a f=\\frac{R_{F} R_{L}}{R_{F} R_{L}+z_{o} R_{F}+z_{o} R_{L}} a_{v} \\frac{z_{i}}{z_{i}+R_{F}} \\tag{8.70}\n$$\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nSuppose the circuit of Fig. $8.15 a$ is implemented with a NE5234 op amp with $R_{F}=1 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega$ and $R_{L}=10 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$, calculate the terminal impedances, loop gain, and overall gain of the feedback amplifier at low frequencies. The NE5234 specifications are $z_{i}=170 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega, z_{o}=15 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$, and $a_{v}=130,000$.\n\nFrom (8.66), the low-frequency input impedance of the basic amplifier, including loading, is\n\n$$\nz_{i a}=\\frac{10^{6} \\times 170 \\times 10^{3}}{10^{6}+170 \\times 10^{3}} \\Omega=145 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega \\tag{8.71}\n$$\n\nFrom (8.68), the low-frequency output impedance of the basic amplifier is\n\n$$\nz_{o a}=15 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega\\|1 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega\\| 10 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega \\simeq 5.96 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega \\tag{8.72}\n$$\n\nThe low-frequency loop gain can be calculated from (8.70) as\n\n$$\nT=\\frac{10^{6} \\times 10^{4}}{10^{6} \\times 10^{4}+15 \\times 10^{3} \\times 10^{6}+15 \\times 10^{3} \\times 10^{4}} \\times 130,000 \\times \\frac{170 \\times 10^{3}}{170 \\times 10^{3}+10^{6}} =7510 \\tag{8.73}\n$$\n\nThe loop gain in this case is substantial. Note that a finite source resistance at the input could significantly reduce this value.\n\nThe input impedance with feedback applied is found by substituting (8.71) and (8.73) into (8.67), resulting in\n\n$$\nZ_{i}=\\frac{145 \\times 10^{3}}{7511} \\Omega=19.3 \\Omega\n$$\n\nThe output impedance with feedback applied is determined by substituting (8.72) and (8.73) into (8.69), giving\n\n$$\nZ_{o}=\\frac{5.96 \\times 10^{3}}{7511} \\Omega=0.794 \\Omega\n$$\n\nIn practice, second-order effects in the circuit may lead to a higher value of $Z_{o}$.\nThe overall transfer function with feedback can be approximately derived from (8.8) as\n\n$$\n\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{i}}=A \\simeq \\frac{1}{f} \\tag{8.74}\n$$\n\nUsing (8.61) in (8.74) yields\n\n$$\n\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{i}}=A \\simeq-R_{F}\n$$\n\nSubstituting for $R_{F}$, we get\n\n$$\n\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{i}}=A \\simeq-1 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega \\tag{8.75}\n$$\n\nA more precise value of $A$ can be calculated from (8.5). Since the loop gain is high in this example, it is beneficial to rearrange (8.5) as follows:\n\n$$\nA=\\frac{1}{f} \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1}{a f}}  \\tag{8.76}\n$$\n\n$$\nA=\\frac{1}{f} \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1}{T}} \\tag{8.77}\n$$\n\nGiven the high value of $T$ in this example, $A$ is nearly equivalent to $1 / f$. Substituting $T=7510$ and $1 / f=$ $-1 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega$ into (8.77), we obtain\n\n$$\nA=-999,867 \\Omega \\tag{8.78}\n$$\n\nFor most practical purposes, (8.75) is sufficiently accurate."

    "text": "The shunt-shunt feedback amplifier depicted in Figure 8.9 is to be examined. The nonideal nature of networks can be accounted for, as illustrated in Figure 8.13a, where both the forward and feedback paths are considered to have finite input and output admittances, along with reverse transmission in each. Finite admittances for the source ($y_S$) and load ($y_L$) are considered. The most convenient two-port depiction in this scenario is the short-circuit admittance parameters, or $y$ parameters, as demonstrated in Figure 8.13a. This is due to the parallel connection of the basic amplifier and the feedback network at both input and output, resulting in identical terminal voltages for both. The $y$ parameters define the network's response by expressing terminal currents in terms of terminal voltages. \n\nThe image_name:(a) description: provides an illustration of a shunt-shunt feedback configuration employing y-parameters. The diagram includes a basic amplifier and a feedback network connected in parallel, with shared terminal voltages. The design is intended to streamline calculations by representing terminal currents based on terminal voltages.\n\nImage_name:(b) description: depicts the circuit diagram (b), which shows a shunt-shunt feedback configuration utilizing y-parameters. It presents a new setup for the basic amplifier and feedback network with parallel connections at the input and output terminals.\n\nIn Figure 8.13a, the input can be described by the equation:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{s}=\\left(y_{S}+y_{11 a}+y_{11 f}\\right) v_{i}+\\left(y_{12 a}+y_{12 f}\\right) v_{o} \\tag{8.46}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe image_name:Figure 8.14 description: reveals a two-port network using the y-parameter (admittance) model. The diagram features a rectangular symbol representing the two-port network with four terminals, detailing key components and their functions. The input current flows into the network at the left side and out at the right side, with voltages applied across the terminals. The y-parameters are essential for analyzing and designing interconnected circuits by converting complex interactions into linear equations.\n\nThe summation of currents at the output leads to the equation:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n0=\\left(y_{21 a}+y_{21 f}\\right) v_{i}+\\left(y_{L}+y_{22 a}+y_{22 f}\\right) v_{o} \\tag{8.47}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nUseful definitions are given by:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gather*}\ny_{i}=y_{S}+y_{11 a}+y_{11 f}  \\tag{8.48}\\\\\ny_{o}=y_{L}+y_{22 a}+y_{22 f} \\tag{8.49}\n\\end{gather*}\n$$\n\nSolving equations (8.46) and (8.47) using (8.48) and (8.49) yields:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{s}}=\\frac{-\\left(y_{21 a}+y_{21 f}\\right)}{y_{i} y_{o}-\\left(y_{21 a}+y_{21 f}\\right)\\left(y_{12 a}+y_{12 f}\\right)} \\tag{8.50}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nBy dividing by $y_{i} y_{o}$, the equation can be transformed into the form of the ideal feedback equation (8.35), resulting in:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{s}}=\\frac{\\frac{-\\left(y_{21 a}+y_{21 f}\\right)}{y_{i} y_{o}}}{1+\\frac{-\\left(y_{21 a}+y_{21 f}\\right)}{y_{i} y_{o}}\\left(y_{12 a}+y_{12 f}\\right)} \\tag{8.51}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nComparing (8.51) with (8.35) gives:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& a=-\\frac{y_{21 a}+y_{21 f}}{y_{i} y_{o}}  \\tag{8.52}\\\\\n& f=y_{12 a}+y_{12 f} \\tag{8.53}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSeveral approximations can be made to simplify calculations. First, the signal transmitted by the basic amplifier is much larger than the signal fed forward by the feedback network. This is valid because the amplifier has gain and the feedback network has loss. This implies:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left|y_{21 a}\\right| \\gg\\left|y_{21 f}\\right| \\tag{8.54}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSecond, the signal fed back by the feedback network is much larger than the signal fed back through the basic amplifier. Since most active devices have small reverse transmission, this assumption is generally accurate:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left|y_{12 a}\\right| \\ll\\left|y_{12 f}\\right| \\tag{8.55}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nUsing (8.54) and (8.55) in (8.51) results in:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{s}}=A \\simeq \\frac{\\frac{-y_{21 a}}{y_{i} y_{o}}}{1+\\left(\\frac{-y_{21 a}}{y_{i} y_{o}}\\right) y_{12 f}} \\tag{8.56}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nComparing (8.56) with (8.35) gives:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\na & =-\\frac{y_{21 a}}{y_{i} y_{o}}  \\tag{8.57}\\\\\nf & =y_{12 f} \\tag{8.58}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe circuit representation of (8.57) and (8.58) can be found by neglecting the feedback generator of the basic amplifier and the forward transmission generator of the feedback network in Figure 8.13a. This simplifies the circuit to the form shown in Figure 8.13b, where the terminal admittances $y_{11 f}$ and $y_{22 f}$ of the feedback network are absorbed into the basic amplifier, along with source and load admittances $y_S$ and $y_L$. This new basic amplifier incorporates the loading effect of the original feedback network, and the new feedback network is ideal as in Figure 8.9. The transfer functions of the basic amplifier and the feedback network of Figure 8.13b can be determined using these equations.\n\nSince Figure 8.13b corresponds to Figure 8.9, all the results from Section 8.4.2 for Figure 8.9 can be applied here. The loading effect of the feedback network on the basic amplifier is included by simply shunting the input and output with $y_{11 f}$ and $y_{22 f}$, respectively, as shown in Figure 8.14. The feedback transfer function $f$ given by (8.58) is the short-circuit reverse transfer admittance of the feedback network and is defined in Figure 8.14. This can be easily calculated in practice and is often obtained by inspection. The use of $y$ parameters in further calculations is not necessary once the circuit of Figure 8.13b is established. Any convenient network analysis method may be used to calculate the gain $a$ of the basic amplifier. The two-port representation is merely used to illustrate how loading effects can be included in calculations.\n\nFor instance, the common shunt-shunt feedback circuit using an operational amplifier, as shown in Figure 8.15a, can be represented by the equivalent circuit in Figure 8.15b. This circuit is further simplified in Figure 8.15c to account for the loading of the feedback network on the basic amplifier. The $y$ parameters of the feedback network can be determined from Figure 8.15d.\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& y_{11 f}=\\left.\\frac{i_{1}}{v_{1}}\\right|_{v_{2}=0}=\\frac{1}{R_{F}}  \\tag{8.59}\\\\\n& y_{22 f}=\\left.\\frac{i_{2}}{v_{2}}\\right|_{v_{1}=0}=\\frac{1}{R_{F}}  \\tag{8.60}\\\\\n& y_{12 f}=\\left.\\frac{i_{1}}{v_{2}}\\right|_{v_{1}=0}=-\\frac{1}{R_{F}}=f \\tag{8.61}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nUsing (8.54), $y_{21 f}$ is neglected.\n\nThe basic-amplifier gain $a$ can be calculated from Figure 8.15c by setting $i_{f b}=0$, resulting in:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv_{1} & =\\frac{z_{i} R_{F}}{z_{i}+R_{F}} i_{i}  \\tag{8.62}\\\\\nv_{o} & =-\\frac{R}{R+z_{o}} a_{\\nu} v_{1} \\tag{8.63}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR=R_{F} \\| R_{L} \\tag{8.64}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe image_name:(a) description: provides a representation of a shunt-shunt feedback amplifier using an operational amplifier as the gain element.

Finite source and load admitances, denoted as $y_{S}$ and $y_{L}$, are considered. The most practical two-port representation in this instance is the short-circuit admittance parameters, or $y$ parameters, as illustrated in Figure 8.13a.

This representation is advantageous for analyzing and designing circuits involving interconnected networks by simplifying complex interactions into linear equations.\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\ni_{1}=y_{11} v_{1}+y_{12} v_{2} & \\\\\ni_{2}=y_{21} v_{1}+y_{22} v_{2} & \\\\\ny_{11}=\\left.\\frac{i_{1}}{v_{1}}\\right|_{v_{2}=0} & y_{12}=\\left.\\frac{i_{1}}{v_{2}}\\right|_{v_{1}=0} \\\\\ny_{21}=\\left.\\frac{i_{2}}{v_{1}}\\right|_{v_{2}=0} & y_{22}=\\left.\\frac{i_{2}}{v_{2}}\\right|_{v_{1}=0}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nFigure 8.14 The $y$-parameter representation of a two-port.\n\nSumming currents at the output yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n0=\\left(y_{21 a}+y_{21 f}\\right) v_{i}+\\left(y_{L}+y_{22 a}+y_{22 f}\\right) v_{o} \\tag{8.47}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIt is beneficial to define\n\n$$\n\\begin{gather*}\ny_{i}=y_{S}+y_{11 a}+y_{11 f}  \\tag{8.48}\\\\\ny_{o}=y_{L}+y_{22 a}+y_{22 f} \\tag{8.49}\n\\end{gather*}\n$$\n\nSolving (8.46) and (8.47) using (8.48) and (8.49) results in\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{s}}=\\frac{-\\left(y_{21 a}+y_{21 f}\\right)}{y_{i} y_{o}-\\left(y_{21 a}+y_{21 f}\\right)\\left(y_{12 a}+y_{12 f}\\right)} \\tag{8.50}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nRearranging the equation by dividing by $y_{i} y_{o}$ yields the ideal feedback equation form of (8.35):\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{s}}=\\frac{\\frac{-\\left(y_{21 a}+y_{21 f}\\right)}{y_{i} y_{o}}}{1+\\frac{-\\left(y_{21 a}+y_{21 f}\\right)}{y_{i} y_{o}}\\left(y_{12 a}+y_{12 f}\\right)} \\tag{8.51}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nComparing (8.51) to (8.35) yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& a=-\\frac{y_{21 a}+y_{21 f}}{y_{i} y_{o}}  \\tag{8.52}\\\\\n& f=y_{12 a}+y_{12 f} \\tag{8.53}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nAt this stage, several approximations can be made to greatly simplify calculations. Initially, we assume that the signal transmitted by the basic amplifier is much larger than the signal forwarded by the feedback network. Given that the former has a high gain (usually substantial) and the latter has a loss, this assumption is typically valid. This implies\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left|y_{21 a}\\right| \\gg\\left|y_{21 f}\\right| \\tag{8.54}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSecond, we assume that the signal reflected by the feedback network is much larger than the signal reflected through the basic amplifier. Given that most active devices have negligible reverse transmission and the basic amplifier exhibits similar characteristics, this assumption is generally accurate. This assumption means that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left|y_{12 a}\\right| \\ll\\left|y_{12 f}\\right| \\tag{8.55}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nUtilizing (8.54) and (8.55) in (8.51) results in\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{s}}=A \\simeq \\frac{\\frac{-y_{21 a}}{y_{i} y_{o}}}{1+\\left(\\frac{-y_{21 a}}{y_{i} y_{o}}\\right) y_{12 f}} \\tag{8.56}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nComparing (8.56) to (8.35) gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\na & =-\\frac{y_{21 a}}{y_{i} y_{o}}  \\tag{8.57}\\\\\nf & =y_{12 f} \\tag{8.58}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe circuit representation of (8.57) and (8.58) can be established as follows. Equations 8.54 and 8.55 imply that in Figure 8.13a, the feedback generator of the basic amplifier and the forward-transmission generator of the feedback network can be disregarded. If this is done, the circuit can be redrawn as in Figure 8.13b, where the terminal admittances $y_{11 f}$ and $y_{22 f}$ of the feedback network have been incorporated into the basic amplifier, along with source and load impedances $y_{S}$ and $y_{L}$. The new basic amplifier thus incorporates the loading effect of the original feedback network, and the new feedback network is ideal, as shown in Figure 8.9. If the transfer function of the basic amplifier in Figure 8.13b is calculated (by initially removing the feedback network), the result given in (8.57) is obtained. Similarly, the transfer function of the feedback network in Figure 8.13b is provided by (8.58). Thus, Figure 8.13b is a circuit representation of (8.57) and (8.58).\n\nSince Figure $8.13 b$ corresponds directly with Figure 8.9, all the results derived in Section 8.4.2 for Figure 8.9 can now be applied. The loading effect of the feedback network on the basic amplifier is included by simply shunting the input and output with $y_{11 f}$ and $y_{22 f}$, respectively. As depicted in Figure 8.14, these terminal admittances of the feedback network are calculated with the other port of the network short-circuited. In practice, the loading term $y_{11 f}$ is simply obtained by short-circuiting the output node of the amplifier and calculating the feedback circuit input admittance. Similarly, term $y_{22 f}$ is calculated by short-circuiting the input node in the amplifier and calculating the feedback circuit output admittance. The feedback transfer function $f$ given by (8.58) is the short-circuit reverse transfer admittance of the feedback network and is defined in Figure 8.14. This is easily calculated in practice and is often obtained by inspection. Note that the use of $y$ parameters in further calculations is not necessary. Once the circuit of Figure $8.13 b$ is established, any suitable network analysis technique may be utilized to calculate the gain $a$ of the basic amplifier. We have merely employed the two-port representation to illustrate how loading effects can be incorporated into the calculations.\n\nFor instance, consider the common shunt-shunt feedback circuit utilizing an operational amplifier, as shown in Figure 8.15a. The equivalent circuit is presented in Figure $8.15 b$ and is redrawn in $8.15 c$ to account for the loading of the feedback network on the basic amplifier. The $y$ parameters of the feedback network are derived from Figure 8.15d.\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& y_{11 f}=\\left.\\frac{i_{1}}{v_{1}}\\right|_{v_{2}=0}=\\frac{1}{R_{F}}  \\tag{8.59}\\\\\n& y_{22 f}=\\left.\\frac{i_{2}}{v_{2}}\\right|_{v_{1}=0}=\\frac{1}{R_{F}}  \\tag{8.60}\\\\\n& y_{12 f}=\\left.\\frac{i_{1}}{v_{2}}\\right|_{v_{1}=0}=-\\frac{1}{R_{F}}=f \\tag{8.61}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nUsing (8.54), we ignore $y_{21 f}$.\nThe basic-amplifier gain $a$ can be calculated from Figure 8.15 c by setting $i_{f b}=0$, resulting in\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv_{1} & =\\frac{z_{i} R_{F}}{z_{i}+R_{F}} i_{i}  \\tag{8.62}\\\\\nv_{o} & =-\\frac{R}{R+z_{o}} a_{\\nu} v_{1} \\tag{8.63}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR=R_{F} \\| R_{L} \\tag{8.64}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:\n[\nname: RF, type: Resistor, value: RF, ports: {N1: In(A0), N2: vo}\nname: A0, type: OpAmp, value: A0, ports: {InP: GND, InN: In(A0), OutP: vo, OutN: GND}\nname: ii, type: CurrentSource, value: ii, ports: {Np: In(A0), Nn: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit diagram (a) illustrates a shunt-shunt feedback amplifier using an operational amplifier as the gain element.

Consequently, the new basic amplifier accounts for the loading effect of the original feedback network, and the new feedback network becomes ideal as depicted in Figure 8.9. If the transfer function of the basic amplifier in Figure 8.13b is calculated (by first removing the feedback network), the result given in (8.57) is achieved. Similarly, the transfer function of the feedback network in Figure 8.13b is given by (8.58).

The loading effect of the feedback network on the basic amplifier is accounted for by simply shunting the input and output with $y_{11 f}$ and $y_{22 f}$, respectively. As depicted in Figure 8.14, these terminal admittances of the feedback network are calculated with the other port of the network short-circuited. In practice, the loading term $y_{11 f}$ is simply obtained by shorting the output node of the amplifier and calculating the feedback circuit input admittance. Similarly, term $y_{22 f}$ is calculated by shorting the input node in the amplifier and calculating the feedback circuit output admittance. The feedback transfer function $f$ given by (8.58) is the short-circuit reverse transfer admittance of the feedback network and is defined in Figure 8.14. This is easily calculable in practice and is often obtainable through inspection. Note that the use of $y$ parameters in further calculations is not necessary. Once the circuit of Figure 8.13b is established, any convenient network analysis method may be utilized to calculate gain $a$ of the basic amplifier.

Here, finite input and output admittances are assumed in both the forward and feedback paths, as well as reverse transmission in each. Finite source and load admittances, $y_{S}$ and $y_{L}$, are considered. The most suitable two-port representation in this scenario is the short-circuit admittance parameters, or $y$ parameters, as utilized in Fig. 8.13a. This choice is due to the parallel connection of the basic amplifier and the feedback network at the input and output, resulting in identical voltages at their terminals. The $y$ parameters define a network's response by expressing terminal currents in terms of terminal voltages, leading to straightforward calculations when two networks share the same terminal voltages. This simplicity will become apparent in subsequent circuit calculations. The $y$-parameter representation is depicted in Fig. 8.14.\n\nIn Fig. 8.13a, at the input, the current $i_{s}$ is given by:\n\n$$\ni_{s}=\\left(y_{S}+y_{11 a}+y_{11 f}\\right) v_{i}+\\left(y_{12 a}+y_{12 f}\\right) v_{o} \\tag{8.46}\n$$\n\nFigure 8.14 illustrates the $y$-parameter representation of a two-port network. It consists of a block symbolizing the network with four terminals, labeled with voltages and currents. The input current $i_{1}$ enters the network on the left, and the output current $i_{2}$ exits on the right. The voltages $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ are applied across the input and output terminals, respectively. The direction of current flow is indicated by arrows. The y-parameters define how the input and output currents depend on the input and output voltages, simplifying the analysis of interconnected networks.\n\nAt the output, the sum of currents yields:\n\n$$\n0=\\left(y_{21 a}+y_{21 f}\\right) v_{i}+\\left(y_{L}+y_{22 a}+y_{22 f}\\right) v_{o} \\tag{8.47}\n$$\n\nIt is helpful to define:\n\n$$\ny_{i}=y_{S}+y_{11 a}+y_{11 f} \\tag{8.48}\n$$\n\n$$\ny_{o}=y_{L}+y_{22 a}+y_{22 f} \\tag{8.49}\n$$\n\nSolving equations (8.46) and (8.47) using (8.48) and (8.49) results in:\n\n$$\n\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{s}}=\\frac{-\\left(y_{21 a}+y_{21 f}\\right)}{y_{i} y_{o}-\\left(y_{21 a}+y_{21 f}\\right)\\left(y_{12 a}+y_{12 f}\\right)} \\tag{8.50}\n$$\n\nThis equation can be transformed into the ideal feedback equation (8.35) by dividing by $y_{i} y_{o}$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{s}}=\\frac{\\frac{-\\left(y_{21 a}+y_{21 f}\\right)}{y_{i} y_{o}}}{1+\\frac{-\\left(y_{21 a}+y_{21 f}\\right)}{y_{i} y_{o}}\\left(y_{12 a}+y_{12 f}\\right)} \\tag{8.51}\n$$\n\nComparing (8.51) with (8.35) yields:\n\n$$\na=-\\frac{y_{21 a}+y_{21 f}}{y_{i} y_{o}} \\tag{8.52}\n$$\n\n$$\nf=y_{12 a}+y_{12 f} \\tag{8.53}\n$$\n\nAt this stage, several approximations can be made to significantly simplify the calculations. First, it is assumed that the signal transmitted by the basic amplifier is much greater than the signal fed forward by the feedback network. This assumption is generally valid since the former has gain, usually large, while the latter has loss. This implies:\n\n$$\n\\left|y_{21 a}\\right| \\gg\\left|y_{21 f}\\right| \\tag{8.54}\n$$\n\nSecond, it is assumed that the signal fed back by the feedback network is much greater than the signal fed back through the basic amplifier. This assumption is nearly always accurate due to the small reverse transmission of most active devices. This means:\n\n$$\n\\left|y_{12 a}\\right| \\ll\\left|y_{12 f}\\right| \\tag{8.55}\n$$\n\nUsing (8.54) and (8.55) in (8.51) gives:\n\n$$\n\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{s}}=A \\simeq \\frac{\\frac{-y_{21 a}}{y_{i} y_{o}}}{1+\\left(\\frac{-y_{21 a}}{y_{i} y_{o}}\\right) y_{12 f}} \\tag{8.56}\n$$\n\nComparing (8.56) with (8.35) yields:\n\n$$\na=-\\frac{y_{21 a}}{y_{i} y_{o}} \\tag{8.57}\n$$\n\n$$\nf=y_{12 f} \\tag{8.58}\n$$\n\nA circuit representation of (8.57) and (8.58) can be constructed as follows. Equations 8.54 and 8.55 suggest that in Fig. 8.13a, the feedback generator of the basic amplifier and the forward transmission generator of the feedback network can be neglected. If this is done, the circuit can be redrawn as in Fig. 8.13b, where the terminal admittances $y_{11 f}$ and $y_{22 f}$ of the feedback network have been absorbed into the basic amplifier, along with source and load impedances $y_{S}$ and $y_{L}$. The new basic amplifier thus includes the loading effect of the original feedback network, and the new feedback network is an ideal one as used in Fig. 8.9. If the transfer function of the basic amplifier of Fig. 8.13b is calculated (by first removing the feedback network), the result given in (8.57) is obtained. Similarly, the transfer function of the feedback network of Fig. 8.13b is given by (8.58). Thus Fig. 8.13b is a circuit representation of (8.57) and (8.58).\n\nSince Fig. 8.13b has a direct correspondence with Fig. 8.9, all the results derived in Section 8.4.2 for Fig. 8.9 can now be applied. The loading effect of the feedback network on the basic amplifier is now included by simply shunting input and output with $y_{11 f}$ and $y_{22 f}$, respectively. As shown in Fig. 8.14, these terminal admittances of the feedback network are calculated with the other port of the network short-circuited. In practice, the loading term $y_{11 f}$ is obtained by shorting the output node of the amplifier and calculating the feedback circuit input admittance. Similarly, term $y_{22 f}$ is calculated by shorting the input node in the amplifier and calculating the feedback circuit output admittance. The feedback transfer function $f$ given by (8.58) is the short-circuit reverse transfer admittance of the feedback network and is defined in Fig. 8.14. This is readily calculated in practice and is often obtained by inspection. Note that the use of $y$ parameters in further calculations is not necessary. Once the circuit of Fig. 8.13b is established, any convenient network analysis method may be used to calculate gain $a$ of the basic amplifier. We have simply used the two-port representation as a general means of illustrating how loading effects may be included in the calculations.\n\nFor instance, consider the common shunt-shunt feedback circuit using an op amp as shown in Fig. 8.15a. The equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 8.15b and is redrawn in 8.15c to allow for loading of the feedback network on the basic amplifier. The $y$ parameters of the feedback network can be found from Fig. 8.15d.\n\n$$\ny_{11 f}=\\left.\\frac{i_{1}}{v_{1}}\\right|_{v_{2}=0}=\\frac{1}{R_{F}} \\tag{8.59}\n$$\n\n$$\ny_{22 f}=\\left.\\frac{i_{2}}{v_{2}}\\right|_{v_{1}=0}=\\frac{1}{R_{F}} \\tag{8.60}\n$$\n\n$$\ny_{12 f}=\\left.\\frac{i_{1}}{v_{2}}\\right|_{v_{1}=0}=-\\frac{1}{R_{F}}=f \\tag{8.61}\n$$\n\nUsing (8.54), we neglect $y_{21 f}$.\nThe basic-amplifier gain $a$ can be calculated from Fig. 8.15c by setting $i_{f b}=0$ to give:\n\n$$\nv_{1}=\\frac{z_{i} R_{F}}{z_{i}+R_{F}} i_{i} \\tag{8.62}\n$$\n\n$$\nv_{o}=-\\frac{R}{R+z_{o}} a_{\\nu} v_{1} \\tag{8.63}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n\n$$\nR=R_{F} \\| R_{L} \\tag{8.64}\n$$\n\nSubstituting (8.62) in (8.63) gives:\n\n$$\n\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{i}}=a=-\\frac{R}{R+z_{o}} a_{v} \\frac{z_{i} R_{F}}{z_{i}+R_{F}} \\tag{8.65}\n$$\n\nUsing the formulas derived in Section 8.4.2, we can now calculate all parameters of the feedback circuit. The input and output impedances of the basic amplifier now include the effect of feedback loading, and it is these impedances that are divided by $(1+T)$ as described in Section 8.4.2. Thus, the input impedance of the basic amplifier of Fig. 8.15c is:\n\n$$\nz_{i a}=R_{F} \\| z_{i}=\\frac{R_{F} z_{i}}{R_{F}+z_{i}} \\tag{8.66}\n$$\n\nWith feedback applied, the input impedance becomes:\n\n$$\nZ_{i}=\\frac{z_{i a}}{1+T} \\tag{8.67}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, for the output impedance of the basic amplifier:\n\n$$\nz_{o a}=z_{o}\\left\\|R_{F}\\right\\| R_{L} \\tag{8.68}\n$$\n\nWith feedback applied, this becomes:\n\n$$\nZ_{o}=\\frac{z_{o}\\left\\|R_{F}\\right\\| R_{L}}{1+T} \\tag{8.69}\n$$\n\nNote that these calculations can be made using the circuit of Fig. 8.15c without further need for two-port $y$ parameters.\n\nSince the loop gain $T$ is of considerable interest, this is now calculated using (8.61) and (8.65):\n\n$$\nT=a f=\\frac{R_{F} R_{L}}{R_{F} R_{L}+z_{o} R_{F}+z_{o} R_{L}} a_{v} \\frac{z_{i}}{z_{i}+R_{F}} \\tag{8.70}\n$$\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nAssuming that the circuit of Fig. 8.15a is realized using a NE5234 op amp with $R_{F}=1 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega$ and $R_{L}=10 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$, calculate the terminal impedances, loop gain, and overall gain of the feedback amplifier at low frequencies. The NE5234 data are $z_{i}=170 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega, z_{o}=15 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$, and $a_{v}=130,000$.\n\nFrom (8.66), the low-frequency input impedance of the basic amplifier including loading is:\n\n$$\nz_{i a}=\\frac{10^{6} \\times 170 \\times 10^{3}}{10^{6}+170 \\times 10^{3}} \\Omega=145 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega \\tag{8.71}\n$$\n\nFrom (8.68), the low-frequency output impedance of the basic amplifier is:\n\n$$\nz_{o a}=15 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega\\|1 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega\\| 10 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega \\simeq 5.96 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega \\tag{8.72}\n$$\n\nThe low-frequency loop gain can be calculated from (8.70) as:\n\n$$\nT=\\frac{10^{6} \\times 10^{4}}{10^{6} \\times 10^{4}+15 \\times 10^{3} \\times 10^{6}+15 \\times 10^{3} \\times 10^{4}} \\times 130,000 \\times \\frac{170 \\times 10^{3}}{170 \\times 10^{3}+10^{6}} =7510 \\tag{8.73}\n$$\n\nThe loop gain in this case is large. Note that a finite source resistance at the input could reduce this significantly.\n\nThe input impedance with feedback applied is found by substituting (8.71) and (8.73) in (8.67) to give:\n\n$$\nZ_{i}=\\frac{145 \\times 10^{3}}{7511} \\Omega=19.3 \\Omega\n$$\n\nThe output impedance with feedback applied is found by substituting (8.72) and (8.73) in (8.69) to give:\n\n$$\nZ_{o}=\\frac{5.96 \\times 10^{3}}{7511} \\Omega=0.794 \\Omega\n$$\n\nIn practice, second-order effects in the circuit may result in a larger value of $Z_{o}$.\nThe overall transfer function with feedback can be found approximately from (8.8) as:\n\n$$\n\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{i}}=A \\simeq \\frac{1}{f} \\tag{8.74}\n$$\n\nUsing (8.61) in (8.74) gives:\n\n$$\n\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{i}}=A \\simeq-R_{F}\n$$\n\nSubstituting for $R_{F}$ we obtain:\n\n$$\n\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{i}}=A \\simeq-1 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega \\tag{8.75}\n$$\n\nA more exact value of $A$ can be calculated from (8.5). Since the loop gain is large in this case, it is useful to transform (8.5) as follows:\n\n$$\nA=\\frac{1}{f} \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1}{a f}} \\tag{8.76}\n$$\n\n$$\nA=\\frac{1}{f} \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1}{T}} \\tag{8.77}\n$$\n\nSince $T$ is high in this example, $A$ differs little from $1 / f$. Substituting $T=7510$ and $1 / f=$ $-1 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega$ in (8.77), we obtain:\n\n$$\nA=-999,867 \\Omega \\tag{8.78}\n$$\n\nFor most practical purposes, (8.75) is sufficiently accurate."

The influence of non-ideal networks is illustrated in Fig. 8.13a, incorporating finite input and output admittances in both the forward and feedback paths, along with reverse transmission in each. The admittances of the source and load, denoted as \\( y_S \\) and \\( y_L \\), are considered finite. In this scenario, the most suitable two-port representation is the short-circuit admittance parameters, or \\( y \\) parameters, as demonstrated in Fig. 8.13a. This choice is due to the parallel connection of the basic amplifier and the feedback network at the input and output, resulting in matching terminal voltages. The \\( y \\) parameters describe a network's response by expressing terminal currents as functions of terminal voltages.\n\nFigures 8.13a and 8.13b depict the shunt-shunt feedback configuration using \\( y \\)-parameters. Figure 8.13a shows the basic amplifier and feedback network in parallel, sharing the same terminal voltages, simplifying calculations by expressing terminal currents in terms of terminal voltages. Figure 8.13b presents a redrawn version of 8.13a, omitting generators \\( y_{21f} v_i \\) and \\( y_{12a} v_o \\).\n\nThe \\( y \\)-parameter representation simplifies calculations when networks share identical terminal voltages, as demonstrated in subsequent circuit calculations. This representation is further illustrated in Fig. 8.14.\n\nIn Fig. 8.13a, the input current is given by:\n\n\\[ i_s = (y_S + y_{11a} + y_{11f}) v_i + (y_{12a} + y_{12f}) v_o \\tag{8.46} \\]\n\nFig. 8.14 represents a two-port network using the \\( y \\)-parameter (admittance) model. It features a block symbolizing the two-port network with four terminals, clearly labeled with voltages and currents for input and output. The model defines how input and output currents depend on the respective voltages through the \\( y \\)-parameters, facilitating the analysis and design of circuits involving interconnected networks.\n\nThe summation of currents at the output yields:\n\n\\[ 0 = (y_{21a} + y_{21f}) v_i + (y_L + y_{22a} + y_{22f}) v_o \\tag{8.47} \\]\n\nIt is helpful to define:\n\n\\[ y_i = y_S + y_{11a} + y_{11f} \\tag{8.48} \\]\n\\[ y_o = y_L + y_{22a} + y_{22f} \\tag{8.49} \\]\n\nSolving equations (8.46) and (8.47) using (8.48) and (8.49) results in:\n\n\\[ \\frac{v_o}{i_s} = \\frac{-(y_{21a} + y_{21f})}{y_i y_o - (y_{21a} + y_{21f})(y_{12a} + y_{12f})} \\tag{8.50} \\]\n\nBy dividing by \\( y_i y_o \\), equation (8.50) can be transformed into the ideal feedback equation (8.35):\n\n\\[ \\frac{v_o}{i_s} = \\frac{\\frac{-(y_{21a} + y_{21f})}{y_i y_o}}{1 + \\frac{-(y_{21a} + y_{21f})}{y_i y_o}(y_{12a} + y_{12f})} \\tag{8.51} \\]\n\nComparing (8.51) with (8.35) yields:\n\n\\[ a = -\\frac{y_{21a} + y_{21f}}{y_i y_o} \\tag{8.52} \\]\n\\[ f = y_{12a} + y_{12f} \\tag{8.53} \\]\n\nAt this stage, several approximations can be made to greatly simplify calculations. First, it is assumed that the signal transmitted by the basic amplifier is much greater than the signal fed forward by the feedback network. This assumption is generally valid since the former has gain, while the latter has loss. This implies:\n\n\\[ |y_{21a}| \\gg |y_{21f}| \\tag{8.54} \\]\n\nSecond, it is assumed that the signal fed back by the feedback network is much greater than the signal fed back through the basic amplifier. This assumption is also generally accurate, considering that most active devices have very small reverse transmission. This assumption means:\n\n\\[ |y_{12a}| \\ll |y_{12f}| \\tag{8.55} \\]\n\nUsing (8.54) and (8.55) in (8.51) gives:\n\n\\[ \\frac{v_o}{i_s} = A \\simeq \\frac{\\frac{-y_{21a}}{y_i y_o}}{1 + \\left(\\frac{-y_{21a}}{y_i y_o}\\right) y_{12f}} \\tag{8.56} \\]\n\nComparing (8.56) with (8.35) yields:\n\n\\[ a = -\\frac{y_{21a}}{y_i y_o} \\tag{8.57} \\]\n\\[ f = y_{12f} \\tag{8.58} \\]\n\nThe circuit representation of (8.57) and (8.58) can be derived as follows.

    "text": "In examining the series-series feedback arrangement depicted in Fig. 8.12, the impact of non-ideal networks can be quantified through the model presented in Fig. 8.16a. In this scenario, the most practical two-port network representation involves the utilization of open-circuit impedance parameters, or $z$ parameters, since the fundamental amplifier and the feedback network are interconnected in series at both the input and output, thereby sharing the same current at their respective terminals. As illustrated in Fig. 8.17, the $z$ parameters delineate the network by expressing terminal voltages as functions of terminal currents, which simplifies the computational process when the networks exhibit shared terminal currents. The calculation in this instance proceeds as the precise dual of that described in Section 8.5.1. From Fig. 8.16, the sum of the input voltages yields:\n\n$$\nv_{s}=\\left(z_{S}+z_{11 a}+z_{11 f}\\right) i_{i}+\\left(z_{12 a}+z_{12 f}\\right) i_{o} \\tag{8.79}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, summing the output voltages results in:\n\n$$\n0=\\left(z_{21 a}+z_{21 f}\\right) i_{i}+\\left(z_{L}+z_{22 a}+z_{22 f}\\right) i_{o} \\tag{8.80}\n$$\n\nIt is beneficial to define:\n\n$$\nz_{i} =z_{S}+z_{11 a}+z_{11 f}  \\tag{8.81}\n$$\n\n$$\nz_{o} =z_{L}+z_{22 a}+z_{22 f} \\tag{8.82}\n$$\n\nDisregarding reverse transmission through the basic amplifier, we posit that:\n\n$$\n\\left|z_{12 a}\\right| \\ll\\left|z_{12 f}\\right| \\tag{8.83}\n$$\n\nAnd neglecting feed-forward through the feedback network, we can assert:\n\n$$\n\\left|z_{21 a}\\right| \\gg\\left|z_{21 f}\\right| \\tag{8.84}\n$$\n\nWith these assumptions, it follows that:\n\n$$\n\\frac{i_{o}}{v_{s}}=A \\simeq \\frac{\\frac{-z_{21 a}}{z_{i} z_{o}}}{1+\\left(\\frac{-z_{21 a}}{z_{i} z_{o}}\\right) z_{12 f}}=\\frac{a}{1+a f} \\tag{8.85}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n\n$$\na=-\\frac{z_{21 a}}{z_{i} z_{o}}  \\tag{8.86}\n$$\n\n$$\nf=z_{12 f} \\tag{8.87}\n$$\n\nA circuit representation of $a$ in (8.86) and $f$ in (8.87) can be derived by removing generators $z_{21 f} i_{i}$ and $z_{12 a} i_{o}$ from Fig. $8.16 a$ in accordance with (8.83) and (8.84). This yields the approximate representation of Fig. $8.16b$, wherein the revised basic amplifier incorporates the loading effect of the original feedback network. The new feedback network is an ideal one, as utilized in Fig. 8.12. The transfer function of the basic amplifier in Fig. $8.16b$ corresponds to that in (8.86), and the transfer function of the feedback network in Fig. $8.16 b$ is given by (8.87). Thus, Fig. $8.16 b$ serves as a circuit representation of (8.86) and (8.87).\n\nGiven that Fig. 8.16b aligns directly with Fig. 8.12, the findings of Section 8.4.4 are now applicable. The loading effect of the feedback network on the basic amplifier is incorporated by connecting the feedback-network terminal impedances $z_{11 f}$ and $z_{22 f}$ in series at the input and output of the basic amplifier. The terms $z_{11 f}$ and $z_{22 f}$ are defined in Fig. 8.17 and are obtained by calculating the terminal impedances of the feedback network with the other port open-circuited. The feedback function $f$ provided by (8.87) represents the reverse transfer impedance of the feedback network.\n\nFor instance, consider the series-series feedback triple depicted in Fig. 8.18a, which serves as a wideband feedback amplifier. $R_{E 2}$ is typically a small resistor that samples the output current $i_{o}$, and the resulting voltage across $R_{E 2}$ is sampled by the divider $R_{F}$ and $R_{E 1}$ to generate a feedback voltage across $R_{E 1}$. Generally, $R_{F} \\gg R_{E 1}$ and $R_{E 2}$.\n\nThe two-port theory previously established cannot be directly applied here since the basic amplifier cannot be represented by a two-port network. However, the techniques developed using two-port theory can be adapted with minor alterations by first recognizing that the feedback network can be represented by a two-port network, as shown in 8.18 b. One challenge with this circuit is that the feedback generator $z_{12} i_{e 3}$ is located at the emitter of $Q_{1}$ and not at the input lead where it can be directly compared with $v_{s}$. This issue can be resolved by examining the small-signal equivalent of the input portion of this circuit, as depicted in Fig. 8.19. For this circuit:\n\n$$\nv_{s}=i_{i} z_{S}+v_{b e}+i_{e 1} z_{11 f}+z_{12 f} i_{e 3} \\tag{8.88}\n$$\n\nSubstituting:\n\n$$\ni_{e 3}=\\frac{i_{o}}{\\alpha_{3}} \\tag{8.89}\n$$\n\ninto (8.88) yields:\n\n$$\nv_{s}-z_{12 f} \\frac{i_{o}}{\\alpha_{3}}=i_{i} z_{S}+v_{b e}+i_{e 1} z_{11 f} \\tag{8.90}\n$$\n\nwhere the quantities in these equations pertain to small-signal attributes. Equation 8.90 demonstrates that the feedback voltage generator $z_{12 f}\\left(i_{o} / \\alpha_{3}\\right)$ can be relocated back in series with the input lead; if this were done, the same equation would result (see Fig. 8.18c). Note that the common-base current gain $\\alpha_{3}$ of $Q_{3}$ is included in this feedback expression because the output current is sampled by $R_{E 2}$ at the emitter of $Q_{3}$ to provide a corrective signal to the input. This issue is common to most circuits that employ series feedback at the output, and the $\\alpha_{3}$ of $Q_{3}$ lies outside the feedback loop. There are numerous applications where this poses no issue since $\\alpha \\simeq 1$. However, if high gain precision is necessary, variations in $\\alpha_{3}$ can lead to complications.\n\nThe $z$ parameters of the feedback network can be ascertained from Fig. 8.20 as follows:\n\n$$\nz_{12 f}=\\left.\\frac{v_{1}}{i_{2}}\\right|_{i_{1}=0}=\\frac{R_{E 1} R_{E 2}}{R_{E 1}+R_{E 2}+R_{F}}  \\tag{8.91}\n$$\n\n$$\nz_{22 f}=\\left.\\frac{v_{2}}{i_{2}}\\right|_{i_{1}=0}=R_{E 2} \\|\\left(R_{E 1}+R_{F}\\right)  \\tag{8.92}\n$$\n\n$$\nz_{11 f}=\\left.\\frac{v_{1}}{i_{1}}\\right|_{i_{2}=0}=R_{E 1} \\|\\left(R_{F}+R_{E 2}\\right) \\tag{8.93}\n$$\n\nUsing (8.84), we disregard $z_{21}$.\n\nBased on the preceding findings, we can reconfigure the circuit of Fig. $8.18 b$ as illustrated in Fig. $8.18c$. As in previous computations, the signal fed forward via the feedback network (in this case, $\\left.z_{21} i_{e 1}\\right)$ is ignored. The feedback voltage generator is positioned in series with the input lead, establishing an ideal differencing node at the input. The impact of feedback loading on the basic amplifier is represented by the impedances present in the emitters of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{3}$. It should be noted that this case differs somewhat from the example in Fig. $8.16 b$ in that the impedances $z_{11 f}$ and $z_{22 f}$ of the feedback network are depicted in series with the input and output leads in Fig. $8.16b$, whereas in Fig. $8.18 c$ these impedances are situated in the emitters of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{3}$. This discrepancy arises because the basic amplifier in the circuit of Fig. 8.18a cannot be represented by two-port $z$ parameters but does not affect the analytical method. Since the feedback voltage generator in Fig. $8.18 c$ is directly in series with the input and is proportional to $i_{o}$, a direct correlation with Fig. $8.16 b$ can be established, allowing the application of the results from Section 8.4.4. There is no further need for the $z$ parameters, and by inspection, we can write:\n\n$$\n\\frac{i_{o}}{v_{s}}=A \\simeq \\frac{a}{1+a f} \\tag{8.94}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n\n$$\nf=\\frac{z_{12 f}}{\\alpha_{3}}=\\frac{1}{\\alpha_{3}} \\frac{R_{E 1} R_{E 2}}{R_{E 1}+R_{E 2}+R_{F}} \\tag{8.95}\n$$\n\nand $a$ denotes the transconductance of the circuit in Fig. $8.18 c$ with the feedback generator $\\left[\\left(z_{12 f} / \\alpha_{3}\\right) i_{o}\\right]$ removed.\n\nThe input impedance perceived by $v_{s}$ with feedback applied is $(1+a f)$ times the input impedance of the basic amplifier of Fig. 8.18c, inclusive of feedback loading.\n\nThe output impedance with feedback applied is $(1+a f)$ times the output impedance of the basic amplifier, taking into account feedback loading.\n\nIf the loop gain $T=a f$ is substantial, then the gain with feedback applied is:\n\n$$\nA=\\frac{i_{o}}{v_{s}} \\simeq \\frac{1}{f}=\\alpha_{3} \\frac{R_{E 1}+R_{E 2}+R_{F}}{R_{E 1} R_{E 2}} \\tag{8.96}\n$$\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nA commercial integrated circuit ${ }^{2}$ based on the series-series triple is the MC 1553 shown in Fig. 8.21a. Calculate the terminal impedances, loop gain, and overall gain of this amplifier at low frequencies.\n\nThe MC 1553 is a wideband amplifier with a bandwidth of 50 MHz at a voltage gain of 50. The circuit gain is achieved through the series-series triple composed of $Q_{1}, Q_{2}$, and $Q_{3}$. The output voltage is developed across the load resistor $R_{C}$ and is then fed to the output via emitter follower $Q_{4}$, which ensures a low output impedance. The remainder of the circuit primarily serves biasing purposes, excluding capacitors $C_{P}, C_{F}$, and $C_{B}$. Capacitors $C_{P}$ and $C_{F}$ are small capacitors of several picofarads and are included on the chip. They guarantee stability of the feedback loop, and their function will be detailed in Chapter 9. Capacitor $C_{B}$ is external to the chip and is a large bypass capacitor used to decouple the bias circuitry at the signal frequencies of interest.\n\nBias Calculation. The analysis of the circuit commences with the bias conditions. The bias current levels are dictated by the reference current $I_{R K}$ in resistor $R_{K}$, and assuming $V_{B E(\\text { on })}=0.6 \\mathrm{~V}$ and $V_{C C}=6 \\mathrm{~V}$, we obtain:\n\n$$\nI_{R K}=\\frac{V_{C C}-2 V_{B E(\\mathrm{on})}}{R_{K}} \\tag{8.97}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the values in (8.97) yields:\n\n$$\nI_{R K}=\\frac{6-1.2}{6000} \\mathrm{~A}=0.80 \\mathrm{~mA}\n$$\n\nThe current in the output emitter follower $Q_{4}$ is determined by the currents in $Q_{6}$ and $Q_{8}$. Transistor $Q_{8}$ has an area three times that of $Q_{7}$ and $Q_{6}$, hence:\n\n$$\nI_{C 8}=3 \\times 0.8 \\mathrm{~mA}=2.4 \\mathrm{~mA}\n$$\n\n$$\nI_{C 6}=0.8 \\mathrm{~mA}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\beta_{F}$ is assumed to be large in these bias calculations. If the base current of $Q_{1}$ is negligible, all of $I_{C 6}$ and $I_{C 8}$ flow through $Q_{4}$, leading to:\n\n$$\nI_{C 4} \\simeq I_{C 6}+I_{C 8} \\tag{8.98}\n$$\n\nThus:\n\n$$\nI_{C 4} \\simeq 3.2 \\mathrm{~mA}\n$$\n\nTransistor $Q_{8}$ primarily supplies the bias current to $Q_{4}$, with this device functioning as a Class A emitter-follower output stage, as described in Section 5.2. The role of $Q_{6}$ is to facilitate the formation of a negative-feedback bias loop for stabilization of the dc operating point, and resistor $R_{G}$ is selected to induce a sufficient dc voltage drop to enable the connection of $R_{D}$ back to the base of $Q_{1}$. Transistors $Q_{1}, Q_{2}, Q_{3}$, and $Q_{4}$ are then interconnected in a negative-feedback bias loop, allowing the dc conditions to be ascertained approximately as follows.\n\nAssuming $Q_{2}$ is activated, the voltage at the collector of $Q_{1}$ is approximately 0.6 V, and the voltage across $R_{A}$ is 5.4 V. Thus, the current through $R_{A}$ is:\n\n$$\nI_{R A} =\\frac{5.4}{R_{A}}\n$$\n\n$$\nI_{R A} =\\frac{5.4}{9000}=0.6 \\mathrm{~mA} \\tag{8.99}\n$$\n\nIf $\\beta_{F}$ is assumed to be high, it follows that:\n\n$$\nI_{C 1} \\simeq I_{R A}=0.6 \\mathrm{~mA} \\tag{8.100}\n$$\n\nSince the voltage across $R_{E 1}$ is minimal, the voltage at the base of $Q_{1}$ is approximately 0.6 V, and if the base current of $Q_{1}$ is insignificant, this is also the voltage at the collector of $Q_{6}$, as any voltage across $R_{D}$ will be small. The dc output voltage can be expressed as:\n\n$$\nV_{O}=V_{C 6}+I_{C 6} R_{G} \\tag{8.101}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the values yields:\n\n$$\nV_{O}=(0.6+0.8 \\times 3) \\mathrm{V}=3 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nThe voltage at the base of $Q_{4}$ (collector of $Q_{3}$) is $V_{B E}$ above $V_{O}$ and is thus 3.6 V. The collector current of $Q_{3}$ is:\n\n$$\nI_{C 3} \\simeq \\frac{V_{C C}-V_{C 3}}{R_{C}} \\tag{8.102}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the parameter values gives:\n\n$$\nI_{C 3} \\simeq \\frac{6-3.6}{600} \\mathrm{~A}=4 \\mathrm{~mA}\n$$\n\nThe voltage at the base of $Q_{3}$ (collector of $Q_{2}$) is:\n\n$$\nV_{B 3} \\simeq-I_{E 3} R_{E 2}+V_{B E(\\mathrm{on})} \\tag{8.103}\n$$\n\nThus:\n\n$$\nV_{B 3}=V_{C 2} \\simeq(4 \\times 0.1+0.6) \\mathrm{V}=1 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\n$I_{C 2}$ can be calculated from:\n\n$$\nI_{C 2} \\simeq \\frac{V_{C C}-V_{C 2}}{R_{B}} \\tag{8.104}\n$$\n\nand substituting the parameter values gives:\n\n$$\nI_{C 2} \\simeq \\frac{6-1}{5000} \\mathrm{~A}=1 \\mathrm{~mA}\n$$\n\nThe ac Calculation. The ac analysis can now proceed using the methodologies previously developed in this chapter. For the purposes of ac analysis, the feedback triple composed of $Q_{1}, Q_{2}$, and $Q_{3}$ in Fig. 8.21 $a$ is analogous to the circuit in Fig. 8.18a, and the conclusions derived earlier for the latter circuit are directly applicable to the triple in Fig. 8.21a. To determine the voltage gain of the circuit in Fig. 8.21a, we simply multiply the transconductance of the triple by the load resistor $R_{C}$, since the gain of the emitter follower $Q_{4}$ is almost exactly"

This yields the approximate representation in Figure 8.16b, where the revised basic amplifier incorporates the loading effect of the original feedback network. The new feedback network is an ideal one, as utilized in Figure 8.12. The transfer function of the basic amplifier in Figure 8.16b corresponds to equation (8.86), and the transfer function of the feedback network in Figure 8.16b is given by equation (8.87).

The terms \\( z_{11 f} \\) and \\( z_{22 f} \\) are defined in Figure 8.17 and are obtained by calculating the terminal impedances of the feedback network with the other port open-circuited. The feedback function \\( f \\) from equation (8.87) is the reverse transfer impedance of the feedback network.\n\nFor instance, consider the series-series feedback triple depicted in Figure 8.18a, which serves as a wideband feedback amplifier. \\( R_{E 2} \\) is typically a small resistor that samples the output current \\( i_{o} \\), and the resulting voltage across \\( R_{E 2} \\) is sampled by the divider \\( R_{F} \\) and \\( R_{E 1} \\) to generate a feedback voltage across \\( R_{E 1} \\).

    "text": "Examine the series-series feedback arrangement depicted in Fig. 8.12. The impact of less-than-ideal networks can be determined through the illustration in Fig. 8.16a. For this scenario, the most suitable two-port network representation involves the employment of open-circuit impedance parameters, denoted as $z$ parameters. This choice is due to the fact that the fundamental amplifier and the feedback network are now sequentially linked at both the input and the output, leading to matching currents at their respective terminals. As depicted in Fig. 8.17, the $z$ parameters are instrumental in defining the network by expressing terminal voltages as functions of terminal currents. This facilitates simplified calculations when the two networks share common terminal currents. The computations for this instance proceed as the precise dual of those outlined in Section 8.5.1. By analyzing Fig. 8.16, the aggregation of voltages at the input yields the following:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{s}=\\left(z_{S}+z_{11 a}+z_{11 f}\\right) i_{i}+\\left(z_{12 a}+z_{12 f}\\right) i_{o} \\tag{8.79}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe diagram labeled \"Figure 8.17\" presents a two-port network utilizing z-parameters, or impedance parameters. It is depicted as a block diagram featuring two sets of terminals, one on the left and one on the right. The left terminals are designated with voltage $v_1$ and current $i_1$, whereas the right terminals are labeled with voltage $v_2$ and current $i_2$. Current $i_1$ flows into the block from the left, and $i_2$ flows out from the right, signifying the direction of current flow.\n\nThe principal components of this diagram include:\n\n- **Two-Port Network Block:** This is the central element of the diagram, acting as a black box that correlates input and output voltages and currents via z-parameters.\n\nThe flow of information or control is as follows:\n\n- **Input Side:** Voltage $v_1$ and current $i_1$ enter the block from the left.\n- **Output Side:** Voltage $v_2$ and current $i_2$ exit the block on the right.\n- The interplay between these voltages and currents is governed by the z-parameters.\n\nLabels, annotations, and key indicators include:\n\n- **Z-Parameters Equations:**\n- $v_1 = z_{11} i_1 + z_{12} i_2$\n- $v_2 = z_{21} i_1 + z_{22} i_2$\n- **Definitions of Z-Parameters:**\n- $z_{11} = \\frac{v_1}{i_1} \\bigg|_{i_2=0}$: Input impedance with output open-circuited.\n- $z_{21} = \\frac{v_2}{i_1} \\bigg|_{i_2=0}$: Forward transfer impedance with output open-circuited.\n- $z_{12} = \\frac{v_1}{i_2} \\bigg|_{i_1=0}$: Reverse transfer impedance with input open-circuited.\n- $z_{22} = \\frac{v_2}{i_2} \\bigg|_{i_1=0}$: Output impedance with input open-circuited.\n\nThe overall system function of this two-port network is to delineate the relationship between input and output voltages and currents using the z-parameter model. This model is particularly apt for analyzing networks where impedance is the focal point, enabling the computation of voltages and currents when the network is linked to external circuits. The z-parameters offer a convenient method for expressing these relationships, especially for intricate networks, by utilizing open-circuit conditions to delineate the parameters.\n\nThe diagram labeled \"Figure 8.17\" illustrates the z-parameter representation of a two-port network.\n\nBy summing voltages at the output, we derive the following:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n0=\\left(z_{21 a}+z_{21 f}\\right) i_{i}+\\left(z_{L}+z_{22 a}+z_{22 f}\\right) i_{o} \\tag{8.80}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIt is advantageous to define:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nz_{i} & =z_{S}+z_{11 a}+z_{11 f}  \\tag{8.81}\\\\\nz_{o} & =z_{L}+z_{22 a}+z_{22 f} \\tag{8.82}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nOnce again, assuming negligible reverse transmission through the basic amplifier, we posit that:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left|z_{12 a}\\right| \\ll\\left|z_{12 f}\\right| \\tag{8.83}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAdditionally, disregarding feed-forward through the feedback network, we can assert that:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left|z_{21 a}\\right| \\gg\\left|z_{21 f}\\right| \\tag{8.84}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWith these premises, it follows that:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{i_{o}}{v_{s}}=A \\simeq \\frac{\\frac{-z_{21 a}}{z_{i} z_{o}}}{1+\\left(\\frac{-z_{21 a}}{z_{i} z_{o}}\\right) z_{12 f}}=\\frac{a}{1+a f} \\tag{8.85}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& a=-\\frac{z_{21 a}}{z_{i} z_{o}}  \\tag{8.86}\\\\\n& f=z_{12 f} \\tag{8.87}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nA circuit representation of $a$ from (8.86) and $f$ from (8.87) can be derived by excising generators $z_{21 f} i_{i}$ and $z_{12 a} i_{o}$ from Fig. $8.16 a$, in alignment with (8.83) and (8.84). This yields the approximate representation in Fig. $8.16b$, where the revised basic amplifier incorporates the loading effect of the original feedback network. The new feedback network is ideal, as utilized in Fig. 8.12. The transfer function of the basic amplifier in Fig. $8.16b$ is identical to (8.86), and the transfer function of the feedback network in Fig. $8.16 b$ is expressed by (8.87). Hence, Fig. $8.16 b$ serves as a circuit representation of (8.86) and (8.87).\n\nGiven that Fig. 8.16b aligns directly with Fig. 8.12, all the findings of Section 8.4.4 are now applicable. The loading effect of the feedback network on the basic amplifier is accounted for by connecting the feedback-network terminal impedances $z_{11 f}$ and $z_{22 f}$ in series at the input and output of the basic amplifier. The terms $z_{11 f}$ and $z_{22 f}$ are defined in Fig. 8.17 and are obtained by calculating the terminal impedances of the feedback network with the alternate port open-circuited. The feedback function $f$ as stated in (8.87) represents the reverse transfer impedance of the feedback network.\n\nConsider, as an example, the series-series feedback triplet of Fig. 8.18a, which serves as a broadband feedback amplifier. $R_{E 2}$ is typically a low-value resistor that samples the output current $i_{o}$, and the resulting voltage across $R_{E 2}$ is sampled by the divider $R_{F}$ and $R_{E 1}$ to generate a feedback voltage across $R_{E 1}$. Generally is common for $R_{F}$ to be significantly larger than $R_{E 1}$ and $R_{E 2}$.\n\nThe two-port theory established earlier is not directly applicable in this instance because the basic amplifier cannot be depicted by a two-port model. However, the techniques previously developed using two-port theory can be adapted with minor alterations by first acknowledging that the feedback network can be represented by a two-port, as demonstrated in 8.18 b. One challenge with this circuit is that the feedback generator $z_{12} i_{e 3}$ is located at the emitter of $Q_{1}$ and not at the input lead where it can be directly compared with $v_{s}$. This issue can be resolved by examining the small-signal equivalent of the input segment of this circuit, as shown in Fig. 8.19. For this circuit:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{s}=i_{i} z_{S}+v_{b e}+i_{e 1} z_{11 f}+z_{12 f} i_{e 3} \\tag{8.88}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nUtilizing:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{e 3}=\\frac{i_{o}}{\\alpha_{3}} \\tag{8.89}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nin (8.88) yields:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{s}-z_{12 f} \\frac{i_{o}}{\\alpha_{3}}=i_{i} z_{S}+v_{b e}+i_{e 1} z_{11 f} \\tag{8.90}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe quantities in these equations are small-signal quantities. Equation 8.90 demonstrates that the feedback voltage generator $z_{12 f}\\left(i_{o} / \\alpha_{3}\\right)$ can be relocated back in series with the input lead; if this were done, the same equation would result (see Fig. 8.18c). Note that the common-base current gain $\\alpha_{3}$ of $Q_{3}$ is included in this feedback expression because the output current is sampled by $R_{E 2}$ at the emitter of $Q_{3}$ to provide a corrective signal to the input. This challenge is typical for most circuits that employ series feedback at the output, with the $\\alpha_{3}$ of $Q_{3}$ residing outside the feedback loop. There are numerous applications where this poses no issue, since $\\alpha \\simeq 1$. However, if high gain precision is essential, fluctuations in $\\alpha_{3}$ can create complications.\n\nThe $z$ parameters of the feedback network can be ascertained from Fig. 8.20 as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& z_{12 f}=\\left.\\frac{v_{1}}{i_{2}}\\right|_{i_{1}=0}=\\frac{R_{E 1} R_{E 2}}{R_{E 1}+R_{E 2}+R_{F}}  \\tag{8.91}\\\\\n& z_{22 f}=\\left.\\frac{v_{2}}{i_{2}}\\right|_{i_{1}=0}=R_{E 2} \\|\\left(R_{E 1}+R_{F}\\right)  \\tag{8.92}\\\\\n& z_{11 f}=\\left.\\frac{v_{1}}{i_{1}}\\right|_{i_{2}=0}=R_{E 1} \\|\\left(R_{F}+R_{E 2}\\right) \\tag{8.93}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nUsing (8.84), we disregard $z_{21}$.\nFrom these findings, we can reconceptualize the circuit of Fig. $8.18 b$ as presented in Fig. $8.18c$. As in prior computations, the signal fed forward via the feedback network (in this instance, $\\left.z_{21} i_{e 1}\\right)$ is neglected.

Equation 8.90 reveals that the feedback voltage generator $z_{12 f}\\left(i_{o} / \\alpha_{3}\\right)$ can be shifted back in series with the input lead; if this were done, the same equation would result (see Fig. 8.18c). Note that the common-base current gain $\\alpha_{3}$ of $Q_{3}$ is included in this feedback expression because the output current is sampled by $R_{E 2}$ at the emitter of $Q_{3}$ to provide a corrective signal to the input. This challenge is typical for circuits employing series feedback at the output, with the $\\alpha_{3}$ of $Q_{3}$ being outside the feedback loop. In many applications, this is not a concern since $\\alpha \\simeq 1$. However, if high gain precision is essential, variations in $\\alpha_{3}$ can pose difficulties.\n\nThe $z$ parameters of the feedback network can be ascertained from Fig. 8.20 as:\n\n$$\nz_{12 f}=\\left.\\frac{v_{1}}{i_{2}}\\right|_{i_{1}=0}=\\frac{R_{E 1} R_{E 2}}{R_{E 1}+R_{E 2}+R_{F}}  \\tag{8.91}\\\\\nz_{22 f}=\\left.\\frac{v_{2}}{i_{2}}\\right|_{i_{1}=0}=R_{E 2} \\|\\left(R_{E 1}+R_{F}\\right)  \\tag{8.92}\\\\\nz_{11 f}=\\left.\\frac{v_{1}}{i_{1}}\\right|_{i_{2}=0}=R_{E 1} \\|\\left(R_{F}+R_{E 2}\\right) \\tag{8.93}\n$$\n\nUsing (8.84), we disregard $z_{21}$.\nFrom these findings, we can redescribe the circuit of Fig. $8.18 b$ as presented in Fig. $8.18c$. Similar to previous computations, the signal fed forward via the feedback network (in this instance, $\\left.z_{21} i_{e 1}\\right)$ is ignored.

    "text": "Examine the series-series feedback configuration illustrated in Fig. 8.12. The influence of non-ideal networks can be determined by utilizing the representation from Fig. 8.16a. In such a scenario, the most practical two-port representation involves the open-circuit impedance parameters, or $z$ parameters, since both the fundamental amplifier and the feedback network are now connected in series at the input and output, thus sharing the same terminal currents. As depicted in Fig. 8.17, the $z$ parameters define the network by expressing terminal voltages in terms of terminal currents, leading to simplified calculations when the two networks share common terminal currents. The calculation in this instance proceeds as the precise dual of that in Section 8.5.1. Summing the input voltages from Fig. 8.16 yields:\n\n$$\nv_{s}=\\left(z_{S}+z_{11 a}+z_{11 f}\\right) i_{i}+\\left(z_{12 a}+z_{12 f}\\right) i_{o} \\tag{8.79}\n$$\n\nAt the output, the summed voltages result in:\n\n$$\n0=\\left(z_{21 a}+z_{21 f}\\right) i_{i}+\\left(z_{L}+z_{22 a}+z_{22 f}\\right) i_{o} \\tag{8.80}\n$$\n\nIt's beneficial to define:\n\n$$\nz_{i} =z_{S}+z_{11 a}+z_{11 f}  \\tag{8.81}\n$$\n$$\nz_{o} =z_{L}+z_{22 a}+z_{22 f} \\tag{8.82}\n$$\n\nNeglecting reverse transmission through the basic amplifier, we assume:\n\n$$\n\\left|z_{12 a}\\right| \\ll\\left|z_{12 f}\\right| \\tag{8.83}\n$$\n\nAnd neglecting feed-forward through the feedback network:\n\n$$\n\\left|z_{21 a}\\right| \\gg\\left|z_{21 f}\\right| \\tag{8.84}\n$$\n\nWith these assumptions, we find:\n\n$$\n\\frac{i_{o}}{v_{s}}=A \\simeq \\frac{\\frac{-z_{21 a}}{z_{i} z_{o}}}{1+\\left(\\frac{-z_{21 a}}{z_{i} z_{o}}\\right) z_{12 f}}=\\frac{a}{1+a f} \\tag{8.85}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n\n$$\na=-\\frac{z_{21 a}}{z_{i} z_{o}}  \\tag{8.86}\n$$\n$$\nf=z_{12 f} \\tag{8.87}\n$$\n\nA circuit representation of $a$ in (8.86) and $f$ in (8.87) can be achieved by removing generators $z_{21 f} i_{i}$ and $z_{12 a} i_{o}$ from Fig. $8.16 a$, in accordance with (8.83) and (8.84), resulting in the approximate representation of Fig. 8.16b. Here, the new basic amplifier incorporates the loading effect of the original feedback network, and the new feedback network is ideal, as used in Fig. 8.12. The transfer function of the basic amplifier in Fig. 8.16b corresponds to (8.86), and the transfer function of the feedback network in Fig. $8.16 b$ is given by (8.87). Thus, Fig. $8.16 b$ is a circuit representation of (8.86) and (8.87).\n\nSince Fig. 8.16b directly corresponds to Fig. 8.12, the results of Section 8.4.4 can now be applied. The loading effect of the feedback network on the basic amplifier is incorporated by connecting the feedback-network terminal impedances $z_{11 f}$ and $z_{22 f}$ in series at the input and output of the basic amplifier. The terms $z_{11 f}$ and $z_{22 f}$ are defined in Fig. 8.17 and are derived by calculating the terminal impedances of the feedback network with the other port open-circuited. The feedback function $f$, as given by (8.87), represents the reverse transfer impedance of the feedback network.\n\nConsider, for instance, the series-series feedback triple of Fig. 8.18a, which serves as a wideband feedback amplifier. Typically, $R_{E 2}$ is a small resistor that samples the output current $i_{o}$, and the resulting voltage across $R_{E 2}$ is sampled by the divider $R_{F}$ and $R_{E 1}$ to generate a feedback voltage across $R_{E 1}$. Usually, $R_{F} \\gg R_{E 1}$ and $R_{E 2}$.\n\nThe previously derived two-port theory cannot be directly applied in this case because the basic amplifier cannot be represented by a two-port. However, the techniques previously developed using two-port theory can be employed with minor modifications by first recognizing that the feedback network can be represented by a two-port, as shown in 8.18 b. One issue with this circuit is that the feedback generator $z_{12} i_{e 3}$ is located at the emitter of $Q_{1}$, not at the input lead where it can be directly compared with $v_{s}$. This issue can be addressed by considering the small-signal equivalent of the input section of this circuit, as shown in Fig. 8.19. For this circuit:\n\n$$\nv_{s}=i_{i} z_{S}+v_{b e}+i_{e 1} z_{11 f}+z_{12 f} i_{e 3} \\tag{8.88}\n$$\n\nUsing:\n\n$$\ni_{e 3}=\\frac{i_{o}}{\\alpha_{3}} \\tag{8.89}\n$$\n\nin (8.88) leads to:\n\n$$\nv_{s}-z_{12 f} \\frac{i_{o}}{\\alpha_{3}}=i_{i} z_{S}+v_{b e}+i_{e 1} z_{11 f} \\tag{8.90}\n$$\n\nwhere the quantities in these equations are small-signal values. Equation 8.90 demonstrates that the feedback voltage generator $z_{12 f}\\left(i_{o} / \\alpha_{3}\\right)$ can be shifted back in series with the input lead; if this were done, the same equation would result (see Fig. 8.18c). Note that the common-base current gain $\\alpha_{3}$ of $Q_{3}$ appears in this feedback expression because the output current is sampled by $R_{E 2}$ at the emitter of $Q_{3}$ to provide a corrective feedback signal to the input. This issue is common in circuits that employ series feedback at the output, with the $\\alpha_{3}$ of $Q_{3}$ being outside the feedback loop. In many applications, this is not a concern since $\\alpha \\simeq 1$. However, if high gain precision is required, variations in $\\alpha_{3}$ can pose challenges.\n\nThe $z$ parameters of the feedback network can be determined from Fig. 8.20 as:\n\n$$\nz_{12 f}=\\left.\\frac{v_{1}}{i_{2}}\\right|_{i_{1}=0}=\\frac{R_{E 1} R_{E 2}}{R_{E 1}+R_{E 2}+R_{F}}  \\tag{8.91}\n$$\n$$\nz_{22 f}=\\left.\\frac{v_{2}}{i_{2}}\\right|_{i_{1}=0}=R_{E 2} \\|\\left(R_{E 1}+R_{F}\\right)  \\tag{8.92}\n$$\n$$\nz_{11 f}=\\left.\\frac{v_{1}}{i_{1}}\\right|_{i_{2}=0}=R_{E 1} \\|\\left(R_{F}+R_{E 2}\\right) \\tag{8.93}\n$$\n\nUsing (8.84), we neglect $z_{21}$.\n\nBased on the preceding results, we can redraw the circuit of Fig. $8.18 b$ as shown in Fig. $8.18c$. As in previous calculations, the signal fed forward via the feedback network (in this case, $\\left.z_{21} i_{e 1}\\right)$ is neglected. The feedback voltage generator is placed in series with the input lead, creating an ideal differencing node at the input. The effect of feedback loading on the basic amplifier is represented by the impedances in the emitters of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{3}$. Note that this case differs slightly from the example of Fig. $8.16 b$ in that the impedances $z_{11 f}$ and $z_{22 f}$ of the feedback network appear in series with the input and output leads in Fig. $8.16b$, whereas in Fig. $8.18 c$, these impedances appear in the emitters of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{3}$. This is due to the fact that the basic amplifier of the circuit of Fig. 8.18a cannot be represented by two-port $z$ parameters but does not affect the analysis method. Since the feedback voltage generator in Fig. $8.18 c$ is directly in series with the input and is proportional to $i_{o}$, a direct correspondence with Fig. $8.16 b$ can be established, and the results of Section 8.4.4 can be applied. There is no further need for the $z$ parameters, and by inspection, we can write:\n\n$$\n\\frac{i_{o}}{v_{s}}=A \\simeq \\frac{a}{1+a f} \\tag{8.94}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n\n$$\nf=\\frac{z_{12 f}}{\\alpha_{3}}=\\frac{1}{\\alpha_{3}} \\frac{R_{E 1} R_{E 2}}{R_{E 1}+R_{E 2}+R_{F}} \\tag{8.95}\n$$\n\nAnd $a$ is the transconductance of the circuit of Fig. $8.18 c$ with the feedback generator $\\left[\\left(z_{12 f} / \\alpha_{3}\\right) i_{o}\\right]$ removed.\n\nThe input impedance seen by $v_{s}$ with feedback applied is $(1+a f)$ times the input impedance of the basic amplifier of Fig. 8.18c, including feedback loading.\n\nThe output impedance with feedback applied is $(1+a f)$ times the output impedance of the basic amplifier, including feedback loading.\n\nIf the loop gain $T=a f$ is large, then the gain with feedback applied is:\n\n$$\nA=\\frac{i_{o}}{v_{s}} \\simeq \\frac{1}{f}=\\alpha_{3} \\frac{R_{E 1}+R_{E 2}+R_{F}}{R_{E 1} R_{E 2}} \\tag{8.96}\n$$\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nA commercial integrated circuit ${ }^{2}$ based on the series-series triple is the MC 1553, shown in Fig. 8.21a. Calculate the terminal impedances, loop gain, and overall gain of this amplifier at low frequencies.\n\nThe MC 1553 is a wideband amplifier with a bandwidth of 50 MHz at a voltage gain of 50. The circuit gain is achieved through the series-series triple composed of $Q_{1}, Q_{2}$, and $Q_{3}$. The output voltage is developed across the load resistor $R_{C}$ and then fed to the output via emitter follower $Q_{4}$, which ensures a low output impedance. The rest of the circuit primarily serves biasing purposes, except for capacitors $C_{P}, C_{F}$, and $C_{B}$. Capacitors $C_{P}$ and $C_{F}$ are small capacitors of several picofarads and are included on the chip. They ensure stability of the feedback loop, and their function will be described in Chapter 9. Capacitor $C_{B}$ is external to the chip and is a large bypass capacitor used to decouple the bias circuitry at the signal frequencies of interest.\n\nBias Calculation. The analysis of the circuit begins with the bias conditions. The bias current levels are set by the reference current $I_{R K}$ in resistor $R_{K}$, and assuming $V_{B E(\\text { on })}=0.6 \\mathrm{~V}$ and $V_{C C}=6 \\mathrm{~V}$, we obtain:\n\n$$\nI_{R K}=\\frac{V_{C C}-2 V_{B E(\\mathrm{on})}}{R_{K}} \\tag{8.97}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the values in (8.97) gives:\n\n$$\nI_{R K}=\\frac{6-1.2}{6000} \\mathrm{~A}=0.80 \\mathrm{~mA}\n$$\n\nThe current in the output emitter follower $Q_{4}$ is determined by the currents in $Q_{6}$ and $Q_{8}$. Transistor $Q_{8}$ has an area three times that of $Q_{7}$ and $Q_{6}$, thus:\n\n$$\nI_{C 8}=3 \\times 0.8 \\mathrm{~mA}=2.4 \\mathrm{~mA}\n$$\n$$\nI_{C 6}=0.8 \\mathrm{~mA}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\beta_{F}$ is assumed large in these bias calculations. Assuming the base current of $Q_{1}$ is small, all of $I_{C 6}$ and $I_{C 8}$ flow through $Q_{4}$, so:\n\n$$\nI_{C 4} \\simeq I_{C 6}+I_{C 8} \\tag{8.98}\n$$\n\nThus:\n\n$$\nI_{C 4} \\simeq 3.2 \\mathrm{~mA}\n$$\n\nTransistor $Q_{8}$ supplies most of the bias current to $Q_{4}$, functioning as a Class A emitter-follower output stage, as described in Section 5.2. The role of $Q_{6}$ is to enable the formation of a negative-feedback bias loop for stabilization of the dc operating point, and resistor $R_{G}$ is chosen to cause sufficient dc voltage drop to allow connection of $R_{D}$ back to the base of $Q_{1}$. Transistors $Q_{1}, Q_{2}, Q_{3}$, and $Q_{4}$ are then connected in a negative-feedback bias loop, and the dc conditions can be approximately ascertained as follows.\n\nAssuming $Q_{2}$ is on, the voltage at the collector of $Q_{1}$ is about 0.6 V, and the voltage across $R_{A}$ is 5.4 V. Thus, the current through $R_{A}$ is:\n\n$$\nI_{R A} =\\frac{5.4}{R_{A}}\n$$\n$$\nI_{R A} =\\frac{5.4}{9000}=0.6 \\mathrm{~mA} \\tag{8.99}\n$$\n\nAssuming $\\beta_{F}$ is high, it follows that:\n\n$$\nI_{C 1} \\simeq I_{R A}=0.6 \\mathrm{~mA} \\tag{8.100}\n$$\n\nSince the voltage across $R_{E 1}$ is small, the voltage at the base of $Q_{1}$ is approximately 0.6 V, and if the base current of $Q_{1}$ is small, this is also the voltage at the collector of $Q_{6}$, as any voltage across $R_{D}$ will be small. The dc output voltage can be expressed as:\n\n$$\nV_{O}=V_{C 6}+I_{C 6} R_{G} \\tag{8.101}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the values gives:\n\n$$\nV_{O}=(0.6+0.8 \\times 3) \\mathrm{V}=3 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nThe voltage at the base of $Q_{4}$ (collector of $Q_{3}$) is $V_{B E}$ above $V_{O}$ and is thus 3.6 V. The collector current of $Q_{3}$ is:\n\n$$\nI_{C 3} \\simeq \\frac{V_{C C}-V_{C 3}}{R_{C}} \\tag{8.102}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the parameter values gives:\n\n$$\nI_{C 3} \\simeq \\frac{6-3.6}{600} \\mathrm{~A}=4 \\mathrm{~mA}\n$$\n\nThe voltage at the base of $Q_{3}$ (collector of $Q_{2}$) is:\n\n$$\nV_{B 3} \\simeq-I_{E 3} R_{E 2}+V_{B E(\\mathrm{on})} \\tag{8.103}\n$$\n\nThus:\n\n$$\nV_{B 3}=V_{C 2} \\simeq(4 \\times 0.1+0.6) \\mathrm{V}=1 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\n$I_{C 2}$ can be calculated from:\n\n$$\nI_{C 2} \\simeq \\frac{V_{C C}-V_{C 2}}{R_{B}} \\tag{8.104}\n$$\n\nand substituting the parameter values gives:\n\n$$\nI_{C 2} \\simeq \\frac{6-1}{5000} \\mathrm{~A}=1 \\mathrm{~mA}\n$$\n\nAc Calculation. The ac analysis can now proceed using the methods previously developed in this chapter. For ac analysis purposes, the feedback triple composed of $Q_{1}, Q_{2}$, and $Q_{3}$ in Fig. 8.21a is identical to the circuit in Fig. 8.18a, and the results derived previously for the latter circuit are directly applicable to the triple in Fig. 8.21a. To obtain the voltage gain of the circuit of Fig. 8.21a, we simply multiply the transconductance of the triple by the load resistor $R_{C}$, since the gain of the emitter follower $Q_{4}$ is almost exactly unity. Note that resistor $R_{D}$ is assumed grounded for ac signals by the large capacitor $C_{B}$, and thus has no influence on the ac circuit operation, except for a shunting effect at the input that"

From Fig. 8.16, summing the voltages at the input yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{s}=\\left(z_{S}+z_{11 a}+z_{11 f}\\right) i_{i}+\\left(z_{12 a}+z_{12 f}\\right) i_{o} \\tag{8.79}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSumming the voltages at the output results in\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n0=\\left(z_{21 a}+z_{21 f}\\right) i_{i}+\\left(z_{L}+z_{22 a}+z_{22 f}\\right) i_{o} \\tag{8.80}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIt is helpful to define\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nz_{i} & =z_{S}+z_{11 a}+z_{11 f}  \\tag{8.81}\\\\\nz_{o} & =z_{L}+z_{22 a}+z_{22 f} \\tag{8.82}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nNeglecting reverse transmission through the basic amplifier, we assume that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left|z_{12 a}\\right| \\ll\\left|z_{12 f}\\right| \\tag{8.83}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, neglecting feed-forward through the feedback network, we can write\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left|z_{21 a}\\right| \\gg\\left|z_{21 f}\\right| \\tag{8.84}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWith these assumptions, it follows that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{i_{o}}{v_{s}}=A \\simeq \\frac{\\frac{-z_{21 a}}{z_{i} z_{o}}}{1+\\left(\\frac{-z_{21 a}}{z_{i} z_{o}}\\right) z_{12 f}}=\\frac{a}{1+a f} \\tag{8.85}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& a=-\\frac{z_{21 a}}{z_{i} z_{o}}  \\tag{8.86}\\\\\n& f=z_{12 f} \\tag{8.87}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nA circuit representation of $a$ in (8.86) and $f$ in (8.87) can be obtained by removing generators $z_{21 f} i_{i}$ and $z_{12 a} i_{o}$ from Fig. $8.16 a$ in accordance with (8.83) and (8.84). This yields the approximate representation of Fig. 8.16b, where the new basic amplifier includes the loading effect of the original feedback network. The new feedback network is an ideal one as used in Fig. 8.12. The transfer function of the basic amplifier of Fig. 8.16b is the same as in (8.86), and the transfer function of the feedback network of Fig. $8.16 b$ is given by (8.87). Thus Fig. $8.16 b$ is a circuit representation of (8.86) and (8.87).\n\nSince Fig. 8.16b has a direct correspondence with Fig. 8.12, all the results of Section 8.4.4 can now be utilized. The loading effect of the feedback network on the basic amplifier is included by connecting the feedback-network terminal impedances $z_{11 f}$ and $z_{22 f}$ in series at the input and output of the basic amplifier. Terms $z_{11 f}$ and $z_{22 f}$ are defined in Fig. 8.17 and are obtained by calculating the terminal impedances of the feedback network with the other port open-circuited. The feedback function $f$ given by (8.87) is the reverse transfer impedance of the feedback network.\n\nConsider, for example, the series-series feedback triple of Fig. 8.18a, which serves as a wideband feedback amplifier. $R_{E 2}$ is typically a small resistor that samples the output current $i_{o}$, and the resulting voltage across $R_{E 2}$ is sampled by the divider $R_{F}$ and $R_{E 1}$ to generate a feedback voltage across $R_{E 1}$. Usually $R_{F} \\gg R_{E 1}$ and $R_{E 2}$.\n\nThe two-port theory derived earlier cannot be applied directly in this case because the basic amplifier cannot be represented by a two-port. However, the techniques developed previously using two-port theory can be employed with minor modification by first noting that the feedback network can be represented by a two-port as shown in 8.18 b . One problem with this circuit is that the feedback generator $z_{12} i_{e 3}$ is in the emitter of $Q_{1}$ and not in the input lead where it can be directly compared with $v_{s}$. This problem can be resolved by considering the small-signal equivalent of the input portion of this circuit as shown in Fig. 8.19. For this circuit\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{s}=i_{i} z_{S}+v_{b e}+i_{e 1} z_{11 f}+z_{12 f} i_{e 3} \\tag{8.88}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nUsing\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{e 3}=\\frac{i_{o}}{\\alpha_{3}} \\tag{8.89}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nin (8.88) gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{s}-z_{12 f} \\frac{i_{o}}{\\alpha_{3}}=i_{i} z_{S}+v_{b e}+i_{e 1} z_{11 f} \\tag{8.90}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere the quantities in these equations are small-signal quantities. Equation 8.90 shows that the feedback voltage generator $z_{12 f}\\left(i_{o} / \\alpha_{3}\\right)$ can be moved back in series with the input lead; if this was done, exactly the same equation would result. (See Fig. 8.18c.) Note that the common-base current gain $\\alpha_{3}$ of $Q_{3}$ appears in this feedback expression because the output current is sampled by $R_{E 2}$ in the emitter of $Q_{3}$ in order to feed back a correcting signal to the input. This problem is common to most circuits employing series feedback at the output, and the $\\alpha_{3}$ of $Q_{3}$ is outside the feedback loop. There are many applications where this is not a problem, since $\\alpha \\simeq 1$. However, if high gain precision is required, variations in $\\alpha_{3}$ can cause difficulties.\n\nThe $z$ parameters of the feedback network can be determined from Fig. 8.20 as\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& z_{12 f}=\\left.\\frac{v_{1}}{i_{2}}\\right|_{i_{1}=0}=\\frac{R_{E 1} R_{E 2}}{R_{E 1}+R_{E 2}+R_{F}}  \\tag{8.91}\\\\\n& z_{22 f}=\\left.\\frac{v_{2}}{i_{2}}\\right|_{i_{1}=0}=R_{E 2} \\|\\left(R_{E 1}+R_{F}\\right)  \\tag{8.92}\\\\\n& z_{11 f}=\\left.\\frac{v_{1}}{i_{1}}\\right|_{i_{2}=0}=R_{E 1} \\|\\left(R_{F}+R_{E 2}\\right) \\tag{8.93}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nUsing (8.84), we neglect $z_{21}$.\nFrom the foregoing results, we can redraw the circuit of Fig. $8.18 b$ as shown in Fig. $8.18c$. As in previous calculations, the signal fed forward via the feedback network (in this case $\\left.z_{21} i_{e 1}\\right)$ is neglected. The feedback voltage generator is placed in series with the input lead\nand an ideal differencing node then exists at the input. The effect of feedback loading on the basic amplifier is represented by the impedances in the emitters of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{3}$. Note that this case does differ somewhat from the example of Fig. $8.16 b$ in that the impedances $z_{11 f}$ and $z_{22 f}$ of the feedback network appear in series with the input and output leads in Fig. $8.16b$, whereas in Fig. $8.18 c$ these impedances appear in the emitters of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{3}$. This is due to the fact that the basic amplifier of the circuit of Fig. 8.18a cannot be represented by two-port $z$ parameters but makes no difference to the method of analysis. Since the feedback voltage generator in Fig. $8.18 c$ is directly in series with the input and is proportional to $i_{o}$, a direct correspondence with Fig. $8.16 b$ can be established and the results of Section 8.4 .4 can be applied. There is no further need of the $z$ parameters, and by inspection we can write\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{i_{o}}{v_{s}}=A \\simeq \\frac{a}{1+a f} \\tag{8.94}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nf=\\frac{z_{12 f}}{\\alpha_{3}}=\\frac{1}{\\alpha_{3}} \\frac{R_{E 1} R_{E 2}}{R_{E 1}+R_{E 2}+R_{F}} \\tag{8.95}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand $a$ is the transconductance of the circuit of Fig. $8.18 c$ with the feedback generator $\\left[\\left(z_{12 f} / \\alpha_{3}\\right) i_{o}\\right]$ removed.\n\nThe input impedance seen by $v_{s}$ with feedback applied is $(1+a f) \\times$ (input impedance of the basic amplifier of Fig. 8.18c including feedback loading).\n\nThe output impedance with feedback applied is $(1+a f)$ times the output impedance of the basic amplifier including feedback loading.\nIf the loop gain $T=a f$ is large, then the gain with feedback applied is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nA=\\frac{i_{o}}{v_{s}} \\simeq \\frac{1}{f}=\\alpha_{3} \\frac{R_{E 1}+R_{E 2}+R_{F}}{R_{E 1} R_{E 2}} \\tag{8.96}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nA commercial integrated circuit ${ }^{2}$ based on the series-series triple is the MC 1553 shown in Fig. 8.21a. Calculate the terminal impedances, loop gain, and overall gain of this amplifier at low frequencies.\n\nThe MC 1553 is a wideband amplifier with a bandwidth of 50 MHz at a voltage gain of 50. The circuit gain is realized by the series-series triple composed of $Q_{1}, Q_{2}$, and $Q_{3}$. The output voltage is developed across the load resistor $R_{C}$ and is then fed to the output via emitter follower $Q_{4}$, which ensures a low output impedance. The rest of the circuit is largely for bias\npurposes except capacitors $C_{P}, C_{F}$, and $C_{B}$. Capacitors $C_{P}$ and $C_{F}$ are small capacitors of several picofarads and are included on the chip. They ensure stability of the feedback loop, and their function will be described in Chapter 9 . Capacitor $C_{B}$ is external to the chip and is a large bypass capacitor used to decouple the bias circuitry at the signal frequencies of interest.\n\nBias Calculation. The analysis of the circuit begins with the bias conditions. The bias current levels are set by the reference current $I_{R K}$ in the resistor $R_{K}$, and assuming $V_{B E(\\text { on })}=0.6 \\mathrm{~V}$ and $V_{C C}=6 \\mathrm{~V}$, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{R K}=\\frac{V_{C C}-2 V_{B E(\\mathrm{on})}}{R_{K}} \\tag{8.97}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSubstituting data in (8.97) gives\n\n$$\nI_{R K}=\\frac{6-1.2}{6000} \\mathrm{~A}=0.80 \\mathrm{~mA}\n$$\n\nThe current in the output emitter follower $Q_{4}$ is determined by the currents in $Q_{6}$ and $Q_{8}$. Transistor $Q_{8}$ has an area three times that of $Q_{7}$ and $Q_{6}$ and thus\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& I_{C 8}=3 \\times 0.8 \\mathrm{~mA}=2.4 \\mathrm{~mA} \\\\\n& I_{C 6}=0.8 \\mathrm{~mA}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\beta_{F}$ is assumed large in these bias calculations. If the base current of $Q_{1}$ is small, all of $I_{C 6}$ and $I_{C 8}$ flow through $Q_{4}$ and\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C 4} \\simeq I_{C 6}+I_{C 8} \\tag{8.98}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus\n\n$$\nI_{C 4} \\simeq 3.2 \\mathrm{~mA}\n$$\n\nTransistor $Q_{8}$ supplies most of the bias current to $Q_{4}$, and this device functions as a Class A emitter-follower output stage of the type described in Section 5.2. The function of $Q_{6}$ is to allow formation of a negative-feedback bias loop for stabilization of the dc operating point, and resistor $R_{G}$ is chosen to cause sufficient dc voltage drop to allow connection of $R_{D}$ back to the base of $Q_{1}$. Transistors $Q_{1}, Q_{2}, Q_{3}$, and $Q_{4}$ are then connected in a negative-feedback bias loop and the dc conditions can be ascertained approximately as follows.\n\nIf we assume that $Q_{2}$ is on, the voltage at the collector of $Q_{1}$ is about 0.6 V and the voltage $\\operatorname{across} R_{A}$ is 5.4 V . Thus the current through $R_{A}$ is\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{R A} & =\\frac{5.4}{R_{A}} \\\\\n& =\\frac{5.4}{9000}=0.6 \\mathrm{~mA} \\tag{8.99}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIf $\\beta_{F}$ is assumed high, it follows that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C 1} \\simeq I_{R A}=0.6 \\mathrm{~mA} \\tag{8.100}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince the voltage across $R_{E 1}$ is small, the voltage at the base of $Q_{1}$ is approximately 0.6 V , and if the base current of $Q_{1}$ is small, this is also the voltage at the collector of $Q_{6}$ since any voltage across $R_{D}$ will be small. The dc output voltage can be written\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{O}=V_{C 6}+I_{C 6} R_{G} \\tag{8.101}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSubstitution of data gives\n\n$$\nV_{O}=(0.6+0.8 \\times 3) \\mathrm{V}=3 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nThe voltage at the base of $Q_{4}$ (collector of $Q_{3}$ ) is $V_{B E}$ above $V_{O}$ and is thus 3.6 V .

    "text": "Examine the series-series feedback circuit depicted in Fig. 8.12. The impact of non-ideal networks can be determined through the representation shown in Fig. 8.16a. In this scenario, the most practical two-port representation involves using the open-circuit impedance parameters, or $z$ parameters, because the fundamental amplifier and the feedback network are connected in series at both the input and output, hence sharing the same currents at their respective terminals. As illustrated in Fig. 8.17, the $z$ parameters define the network by expressing terminal voltages as a function of terminal currents, leading to simplified calculations when the two networks share common terminal currents. The computation for this case follows the exact dual process as described in Section 8.5.1. By analyzing Fig. 8.16, the sum of voltages at the input yields the following equation:\n\n$$\nv_{s}=\\left(z_{S}+z_{11 a}+z_{11 f}\\right) i_{i}+\\left(z_{12 a}+z_{12 f}\\right) i_{o} \\tag{8.79}\n$$\n\nUpon summing the voltages at the output, we derive:\n\n$$\n0=\\left(z_{21 a}+z_{21 f}\\right) i_{i}+\\left(z_{L}+z_{22 a}+z_{22 f}\\right) i_{o} \\tag{8.80}\n$$\n\nIt is beneficial to define:\n\n$$\nz_{i} =z_{S}+z_{11 a}+z_{11 f}  \\tag{8.81}\n$$\n$$\nz_{o} =z_{L}+z_{22 a}+z_{22 f} \\tag{8.82}\n$$\n\nAssuming negligible reverse transmission through the basic amplifier and ignoring feed-forward through the feedback network, we can approximate the current gain as:\n\n$$\n\\frac{i_{o}}{v_{s}}=A \\simeq \\frac{\\frac{-z_{21 a}}{z_{i} z_{o}}}{1+\\left(\\frac{-z_{21 a}}{z_{i} z_{o}}\\right) z_{12 f}}=\\frac{a}{1+a f} \\tag{8.85}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n\n$$\na=-\\frac{z_{21 a}}{z_{i} z_{o}}  \\tag{8.86}\n$$\n$$\nf=z_{12 f} \\tag{8.87}\n$$\n\nThe circuit representation of $a$ and $f$ can be derived by removing the generators $z_{21 f} i_{i}$ and $z_{12 a} i_{o}$ from Fig. 8.16a, in line with the assumptions made. This yields an approximate representation as shown in Fig. 8.16b, where the revised basic amplifier incorporates the loading effect of the original feedback network. The new feedback network is an ideal one, similar to that used in Fig. 8.12. The transfer function of the basic amplifier in Fig. 8.16b corresponds to (8.86), and the transfer function of the feedback network in Fig. 8.16b is given by (8.87). Therefore, Fig. 8.16b serves as a circuit representation of (8.86) and (8.87).\n\nGiven the direct correlation between Fig. 8.16b and Fig. 8.12, the findings from Section 8.4.4 are now applicable. The loading effect of the feedback network on the basic amplifier is accounted for by connecting the feedback-network terminal impedances $z_{11 f}$ and $z_{22 f}$ in series at the input and output of the basic amplifier. These terms are defined in Fig. 8.17 and are obtained by calculating the terminal impedances of the feedback network with the other port open-circuited. The feedback function $f$, as expressed in (8.87), represents the reverse transfer impedance of the feedback network.\n\nConsider the series-series feedback triple depicted in Fig. 8.18a, which serves as a wideband feedback amplifier. Typically, $R_{E 2}$ is a small resistor that samples the output current $i_{o}$, and the resulting voltage across $R_{E 2}$ is divided by $R_{F}$ and $R_{E 1}$ to generate a feedback voltage across $R_{E 1}$. It is common for $R_{F}$ to be much larger than $R_{E 1}$ and $R_{E 2}$.\n\nThe two-port theory discussed earlier is not directly applicable in this instance since the basic amplifier cannot be represented by a two-port. However, the techniques previously developed using two-port theory can be adapted with minor modifications by first recognizing that the feedback network can be represented by a two-port, as shown in Fig. 8.18b. A challenge with this circuit is that the feedback generator $z_{12} i_{e 3}$ is located at the emitter of $Q_{1}$ rather than the input lead, where it could be directly compared with $v_{s}$. This issue can be resolved by examining the small-signal equivalent of the input section of this circuit, as presented in Fig. 8.19. For this circuit, the voltage at the input is given by:\n\n$$\nv_{s}=i_{i} z_{S}+v_{b e}+i_{e 1} z_{11 f}+z_{12 f} i_{e 3} \\tag{8.88}\n$$\n\nUsing the relationship:\n\n$$\ni_{e 3}=\\frac{i_{o}}{\\alpha_{3}} \\tag{8.89}\n$$\n\nin equation (8.88) yields:\n\n$$\nv_{s}-z_{12 f} \\frac{i_{o}}{\\alpha_{3}}=i_{i} z_{S}+v_{b e}+i_{e 1} z_{11 f} \\tag{8.90}\n$$\n\nEquation 8.90 demonstrates that the feedback voltage generator $z_{12 f}\\left(i_{o} / \\alpha_{3}\\right)$ can be shifted back in series with the input lead; doing so would result in the same equation (see Fig. 8.18c). It is important to note that the common-base current gain $\\alpha_{3}$ of $Q_{3}$ is included in this feedback expression because the output current is sampled by $R_{E 2}$ in the emitter of $Q_{3}$ to provide a corrective signal to the input. This challenge is typical for circuits that employ series feedback at the output, with the $\\alpha_{3}$ of $Q_{3}$ being outside the feedback loop. In many applications, this is not a concern since $\\alpha \\simeq 1$. However, if high gain precision is necessary, variations in $\\alpha_{3}$ can pose issues.\n\nThe $z$ parameters of the feedback network can be determined from Fig. 8.20 as follows:\n\n$$\nz_{12 f}=\\left.\\frac{v_{1}}{i_{2}}\\right|_{i_{1}=0}=\\frac{R_{E 1} R_{E 2}}{R_{E 1}+R_{E 2}+R_{F}}  \\tag{8.91}\n$$\n$$\nz_{22 f}=\\left.\\frac{v_{2}}{i_{2}}\\right|_{i_{1}=0}=R_{E 2} \\|\\left(R_{E 1}+R_{F}\\right)  \\tag{8.92}\n$$\n$$\nz_{11 f}=\\left.\\frac{v_{1}}{i_{1}}\\right|_{i_{2}=0}=R_{E 1} \\|\\left(R_{F}+R_{E 2}\\right) \\tag{8.93}\n$$\n\nUsing assumption (8.84), we can disregard $z_{21}$ and redraw the circuit of Fig. 8.18b as shown in Fig. 8.18c. Similar to previous calculations, the signal fed forward through the feedback network (in this case, $\\left.z_{21} i_{e 1}\\right)$ is neglected. The feedback voltage generator is positioned in series with the input lead, establishing an ideal differencing node at the input. The impact of feedback loading on the basic amplifier is represented by the impedances in the emitters of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{3}$. It is worth noting that this case differs slightly from the example in Fig. 8.16b, where the impedances $z_{11 f}$ and $z_{22 f}$ of the feedback network appear in series with the input and output leads in Fig. 8.16b, whereas in Fig. 8.18c, these impedances are located in the emitters of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{3}$. This discrepancy arises because the basic amplifier in the circuit of Fig. 8.18a cannot be represented by two-port $z$ parameters but does not affect the analysis method. Since the feedback voltage generator in Fig. 8.18c is directly in series with the input and is proportional to $i_{o}$, a direct comparison with Fig. 8.16b can be made, allowing the application of the results from Section 8.4.4. There is no further need for the $z$ parameters, and by inspection, we can write:\n\n$$\n\\frac{i_{o}}{v_{s}}=A \\simeq \\frac{a}{1+a f} \\tag{8.94}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n\n$$\nf=\\frac{z_{12 f}}{\\alpha_{3}}=\\frac{1}{\\alpha_{3}} \\frac{R_{E 1} R_{E 2}}{R_{E 1}+R_{E 2}+R_{F}} \\tag{8.95}\n$$\n\nand $a$ is the transconductance of the circuit in Fig. 8.18c with the feedback generator $\\left[\\left(z_{12 f} / \\alpha_{3}\\right) i_{o}\\right]$ removed.\n\nThe input impedance as seen by $v_{s}$ with feedback applied is $(1+a f)$ times the input impedance of the basic amplifier in Fig. 8.18c, including feedback loading.\n\nThe output impedance with feedback applied is $(1+a f)$ times the output impedance of the basic amplifier, including feedback loading.\n\nIf the loop gain $T=a f$ is significant, the gain with feedback applied becomes:\n\n$$\nA=\\frac{i_{o}}{v_{s}} \\simeq \\frac{1}{f}=\\alpha_{3} \\frac{R_{E 1}+R_{E 2}+R_{F}}{R_{E 1} R_{E 2}} \\tag{8.96}\n$$\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nA commercial integrated circuit ${ }^{2}$ based on the series-series triple is the MC 1553, as shown in Fig. 8.21a.

The circuit gain is achieved through the series-series triple composed of $Q_{1}, Q_{2}$, and $Q_{3}$. The output voltage is developed across the load resistor $R_{C}$ and then fed to the output via an emitter follower $Q_{4}$, ensuring a low output impedance. The remaining circuit primarily serves biasing purposes, with the exception of capacitors $C_{P}, C_{F}$, and $C_{B}$. Capacitors $C_{P}$ and $C_{F}$ are small capacitors of several picofarads and are included on the chip to ensure stability of the feedback loop, with their function to be discussed in Chapter 9. Capacitor $C_{B}$ is external to the chip and acts as a large bypass capacitor to decouple the bias circuitry at the signal frequencies of interest.\n\nBias Calculation. The analysis of the circuit commences with the bias conditions. The bias current levels are set by the reference current $I_{R K}$ in resistor $R_{K}$, and assuming $V_{B E(\\text { on })}=0.6 \\mathrm{~V}$ and $V_{C C}=6 \\mathrm{~V}$, we obtain:\n\n$$\nI_{R K}=\\frac{V_{C C}-2 V_{B E(\\mathrm{on})}}{R_{K}} \\tag{8.97}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the values gives:\n\n$$\nI_{R K}=\\frac{6-1.2}{6000} \\mathrm{~A}=0.80 \\mathrm{~mA}\n$$\n\nThe current in the output emitter follower $Q_{4}$ is determined by the currents in $Q_{6}$ and $Q_{8}$.

The role of $Q_{6}$ is to enable the formation of a negative-feedback bias loop for stabilization of the dc operating point, and resistor $R_{G}$ is chosen to create sufficient dc voltage drop to allow connection of $R_{D}$ back to the base of $Q_{1}$. Transistors $Q_{1}, Q_{2}, Q_{3}$, and $Q_{4}$ are then connected in a negative-feedback bias loop, and the dc conditions can be approximated as follows.\n\nAssuming $Q_{2}$ is on, the voltage at the collector of $Q_{1}$ is approximately 0.6 V, and the voltage across $R_{A}$ is 5.4 V.

The ac analysis can now proceed using the methods previously developed in this chapter. For ac analysis purposes, the feedback triple composed of $Q_{1}, Q_{2}$, and $Q_{3}$ in Fig. 8.21a is equivalent to the circuit in Fig. 8.18a, and the results derived for the latter circuit are directly applicable to the triple in Fig. 8.21a. To determine the voltage gain of the circuit in Fig. 8.21a, we simply multiply the transconductance of the triple by the load resistor $R_{C}$, since the gain of the emitter follower $Q_{4}$ is almost exactly unity. It is assumed that resistor $R_{D}$ is grounded for ac signals by the large capacitor $C_{B}$, and thus has no influence on the ac circuit operation, except for a shunting effect at the input that will be discussed later.

This results in the approximate representation of Fig. $8.23 b$, where the new basic amplifier includes the loading effect of the original feedback network. As in prior examples, the circuit of Fig. $8.23 b$ represents (8.123), (8.124), and (8.125) and resembles an ideal feedback loop. Thus, all equations from Section 8.4.1 can be applied to this circuit.\n\nFor instance, consider the common series-shunt op amp circuit in Fig. 8.24, which precisely fits the described model. First, we determine the $h$ parameters of the feedback network from Fig. 8.25:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& h_{22 f}=\\left.\\frac{i_{2}}{v_{2}}\\right|_{i_{1}=0}=\\frac{1}{R_{F}+R_{E}}  \\tag{8.126}\\\\\n& h_{12 f}=\\left.\\frac{v_{1}}{v_{2}}\\right|_{i_{1}=0}=\\frac{R_{E}}{R_{E}+R_{F}} \\tag{8.127}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\n**Figure 8.25**: Feedback network with a current source I1 and resistors RE and RF.\n**Figure 8.26**: Equivalent circuit for Fig. 8.24.\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nh_{11 f}=\\left.\\frac{v_{1}}{i_{1}}\\right|_{v_{2}=0}=R_{E} \\| R_{F} \\tag{8.128}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nUsing (8.122), we neglect $h_{21 f}$. The complete feedback amplifier, including loading effects, is shown in Fig. 8.26 and corresponds directly to Fig. 8.23b (with the op amp output represented by a Thévenin equivalent rather than a Norton equivalent).\n\nThe gain $a$ of the basic amplifier can be calculated from Fig. 8.26 by initially ignoring the feedback generator, resulting in\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\na=\\frac{z_{i}}{z_{i}+R} a_{v} \\frac{z_{L X}}{z_{L X}+z_{o}} \\tag{8.129}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nR & =R_{E} \\| R_{F}  \\tag{8.130}\\\\\nz_{L X} & =z_{L} \\|\\left(R_{E}+R_{F}\\right) \\tag{8.131}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nAlso,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nf=\\frac{R_{E}}{R_{E}+R_{F}} \\tag{8.132}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, the overall gain of the feedback circuit is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nA=\\frac{v_{o}}{v_{s}}=\\frac{a}{1+a f} \\tag{8.133}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand $A$ can be evaluated using (8.129) and (8.132).\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nAssume the circuit in Fig. 8.24 is implemented using a differential amplifier with low-frequency parameters $z_{i}=100 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega, z_{o}=10 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$, and $a_{v}=3000$.

Note that $z_{o}$ is not negligible in this case, which can occur in some applications.\n\nThis problem is best approached by first calculating the input impedance of the basic amplifier and then multiplying by $(1+T)$ as indicated by (8.25) to find the input impedance of the feedback amplifier. By inspection from Fig. 8.26, the input impedance of the basic amplifier is\n\n$$\nz_{i a}=z_{i}+R_{E} \\| R_{F}=(100+5 \\| 20) \\mathrm{k} \\Omega=104 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega\n$$\n\n**Figure 8.27**: Series-shunt feedback circuit with three NPN transistors Q1, Q2, and Q3.\n\nThe parallel combination of $z_{L}$ and $\\left(R_{F}+R_{E}\\right)$ in Fig. 8.27 is\n\n$$\nz_{L X}=\\frac{10 \\times 25}{35}=7.14 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega\n$$\n\nSubstituting into (8.129) gives, for the gain of the basic amplifier in Fig. 8.26,\n\n$$\na=\\frac{100}{100+4} \\times 3000 \\times \\frac{7.14}{7.14+10}=1202\n$$\n\nFrom (8.127), the feedback factor $f$ for this circuit is\n\n$$\nf=\\frac{5}{5+20}=0.2\n$$\n\nThus, the loop gain is\n\n$$\nT=a f=1202 \\times 0.2=240\n$$\n\nThe input impedance of the feedback amplifier is therefore\n\n$$\nZ_{i}=z_{i a}(1+T)=104 \\times 241 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega=25 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega\n$$\n\nIn this example, the loading effect of $\\left(R_{F}+R_{E}\\right)$ significantly impacts the gain $a$ of the basic amplifier and thus the input impedance of the feedback amplifier.\n\nAs another example, consider the series-series triple of Fig. 8.18a but assume the output signal is taken as the voltage at the emitter of $Q_{3}$, as shown in Fig. 8.27. This illustrates how the same circuit can realize different feedback functions depending on the output node. As with Fig. 8.18a, the basic amplifier in Fig. 8.27 cannot be represented as a two-port. However, the feedback network can be represented as a two-port using the $h$ parameters as shown in Fig. 8.28. The $h$ parameters for this feedback network are given by (8.126), (8.127), and (8.128), with $h_{21 f}$ neglected. The analysis of Fig. 8.28 then proceeds as usual."

This results in the approximate representation in Fig. $8.23 b$, where the new basic amplifier includes the loading effect of the original feedback network. As in previous examples, the circuit in Fig. $8.23 b$ represents (8.123), (8.124), and (8.125) and resembles an ideal feedback loop. Thus, all equations from Section 8.4.1 apply to this circuit.\n\nFor instance, consider the common series-shunt op amp circuit in Fig. 8.24, which precisely fits the described model. First, determine the $h$ parameters of the feedback network from Fig. 8.25:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& h_{22 f}=\\left.\\frac{i_{2}}{v_{2}}\\right|_{i_{1}=0}=\\frac{1}{R_{F}+R_{E}}  \\tag{8.126}\\\\\n& h_{12 f}=\\left.\\frac{v_{1}}{v_{2}}\\right|_{i_{1}=0}=\\frac{R_{E}}{R_{E}+R_{F}} \\tag{8.127}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\n**Figure 8.26**: Equivalent circuit for Fig. 8.24.\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nh_{11 f}=\\left.\\frac{v_{1}}{i_{1}}\\right|_{v_{2}=0}=R_{E} \\| R_{F} \\tag{8.128}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nUsing (8.122), we neglect $h_{21 f}$. The complete feedback amplifier, including loading effects, is shown in Fig. 8.26 and corresponds directly to Fig. 8.23b. (The only difference is the representation of the op amp output as a Thévenin rather than a Norton equivalent.)\n\nThe gain $a$ of the basic amplifier can be calculated from Fig. 8.26 by initially ignoring the feedback generator, resulting in\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\na=\\frac{z_{i}}{z_{i}+R} a_{v} \\frac{z_{L X}}{z_{L X}+z_{o}} \\tag{8.129}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nR & =R_{E} \\| R_{F}  \\tag{8.130}\\\\\nz_{L X} & =z_{L} \\|\\left(R_{E}+R_{F}\\right) \\tag{8.131}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nAdditionally,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nf=\\frac{R_{E}}{R_{E}+R_{F}} \\tag{8.132}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, the overall gain of the feedback circuit is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nA=\\frac{v_{o}}{v_{s}}=\\frac{a}{1+a f} \\tag{8.133}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand $A$ can be evaluated using (8.129) and (8.132).\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nAssume the circuit in Fig. 8.24 is implemented using a differential amplifier with low-frequency parameters $z_{i}=100 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega, z_{o}=10 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$, and $a_{v}=3000$. Calculate the input impedance of the feedback amplifier at low frequencies given $R_{E}=5 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega, R_{F}=20 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$, and $z_{L}=10 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$. Note that $z_{o}$ is not negligible in this case, as is typical for an op amp, and this scenario can occur in some applications.\n\nThis problem is best tackled by first calculating the input impedance of the basic amplifier and then multiplying by $(1+T)$, as indicated by (8.25), to find the input impedance of the feedback amplifier. By inspection from Fig. 8.26, the input impedance of the basic amplifier is\n\n$$\nz_{i a}=z_{i}+R_{E} \\| R_{F}=(100+5 \\| 20) \\mathrm{k} \\Omega=104 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega\n$$\n\n**Figure 8.27**: Series-shunt feedback circuit.\n\nThe parallel combination of $z_{L}$ and $\\left(R_{F}+R_{E}\\right)$ in Fig. 8.27 is\n\n$$\nz_{L X}=\\frac{10 \\times 25}{35}=7.14 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega\n$$\n\nSubstituting into (8.129) gives, for the gain of the basic amplifier in Fig. 8.26,\n\n$$\na=\\frac{100}{100+4} \\times 3000 \\times \\frac{7.14}{7.14+10}=1202\n$$\n\nFrom (8.127), the feedback factor $f$ for this circuit is\n\n$$\nf=\\frac{5}{5+20}=0.2\n$$\n\nThus, the loop gain is\n\n$$\nT=a f=1202 \\times 0.2=240\n$$\n\nThe input impedance of the feedback amplifier is therefore\n\n$$\nZ_{i}=z_{i a}(1+T)=104 \\times 241 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega=25 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega\n$$\n\nIn this example, the loading effect produced by $\\left(R_{F}+R_{E}\\right)$ significantly impacts the gain $a$ of the basic amplifier and thus the input impedance of the feedback amplifier.\n\nAs another example of a series-shunt feedback circuit, consider the series-series triple in Fig. 8.18a but assume the output signal is taken as the voltage at the emitter of $Q_{3}$, as shown in Fig. 8.27. This illustrates how the same circuit can realize different feedback functions if the output is taken from different nodes. As with Fig. 8.18a, the basic amplifier in Fig. 8.27 cannot be represented as a two-port.

This approach is particularly beneficial for analyzing and designing amplifiers and other linear circuits where feedback and inter-stage interactions are significant.\n\nFigure 8.29 The $g$-parameter representation of a two-port.\nAs depicted in Fig. 8.30a, at the input, we observe that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{s}=\\left(y_{S}+g_{11 a}+g_{11 f}\\right) v_{i}+\\left(g_{12 a}+g_{12 f}\\right) i_{o} \\tag{8.134}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAt the output\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n0=\\left(g_{21 a}+g_{21 f}\\right) v_{i}+\\left(z_{L}+g_{22 a}+g_{22 f}\\right) i_{o} \\tag{8.135}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nDefining\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& y_{i}=y_{S}+g_{11 a}+g_{11 f}  \\tag{8.136}\\\\\n& z_{o}=z_{L}+g_{22 a}+g_{22 f} \\tag{8.137}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nand making the assumptions\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& \\left|g_{12 a}\\right| \\ll\\left|g_{12 f}\\right|  \\tag{8.138}\\\\\n& \\left|g_{21 a}\\right| \\gg\\left|g_{21 f}\\right| \\tag{8.139}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwe derive\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{i_{o}}{i_{s}}=A \\simeq \\frac{-\\frac{g_{21 a}}{y_{i} z_{o}}}{1+\\left(-\\frac{g_{21 a}}{y_{i} z_{o}}\\right) g_{12 f}}=\\frac{a}{1+a f} \\tag{8.140}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:The circuit diagram illustrates a shunt-series feedback configuration using g-parameter representation.

Since this conforms to the structure of an ideal feedback circuit, all the findings from Section 8.4.3 can now be applied.\n\nA typical shunt-series feedback amplifier is the current-feedback pair shown in Fig. 8.31. Since the basic amplifier in Fig. 8.31 cannot be directly represented by a two-port, the representation of Fig. 8.30b cannot be used straightforwardly. However, as in earlier examples, the feedback network can be represented by a two-port, and the $g$ parameters can be computed using Fig. 8.32 to yield\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ng_{11 f} & =\\left.\\frac{i_{1}}{v_{1}}\\right|_{i_{2}=0}=\\frac{1}{R_{F}+R_{E}}  \\tag{8.143}\\\\\ng_{12 f} & =\\left.\\frac{i_{1}}{i_{2}}\\right|_{v_{1}=0}=-\\frac{R_{E}}{R_{E}+R_{F}}  \\tag{8.144}\\\\\ng_{22 f} & =\\left.\\frac{v_{2}}{i_{2}}\\right|_{v_{1}=0}=R_{E} \\| R_{F} \\tag{8.145}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nUsing (8.139), we disregard $g_{21 f}$.
