# 9. Frequency Response and Stability of Feedback Amplifiers

## 9.1 Introduction

In Chapter 8, we considered the effects of negative feedback on circuit parameters such as gain and terminal impedance. We saw that application of negative feedback resulted in a number of performance improvements, such as reduced sensitivity of gain to active-device parameter changes and reduction of distortion due to circuit nonlinearities.

In this chapter, we see the effect of negative feedback on the frequency response of a circuit. The possibility of oscillation in feedback circuits is illustrated, and methods of overcoming these problems by compensation of the circuit are described. Finally, the effect of compensation on the large-signal high-frequency performance of feedback amplifiers is investigated.

Much of the analysis in this chapter is based on the ideal block diagram in Fig. 9.1. This block diagram includes the forward gain $a$ and feedback factor $f$, which are the parameters used in two-port analysis of feedback circuits in Chapter 8. The equations and results in this chapter could be expressed in terms of the parameters used in the return-ratio analysis in Chapter 8 by an appropriate change of variables, as shown in Appendix A9.1.

The equations and relationships in this chapter are general and can be applied to any feedback circuit. However, for simplicity we will often assume the feedback factor $f$ is a positive, unitless constant. One circuit that has such an $f$ is the series-shunt feedback circuit shown in Fig 8.24. In this circuit, the feedback network is a resistive voltage divider, so $f$ is a constant with $0 \leq f \leq 1$. The forward gain $a$ is a voltage gain that is positive at low frequencies. This circuit gives a noninverting closed-loop voltage gain.

## 9.2 Relation Between Gain and Bandwidth in Feedback Amplifiers

Chapter 8 showed that the performance improvements produced by negative feedback were obtained at the expense of a reduction in gain by a factor $(1+T)$, where $T$ is the loop gain. The performance specifications that were improved were also changed by the factor $(1+T)$.

In addition to the foregoing effects, negative feedback also tends to broadband the amplifier. Consider first a feedback circuit as shown in Fig. 9.1 with a simple basic amplifier whose gain function contains a single pole

$$
\begin{equation*}
a(s)=\frac{a_{0}}{1-\frac{s}{p_{1}}} \tag{9.1}
\end{equation*}
$$

Figure 9.1 Feedback circuit configuration.
where $a_{0}$ is the low-frequency gain of the basic amplifier and $p_{1}$ is the basic-amplifier pole in radians per second. Assume that the feedback path is purely resistive and thus the feedback function $f$ is a positive constant. Since Fig. 9.1 is an ideal feedback arrangement, the overall gain is

$$
\begin{equation*}
A(s)=\frac{v_{o}}{v_{i}}=\frac{a(s)}{1+a(s) f} \tag{9.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the loop gain is $T(s)=a(s) f$. Substitution of (9.1) in (9.2) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
A(s)=\frac{\frac{a_{0}}{1-\frac{s}{p_{1}}}}{1+\frac{a_{0} f}{1-\frac{s}{p_{1}}}}=\frac{a_{0}}{1-\frac{s}{p_{1}}+a_{0} f}=\frac{a_{0}}{1+a_{0} f} \frac{1}{1-\frac{s}{p_{1}} \frac{1}{1+a_{0} f}} \tag{9.3}
\end{equation*}
$$

From (9.3) the low-frequency gain $A_{0}$ is

$$
\begin{equation*}
A_{0}=\frac{a_{0}}{1+T_{0}} \tag{9.4}
\end{equation*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{equation*}
T_{0}=a_{0} f=\text { low-frequency loop gain } \tag{9.5}
\end{equation*}
$$

The $-3-\mathrm{dB}$ bandwidth of the feedback circuit (i.e., the new pole magnitude) is $\left(1+a_{o} f\right) \cdot\left|p_{1}\right|$ from (9.3). Thus the feedback has reduced the low-frequency gain by a factor $\left(1+T_{0}\right)$, which is consistent with the results of Chapter 8 , but it is now apparent that the $-3-\mathrm{dB}$ frequency of the circuit has been increased by the same quantity $\left(1+T_{0}\right)$. Note that the gain-bandwidth product is constant. These results are illustrated in the Bode plots of Fig. 9.2, where the magnitudes of
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_c6361d8e0343487b8e82g-025.jpg?height=511&width=1043&top_left_y=1720&top_left_x=390)

$a(j \omega)$ and $A(j \omega)$ are plotted versus frequency on log scales. It is apparent that the gain curves for any value of $T_{0}$ are contained in an envelope bounded by the curve of $|a(j \omega)|$.

Because the use of negative feedback allows the designer to trade gain for bandwidth, negative feedback is widely used as a method for designing broadband amplifiers. The gain reduction that occurs is made up by using additional gain stages, which in general are also feedback amplifiers.

Let us now examine the effect of the feedback on the pole of the overall transfer function $A(s)$. It is apparent from (9.3) that as the low-frequency loop gain $T_{0}$ is increased, the magnitude of the pole of $A(s)$ increases. This is illustrated in Fig. 9.3, which shows the locus of the pole of $A(s)$ in the $s$ plane as $T_{0}$ varies. The pole starts at $p_{1}$ for $T_{0}=0$ and moves out along the negative real axis as $T_{0}$ is made positive. Figure 9.3 is a simple root-locus diagram and will be discussed further in Section 9.5.

## 9.3 Instability and the Nyquist Criterion ${ }^{1}$

In the above simple example the basic amplifier was assumed to have a single-pole transfer function, and this situation is closely approximated in practice by internally compensated general-purpose op amps. However, many amplifiers have multipole transfer functions that cause deviations from the above results. The process of compensation overcomes these problems, as will be seen later.

Consider an amplifier with a three-pole transfer function

$$
\begin{equation*}
a(s)=\frac{a_{0}}{\left(1-\frac{s}{p_{1}}\right)\left(1-\frac{s}{p_{2}}\right)\left(1-\frac{s}{p_{3}}\right)} \tag{9.6}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\left|p_{1}\right|,\left|p_{2}\right|$, and $\left|p_{3}\right|$ are the pole magnitudes in rad/s. The poles are shown in the $s$ plane in Fig. 9.4 and gain magnitude $|a(j \omega)|$ and phase $\mathrm{ph} a(j \omega)$ are plotted versus frequency in Fig. 9.5 assuming about a factor of 10 separation between the poles. Only asymptotes are

Figure 9.5 Gain and phase versus frequency for a circuit with a three-pole transfer function.
shown for the magnitude plot. At frequencies above the first pole magnitude $\left|p_{1}\right|$, the plot of $|a(j \omega)|$ falls at $6 \mathrm{~dB} /$ octave and $\mathrm{ph} a(j \omega)$ approaches $-90^{\circ}$. Above $\left|p_{2}\right|$ these become 12 $\mathrm{dB} /$ octave and $-180^{\circ}$, and above $\left|p_{3}\right|$ they become $18 \mathrm{~dB} /$ octave and $-270^{\circ}$. The frequency where $\mathrm{ph} a(j \omega)=-180^{\circ}$ has special significance and is marked $\omega_{180}$, and the value of $|a(j \omega)|$ at this frequency is $a_{180}$. If the three poles are fairly widely separated (by a factor of 10 or more), the phase shifts at frequencies $\left|p_{1}\right|,\left|p_{2}\right|$, and $\left|p_{3}\right|$ are approximately $-45^{\circ},-135^{\circ}$, and $-225^{\circ}$, respectively. This will now be assumed for simplicity. In addition, the gain magnitude will be assumed to follow the asymptotic curve and the effect of these assumptions in practical cases will be considered later.

Now consider this amplifier connected in a feedback loop as in Fig. 9.1 with $f$ a positive constant. Since $f$ is constant, the loop gain $T(j \omega)=a(j \omega) f$ will have the same variation with frequency as $a(j \omega)$. A plot of $a f(j \omega)=T(j \omega)$ in magnitude and phase on a polar plot (with $\omega$ as a parameter) can thus be drawn using the data of Fig. 9.5 and the magnitude of $f$. Such a plot for this example is shown in Fig. 9.6 (not to scale) and is called a Nyquist diagram. The variable on the curve is frequency and varies from $\omega=-\infty$ to $\omega=\infty$. For $\omega=0,|T(j \omega)|=T_{0}$ and ph $T(j \omega)=0$, and the curve meets the real axis with an intercept $T_{0}$. As $\omega$ increases, as Fig. 9.5 shows, $|a(j \omega)|$ decreases and ph $a(j \omega)$ becomes negative and thus the plot is in the fourth quadrant. As $\omega \rightarrow \infty$, ph $a(j \omega) \rightarrow-270^{\circ}$ and $|a(j \omega)| \rightarrow 0$. Consequently, the plot is asymptotic to the origin and is tangent to the imaginary axis. At the frequency $\omega_{180}$ the phase is $-180^{\circ}$ and the curve crosses the negative real axis. If $\left|a\left(j \omega_{180}\right) f\right|>1$ at this point, the Nyquist diagram will encircle the point $(-1,0)$ as shown, and this has particular significance, as will
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_c6361d8e0343487b8e82g-028.jpg?height=653&width=1028&top_left_y=210&top_left_x=408)

Figure 9.6 Nyquist diagram [polar plot of $T(j \omega)$ in magnitude and phase] corresponding to the characteristic of Fig. 9.5 (not to scale).
now become apparent. For the purposes of this treatment, the Nyquist criterion for stability of the amplifier can be stated as follows:
"Consider a feedback amplifier with a stable $T(s)$ (i.e., all poles of $T(s)$ are in the left half-plane). If the Nyquist plot of $T(j \omega)$ encircles the point $(-1,0)$, the feedback amplifier is unstable."

This criterion simply amounts to a mathematical test for poles of transfer function $A(s)$ in the right half-plane. If the Nyquist plot encircles the point $(-1,0)$, the amplifier has poles in the right half-plane and the circuit will oscillate. In fact the number of encirclements of the point $(-1,0)$ gives the number of right half-plane poles and in this example there are two. The significance of poles in the right half-plane can be seen by assuming that a circuit has a pair of complex poles at $\left(\sigma_{1} \pm j \omega_{1}\right)$ where $\sigma_{1}$ is positive. The transient response of the circuit then contains a term $K_{1} \exp \sigma_{1} t \sin \omega_{1} t$, which represents a growing sinusoid if $\sigma_{1}$ is positive. ( $K_{1}$ is a constant representing initial conditions.) This term is then present even if no further input is applied, and a circuit behaving in this way is said to be unstable or oscillatory.

The significance of the point $(-1,0)$ can be appreciated if the Nyquist diagram is assumed to pass through this point. Then at the frequency $\omega_{180}, T(j \omega)=a(j \omega) f=-1$ and $A(j \omega)=\infty$ using (9.2) in the frequency domain. The feedback amplifier is thus calculated to have a forward gain of infinity, and this indicates the onset of instability and oscillation. This situation corresponds to poles of $A(s)$ on the $j \omega$ axis in the $s$ plane. If $T_{0}$ is then increased by increasing $a_{0}$ or $f$, the Nyquist diagram expands linearly and then encircles $(-1,0)$. This corresponds to poles of $A(s)$ in the right half-plane, as shown in Fig. 9.7.

From the above criterion for stability, a simpler test can be derived that is useful in most common cases.
"If $|T(j \omega)|>1$ at the frequency where ph $T(j \omega)=-180^{\circ}$, then the amplifier is unstable." The validity of this criterion for the example considered here is apparent from inspection of Fig. 9.6 and application of the Nyquist criterion.

In order to examine the effect of feedback on the stability of an amplifier, consider the three-pole amplifier with gain function given by (9.6) to be placed in a negative-feedback loop with $f$ constant. The gain (in decibels) and phase of the amplifier are shown again in Fig. 9.8, and also plotted is the quantity $20 \log _{10} 1 / f$. The value of $20 \log _{10} 1 / f$ is approximately equal
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_c6361d8e0343487b8e82g-029.jpg?height=496&width=1089&top_left_y=210&top_left_x=367)

to the low-frequency gain in decibels with feedback applied since

$$
\begin{equation*}
A_{0}=\frac{a_{0}}{1+a_{0} f} \tag{9.7}
\end{equation*}
$$

and thus

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{f} \approx A_{0} \tag{9.8}
\end{equation*}
$$

if

$$
T_{0}=a_{0} f \gg 1
$$

Consider the vertical distance between the curve of $20 \log _{10}|a(j \omega)|$ and the line $20 \log _{10} 1 / f$ in Fig. 9.8. Since the vertical scale is in decibels this quantity is

$$
\begin{align*}
x & =20 \log _{10}|a(j \omega)|-20 \log _{10} 1 / f  \tag{9.9}\\
& =20 \log _{10}|a(j \omega) f| \\
& =20 \log _{10}|T(j \omega)| \tag{9.10}
\end{align*}
$$

Thus the distance $x$ is a direct measure in decibels of the loop-gain magnitude, $|T(j \omega)|$. The point where the curve of $20 \log _{10}|a(j \omega)|$ intersects the line $20 \log _{10} 1 / f$ is the point where the loop-gain magnitude $|T(j \omega)|$ is 0 dB or unity, and the curve of $|a(j \omega)|$ in decibels in Fig. 9.8 can thus be considered a curve of $|T(j \omega)|$ in decibels if the dotted line at $20 \log _{10} 1 / f$ is taken as the new zero axis.

The simple example of Section 9.1 showed that the gain curve versus frequency with feedback applied $\left(20 \log _{10}|A(j \omega)|\right)$ follows the $20 \log _{10} A_{0}$ line until it intersects the gain curve $20 \log _{10}|a(j \omega)|$. At higher frequencies the curve $20 \log _{10}|A(j \omega)|$ simply follows the curve of $20 \log _{10}|a(j \omega)|$ for the basic amplifier. The reason for this is now apparent in that at the higher frequencies the loop gain $|T(j \omega)| \rightarrow 0$ and the feedback then has no influence on the gain of the amplifier.

Figure 9.8 shows that the loop-gain magnitude $|T(j \omega)|$ is unity at frequency $\omega_{0}$. At this frequency the phase of $T(j \omega)$ has not reached $-180^{\circ}$ for the case shown, and using the modified Nyquist criterion stated above we conclude that this feedback loop is stable. Obviously $|T(j \omega)|<1$ at the frequency where $\mathrm{ph} T(j \omega)=-180^{\circ}$. If the polar Nyquist diagram is sketched for this example, it does not encircle the point $(-1,0)$.

As $|T(j \omega)|$ is made closer to unity at the frequency where ph $T(j \omega)=-180^{\circ}$, the amplifier has a smaller margin of stability, and this can be specified in two ways. The most common is the phase margin, which is defined as follows:

Phase margin $=180^{\circ}+(\mathrm{ph} T(j \omega)$ at frequency where $|T(j \omega)|=1)$. The phase margin is indicated in Fig. 9.8 and must be greater than $0^{\circ}$ for stability.

Another measure of stability is the gain margin. This is defined to be $1 /|T(j \omega)|$ in decibels at the frequency where ph $T(j \omega)=-180^{\circ}$, and this must be greater than 0 dB for stability.

The significance of the phase-margin magnitude is now explored. For the feedback amplifier considered in Section 9.1, where the basic amplifier has a single-pole response, the phase margin is obviously $90^{\circ}$ if the low-frequency loop gain is reasonably large. This is illustrated in Fig. 9.9 and results in a very stable amplifier. A typical lower allowable limit for the phase margin in practice is $45^{\circ}$, with a value of $60^{\circ}$ being more common.

Consider a feedback amplifier with a phase margin of $45^{\circ}$ and a feedback function $f$ that is real (and thus constant). Then

$$
\begin{equation*}
\text { ph } T\left(j \omega_{0}\right)=-135^{\circ} \tag{9.11}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\omega_{0}$ is the frequency defined by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|T\left(j \omega_{0}\right)\right|=1 \tag{9.12}
\end{equation*}
$$

Now $\left|T\left(j \omega_{0}\right)\right|=\left|a\left(j \omega_{0}\right) f\right|=1$ implies that

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|a\left(j \omega_{0}\right)\right|=\frac{1}{f} \tag{9.13}
\end{equation*}
$$

assuming that $f$ is positive real.

Figure 9.9 Gain and phase versus frequency for a single-pole basic amplifier showing the phase margin for a low-frequency loop gain $T_{0}$.

The overall gain is

$$
\begin{equation*}
A(j \omega)=\frac{a(j \omega)}{1+T(j \omega)} \tag{9.14}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substitution of (9.11) and (9.12) in (9.14) gives

$$
A\left(j \omega_{0}\right)=\frac{a\left(j \omega_{0}\right)}{1+e^{-j 135^{\circ}}}=\frac{a\left(j \omega_{0}\right)}{1-0.7-0.7 j}=\frac{a\left(j \omega_{0}\right)}{0.3-0.7 j}
$$

and thus

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|A\left(j \omega_{0}\right)\right|=\frac{\left|a\left(j \omega_{0}\right)\right|}{0.76}=\frac{1.3}{f} \tag{9.15}
\end{equation*}
$$

using (9.13).
The frequency $\omega_{0}$, where $\left|T\left(j \omega_{0}\right)\right|=1$, is the nominal $-3-\mathrm{dB}$ point for a single-pole basic amplifier, but in this case there is $2.4 \mathrm{~dB}(1.3 \times)$ of peaking above the low-frequency gain of $1 / f$.

Consider a phase margin of $60^{\circ}$. At the frequency $\omega_{0}$ in this case

$$
\begin{equation*}
\operatorname{ph} T\left(j \omega_{0}\right)=-120^{\circ} \tag{9.16}
\end{equation*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|T\left(j \omega_{0}\right)\right|=1 \tag{9.17}
\end{equation*}
$$

Following a similar analysis we obtain

$$
\left|A\left(j \omega_{0}\right)\right|=\frac{1}{f}
$$

In this case there is no peaking at $\omega=\omega_{0}$, but there has also been no gain reduction at this frequency.

Finally, the case where the phase margin is $90^{\circ}$ can be similarly calculated. In this case

$$
\begin{equation*}
\operatorname{ph} T\left(j \omega_{0}\right)=-90^{\circ} \tag{9.18}
\end{equation*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|T\left(j \omega_{0}\right)\right|=1 \tag{9.19}
\end{equation*}
$$

A similar analysis gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|A\left(j \omega_{0}\right)\right|=\frac{0.7}{f} \tag{9.20}
\end{equation*}
$$

As expected in this case, the gain at frequency $\omega_{0}$ is 3 dB below the midband value.
These results are illustrated in Fig. 9.10, where the normalized overall gain versus frequency is shown for various phase margins. The plots are drawn assuming the response is dominated by the first two poles of the transfer function, except for the case of the $90^{\circ}$ phase margin, which has one pole only. As the phase margin diminishes, the gain peak becomes larger until the gain approaches infinity and oscillation occurs for phase margin $=0^{\circ}$. The gain peak usually occurs close to the frequency where $|T(j \omega)|=1$, but for a phase margin of $60^{\circ}$ there is 0.2 dB of peaking just below this frequency. Note that after the peak, the gain curves approach an asymptote of $-12 \mathrm{~dB} /$ octave for phase margins other than $90^{\circ}$. This is because the open-loop gain falls at -12 dB /octave due to the presence of two poles in the transfer function.

The simple tests for stability of a feedback amplifier (i.e., positive phase and gain margins) can only be applied when the phase and gain margins are uniquely defined. The phase margin is uniquely defined if there is only one frequency at which the magnitude of the loop gain equals one. Similarly, the gain margin is uniquely defined if there is only one frequency at which the phase of the loop gain equals $-180^{\circ}$. In most feedback circuits, these margins are uniquely defined. However, if either of these margins is not uniquely defined, then stability should be checked using a Nyquist diagram and the Nyquist criterion.

Figure 9.10 Normalized overall gain for feedback amplifiers versus normalized frequency for various phase margins. Frequency is normalized to the frequency where the loop gain is unity.

The loop gain $T=a f$ can be examined to determine the stability of a feedback circuit, as explained in this section. Alternatively these measures of stability can be applied to the return ratio $\mathscr{R}$, as explained in Appendix A9.1. Techniques for simulating $\mathscr{R}^{2-5}$ and $T=a f^{4}$ using SPICE have been developed, based on methods for measuring loop transmission. ${ }^{6,7}$ These techniques measure the loop transmission at the closed-loop dc operating point. An advantage of SPICE simulation of the loop transmission is that parasitics that might have an important effect are included. For example, parasitic capacitance at the op-amp input introduces frequency dependence in the feedback network in Fig. 8.24, which may degrade the phase margin.

## 9.4 Compensation

### 9.4.1 Theory of Compensation

Consider again the amplifier whose gain and phase is shown in Fig. 9.8. For the feedback circuit in which this was assumed to be connected, the forward gain was $A_{0}$, as shown in Fig. 9.8 , and the phase margin was positive. Thus the circuit was stable. It is apparent, however, that if the amount of feedback is increased by making $f$ larger (and thus $A_{0}$ smaller), oscillation will eventually occur. This is shown in Fig. 9.11, where $f_{1}$ is chosen to give a zero phase margin and the corresponding overall gain is $A_{1} \simeq 1 / f_{1}$. If the feedback is increased to $f_{2}$ (and $A_{2} \simeq 1 / f_{2}$ is the overall gain), the phase margin is negative and the circuit will oscillate. Thus if this amplifier is to be used in a feedback loop with loop gain larger than $a_{0} f_{1}$, efforts
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_c6361d8e0343487b8e82g-033.jpg?height=1029&width=1028&top_left_y=1167&top_left_x=393)

Figure 9.11 Gain and phase versus frequency for a three-pole basic amplifier. Feedback factor $f_{1}$ gives a zero phase margin and factor $f_{2}$ gives a negative phase margin.
must be made to increase the phase margin. This process is known as compensation. Note that without compensation, the forward gain of the feedback amplifier cannot be made less than $A_{1} \simeq 1 / f_{1}$ because of the oscillation problem.

The simplest and most common method of compensation is to reduce the bandwidth of the amplifier (often called narrowbanding). That is, a dominant pole is deliberately introduced into the amplifier to force the phase shift to be less than $-180^{\circ}$ when the loop gain is unity. This involves a direct sacrifice of the frequency capability of the amplifier.

If $f$ is constant, the most difficult case to compensate is $f=1$, which is a unity-gain feedback configuration. In this case the loop-gain curve is identical to the gain curve of the basic amplifier. Consider this situation and assume that the basic amplifier has the same characteristic as in Fig. 9.11. To compensate the amplifier, we introduce a new dominant pole with magnitude $\left|p_{D}\right|$, as shown in Fig. 9.12, and assume that this does not affect the original amplifier poles with magnitudes $\left|p_{1}\right|,\left|p_{2}\right|$, and $\left|p_{3}\right|$. This is often not the case but is assumed here for purposes of illustration.

The introduction of the dominant pole with magnitude $\left|p_{D}\right|$ into the amplifier gain function causes the gain magnitude to decrease at $6 \mathrm{~dB} /$ octave until frequency $\left|p_{1}\right|$ is reached, and over this region the amplifier phase shift asymptotes to $-90^{\circ}$. If frequency $\left|p_{D}\right|$ is chosen so that the gain $|a(j \omega)|$ is unity at frequency $\left|p_{1}\right|$ as shown, then the loop gain is also unity at frequency $\left|p_{1}\right|$ for the assumed case of unity feedback with $f=1$. The phase margin in this case is then $45^{\circ}$, which means that the amplifier is stable. The original amplifier would have been unstable in such a feedback connection.

Figure 9.12 Gain and phase versus frequency for a three-pole basic amplifier. Compensation for unity-gain feedback operation $(f=1)$ is achieved by introduction of a negative real pole with magnitude $\left|p_{D}\right|$.

The price that has been paid for achieving stability in this case is that with the feedback removed, the basic amplifier has a unity-gain bandwidth of only $\left|p_{1}\right|$, which is much less than before. Also, with feedback applied, the loop gain now begins to decrease at a frequency $\left|p_{D}\right|$, and all the benefits of feedback diminish as the loop gain decreases. For example, in Chapter 8 it was shown that shunt feedback at the input or output of an amplifier reduces the basic terminal impedance by $[1+T(j \omega)]$. Since $T(j \omega)$ is frequency dependent, the terminal impedance of a shunt-feedback amplifier will begin to rise when $|T(j \omega)|$ begins to decrease. Thus the high-frequency terminal impedance will appear inductive, as in the case of $z_{0}$ for an emitter follower, which was calculated in Chapter 7. (See Problem 9.8.)

#### EXAMPLE

Calculate the dominant-pole magnitude required to give unity-gain compensation of the 702 op amp with a phase margin of $45^{\circ}$. The low-frequency gain is $a_{0}=3600$ and the circuit has poles at $-\left(p_{1} / 2 \pi\right)=1 \mathrm{MHz},-\left(p_{2} / 2 \pi\right)=4 \mathrm{MHz}$, and $-\left(p_{3} / 2 \pi\right)=40 \mathrm{MHz}$.

In this example, the second pole $p_{2}$ is sufficiently close to $p_{1}$ to produce significant phase shift at the amplifier $-3-\mathrm{dB}$ frequency. The approach to this problem will be to use the approximate results developed above to obtain an initial estimate of the required dominant-pole magnitude and then to empirically adjust this estimate to obtain the required results.

The results of Fig. 9.12 indicate that a dominant pole with magnitude $\left|p_{D}\right|$ should be introduced so that gain $a_{0}=3600$ is reduced to unity at $\left|p_{1} / 2 \pi\right|=1 \mathrm{MHz}$ with a $6-\mathrm{dB} /$ octave decrease as a function of frequency. The product $|a| \omega$ is constant where the slope of the gain-magnitude plot is -6 dB /octave; therefore

$$
\left|\frac{p_{D}}{2 \pi}\right|=\frac{1}{a_{0}}\left|\frac{p_{1}}{2 \pi}\right|=\frac{10^{6}}{3600} \mathrm{~Hz}=278 \mathrm{~Hz}
$$

This would give a transfer function

$$
\begin{equation*}
a(j \omega)=\frac{3600}{\left(1+\frac{j \omega}{\left|p_{D}\right|}\right)\left(1+\frac{j \omega}{\left|p_{1}\right|}\right)\left(1+\frac{j \omega}{\left|p_{2}\right|}\right)\left(1+\frac{j \omega}{\left|p_{3}\right|}\right)} \tag{9.21}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the pole magnitudes are in radians per second. Equation 9.21 gives a unity-gain frequency [where $|a(j \omega)|=1$ ] of 780 kHz . This is slightly below the design value of 1 MHz because the actual gain curve is 3 dB below the asymptote at the break frequency $\left|p_{1}\right|$. At 780 kHz the phase shift obtained from (9.21) is $-139^{\circ}$ instead of the desired $-135^{\circ}$ and this includes a contribution of $-11^{\circ}$ from pole $p_{2}$. Although this result is close enough for most purposes, a phase margin of precisely $45^{\circ}$ can be achieved by empirically reducing $\left|p_{D}\right|$ until (9.21) gives a phase shift of $-135^{\circ}$ at the unity gain frequency. This occurs for $\left|p_{D} / 2 \pi\right|=$ 260 Hz , which gives a unity-gain frequency of 730 kHz .

Consider now the performance of the amplifier whose characteristic is shown in Fig. 9.12 (with dominant pole magnitude $\left|p_{D}\right|$ ) when used in a feedback loop with $f<1$ (i.e., overall gain $A_{0}>1$ ). This case is shown in Fig. 9.13. The loop gain now falls to unity at frequency $\omega_{x}$ and the phase margin of the circuit is now approximately $90^{\circ}$. The $-3-\mathrm{dB}$ bandwidth of the feedback circuit is $\omega_{x}$. The circuit now has more compensation than is needed, and, in fact, bandwidth is being wasted. Thus, although it is convenient to compensate an amplifier for unity gain and then use it unchanged for other applications (as is done in many op amps), this procedure is quite wasteful of bandwidth. Fixed-gain amplifiers that are designed for applications where maximum bandwidth is required are usually compensated for a specified phase margin (typically $45^{\circ}$ to $60^{\circ}$ ) at the required gain value. However, op amps are

general-purpose circuits that are used with differing feedback networks with $f$ values ranging from 0 to 1 . Optimum bandwidth is achieved in such circuits if the compensation is tailored to the gain value required, and this approach gives much higher bandwidths for high gain values, as seen in Fig. 9.14. This figure shows compensation of the amplifier characteristic of Fig. 9.11 for operation in a feedback circuit with forward gain $A_{0}$. A dominant pole is added with magnitude $\left|p_{D}^{\prime}\right|$ to give a phase margin of $45^{\circ}$. Frequency $\left|p_{D}^{\prime}\right|$ is obviously $\gg\left|p_{D}\right|$, and the $-3-\mathrm{dB}$ bandwidth of the feedback amplifier is nominally $\left|p_{1}\right|$, at which frequency the loop gain is 0 dB (disregarding peaking). The $-3-\mathrm{dB}$ frequency from Fig. 9.13 would be only $\omega_{x}=\left|p_{1}\right| / A_{0}$ if unity-gain compensation had been used. Obviously, since $A_{0}$ can be large, the improvement in bandwidth is significant.

In the compensation schemes discussed above, an additional dominant pole was assumed to be added to the amplifier, and the original amplifier poles were assumed to be unaffected by this procedure. In terms of circuit bandwidth, a much more efficient way to compensate the amplifier is to add capacitance to the circuit in such a way that the original amplifier dominant pole magnitude $\left|p_{1}\right|$ is reduced so that it performs the compensation function. This technique requires access to the internal nodes of the amplifier, and knowledge of the nodes in the circuit where added capacitance will reduce frequency $\left|p_{1}\right|$.

Consider the effect of compensating for unity-gain operation the amplifier characteristic of Fig. 9.11 in this way. Again assume that higher frequency poles $p_{2}$ and $p_{3}$ are unaffected by this procedure. In fact, depending on the method of compensation, these poles are usually moved up or down in magnitude by the compensation. This point will be taken up later.

Figure 9.14 Gain and phase versus frequency for an amplifier compensated for use in a feedback loop with $f<1$ and a phase margin of $45^{\circ}$. Compensation is achieved by adding a new pole $p_{D}^{\prime}$ to the amplifier.

Compensation of the amplifier by reducing $\left|p_{1}\right|$ is shown in Fig. 9.15. For a $45^{\circ}$-phase margin in a unity-gain feedback configuration, dominant pole magnitude $\left|p_{1}^{\prime}\right|$ must cause the gain to fall to unity at frequency $\left|p_{2}\right|$ (the second pole magnitude). Thus the nominal bandwidth in a unity-gain configuration is $\left|p_{2}\right|$, and the loop gain is unity at this frequency. This result can be contrasted with a bandwidth of $\left|p_{1}\right|$, as shown in Fig. 9.12 for compensation achieved by adding another pole with magnitude $\left|p_{D}\right|$ to the amplifier. In practical amplifiers, frequency $\left|p_{2}\right|$ is often 5 or 10 times frequency $\left|p_{1}\right|$ and substantial improvements in bandwidth are thus achieved.

The results of this section illustrate why the basic amplifier of a feedback circuit is usually designed with as few stages as possible. Each stage of gain inevitably adds more poles to the transfer function, complicating the compensation problem, particularly if a wide bandwidth is required.

### 9.4.2 Methods of Compensation

In order to compensate a circuit by the common method of narrowbanding described above, it is necessary to add capacitance to create a dominant pole with the desired magnitude. One method of achieving this is shown in Fig. 9.16, which is a schematic of the first two stages of a simple amplifier. A large capacitor $C$ is connected between the collectors of the input stage. The output stage, which is assumed relatively broadband, is not shown. A differential half-circuit of Fig. 9.16 is shown in Fig. 9.17, and it should be noted that the compensation
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_c6361d8e0343487b8e82g-038.jpg?height=910&width=1133&top_left_y=207&top_left_x=350)

Figure 9.15 Gain and phase versus frequency for an amplifier compensated for use in a feedback loop with $f=1$ and a phase margin of $45^{\circ}$. Compensation is achieved by reducing the magnitude $\left|p_{1}\right|$ of the dominant pole of the original amplifier.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_c6361d8e0343487b8e82g-038.jpg?height=671&width=1256&top_left_y=1248&top_left_x=269)

Figure 9.16 Compensation of an amplifier by introduction of a large capacitor $C$.
capacitor is doubled in the half-circuit. The major contributions to the dominant pole of a circuit of this type (if $R_{S}$ is not large) come from the input capacitance of $Q_{4}$ and Miller capacitance associated with $Q_{4}$. Thus the compensation as shown will reduce the magnitude of the dominant pole of the original amplifier so that it performs the required compensation function. Almost certainly, however, the higher frequency poles of the amplifier will also be changed by the addition of $C$. In practice, the best method of approaching the compensation
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_c6361d8e0343487b8e82g-039.jpg?height=408&width=1026&top_left_y=193&top_left_x=406)

Figure 9.17 Differential half-circuit of Fig. 9.16.
design is to use computer simulation to determine the original pole positions. A first estimate of $C$ is made on the assumption that the higher frequency poles do not change in magnitude and a new computer simulation is made with $C$ included to check this assumption. Another estimate of $C$ is then made on the basis of the new simulation, and this process usually converges after several iterations.

The magnitude of the dominant pole of Fig. 9.17 can be estimated using zero-value time constant analysis. However, if the value of $C$ required is very large, this capacitor will dominate and a good estimate of the dominant pole can be made by considering $C$ only and ignoring other circuit capacitance. In that case the dominant-pole magnitude is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|p_{D}\right|=\frac{1}{2 C R} \tag{9.22}
\end{equation*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{equation*}
R=R_{L 1} \| R_{i 4} \tag{9.23}
\end{equation*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{i 4}=r_{b 4}+r_{\pi 4} \tag{9.24}
\end{equation*}
$$

One disadvantage of the above method of compensation is that the value of $C$ required is quite large (typically $>1000 \mathrm{pF}$ ) and cannot be realized on a monolithic chip.

Many general-purpose op amps have unity-gain compensation included on the monolithic chip and require no further compensation from the user. (The sacrifice in bandwidth caused by this technique when using gain other than unity was described earlier.) In order to realize an internally compensated monolithic op amp, compensation must be achieved using capacitance less than about 50 pF . This can be achieved using Miller multiplication of the capacitance as in the 741 op amp , which uses a 30 pF compensation capacitor and was analyzed in previous editions of this book.

As well as allowing use of a small capacitor that can be integrated on the monolithic chip, this type of compensation has another significant advantage. This is due to the phenomenon of pole splitting, ${ }^{8}$ in which the dominant pole moves to a lower frequency while the next pole moves to a higher frequency. The splitting of the two low-frequency poles in practical op amps is often a rather complex process involving other higher frequency poles and zeros as well. However, the process involved can be illustrated with the two-stage op-amp model in Fig. 9.18. The input is from from a current $i_{s}$, which stems from the transconductance of the first stage times the op-amp differential input voltage. Resistors $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ represent the total shunt resistances at the output of the first and second stages, including transistor input and output resistances. Similarly, $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ represent the total shunt capacitances at the same places. Capacitor $C$ represents transistor collector-base capacitance of the amplifying transistor in the second stage plus the compensation capacitance.

Figure 9.18 Small-signal equivalent circuit of a single transistor stage. Feedback capacitor $C$ includes compensation capacitance.

For the circuit of Fig. 9.18,

$$
\begin{gather*}
-i_{s}=\frac{v_{1}}{R_{1}}+v_{1} C_{1} s+\left(v_{1}-v_{o}\right) C s  \tag{9.25}\\
g_{m} v_{1}+\frac{v_{o}}{R_{2}}+v_{o} C_{2} s+\left(v_{o}-v_{1}\right) C s=0 \tag{9.26}
\end{gather*}
$$

From (9.25) and (9.26)

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{o}}{i_{s}}=\frac{\left(g_{m}-C s\right) R_{2} R_{1}}{1+s\left[\left(C_{2}+C\right) R_{2}+\left(C_{1}+C\right) R_{1}+g_{m} R_{2} R_{1} C\right]+s^{2} R_{2} R_{1}\left(C_{2} C_{1}+C C_{2}+C C_{1}\right)} \tag{9.27}
\end{equation*}
$$

The circuit transfer function has a positive real zero at

$$
\begin{equation*}
z=\frac{g_{m}}{C} \tag{9.27a}
\end{equation*}
$$

which usually has such a large magnitude in bipolar circuits that it can be neglected. This is often not the case in MOS circuits because of their lower $g_{m}$. This point is taken up later.

The circuit has a two-pole transfer function. If $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$ are the poles of the circuit, then the denominator of (9.27) can be written

$$
\begin{align*}
D(s) & =\left(1-\frac{s}{p_{1}}\right)\left(1-\frac{s}{p_{2}}\right)  \tag{9.28}\\
& =1-s\left(\frac{1}{p_{1}}+\frac{1}{p_{2}}\right)+\frac{s^{2}}{p_{1} p_{2}} \tag{9.29}
\end{align*}
$$

and thus

$$
\begin{equation*}
D(s) \simeq 1-\frac{s}{p_{1}}+\frac{s^{2}}{p_{1} p_{2}} \tag{9.30}
\end{equation*}
$$

if the poles are real and widely separated, which is usually true. Note that $p_{1}$ is assumed to be the dominant pole.

If the coefficients in (9.27) and (9.30) are equated then

$$
\begin{equation*}
p_{1}=-\frac{1}{\left(C_{2}+C\right) R_{2}+\left(C_{1}+C\right) R_{1}+g_{m} R_{2} R_{1} C} \tag{9.31}
\end{equation*}
$$

and this can be approximated by

$$
\begin{equation*}
p_{1} \simeq-\frac{1}{g_{m} R_{2} R_{1} C} \tag{9.32}
\end{equation*}
$$

since the Miller effect due to $C$ will be dominant if $C$ is large and $g_{m} R_{1}, g_{m} R_{2} \gg 1$. Equation 9.31 is the same result for the dominant pole as is obtained using zero-value time constant analysis.

The nondominant pole $p_{2}$ can now be estimated by equating coefficients of $s^{2}$ in (9.27) and (9.30) and using (9.32).

$$
\begin{equation*}
p_{2} \simeq-\frac{g_{m} C}{C_{2} C_{1}+C\left(C_{2}+C_{1}\right)} \tag{9.33}
\end{equation*}
$$

Equation 9.32 indicates that the dominant-pole magnitude $\left|p_{1}\right|$ decreases as $C$ increases, whereas (9.33) shows that $\left|p_{2}\right|$ increases as $C$ increases. Thus, increasing $C$ causes the poles to split apart. The dominant pole moves to a lower frequency because increasing $C$ increases the time constant associated with the output node of the first stage in Fig. 9.18. The reason the nondominant pole moves to a higher frequency is explained below.

Equation 9.33 can be interpreted physically by associating $p_{2}$ with the output node in Fig. 9.18. Then

$$
\begin{equation*}
p_{2}=-\frac{1}{R_{o} C_{T}} \tag{9.33a}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $R_{o}$ is the output resistance including negative feedback around the second stage through $C$, and $C_{T}$ is the total capacitance from the output node to ground. The output resistance is

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{o}=\frac{R_{2}}{1+T} \tag{9.33b}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $R_{2}$ is the open-loop output resistance, and $T$ is the loop gain around the second stage through capacitor $C$, which is the open-loop gain, $g_{m} R_{2}$, times the feedback factor, $f$. Therefore,

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{o}=\frac{R_{2}}{1+g_{m} R_{2} f} \simeq \frac{1}{g_{m} f} \tag{9.33c}
\end{equation*}
$$

assuming that $T=g_{m} R_{2} f \gg 1$. Since $p_{2}$ is a high frequency, we will find $f$ at high frequency $\omega$, where $1 / \omega C_{1} \ll R_{1}$. Then the feedback around the second stage is controlled by a capacitive voltage divider and

$$
\begin{equation*}
f \simeq \frac{C}{C+C_{1}} \tag{9.33d}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus,

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{o} \simeq \frac{C+C_{1}}{g_{m} C} \tag{9.33e}
\end{equation*}
$$

The total capacitance from the output node to ground is $C_{2}$ in parallel with the series combination of $C$ and $C_{1}$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
C_{T}=C_{2}+\frac{C C_{1}}{C+C_{1}}=\frac{C C_{2}+C_{1} C_{2}+C C_{1}}{C+C_{1}} \tag{9.33f}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substituting (9.33e) and (9.33f) into (9.33a) gives (9.33).
Equations 9.33 d and 9.33 f show that increasing $C$ increases the feedback factor but has little effect on the total capacitance in shunt with the output node because $C$ is in series with $C_{1}$. As a result, increasing $C$ reduces the output resistance and increases the frequency of the nondominant pole. In the limit as $C \rightarrow \infty$, the feedback factor approaches unity, and $p_{2} \rightarrow-g_{m} /\left(C_{2}+C_{1}\right)$. In practice, however, (9.33d) shows that the feedback factor is less than unity, which limits the increase in the magnitude of the nondominant pole frequency.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_c6361d8e0343487b8e82g-042.jpg?height=317&width=1069&top_left_y=209&top_left_x=387)

Figure 9.19 Locus of the poles of the circuit of Fig. 9.18 as $C$ is increased from zero, for the case $-1 /\left(R_{1} C_{1}\right)>-1 /\left(R_{2} C_{2}\right)$.

On the other hand, with $C=0$, the poles of the circuit of Fig. 9.18 are

$$
\begin{align*}
& p_{1}=-\frac{1}{R_{1} C_{1}}  \tag{9.34a}\\
& p_{2}=-\frac{1}{R_{2} C_{2}} \tag{9.34b}
\end{align*}
$$

Thus as $C$ increases from zero, the locus of the poles of the circuit of Fig. 9.18 is as shown in Fig. 9.19.

Another explanation of pole splitting is as follows. The circuit in Fig. 9.18 has two poles. The compensation capacitor across the second stage provides feedback and causes the second stage to act like an integrator. The two poles split apart as $C$ increases. One pole moves to a low frequency (toward dc), and the other moves to a high frequency (toward $-\infty$ ) to approximate an ideal integrator, which has only one pole at dc.

The previous calculations have shown how compensation of an amplifier by addition of a large Miller capacitance to a single transistor stage causes the nondominant pole to move to a much higher frequency. For the sake of comparison, consider compensating the circuit in Fig. 9.18 without adding capacitance to $C$ by making $C_{1}$ large enough to produce a dominant pole. Then the pole can be calculated from (9.31) as $p_{1} \simeq-1 / R_{1} C_{1}$. The nondominant pole can be estimated by equating coefficients of $s^{2}$ in (9.27) and (9.30) and using this value of $p_{1}$. This gives $p_{2} \simeq-1 / R_{2}\left(C_{2}+C\right)$. This value of $p_{2}$ is approximately the same as that given by (9.34b), which is for $C=0$ and is before pole splitting occurs. Thus, creation of a dominant pole in the circuit of Fig. 9.18 by making $C_{1}$ large will result in a second pole magnitude $\left|p_{2}\right|$ that is much smaller than that obtained if the dominant pole is created by increasing $C$. As a consequence, the realizable bandwidth of the circuit when compensated in this way is much smaller than that obtained with Miller-effect compensation. Also, without using the Miller effect, the required compensation capacitor often would be too large to be included on a monolithic chip. The same general conclusions are true in the more complex situation that exists in many practical op amps.

The results derived in this section are useful in further illuminating the considerations of Section 7.3.3. In that section, it was stated that in a common-source cascade, the existence of drain-gate capacitance tends to cause pole splitting and to produce a dominant-pole situation. If the equivalent circuit of Fig. 9.18 is taken as a representative section of a cascade of commonsource stages ( $C_{2}$ is the input capacitance of the following stage) and capacitor $C$ is taken as $C_{g d}$, the calculations of this section show that the presence of $C_{g d}$ does, in fact, tend to produce a dominant-pole situation because of the pole splitting that occurs. Thus, the zero-value time constant approach gives a good estimate of $\omega_{-3 \mathrm{~dB}}$ in such circuits.

The theory of compensation that was developed in this chapter was illustrated with some bipolar-transistor circuit examples. The theory applies in general to any active circuit, but the unique device parameters of MOSFETs cause some of the approximations that were made in
the preceding analyses to become invalid. The special aspects of MOS amplifier compensation are now considered.

### 9.4.3 Two-Stage MOS Amplifier Compensation

The basic two-stage CMOS op amp topology shown in Fig. 6.16 is essentially identical to its bipolar counterpart. As a consequence, the equivalent circuit of Fig. 9.18 can be used to represent the second stage with its compensation capacitance. The poles of the circuit are again given by (9.32) and (9.33) and the zero by (9.27a). In the case of the MOS transistor, however, the value of $g_{m}$ is typically an order of magnitude lower than for a bipolar transistor, and the break frequency caused by the right half-plane zero in (9.27) may actually fall below the nominal unity-gain frequency of the amplifier. The effect of this is shown in Fig. 9.20. At the frequency $|z|$ the gain characteristic of the amplifier flattens out because of the contribution to the gain of +6 dB /octave from the zero. In the same region the phase is made $90^{\circ}$ more negative by the positive real zero. As a consequence, the amplifier will have negative phase margin and be unstable when the influence of the next most dominant pole is felt. In effect, the zero halts the gain roll-off intended to stabilize the amplifier and simultaneously pushes the phase in the negative direction. Note also from (9.33) that the low $g_{m}$ of the MOSFET will tend to reduce the value of $\left|p_{2}\right|$ relative to a bipolar amplifier.

Another way to view this problem is to note from Fig. 9.18 that at high frequencies, feedforward through $C$ tends to overwhelm the normal gain path via $g_{m}$ of the second stage
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_c6361d8e0343487b8e82g-043.jpg?height=1094&width=994&top_left_y=1142&top_left_x=410)

Figure 9.20 Typical gain and phase of the CMOS op amp of Fig. 6.16.
if $g_{m}$ is small. The feedforward path does not have the $180^{\circ}$ phase shift of the normal gain stage, and thus the gain path loses an inverting stage. Any feedback applied around the overall amplifier will then be positive instead of negative feedback, resulting in oscillation. At very high frequencies, $C$ acts like a short circuit, diode-connecting the second stage, which then simply presents a resistive load of $1 / g_{m}$ to the first stage, again showing the loss of $180^{\circ}$ of phase shift.

The right half-plane (RHP) zero is caused by the interaction of current from the $g_{m}$ generator and the frequency-dependent current that flows forward from the input node to the output node through $C$. The current through $C$ in Fig. 9.18 is

$$
\begin{equation*}
i_{c}=s C\left(v_{o}-v_{1}\right) \tag{9.35}
\end{equation*}
$$

This current can be broken into two parts: a feedback current $i_{f b}=s C v_{o}$ that flows from the output back toward the input and a feedforward current $i_{f f}=s C v_{1}$ that flows forward from the input toward the output. This feedforward current is related to $v_{1}$. The current $g_{m} v_{1}$ from the controlled source flows out of the output node and is also related to $v_{1}$. Subtracting these two currents gives the total current at the output node that is related to $v_{1}$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
i_{v_{1}}=\left(g_{m}-s C\right) v_{1} \tag{9.36}
\end{equation*}
$$

A zero exists in the transfer function where this current equals zero, at $z=g_{m} / C$.
Three techniques have been used to eliminate the effect of the RHP zero. One approach is to put a source follower in series with the compensation capacitor, ${ }^{9}$ as shown in Fig. 9.21a. The source follower blocks feedforward current through $C$ from reaching the output node and therefore eliminates the zero. This will be shown by analyzing Fig. 9.18 with $C$ replaced by the model in Fig. 9.21b. Here the source follower is modeled as an ideal voltage buffer. Equation 9.25 still holds because the same elements are connected to the input node and the voltage across $C$ remains $v_{o}-v_{1}$. However, summing currents at the output node gives a different equation than (9.26) because no current flows through $C$ to the output node due to the buffer. The new equation is

$$
\begin{equation*}
g_{m} v_{1}+\frac{v_{o}}{R_{2}}+s C_{2} v_{o}=0 \tag{9.37}
\end{equation*}
$$

Combining this equation with (9.25) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{o}}{i_{s}}=\frac{g_{m} R_{1} R_{2}}{1+s\left[R_{1}\left(C_{1}+C\right)+R_{2} C_{2}+g_{m} R_{2} R_{1} C\right]+s^{2} R_{1} R_{2} C_{2}\left(C_{1}+C\right)} \tag{9.38}
\end{equation*}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_c6361d8e0343487b8e82g-044.jpg?height=438&width=1205&top_left_y=1764&top_left_x=324)

Figure 9.21 (a) Compensation capacitor $C$ in Fig. 9.18 is replaced by $C$ in series with a source follower. (b) A simple model for the capacitor and source follower.

The zero has been eliminated. Assuming $g_{m} R_{1}, g_{m} R_{2} \gg 1$ and $C$ is large, the same steps that led from (9.27) to (9.32) and (9.33) give

$$
\begin{align*}
& p_{1} \approx-\frac{1}{g_{m} R_{2} R_{1} C}  \tag{9.39a}\\
& p_{2} \approx-\frac{g_{m} C}{\left(C_{1}+C\right) C_{2}} \approx-\frac{g_{m}}{C_{2}} \tag{9.39b}
\end{align*}
$$

The dominant pole $p_{1}$ is unchanged, and $p_{2}$ is about the same as before if $C_{2} \gg C_{1}$. This approach eliminates the zero, but the follower requires extra devices and bias current. Also, the source follower has a nonzero dc voltage between its input and output. This voltage will affect the output voltage swing since the source-follower transistor must remain in the active region to maintain the desired feedback through $C$.

A second approach to eliminate the RHP zero is to block the feedforward current through $C$ using a common-gate transistor, ${ }^{10}$ as illustrated in Fig. 9.22a. This figure shows a two-stage op amp , with the addition of two current sources of value $I_{2}$ and transistor $M_{11}$. The compensation capacitor is connected from the op-amp output to the source of $M_{11}$. Here, common-gate $M_{11}$ allows capacitor current to flow from the output back toward the input of the second stage. However, the impedance looking into the drain of $M_{11}$ is very large. Therefore, feedforward current through $C$ is very small. If the feedforward current is zero, the RHP zero is eliminated. A simplified small-signal model for the common-gate stage and compensation capacitor is shown in Fig. 9.22b. Here common-gate $M_{11}$ is modeled as an ideal current buffer. Replacing $C$ in Fig. 9.18 with the model in Fig. $9.22 b$ yields

$$
\begin{gather*}
-i_{s}=\frac{v_{1}}{R_{1}}+v_{1} C_{1} s-v_{o} C s  \tag{9.40a}\\
g_{m} v_{1}+\frac{v_{o}}{R_{2}}+v_{o} C s+v_{o} C_{2} s=0 \tag{9.40b}
\end{gather*}
$$

Combining these equations gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{o}}{i_{s}}=\frac{g_{m} R_{1} R_{2}}{1+s\left[R_{1} C_{1}+R_{2}\left(C+C_{2}\right)+g_{m} R_{1} R_{2} C\right]+s^{2} R_{1} R_{2} C_{1}\left(C_{2}+C\right)} \tag{9.41}
\end{equation*}
$$

The zero has been eliminated. Again assuming $g_{m} R_{1}, g_{m} R_{2} \gg 1$ and $C$ is large, the poles are

$$
\begin{align*}
& p_{1} \approx-\frac{1}{g_{m} R_{2} R_{1} C}  \tag{9.42a}\\
& p_{2} \approx-\frac{g_{m}}{C+C_{2}} \cdot \frac{C}{C_{1}} \tag{9.42b}
\end{align*}
$$

The dominant pole is the same as before. However, the nondominant pole $p_{2}$ is different. This $p_{2}$ is at a higher frequency than in the two previous approaches because $C \gg C_{1}$ when $C$ and $C_{2}$ are comparable. (In this section, we assume that the two-stage MOS op amp in Fig. 9.18 drives a load capacitor $C_{2}$ that is much larger than parasitic capacitance $C_{1}$; therefore $C_{2} \gg C_{1}$.) Therefore, a smaller compensation capacitor $C$ can be used here for a given load capacitance $C_{2}$, when compared to the previous approaches. The increase in $\left|p_{2}\right|$ arises because the input node is not connected to, and therefore is not loaded by, the compensation capacitor. An advantage of this scheme is that it provides better high-frequency negative-power-supply rejection than Miller compensation. (Power-supply rejection was introduced in Section 6.3.6.) With Miller compensation, $C$ is connected from the gate to drain of $M_{6}$, and it shorts the gate and drain at high frequencies. Assuming $V_{g s 6}$ is approximately constant, high-frequency variations on the negative supply are coupled directly to the op-amp output. Connecting $C$ to common-gate $M_{11}$ eliminates this coupling path. Drawbacks of this approach are that extra devices and dc current are needed to implement the scheme in Fig. 9.22a. Also, if there is a mismatch between the $I_{2}$ current sources, the difference current must flow in the input stage, which disrupts the balance in the input stage and affects the input-offset voltage of the op amp.

When the first stage of the op amp uses a cascode transistor, the compensation capacitor can be connected to the source of the cascode device as shown in Fig. 9.23. ${ }^{11}$ This connection reduces the feedforward current through $C$, when compared to connecting $C$ to node $(8)$, if the
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_c6361d8e0343487b8e82g-046.jpg?height=759&width=1002&top_left_y=1454&top_left_x=428)

voltage swing at the source of the cascode device is smaller than the swing at its drain. This approach eliminates the feedforward path, and therefore the zero, if the voltage swing at the source of the cascode device is zero. An advantage of this approach is that it avoids the extra devices, bias current, and mismatch problems in Fig. 9.22a.

A third way to deal with the RHP zero is to insert a resistor in series with the compensation capacitor, as shown in Fig. 9.24a. ${ }^{12,13}$ Rather than eliminate the feedforward current, the resistor modifies this current and allows the zero to be moved to infinity. If the zero moves to infinity, the total forward current at the output node that is related to $v_{1}$ must go to zero when $\omega \rightarrow \infty$. When $\omega \rightarrow \infty$, capacitor $C$ is a short circuit and therefore the feedforward current is only due to $R_{Z}$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
i_{f f}(\omega \rightarrow \infty)=-\frac{v_{1}}{R_{Z}} \tag{9.43}
\end{equation*}
$$

When this current is added to the current from the $g_{m}$ source, the total current at the output node that is related to $v_{1}$ is

$$
\begin{equation*}
i_{v_{1}}=\left(g_{m}-\frac{1}{R_{Z}}\right) v_{1} \tag{9.44}
\end{equation*}
$$

when $\omega \rightarrow \infty$. If $R_{Z}=1 / g_{m}$, this term vanishes, and the zero is at infinity.
The complete transfer function can be found by carrying out an analysis similar to that performed for Fig. 9.18, which gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{o}}{i_{s}}=\frac{g_{m} R_{1} R_{2}\left[1-s C\left(\frac{1}{g_{m}}-R_{Z}\right)\right]}{1+b s+c s^{2}+d s^{3}} \tag{9.45}
\end{equation*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{align*}
& b=R_{2}\left(C_{2}+C\right)+R_{1}\left(C_{1}+C\right)+R_{Z} C+g_{m} R_{1} R_{2} C  \tag{9.46a}\\
& c=R_{1} R_{2}\left(C_{1} C_{2}+C C_{1}+C C_{2}\right)+R_{Z} C\left(R_{1} C_{1}+R_{2} C_{2}\right)  \tag{9.46b}\\
& d=R_{1} R_{2} R_{Z} C_{1} C_{2} C \tag{9.46c}
\end{align*}
$$

Again assuming $g_{m} R_{1}, g_{m} R_{2} \gg 1$ and $C$ is large, the poles can be approximated by

$$
\begin{align*}
& p_{1} \approx-\frac{1}{g_{m} R_{2} R_{1} C}  \tag{9.47a}\\
& p_{2} \approx-\frac{g_{m} C}{C_{1} C_{2}+C\left(C_{1}+C_{2}\right)} \approx-\frac{g_{m}}{C_{1}+C_{2}}  \tag{9.47b}\\
& p_{3} \approx-\frac{1}{R_{Z} C_{1}} \tag{9.47c}
\end{align*}
$$

The first two poles, $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$, are the same as for the original circuit in Fig. 9.18. The third pole is at a very high frequency with $\left|p_{3}\right| \gg\left|p_{2}\right|$ because typically $C_{1} \ll C_{2}$ (since $C_{1}$ is a small parasitic capacitor and $C_{2}$ is the load capacitor) and $R_{Z}$ will be about equal to $1 / g_{m}$ if the zero is moved to a high frequency [from (9.44)]. This circuit has three poles because there are three independent capacitors. In contrast, Fig. 9.18 has three capacitors that form a loop, so only two of the capacitor voltages are independent. Thus there are only two poles associated with that circuit.

The zero of (9.45) is

$$
\begin{equation*}
z=\frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{g_{m}}-R_{Z}\right) C} \tag{9.48}
\end{equation*}
$$

This zero moves to infinity when $R_{Z}$ equals $1 / g_{m}$. Making the resistor greater than $1 / g_{m}$ moves the zero into the left half-plane, which can be used to provide positive phase shift at high frequencies and improve the phase margin of a feedback circuit that uses this op amp. ${ }^{13}$ The movement of the zero for increasing $R_{Z}$ is shown in Fig. 9.24b.

Figure 9.25 shows a Miller-compensated op amp using a resistor $R_{Z}$ in series with the compensation capacitor. In practice, resistor $R_{Z}$ is usually implemented using a MOS transistor
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_c6361d8e0343487b8e82g-048.jpg?height=677&width=1177&top_left_y=1561&top_left_x=333)

biased in the triode region. From (1.152), a MOS transistor operating in the triode region behaves like a linear resistor if $V_{d s} \ll 2\left(V_{G S}-V_{t}\right)$. The on-resistance $R_{Z}$ of the triode device can be made to track $1 / g_{m}$ of common-source transistor $M_{6}$ if the two transistors are identical and have the same $V_{G S}-V_{t}$. When this MOS transistor is placed to the left of the compensation capacitor as shown in Fig. 9.25 , its source voltage is set by $V_{g s 6}$, which is approximately constant. Therefore, $V_{G S}$ of the triode transistor can be set by connecting its gate to a dc bias voltage, which can be generated using replica biasing. ${ }^{13}$ (See Problem 9.23.)

Another way to shift the zero location that can be used in multistage op amps will be presented in Section 9.4.5.

In all the compensation approaches described so far, the dominant pole is set by compensation capacitor $C$ and is independent of the load capacitor $C_{2}$. However, the second pole is a function of $C_{2}$. If the op amp will be used in different applications with a range of load capacitors, the compensation capacitor should be selected to give an acceptable phase margin for the largest $C_{2}$. Then the phase margin will increase as the load capacitor decreases because $\left|p_{2}\right|$ is inversely proportional to $C_{2}$.

#### EXAMPLE

Compensate the two-stage CMOS op amp from the example in Section 6.3.5 (Fig. 6.16) to achieve a phase margin of $45^{\circ}$ or larger when driving a load capacitance of 5 pF , assuming the op amp is connected in unity-gain feedback.

With the op amp in unity-gain feedback, $f=1$ and the loop gain $T=a f=a$ (or, equivalently, $A_{\infty}=1$ and the return ratio $\mathscr{R}=a$ ). Therefore, the phase and gain margins can be determined from Bode plots of $|a|$ and $\mathrm{ph}(a)$.

The two-stage op amp and a simplified model for this op amp are shown in Fig. 9.25. In the model, all capacitances that connect to node $\otimes$ are lumped into $C_{1}$, and all capacitances that connect to the output node are lumped into $C_{2}$. If we apply an input voltage $v_{i}$ in Fig. 9.26, a current $i_{1}=g_{m 1} v_{i}$ is generated. This $i_{1}$ drives a circuit that is the same as the circuit that $i_{s}$ drives in Fig. 9.18. Therefore, the equations for the two poles and one zero for the circuit in Fig. 9.18 apply here with $i_{s}=g_{m 1} v_{i}, g_{m}=g_{m 6}, R_{1}=r_{o 2} \| r_{o 4}$, and $R_{2}=r_{o 6} \| r_{o 7}$.

We will use Miller compensation with a series resistance to eliminate the zero. To achieve a $45^{\circ}$ phase margin, the compensation capacitor $C$ should be chosen so that $\left|p_{2}\right|$ equals the unity-gain frequency (assuming the zero has been eliminated and $\left|p_{3}\right| \gg\left|p_{2}\right|$ ). Since the gain roll-off from $\left|p_{1}\right|$ to $\left|p_{2}\right|$ is $-6 \mathrm{~dB} /$ octave, $|a(j \omega)| \cdot \omega$ is constant from $\left|p_{1}\right|$ to $\left|p_{2}\right|$. Therefore,

$$
\begin{equation*}
a_{o} \cdot\left|p_{1}\right|=1 \cdot\left|p_{2}\right| \tag{9.49}
\end{equation*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{equation*}
a_{o}=g_{m 1}\left(r_{o 2} \| r_{o 4}\right) g_{m 6}\left(r_{o 6} \| r_{o 7}\right)=g_{m 1} R_{1} g_{m 6} R_{2} \tag{9.50}
\end{equation*}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_c6361d8e0343487b8e82g-049.jpg?height=357&width=1295&top_left_y=1895&top_left_x=267)

Figure 9.26 A small-signal model for the op amp in Fig. 9.25.
is the dc gain of the op amp. Substitution of (9.47) and (9.50) into (9.49) gives

$$
g_{m 1} R_{1} g_{m 6} R_{2} \cdot \frac{1}{g_{m 6} R_{2} R_{1} C}=1 \cdot \frac{g_{m 6}}{C_{1}+C_{2}}
$$

or

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{g_{m 1}}{C}=\frac{g_{m 6}}{C_{1}+C_{2}} \tag{9.51}
\end{equation*}
$$

The capacitance $C_{2}$ at the output is dominated by the $5-\mathrm{pF}$ load capacitance, and the internal parasitic capacitance $C_{1}$ is much smaller than 5 pF (SPICE simulation gives $C_{1} \approx 120 \mathrm{fF}$ ). Therefore $C_{1}+C_{2} \approx 5 \mathrm{pF}$. From the example in Section 6.3.5, we find

$$
g_{m 1}=k_{p}^{\prime}(W / L)_{1}\left|V_{o v 1}\right|=\left(64.7 \mu \mathrm{~A} / \mathrm{V}^{2}\right)(77)(0.2 \mathrm{~V})=1 \mathrm{~mA} / \mathrm{V}
$$

and

$$
g_{m 6}=k_{n}^{\prime}(W / L)_{6}\left(V_{o v 6}\right)=\left(194 \mu \mathrm{~A} / \mathrm{V}^{2}\right)(16)(0.5 \mathrm{~V})=1.55 \mathrm{~mA} / \mathrm{V}
$$

Substituting these values into (9.51) and rearranging gives

$$
C=\frac{g_{m 1}}{g_{m 6}}\left(C_{1}+C_{2}\right) \approx \frac{1 \mathrm{~mA} / \mathrm{V}}{1.55 \mathrm{~mA} / \mathrm{V}}(5 \mathrm{pF})=3.2 \mathrm{pF}
$$

To eliminate the zero due to feedforward through $C$, a resistor $R_{Z}$ of value $1 / g_{m 6}=645 \Omega$ can be connected in series with the compensation capacitor $C$. (In practice, this resistance should be implemented with an NMOS transistor that is a copy of $M_{6}$ biased in the triode region, so that $R_{Z}=1 / g_{m 6}$. See Problem 9.23.)

SPICE simulations (using models based on Table 2.4) of the op amp before and after compensation give the magnitude and phase plots shown in Fig. 9.27. Before compensation, the amplifier is unstable and has a phase margin of $-6^{\circ}$. After compensation with $R_{Z}=645 \Omega$ and $C=3.2 \mathrm{pF}$ the phase margin improves to $41^{\circ}$ with a unity-gain frequency of 35 MHz , and the gain margin is 15 dB . This phase margin is less than the desired $45^{\circ}$. The simulated value of $g_{m 6}$ is $1.32 \mathrm{~mA} / \mathrm{V}$ and differs somewhat from the calculated $g_{m 6}$, because the formulas used to calculate $g_{m}$ are based on square-law equations that are only approximately correct. Changing $R_{Z}$ to $1 / g_{m 6}($ SPICE $)=758 \Omega$ gives a phase margin of $46^{\circ}$ with a unity-gain frequency of 35 MHz , and the gain margin is 22 dB . Without $R_{Z}$, the phase margin is $14^{\circ}$, so eliminating the right-half-plane zero significantly improves the phase margin.

Two earlier assumptions can be checked from SPICE simulations. First, $C_{1} \approx 120 \mathrm{fF}$ from SPICE and $C_{2} \approx 5 \mathrm{pF}$; therefore, the assumption that $C_{1} \ll C_{2}$ is valid. Also, $\left|p_{3}\right| \gg\left|p_{2}\right|$ follows from $\left|p_{3}\right| \approx 1 /\left(R_{Z} C_{1}\right)=g_{m 6} / C_{1},\left|p_{2}\right| \approx g_{m 6} / C_{2}$, and $C_{1} \ll C_{2}$.

### 9.4.4 Compensation of Single-Stage CMOS Op Amps

Single-stage op amps, such as the telescopic cascode or folded cascode, have only one gain stage; therefore Miller compensation is not possible. These op amps have high open-loop output resistance and are typically used in switched-capacitor circuits, where the load is purely capacitive. Therefore, the dominant pole is associated with the output node, and the load capacitor provides the compensation.

A simplified, fully differential, telescopic-cascode op amp is shown in Fig. 9.28a. The simplifications here are that ideal current sources replace biasing transistors and all capacitances have been lumped into the load capacitors $C_{L}$ and the parasitic capacitors $C_{p}$ at the cascode nodes. The differential-mode (DM) voltage gain can be found by analyzing the half-circuit shown in Fig. 9.28b. Since there are two independent capacitors, the DM gain has two poles.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_c6361d8e0343487b8e82g-051.jpg?height=1295&width=884&top_left_y=198&top_left_x=269)
(b)

Figure 9.27 Plots of the simulated (a) magnitude and (b) phase of the op-amp gain before and after compensation ( $C=3.2 \mathrm{pF}, R_{Z}=645 \Omega$ ) for the op amp in Fig. 9.25.

An exact analysis, ignoring body effect, gives a DM gain of

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{o d}}{v_{i d}}=-\frac{g_{m 1} r_{o 1}\left(g_{m 1 A} r_{o 1 A}+1\right)}{1+s\left(r_{o 1 A} C_{L}+r_{o 1} C_{p}+r_{o 1} C_{L}+g_{m 1 A} r_{o 1 A} r_{o 1} C_{L}\right)+s^{2} r_{o 1} r_{o 1 A} C_{p} C_{L}} \tag{9.52}
\end{equation*}
$$

If $g_{m} r_{o} \gg 1,(9.52)$ simplifies to

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{o d}}{v_{i d}}=-\frac{g_{m 1} r_{o 1} g_{m 1 A} r_{o 1 A}}{1+s g_{m 1 A} r_{o 1 A} r_{o 1} C_{L}+s^{2} r_{o 1} r_{o 1 A} C_{p} C_{L}} \tag{9.53}
\end{equation*}
$$

The gain has two poles and no zeros. Assuming widely spaced real poles, the poles can be approximated using (9.29) and (9.30):

$$
\begin{align*}
& p_{1} \approx-\frac{1}{g_{m 1 A} r_{o 1 A} r_{o 1} C_{L}} \approx-\frac{1}{R_{o} C_{L}}  \tag{9.54a}\\
& p_{2} \approx-\frac{g_{m 1 A}}{C_{p}} \tag{9.54b}
\end{align*}
$$

where $R_{o}$ is the output resistance of the DM half-circuit and $R_{o} \approx g_{m 1 A} r_{o 1 A} r_{o 1}$. Alternatively, these poles can be estimated using time-constant analysis as shown in Chapter 7. The dominant pole is set by the zero-value time constant for $C_{L}$, which is computed with $C_{p}$ open and equals $R_{O} C_{L}$. The nondominant pole can be approximated using the short-circuit time constant for $C_{p}$, which is computed with $C_{L}$ shorted. When $C_{L}$ is shorted, the resistance seen by $C_{p}$ is the resistance looking into the source of $M_{1 A}$, which is $1 / g_{m 1 A}$ (ignoring body effect). Typically, $\left|p_{1}\right| \ll\left|p_{2}\right|$ because $R_{o} \gg 1 / g_{m 1 A}$ and $C_{L} \gg C_{p}$. If the phase margin is not large enough for a given feedback application, additional capacitance can be added at the output node to increase $C_{L}$, which decreases $\left|p_{1}\right|$ without affecting $p_{2}$ and therefore increases the phase margin.

Capacitance $C_{p}$ consists of $C_{g s 1 A}$ plus smaller capacitances such as $C_{d b 1}$ and $C_{s b 1 A}$. Assuming $C_{p} \approx C_{g s 1 A}$, then $\left|p_{2}\right| \approx g_{m 1 A} / C_{p} \approx g_{m 1 A} / C_{g s 1 A} \approx \omega_{T}$ of $M_{1 A}$. Thus, the frequency at which the magnitude of the op-amp gain equals one, which is called the unity-gain bandwidth, can be very high with this op amp.

A simplified, fully differential, folded-cascode op amp is shown in Fig. 9.29a. As above, the simplifications are that ideal current sources replace biasing transistors and all capacitances have been lumped into the load capacitors $C_{L}$ and the parasitic capacitors $C_{p}^{\prime}$ at the cascode nodes. With these simplifications, the DM voltage gain can be found by analyzing the halfcircuit shown in Fig. 9.29b. This circuit is identical to Fig. 9.28b except that the cascode device is $p$-channel rather than $n$-channel and $C_{p}^{\prime}$ replaces $C_{p}$. Therefore, the gain is identical to (9.52)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_c6361d8e0343487b8e82g-053.jpg?height=1138&width=1259&top_left_y=176&top_left_x=253)
with $C_{p}$ replaced by $C_{p}^{\prime}$. Hence the dominant pole has the same form as (9.54a)

$$
\begin{equation*}
p_{1} \approx-\frac{1}{g_{m 1 A} r_{o 1 A} r_{o 1} C_{L}} \approx-\frac{1}{R_{o} C_{L}} \tag{9.55a}
\end{equation*}
$$

The second pole is associated with $C_{p}^{\prime}$ and is approximately given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
p_{2} \approx-\frac{g_{m 1 A}}{C_{p}^{\prime}} \tag{9.55b}
\end{equation*}
$$

Equations 9.55 b and 9.54 b look similar, but $\left|p_{2}\right|$ for the folded-cascode op amp will usually be smaller than $\left|p_{2}\right|$ for the telescopic-cascode op amp. The reason is that, while the transconductances of the cascode devices in the two circuits are often comparable, $C_{p}^{\prime}$ will be significantly larger than $C_{p}$. One cause of the higher capacitance is that more devices are connected to the node associated with $C_{p}^{\prime}$ in the folded-cascode op amp than are connected to the node associated with $C_{p}$ in the telescopic cascode. (Recall that the output of each ideal current source in Fig. 9.29a is the drain of a transistor.) Also, $W / L$ of the $p$-channel cascode transistor $M_{1 A}$ in Fig. $9.29 b$ must be larger than $W / L$ of the $n$-channel cascode device in Fig. $9.28 b$ to make their transconductances comparable. The larger $W / L$ will cause $C_{p}^{\prime}$ to be larger than $C_{p}$. The smaller $\left|p_{2}\right|$ for the folded cascode leads to a smaller unity-gain bandwidth, if the two op amps are compensated to give the same phase margin in a given feedback application.

The circuits in Figs. 9.28 and 9.29 are fully differential. These op amps can be converted to single-ended op amps by replacing a pair of matched current sources with a current mirror. In Fig. 9.28a, the two $I$ current sources would be replaced with a $p$-channel current mirror. In

Fig. $9.29 a$, the two $I_{2}$ current sources would be replaced with a $n$-channel current mirror. As shown in Section 7.3.5, a current mirror introduces a closely spaced pole-zero pair, in addition to the poles $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$ in (9.54) and (9.55).

Active cascodes can be used to increase the low-frequency gain of an op amp, as shown in Fig. 6.30a. There are four active cascodes in Fig. 6.30a; each consists of a cascode transistor $\left(M_{1 A}-M_{4 A}\right)$ and an auxiliary amplifier $\left(A_{1}\right.$ or $\left.A_{2}\right)$ in a feedback loop. When such an op amp is placed in feedback, multiple feedback loops are present. There are four local feedback loops associated with the active cascodes in the op amp and one global feedback loop that consists of the op amp and a feedback network around the op amp. All these feedback loops must be stable to avoid oscillation. The stability of each local feedback loop can be determined from its loop gain or return ratio. Since the auxiliary amplifiers in these loops are op amps, each auxiliary amplifier can be compensated using the techniques described in this chapter to ensure stability of these local loops. Then the global feedback loop can be compensated to guarantee its stability.

### 9.4.5 Nested Miller Compensation

Many feedback circuits require an op amp with a high voltage gain. While cascoding is commonly used to increase the gain in op amps with a total supply voltage of 5 V or more, cascoding becomes increasingly difficult as the power-supply voltage is reduced. (See Chapter 4.) To overcome this problem, simple gain stages without cascoding can be cascaded to achieve high gain. When three or more voltage-gain stages must be cascaded to achieve the desired gain, the op amp will have three or more poles, and frequency compensation becomes complicated. Nested Miller compensation can be used with more than two gain stages. ${ }^{14,15}$ This compensation scheme involves repeated, nested application of Miller compensation. An example of nested Miller compensation applied to three cascaded gain stages is shown in Fig. $9.30 a$. Two noninverting gain stages are followed by an inverting gain stage. Each voltage-gain stage is assumed to have a high-output resistance and therefore is labeled as a $g_{m}$ block. The sign of the dc voltage gain of each stage is given by the sign of the transconductance. Two Miller compensation capacitors are used: $C_{m 1}$, which is placed around the last gain stage, and $C_{m 2}$, which is connected across the last two gain stages. Because the dc gain of the second stage is positive and the dc gain of the third stage is negative, both capacitors are in negative feedback loops.

A simplified circuit schematic is shown in Fig. 9.30b. Each noninverting gain stage is composed of a differential pair with a current-source load. The inverting gain stage consists of a common-source amplifier with a current-source load. A simplified small-signal model is shown in Fig. 9.30c. The main simplification here is that all capacitances associated with the gain stages are modeled by $C_{0}, C_{1}$, and $C_{2}$.

Without the compensation capacitors, this amplifier has three real poles that are not widely spaced if the $R_{i} C_{i}$ time constants are comparable. When $C_{m 1}$ is added, the two poles associated with the output nodes of the second and third stages split apart along the real axis due to the Miller compensation, but the pole associated with output of the first stage does not change. From a design standpoint, the goal of this pole splitting is to cause one pole to dominate the frequency response of the second and third stages together. Assume at first that this goal is met. Then adding $C_{m 2}$ across the second and third stages is similar to adding $C_{m 1}$ across the third stage. Pole splitting occurs again, and the pole associated with the output node of the first stage becomes dominant because the Miller-multiplied $C_{m 2}$ loads this node. Meanwhile, the pole associated with the output of the second stage moves to higher frequency because of negative feedback through $C_{m 2}$. The polarity of this feedback does not become positive at any frequency where the gain around the loop is at least unity because the frequency response of of the second and third stages is dominated by one pole.

In practice, the exact movement of the poles is complicated by the nondominant pole in the feedback loop though $C_{m 2}$. Also, zeros are introduced by feedforward through $C_{m 1}$ and $C_{m 2}$. The pole and zero locations can be found from an exact analysis of the small-signal circuit. The analysis can be carried out by summing currents at the outputs of the $g_{m}$ generators, then manipulating the resulting three equations. These steps are not conceptually difficult but are not shown here. The exact transfer function from the output of the current generator in the input stage, $i_{s}=g_{m 0} v_{\mathrm{in}}$, to the output voltage $v_{o}$ is

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{v_{o}}{i_{s}} & =-\frac{N(s)}{D(s)}  \tag{9.56}\\
& =-\frac{R_{0} g_{m 1} R_{1} g_{m 2} R_{2}-\left(g_{m 1} R_{1} C_{m 1}+C_{m 2}\right) R_{0} R_{2} s-R_{0} R_{1} R_{2} C_{m 2}\left(C_{1}+C_{m 1}\right) s^{2}}{1+a_{1} s+a_{2} s^{2}+a_{3} s^{3}}
\end{align*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{align*}
a_{1}= & K+R_{0}\left(C_{m 2}+C_{0}\right)+g_{m 1} R_{1} g_{m 2} R_{2} R_{0} C_{m 2}  \tag{9.57a}\\
a_{2}= & R_{1} R_{2}\left(C_{2}+C_{m 1}+C_{m 2}\right)\left(C_{1}+C_{m 1}\right)-R_{1} R_{2} C_{m 1}^{2}+R_{0}\left(C_{m 2}+C_{0}\right) K \\
& -g_{m 1} R_{1} C_{m 1} C_{m 2} R_{0} R_{2}-R_{0} R_{2} C_{m 2}^{2}  \tag{9.57b}\\
a_{3}= & R_{0} R_{1} R_{2}\left[\left(C_{2} C_{m 2}+C_{0} C_{2}+C_{0} C_{m 2}\right)\left(C_{1}+C_{m 1}\right)+C_{1} C_{m 1} C_{m 2}\right. \\
& \left.+C_{0} C_{1} C_{m 1}\right] \tag{9.57c}
\end{align*}
$$

with

$$
\begin{equation*}
K=R_{2}\left(C_{2}+C_{m 1}+C_{m 2}\right)+R_{1}\left(C_{1}+C_{m 1}\right)+R_{1} C_{m 1} g_{m 2} R_{2} \tag{9.57d}
\end{equation*}
$$

Equation 9.56 is the transfer function from $i_{s}$ to $v_{o}$. The transfer function of the voltage gain from $v_{\text {in }}$ to $v_{o}$ is found by multiplying (9.56) by $g_{m 0}$ (since $i_{s}=g_{m 0} v_{\text {in }}$ ); therefore, the voltage gain and (9.56) have the same poles and zeros. The transfer function in (9.56) has two zeros and three poles. Let us first examine the poles. The expressions for the $a_{i}$ coefficients are complicated and involve many terms. Therefore assumptions are needed to simplify the equations. If $g_{m 1} R_{1} g_{m 2} R_{2} \gg 1$, which is usually true, then

$$
\begin{equation*}
a_{1} \approx g_{m 1} R_{1} g_{m 2} R_{2} R_{0} C_{m 2} \tag{9.58}
\end{equation*}
$$

Assuming there is a dominant pole $p_{1}$, then

$$
\begin{equation*}
p_{1} \approx-\frac{1}{a_{1}}=-\frac{1}{g_{m 1} R_{1} g_{m 2} R_{2} R_{0} C_{m 2}} \tag{9.59}
\end{equation*}
$$

Another way to arrive at this estimate of $p_{1}$ is to apply the Miller effect to $C_{m 2}$. The effective Miller capacitor is about $C_{m 2}$ times the negative of the gain across $C_{m 2}$, which is $g_{m 1} R_{1} g_{m 2} R_{2}$. This capacitor appears in parallel with $R_{0}$, giving a time constant of $\left(g_{m 1} R_{1} g_{m 2} R_{2}\right) R_{0} C_{m 2}$.

The other poles $p_{2}$ and $p_{3}$ could be found by factoring the third-order denominator in (9.56), which can be done using a computer but is difficult by hand. However, these poles can be estimated from a quadratic equation under certain conditions. If there is a dominant pole $p_{1}$, then $\left|p_{2}\right|,\left|p_{3}\right| \gg\left|p_{1}\right|$. At high frequencies, where $|s| \gg\left|p_{1}\right| \approx 1 / a_{1}$, we have $\left|a_{1} s\right| \gg 1$, so the denominator in (9.56) can be approximated by dropping the constant " 1 " to give

$$
\begin{equation*}
D(s) \approx a_{1} s+a_{2} s^{2}+a_{3} s^{3}=a_{1} s\left(1+\frac{a_{2}}{a_{1}} s+\frac{a_{3}}{a_{1}} s^{2}\right) \tag{9.60}
\end{equation*}
$$

This equation gives three poles. One pole is at dc, which models the effect of the dominant pole $p_{1}$ for frequencies well above $\left|p_{1}\right|$. Poles $p_{2}$ and $p_{3}$ are the other roots of (9.60). They can be found by concentrating on the quadratic term in parenthesis in (9.60), which is

$$
\begin{equation*}
D^{\prime}(s)=\frac{D(s)}{a_{1} s} \approx 1+\frac{a_{2}}{a_{1}} s+\frac{a_{3}}{a_{1}} s^{2} \approx\left(1-\frac{s}{p_{2}}\right)\left(1-\frac{s}{p_{3}}\right) \tag{9.61}
\end{equation*}
$$

Assuming that $R_{0}, R_{1}, R_{2} \gg\left|1 /\left(g_{m 2}-g_{m 1}\right)\right|$ and $C_{o}$ is small compared to the other capacitors, (9.57b) and ( 9.57 c ) simplify to

$$
\begin{align*}
& a_{2} \approx R_{0} R_{1} R_{2}\left(g_{m 2}-g_{m 1}\right) C_{m 1} C_{m 2}  \tag{9.62}\\
& a_{3} \approx R_{0} R_{1} R_{2}\left(C_{1} C_{2} C_{m 2}+C_{2} C_{m 1} C_{m 2}+C_{1} C_{m 1} C_{m 2}\right) \tag{9.63}
\end{align*}
$$

Using (9.58), (9.62), and (9.63), the coefficients in $D^{\prime}(s)$ are

$$
\begin{align*}
& \frac{a_{2}}{a_{1}} \approx \frac{g_{m 2}-g_{m 1}}{g_{m 1} g_{m 2}} C_{m 1}  \tag{9.64}\\
& \frac{a_{3}}{a_{1}} \approx \frac{C_{1} C_{2}+C_{m 1} C_{1}+C_{2} C_{m 1}}{g_{m 1} g_{m 2}} \tag{9.65}
\end{align*}
$$

To ensure that the high-frequency poles are in the left half-plane (LHP), $a_{2} / a_{1}$ must be positive (see Appendix A9.2). Therefore, $g_{m 2}$ must be larger than $g_{m 1}$. Poles $p_{2}$ and $p_{3}$ can be real or complex, and in general the quadratic formula must be used to solve for these poles. However, if these poles are real and widely spaced and if $C_{m 1} \gg C_{1}, C_{2}$, then approximate expressions can be found. If $\left|p_{2}\right| \ll\left|p_{3}\right|$, then $-1 / p_{2}$ is approximately equal to the coefficient of $s$ in $D^{\prime}(s)$, so

$$
\begin{equation*}
p_{2} \approx-\frac{a_{1}}{a_{2}}=-\frac{g_{m 1} g_{m 2}}{\left(g_{m 2}-g_{m 1}\right) C_{m 1}} \tag{9.66a}
\end{equation*}
$$

Also $1 /\left(p_{2} p_{3}\right)$ is equal to the coefficient of $s^{2}$ in $D^{\prime}(s)$, so

$$
\begin{align*}
p_{3} \approx \frac{a_{1}}{a_{3}} \frac{1}{p_{2}} & =-\frac{g_{m 1} g_{m 2}}{C_{1} C_{2}+C_{m 1} C_{1}+C_{2} C_{m 1}} \cdot \frac{\left(g_{m 2}-g_{m 1}\right) C_{m 1}}{g_{m 1} g_{m 2}}  \tag{9.66b}\\
& =-\frac{\left(g_{m 2}-g_{m 1}\right) C_{m 1}}{C_{1} C_{2}+C_{m 1}\left(C_{1}+C_{2}\right)} \approx-\frac{g_{m 2}-g_{m 1}}{C_{1}+C_{2}}
\end{align*}
$$

The final approximation here follows if $C_{m 1}$ is large. Equations 9.66 a and 9.66 b are accurate if $\left|p_{2}\right| \ll\left|p_{3}\right|$. Substituting (9.66a) and (9.66b) into this inequality produces an equivalent condition

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|p_{2}\right| \approx \frac{g_{m 1} g_{m 2}}{\left(g_{m 2}-g_{m 1}\right) C_{m 1}} \ll \frac{\left(g_{m 2}-g_{m 1}\right) C_{m 1}}{C_{1} C_{2}+C_{m 1}\left(C_{1}+C_{2}\right)} \approx\left|p_{3}\right| \tag{9.67}
\end{equation*}
$$

If this condition is not satisfied, $p_{2}$ and $p_{3}$ are either complex conjugates or real but closely spaced. $C_{m 1}$ can always be chosen large enough to satisfy the inequality in (9.67). While it is possible to make the high-frequency poles real and widely separated, higher unity-gain bandwidth may be achievable when $p_{2}$ and $p_{3}$ are not real and widely separated. ${ }^{16}$

In the simplified equations 9.66 a and 9.66 b , poles $p_{2}$ and $p_{3}$ are dependent on $C_{m 1}$ but not on $C_{m 2}$. In contrast, dominant pole $p_{1}$ is inversely proportional to $C_{m 2}$ and is independent of $C_{m 1}$. The poles can be positioned to approximate a two-pole op amp by making $\left|p_{1}\right| \ll$ $\left|p_{2}\right| \ll\left|p_{3}\right|$ and positioning $\left|p_{3}\right|$ well beyond the unity-gain frequency of the op amp.

The zero locations can be found by factoring the second-order numerator $N(s)$ in (9.56). The coefficients of $s$ and $s^{2}$ in the numerator are negative and the constant term is positive. As a result, the zeros are real. One is positive and the other is negative, as is shown in Appendix A9.2.

The zeros will be found using some simplifying assumptions. First, the numerator of (9.56) can be rewritten as

$$
\begin{equation*}
N(s)=R_{0} g_{m 1} R_{1} g_{m 2} R_{2}\left[1-s\left(\frac{C_{m 1}}{g_{m 2}}+\frac{C_{m 2}}{g_{m 1} R_{1} g_{m 2}}\right)-s^{2} \frac{C_{m 2}\left(C_{1}+C_{m 1}\right)}{g_{m 1} g_{m 2}}\right] \tag{9.68}
\end{equation*}
$$

Assuming that $C_{m 1} \gg C_{1}$ and $C_{m 1} \gg C_{m 2} /\left(g_{m 1} R_{1}\right)$, then

$$
\begin{equation*}
N(s) \approx R_{0} g_{m 1} R_{1} g_{m 2} R_{2}\left[1-s \frac{C_{m 1}}{g_{m 2}}-s^{2} \frac{C_{m 2} C_{m 1}}{g_{m 1} g_{m 2}}\right] \tag{9.69}
\end{equation*}
$$

The zeros are the roots of $N(s)=0$. Using the quadratic formula and (9.69), the zeros are

$$
\begin{equation*}
z_{1,2}=-\frac{g_{m 1}}{2 C_{m 2}} \pm \sqrt{\left(\frac{g_{m 1}}{2 C_{m 2}}\right)^{2}+\frac{g_{m 1} g_{m 2}}{C_{m 1} C_{m 2}}}=-\frac{g_{m 1}}{2 C_{m 2}}\left(1 \pm \sqrt{1+\frac{4 g_{m 2} C_{m 2}}{g_{m 1} C_{m 1}}}\right) \tag{9.70}
\end{equation*}
$$

Taking the positive square root in the right-most formula in (9.70) yields a value that is larger than one. Adding this value to 1 gives a positive value for the term in parentheses; subtracting this value from 1 gives a negative quantity with a smaller magnitude than the sum. Therefore, one zero is in the LHP and has a magnitude greater than $g_{m 1} /\left(2 C_{m 2}\right)$. The other zero is in the RHP and has a smaller magnitude than the LHP zero. As a result, the effect of the RHP zero is felt at a lower frequency than the LHP zero.

The magnitude of one or both zeros can be comparable to $\left|p_{2}\right|$. Because the RHP zero is at a lower frequency than the LHP zero, the RHP zero can cause significant negative phase shift for frequencies at or below $\left|p_{2}\right|$, which would degrade the phase margin of a feedback loop. This undesired negative phase shift would not occur if the transfer function did not have zeros. Unfortunately, the three techniques considered in Section 9.4.3 to eliminate a RHP zero have important limitations in a low-supply application. First, the zeros could be eliminated by adding a source-follower buffer between the op-amp output and the right-hand side of capacitors $C_{m 1}$ and $C_{m 2}$ (as in Fig. 9.21), thereby eliminating the feedforward paths through the capacitors. However, the source follower has a nonzero dc voltage between its input and output. This voltage may limit the op-amp output swing to an unacceptably low value in a low-power-supply application. Second, cascode stages could be used to eliminate the zeros, as shown in Fig. 9.23. However, the requirement that all transistors in the cascode stage operate in the active region may limit the minimum supply voltage. Finally, a series zero-canceling resistance (as in Fig. 9.24a) implemented with a transistor may require a large gate voltage that exceeds the power supply.

The NE5234 op amp uses nested Miller-effect compensation. Figure 9.31 repeats the simplified ac schematic of the high-frequency gain path of the NE5234 shown in Fig. 7.36. Here, the common-mode input voltage is assumed to be low enough that $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ in Fig. 6.36 are off. Also, the dc load current is assumed to be $I_{L}=1 \mathrm{~mA}$ as in the calculations in Chapter 6. Therefore, $Q_{75}$ in Fig. 6.39 conducts a nearly constant current and is omitted in Fig. 9.31 along with the circuits that control it for simplicity. In practice, these transistors are important under other bias conditions. Also, note that the transconductance of the output stage depends on the bias point assumed. The key point here is that this op amp uses three nested compensation loops: through $C_{22}, C_{25}$, and $C_{65}$. The loop through $C_{25}$ includes series resistor $R_{25}=1.3 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ to reduce the effects of the zero introduced through $C_{25}$ and increase the phase margin. ${ }^{17}$ This structure has one more level of nesting than shown in Fig. 9.30. The extra level is introduced through $C_{65}$ in the third stage, and its purpose is explained next.

Chapter 6 pointed out that the output transistors $Q_{74}$ and $Q_{75}$ in Fig. 6.39 are driven by emitter followers to increase the current gain of the output stage and reduce its load on the second stage. Because the integrated-circuit process is optimized to build much higher quality $n p n$ transistors than pnp transistors, $\beta_{p n p}<\beta_{n p n}$ in practice. To provide adequate current gain when $Q_{74}$ controls the output as shown in Fig. 9.31, two emitter followers $Q_{64} Q_{65}$ drive $Q_{74}$. In contrast, Fig. 6.39 shows that only one emitter follower $Q_{68}$ is used to drive $Q_{75}$. Furthermore, $Q_{64}$ and $Q_{65}$ use opposite polarity transistors to avoid introducing a large dc level shift that would increase the minimum required power-supply voltage.

Figure 9.31 An ac schematic of the high-frequency gain path of the NE5234 op amp assuming that the common-mode input voltage is low enough that $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ in Fig. 6.36 are off and assuming that $Q_{75}$ in Fig. 6.39 conducts a constant current and can be ignored along with the elements that drive it.

Ideally, these emitter followers give unity gain and do not limit the frequency response of the third stage. In practice, however, they introduce extra poles that contribute unwanted phase shift at high frequency that reduces the phase margin when the op amp is connected in a feedback loop. This problem is especially severe in driving $Q_{74}$ because two emitter followers are used instead of one and because the output transistor and one of the emitter followers are $p n p$ transistors, which have much lower $f_{T}$ than $n p n$ transistors operating at the same bias currents. If Miller compensation were not applied through $C_{65}$, the presence of the extra poles in the output stage due to the emitter followers would introduce extra undesired phase shift near the unity-gain frequency of the op amp and significantly reduce the phase margin. To overcome this problem, the extra level of Miller-effect compensation through $C_{65}$ is introduced. It forces one pole to be dominant in the output stage when feedback is applied through $C_{25}$. The minimum required value of $C_{65}$ must be able to cope with all possible bias currents in the output stage. From a stability standpoint, the worst case is when the bias current and transconductance of $Q_{74}$ are maximum because the op-amp bandwidth is increased in this case, which increases the importance of poles introduced by the emitter followers. In practice, $C_{65}$ is chosen from simulations to be $10 \mathrm{pF} .{ }^{17}$ The corresponding capacitor on the npn side of the output stage is $C_{68}$ in Fig. 6.39, and this capacitor is only 1 pF . In practice, $C_{68} \ll C_{65}$ because the $n p n$ side uses only one emitter follower and because the transistors on this side are both npn transistors.

Figure 9.32 Gain and phase versus frequency for the NE5234 op amp from SPICE.

The presence of an extra level of Miller compensation reduces the bandwidth of the output stage to make one pole dominant. Although it allows a simple compensation scheme for the op amp, it also limits the high-frequency performance of the op amp with compensation.

As shown in Chapter 7, the frequency response of the NE5234 is dominated by the Miller multiplied $C_{22}$. With unity-gain feedback as in Fig. 6.3c, the resulting gain and phase plots for the NE5234 are shown in Fig. 9.32. These plots were generated using SPICE with transistor parameters as shown in Fig. 2.32 except $\beta_{F}=40$ and $V_{A}=30 \mathrm{~V}$ for $n p n$ transistors and $\beta_{F}=10$ and $V_{A}=20 \mathrm{~V}$ for pnp transistors. The bias conditions are the same as assumed in Chapter 6. The resulting unity-gain frequency is 2.7 MHz , and the phase margin is 43 degrees. Return ratio simulations give the same results.

Fig. 9.33a shows another technique for eliminating a RHP zero that can be used with cascaded stages in a low-supply application. ${ }^{16,18}$ Two gain stages and one Miller compensation capacitor are shown. A transconductance stage, $g_{m f}$, is included. It provides a feedforward path that can be used to move the zero to infinity. The small-signal circuit is shown in Fig. 9.33b. To allow a simple explanation of this circuit, initially assume that $C_{1}=C_{2}=0$. The circuit has one pole due to $C_{m}$ and one zero due to the feedforward current through $C_{m}$. If the zero moves to infinity, the total forward current must go to zero when $\omega \rightarrow \infty$. Also, if the zero moves to
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_c6361d8e0343487b8e82g-061.jpg?height=896&width=1074&top_left_y=199&top_left_x=375)

Figure 9.33 (a) Block diagram of a two-stage op amp with Miller compensation and a feedforward transconductor. (b) A small-signal model.
infinity, the output voltage will go to zero as $\omega \rightarrow \infty$ due to the pole in the transfer function. When $\omega \rightarrow \infty$, capacitor $C_{m}$ becomes a short circuit, so $v_{2}=0$ when $\omega \rightarrow \infty$. Therefore at infinite frequency, the current $g_{m 1} v_{1}$ from the $g_{m 1}$ source flows through $C_{m}$. Adding this feedforward current to the current $g_{m f} v_{1}$ from the $g_{m f}$ generator gives the total current at the output node that is related to $v_{1}$

$$
\begin{equation*}
i_{f f}(\omega \rightarrow \infty)=\left(-g_{m 1}+g_{m f}\right) v_{1} \tag{9.71}
\end{equation*}
$$

If $g_{m f}=g_{m 1}$, this current equals zero, which means the zero is at infinity.
An exact analysis of the circuit in Fig. 9.33 gives a transfer function

$$
\begin{align*}
& \frac{v_{o}}{v_{1}}=  \tag{9.72}\\
& \frac{-g_{m 1} R_{1} g_{m 2} R_{2}-g_{m f} R_{2}-s R_{1} R_{2}\left[g_{m f}\left(C_{1}+C_{m}\right)-g_{m 1} C_{m}\right]}{1+s\left[g_{m 2} R_{1} R_{2} C_{m}+R_{2}\left(C_{2}+C_{m}\right)+R_{1}\left(C_{1}+C_{m}\right)\right]+s^{2} R_{1} R_{2}\left(C_{1} C_{2}+C_{1} C_{m}+C_{2} C_{m}\right)}
\end{align*}
$$

The zero can be moved to infinity by choosing $g_{m f}$ so that the coefficient of $s$ in the numerator is zero, which occurs when

$$
\begin{equation*}
g_{m f}=g_{m 1} \frac{C_{m}}{C_{1}+C_{m}}=\frac{g_{m 1}}{1+\frac{C_{1}}{C_{m}}} \tag{9.73}
\end{equation*}
$$

This value of $g_{m f}$ depends on the ratio of an internal parasitic capacitance $C_{1}$, which is not well controlled, and compensation capacitor $C_{m}$. Using $g_{m f}=g_{m 1}$ moves the zero into the LHP to about $-g_{m 2} / C_{1}$; the magnitude of this zero is usually above the unity-gain frequency of the op amp. If the $g_{m 1}$ stage has a differential input, the $-g_{m f}$ stage can be realized using a replica of the $g_{m 1}$ stage with the inputs reversed to change the sign of the transconductance.

This zero-cancellation scheme can be used repeatedly in a three-stage op amp to eliminate the zeros, as shown in Fig. 9.34a. A small-signal model is shown in Fig. 9.34b. Analysis of

n_{2}= & \left(g_{m 0}-g_{m f 0}\right) R_{0} R_{1}\left(C_{1}+C_{m 1}\right) C_{m 2}-g_{m f 0} R_{0} R_{1}\left(C_{1}+C_{m 1}\right) C_{0} \tag{9.76c}
\end{align*}
$$

The coefficients of $s$ and $s^{2}$ in the numerator include both positive and negative terms. Therefore, they can be set to zero, which eliminates the zeros, by properly choosing $g_{m f 0}$ and $g_{m f}$. As
in (9.73) above, these values depend on parasitic capacitances $C_{0}$ and $C_{1}$, which are not well controlled in practice. An alternative choice is to set $g_{m f 0}=g_{m 0}$ and $g_{m f 1}=g_{m 1}$. When these values are substituted into (9.76a)-(9.76c), $n_{0}, n_{1}$, and $n_{2}$ are negative. Therefore, both zeros are in the LHP (see Appendix A9.2), and the RHP zero has been eliminated.

With $g_{m f 1}=g_{m 1}$ and $g_{m f 0}=g_{m 0}$, the term added to $a_{1}$ in (9.75a) is small compared to the dominant term in $a_{1}$, which is $g_{m 1} R_{1} g_{m 2} R_{2} R_{0} C_{m 2}$, if $g_{m 2} R_{1} \gg 1$. Therefore $b_{1} \approx a_{1}$, and the dominant pole $p_{1}$ is still given by (9.59). However, $b_{2}$ can be significantly different from $a_{2}$, and therefore $p_{2}$ and $p_{3}$ will be different from the values given by ( 9.66 a ) and ( 9.66 b ). The new values of the high frequency poles can be found by solving the quadratic equation that results when $b_{1}-b_{3}$ are substituted for $a_{1}-a_{3}$ in (9.60).

The selection of the nested Miller compensation capacitors is complicated because the values of two compensation capacitors must be chosen, and they affect the pole and zero locations. The compensation capacitors can be chosen with the aid of a computer to achieve a particular settling-time or phase-margin goal in a feedback application. Computer optimization can be carried out on the closed-loop transfer function based on the op-amp transfer function or on the loop gain or return ratio, if the small-signal model parameters are known. Alternatively, the capacitor values can be estimated using approximations and the equations presented above. Then SPICE simulations can be run on the transistor circuit starting with the initial estimates of the compensation capacitors and varying the capacitors by small amounts to determine the best values. This approach is used in the following example.

#### EXAMPLE

Design the 3-stage op amp in Fig. 9.34 to give a low-frequency gain of 86 dB and $45^{\circ}$ phase margin for unity feedback $(f=1)$ when driving a 5 pF load. Compensate the op amp so that all the poles are real and widely spaced. To simplify this example, assume that the output resistance of each stage is $5 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ and the internal node capacitances $C_{0}$ and $C_{1}$ are each 0.05 pF . Determine the compensation capacitors and the transconductances for the op amp.

The feedforward transconductances $g_{m f 0}$ and $g_{m f 1}$ will be used to move the zeros to well beyond the unity-gain frequency. To simplify the design equations, let $g_{m f 0}=g_{m 0}$ and $g_{m f 1}=g_{m 1}$, based on (9.73)-(9.76) and the assumption that $C_{0}$ and $C_{1}$ are small compared to $C_{m 1}$ and $C_{m 2}$.

When $g_{m f 0}=g_{m f 1}=0$, the coefficients $a_{i}$ of the denominator of the transfer function are given by ( 9.57 ). With nonzero $g_{m f 0}$ and $g_{m f 1}$, however, the coefficients of $s$ and $s^{2}$ in the denominator of the transfer function change and are given by (9.75). From ( 9.75 c$), b_{3}=a_{3}$. Also, as noted in the text following (9.76), the term added to $a_{1}$ in (9.75a) is small compared to $a_{1}$, so $b_{1} \approx a_{1}$ and $p_{1}$ is given by (9.59). Hence, poles $p_{2}$ and $p_{3}$ are changed due to the added term that includes $g_{m f 1}$ in $b_{2}$ in (9.75b). Assuming $C_{1} \ll C_{m 1},(9.75 b)$ reduces to

$$
b_{2} \approx a_{2}+g_{m f 1} R_{0} R_{1} R_{2} C_{m 1} C_{m 2}
$$

Substituting the approximate expression for $a_{2}$ in (9.62) and using $g_{m f 1}=g_{m 1}$, this equation becomes

$$
b_{2} \approx g_{m 2} R_{0} R_{1} R_{2} C_{m 1} C_{m 2}
$$

Following the analysis from (9.60) to (9.67), we find

$$
\begin{align*}
& p_{2} \approx-\frac{b_{1}}{b_{2}} \approx-\frac{g_{m 1}}{C_{m 1}}  \tag{9.77a}\\
& p_{3} \approx \frac{b_{1}}{b_{3}} \frac{1}{p_{2}} \approx-\frac{g_{m 2}}{C_{2}} \tag{9.77b}
\end{align*}
$$

To satisfy $\left|p_{2}\right| \ll\left|p_{3}\right|$, let $\left|p_{3}\right|=10\left|p_{2}\right|$. Substituting (9.77) in this equality and rearranging yields

$$
\begin{equation*}
C_{m 1}=10 \frac{g_{m 1}}{g_{m 2}} C_{2} \tag{9.78}
\end{equation*}
$$

To ensure that $C_{m 1}$ is not much larger than $C_{2}=5 \mathrm{pF}$ we need $g_{m 1} / g_{m 2} \ll 1$ in (9.78). Here, we chose $g_{m 1} / g_{m 2}=0.2$. Substituting this value into (9.78) gives

$$
C_{m 1}=10(0.2)(5 \mathrm{pF})=10 \mathrm{pF}
$$

With widely spaced poles, placing $\left|p_{2}\right|$ at the unity-gain frequency gives a $45^{\circ}$ phase margin. Since $\mid$ gain $\mid \times$ frequency is constant for frequencies between $\left|p_{1}\right|$ and $\left|p_{2}\right|$, we can write

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|a_{0}\right| \cdot\left|p_{1}\right|=1 \cdot\left|p_{2}\right| \tag{9.79}
\end{equation*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|a_{0}\right|=g_{m 0} R_{0} g_{m 1} R_{1} g_{m 2} R_{2} \tag{9.80}
\end{equation*}
$$

is the low-frequency gain. Substitution of (9.59), (9.77a), and (9.80) into (9.79) gives

$$
\frac{g_{m 0}}{C_{m 2}}=\frac{g_{m 1}}{C_{m 1}}
$$

If the first two gain stages are made identical to reduce the circuit-design effort, $g_{m 0}=g_{m 1}$, and the last equation reduces to

$$
C_{m 2}=C_{m 1}=10 \mathrm{pF}
$$

Now the transconductances can be found from the low-frequency gain requirement and (9.80),

$$
\left|a_{0}\right|=g_{m 0} R_{0} g_{m 1} R_{1} g_{m 2} R_{2}=\frac{g_{m 1}^{3}}{0.2}(5 \mathrm{k} \Omega)^{3}=20,000=86 \mathrm{~dB}
$$

since $g_{m 0}=g_{m 1}=0.2 g_{m 2}$ has been selected. Solving gives $g_{m 1}=g_{m 0}=g_{m f 1}=g_{m f 0}=$ $3.2 \mathrm{~mA} / \mathrm{V}$ and $g_{m 2}=g_{m 1} / 0.2=16 \mathrm{~mA} / \mathrm{V}$.

SPICE simulation of this op amp gives a dc gain of 86.3 dB and a phase margin of 52 degrees with a unity-gain frequency of 40 MHz . These values are close enough to the specifications to illustrate the usefulness of the calculations. The pole locations are $\left|p_{1}\right| / 2 \pi=$ $2.3 \mathrm{kHz},\left|p_{2}\right| / 2 \pi=59 \mathrm{MHz}$, and $\left|p_{3}\right| / 2 \pi=464 \mathrm{MHz}$. The zero locations are complex with a magnitude much larger than the unity-gain frequency, at $z_{1,2} / 2 \pi=-345 \mathrm{MHz} \pm j 1.58 \mathrm{GHz}$. Running simulations with slight changes to the compensation capacitors, we find that using $C_{m 1}=10.4 \mathrm{pF}$ and $C_{m 2}=8.3 \mathrm{pF}$ gives a phase margin of 47 degrees with a unity-gain frequency of 45 MHz .

## 9.5 Root-Locus Techniques ${ }^{1,19}$

To this point the considerations of this chapter have been mainly concerned with calculations of feedback amplifier stability and compensation using frequency-domain techniques. Such techniques are widely used because they allow the design of feedback amplifier compensation without requiring excessive design effort. The root-locus technique involves calculation of the actual poles and zeros of the amplifier and of their movement in the $s$ plane as the lowfrequency, loop-gain magnitude $T_{0}$ is changed. This method thus gives more information about the amplifier performance than is given by frequency-domain techniques, but also requires
more computational effort. In practice, some problems can be solved equally well using either method, whereas others yield more easily to one or the other. The circuit designer needs skill in applying both methods. The root-locus technique will be first illustrated with a simple example.

### 9.5.1 Root Locus for a Three-Pole Transfer Function

Consider an amplifier whose transfer function has three identical poles. The transfer function can be written as

$$
\begin{equation*}
a(s)=\frac{a_{0}}{\left(1-\frac{s}{p_{1}}\right)^{3}} \tag{9.81}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $a_{0}$ is the low-frequency gain and $\left|p_{1}\right|$ is the pole magnitude. Consider this amplifier placed in a negative-feedback loop as in Fig. 9.1, where the feedback network has a transfer function $f$, which is a constant. If we assume that the effects of feedback loading are small, the overall gain with feedback is

$$
\begin{equation*}
A(s)=\frac{a(s)}{1+a(s) f} \tag{9.82}
\end{equation*}
$$

Using (9.81) in (9.82) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
A(s)=\frac{\frac{a_{0}}{\left(1-\frac{s}{p_{1}}\right)^{3}}}{1+\frac{a_{0} f}{\left(1-\frac{s}{p_{1}}\right)^{3}}}=\frac{a_{0}}{\left(1-\frac{s}{p_{1}}\right)^{3}+T_{0}} \tag{9.83}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $T_{0}=a_{0} f$ is the low-frequency loop gain.
The poles of $A(s)$ are the roots of the equation

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left(1-\frac{s}{p_{1}}\right)^{3}+T_{0}=0 \tag{9.84}
\end{equation*}
$$

That is

$$
\left(1-\frac{s}{p_{1}}\right)^{3}=-T_{0}
$$

and thus

$$
1-\frac{s}{p_{1}}=\sqrt[3]{-T_{0}}=-\sqrt[3]{T_{0}} \quad \text { or } \quad \sqrt[3]{T_{0}} e^{j 60^{\circ}} \quad \text { or } \quad \sqrt[3]{T_{0}} e^{-j 60^{\circ}}
$$

Thus the three roots of (9.84) are

$$
\begin{align*}
& s_{1}=p_{1}\left(1+\sqrt[3]{T_{0}}\right) \\
& s_{2}=p_{1}\left(1-\sqrt[3]{T_{0}} e^{j 60^{\circ}}\right)  \tag{9.85}\\
& s_{3}=p_{1}\left(1-\sqrt[3]{T_{0}} e^{-j 60^{\circ}}\right)
\end{align*}
$$

These three roots are the poles of $A(s)$ and (9.83) can be written as

$$
\begin{equation*}
A(s)=\frac{a_{0}}{1+T_{0}} \frac{1}{\left(1-\frac{s}{s_{1}}\right)\left(1-\frac{s}{s_{2}}\right)\left(1-\frac{s}{s_{3}}\right)} \tag{9.86}
\end{equation*}
$$

Figure 9.35 Root locus for a feedback amplifier with three identical poles in $T(s)$.

The equations in (9.85) allow calculation of the poles of $A(s)$ for any value of low-frequency loop gain $T_{0}$. For $T_{0}=0$, all three poles are at $p_{1}$ as expected. As $T_{0}$ increases, one pole moves out along the negative real axis while the other two leave the axis at an angle of $60^{\circ}$ and move toward the right half-plane. The locus of the roots (or the root locus) is shown in Fig. 9.35, and each point of this root locus can be identified with the corresponding value of $T_{0}$. One point of significance on the root locus is the value of $T_{0}$ at which the two complex poles cross into the right half-plane, as this is the value of loop gain causing oscillation. From the equation for $s_{2}$ in (9.85), this is where $\operatorname{Re}\left(s_{2}\right)=0$, from which we obtain

$$
1-\operatorname{Re}\left(\sqrt[3]{T_{0}} e^{j 60^{\circ}}\right)=0
$$

That is,

$$
\sqrt[3]{T_{0}} \cos 60^{\circ}=1
$$

and

$$
T_{0}=8
$$

Thus, any amplifier with three identical poles becomes unstable for low-frequency loop gain $T_{0}$ greater than 8 . This is quite a restrictive condition and emphasizes the need for compensation if larger values of $T_{0}$ are required. Note that not only does the root-locus technique give the value of $T_{0}$ causing instability, it also allows calculation of the amplifier poles for values of $T_{0}<8$, and thus allows calculation of both sinusoidal and transient response of the amplifier.

The frequency of oscillation can be found from Fig. 9.35 by calculating the distance

$$
\begin{equation*}
\omega_{0}=\left|p_{1}\right| \tan 60^{\circ}=1.732\left|p_{1}\right| \tag{9.87}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus, when the poles just enter the right half-plane, their imaginary part has a magnitude $1.732\left|p_{1}\right|$ and this will be the frequency of the increasing sinusoidal response. That is, if the complex poles are at ( $\sigma \pm j \omega_{0}$ ) where $\sigma$ is small and positive, the transient response of the circuit contains a term $K e^{\sigma t} \sin \omega_{0} t$, which represents a growing sinusoid. ( $K$ is set by an initial condition.)

It is useful to calculate the value of $T_{0}$ causing instability in this case by using the frequencydomain approach and the Nyquist criterion. From (9.81) the loop gain is

$$
\begin{equation*}
T(j \omega)=\frac{a_{0} f}{\left(1+\frac{j \omega}{\left|p_{1}\right|}\right)^{3}}=\frac{T_{0}}{\left(1+j \frac{\omega}{\left|p_{1}\right|}\right)^{3}} \tag{9.88}
\end{equation*}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_c6361d8e0343487b8e82g-067.jpg?height=1016&width=998&top_left_y=203&top_left_x=413)

Figure 9.36 Magnitude and phase of $T(j \omega)$ for a feedback amplifier with three identical poles in $T(s)$.
The magnitude and phase of $T(j \omega)$ as a function of $\omega$ are sketched in Fig. 9.36. The frequency $\omega_{180}$ where the phase shift of $T(j \omega)$ is $-180^{\circ}$ can be calculated from (9.88) as

$$
180^{\circ}=3 \arctan \frac{\omega_{180}}{\left|p_{1}\right|}
$$

and this gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\omega_{180}=1.732\left|p_{1}\right| \tag{9.89}
\end{equation*}
$$

Comparing (9.87) with (9.89) shows that

$$
\begin{equation*}
\omega_{180}=\omega_{0} \tag{9.90}
\end{equation*}
$$

The loop-gain magnitude at $\omega_{180}$ can be calculated from (9.88) as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|T\left(j \omega_{180}\right)\right|=\frac{T_{0}}{\left|1+j \frac{\omega_{180}}{\left|p_{1}\right|}\right|^{3}}=\frac{T_{0}}{8} \tag{9.91}
\end{equation*}
$$

using (9.89). The Nyquist criterion for stability indicates it is necessary that $\left|T\left(j \omega_{180}\right)\right|<1$. This requires that $T_{0}<8$, the same result as obtained using root-locus techniques.

### 9.5.2 Rules for Root-Locus Construction

In the above simple example, it was possible to calculate exact expressions for the amplifier poles as a function of $T_{0}$, and thus to plot the root loci exactly. In most practical cases this
is quite difficult since the solution of third- or higher order polynomial equations is required. Consequently, rules have been developed that allow the root loci to be sketched without requiring exact calculation of the pole positions, and much of the useful information is thus obtained without extensive calculation.

In general, the basic-amplifier transfer function and the feedback function may be expressed as a ratio of polynomials in $s$.

$$
\begin{equation*}
a(s)=a_{0} \frac{1+a_{1} s+a_{2} s^{2}+\cdots}{1+b_{1} s+b_{2} s^{2}+\cdots} \tag{9.92}
\end{equation*}
$$

This can be written as

$$
\begin{equation*}
a(s)=a_{0} \frac{N_{a}(s)}{D_{a}(s)} \tag{9.93}
\end{equation*}
$$

Also assume that

$$
\begin{equation*}
f(s)=f_{0} \frac{1+c_{1} s+c_{2} s^{2}+\cdots}{1+d_{1} s+d_{2} s^{2}+\cdots} \tag{9.94}
\end{equation*}
$$

This can be written as

$$
\begin{equation*}
f(s)=f_{0} \frac{N_{f}(s)}{D_{f}(s)} \tag{9.95}
\end{equation*}
$$

Loading produced by the feedback network on the basic amplifier is assumed to be included in (9.92). It is further assumed that the low-frequency loop gain $a_{0} f_{0}$ can be changed without changing the poles and zeros of $a(s)$ or $f(s)$.

The overall gain when feedback is applied is

$$
\begin{equation*}
A(s)=\frac{a(s)}{1+a(s) f(s)} \tag{9.96}
\end{equation*}
$$

Using (9.93) and (9.95) in (9.96) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
A(s)=\frac{a_{0} N_{a}(s) D_{f}(s)}{D_{f}(s) D_{a}(s)+T_{0} N_{a}(s) N_{f}(s)} \tag{9.97}
\end{equation*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{equation*}
T_{0}=a_{0} f_{0} \tag{9.98}
\end{equation*}
$$

is the low-frequency loop gain.
Equation 9.97 shows that the zeros of $A(s)$ are the zeros of $a(s)$ and the poles of $f(s)$. From (9.97) it is apparent that the poles of $A(s)$ are the roots of

$$
\begin{equation*}
D_{f}(s) D_{a}(s)+T_{0} N_{a}(s) N_{f}(s)=0 \tag{9.99}
\end{equation*}
$$

Consider the two extreme cases.
(a) Assume that there is no feedback and that $T_{0}=0$. Then, from (9.99), the poles of $a(s)$ are the poles of $a(s)$ and $f(s)$. However, the poles of $f(s)$ are also zeros of $A(s)$ and these cancel, leaving the poles of $A(s)$ composed of the poles of $a(s)$ as expected. The zeros of $A(s)$ are the zeros of $a(s)$ in this case.
(b) Let $T_{0} \rightarrow \infty$. Then ( 9.99 ) becomes

$$
\begin{equation*}
N_{a}(s) N_{f}(s)=0 \tag{9.100}
\end{equation*}
$$

This equation shows that the poles of $A(s)$ are now the zeros of $a(s)$ and the zeros of $f(s)$. However, the zeros of $a(s)$ are also zeros of $A(s)$ and these cancel, leaving the poles of $A(s)$ composed of the zeros of $f(s)$. The zeros of $A(s)$ are the poles of $f(s)$ in this case.

Rule 1. The branches of the root locus start at the poles of $T(s)=a(s) f(s)$ where $T_{0}=0$, and terminate on the zeros of $T(s)$ where $T_{0}=\infty$. If $T(s)$ has more poles than zeros, some of the branches of the root locus will terminate at infinity.

Examples of loci terminating at infinity are shown in Figs. 9.3 and 9.35. More rules for the construction of root loci can be derived by returning to (9.99) and dividing it by $D_{f}(s) D_{a}(s)$. Poles of $A(s)$ are roots of

$$
1+T_{0} \frac{N_{a}(s)}{D_{a}(s)} \frac{N_{f}(s)}{D_{f}(s)}=0
$$

That is

$$
T_{0} \frac{N_{a}(s)}{D_{a}(s)} \frac{N_{f}(s)}{D_{f}(s)}=-1
$$

The complete expression including poles and zeros is

$$
\begin{equation*}
T_{0} \frac{\left(1-\frac{s}{z_{a 1}}\right)\left(1-\frac{s}{z_{a 2}}\right) \cdots\left(1-\frac{s}{z_{f 1}}\right)\left(1-\frac{s}{z_{f 2}}\right) \cdots}{\left(1-\frac{s}{p_{a 1}}\right)\left(1-\frac{s}{p_{a 2}}\right) \cdots\left(1-\frac{s}{p_{f 1}}\right)\left(1-\frac{s}{p_{f 2}}\right) \cdots}=-1 \tag{9.101}
\end{equation*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{gathered}
z_{a 1}, z_{a 2} \cdots \text { are zeros of } a(s) \\
z_{f 1}, z_{f 2} \cdots \text { are zeros of } f(s) \\
p_{a 1}, p_{a 2} \cdots \text { are poles of } a(s) \\
p_{f 1}, p_{f 2} \cdots \text { are poles of } f(s)
\end{gathered}
$$

Equation 9.101 can be written as

$$
\begin{align*}
& T_{0} \frac{\left(-p_{a 1}\right)\left(-p_{a 2}\right) \cdots\left(-p_{f 1}\right)\left(-p_{f 2}\right) \cdots}{\left(-z_{a 1}\right)\left(-z_{a 2}\right) \cdots\left(-z_{f 1}\right)\left(-z_{f}\right) \cdots} \\
& \times \frac{\left(s-z_{a 1}\right)\left(s-z_{a 2}\right) \cdots\left(s-z_{f 1}\right)\left(s-z_{f 2}\right) \cdots}{\left(s-p_{a 1}\right)\left(s-p_{a 2}\right) \cdots\left(s-p_{f 1}\right)\left(s-p_{f 2}\right) \cdots}=-1 \tag{9.102}
\end{align*}
$$

If the poles and zeros of $a(s)$ and $f(s)$ are restricted to the left half-plane [this does not restrict the poles of $A(s)]$, then $-p_{a 1},-p_{a 2}$, and so on are positive numbers and (9.102) can be written

$$
\begin{equation*}
T_{0} \frac{\left|p_{a 1}\right| \cdot\left|p_{a 2}\right| \cdots\left|p_{f 1}\right| \cdot\left|p_{f 2}\right| \cdots}{\left|z_{a 1}\right| \cdot\left|z_{a 2}\right| \cdots\left|z_{f 1}\right| \cdot\left|z_{f 2}\right| \cdots} \times \frac{\left(s-z_{a 1}\right)\left(s-z_{a 2}\right) \cdots\left(s-z_{f 1}\right)\left(s-z_{f 2}\right) \cdots}{\left(s-p_{a 1}\right)\left(s-p_{a 2}\right) \cdots\left(s-p_{f 1}\right)\left(s-p_{f 2}\right) \cdots}=-1 \tag{9.103}
\end{equation*}
$$

Values of complex variable $s$ satisfying (9.103) are poles of closed-loop function $A(s)$. Equation 9.103 requires the fulfillment of two conditions simultaneously, and these conditions are used to determine points on the root locus.

The phase condition for values of $s$ satisfying (9.103) is

$$
\begin{align*}
& \angle s-z_{a 1}+\angle s-z_{a 2} \cdots+\angle L^{s-z_{f 1}}+\not L^{s-z_{f 2}}+\cdots \\
& \quad-\left(\angle s-p_{a 1}+\angle s-p_{a 2} \cdots+\angle s-p_{f 1}+\not s-p_{f 2} \cdots\right)=(2 n-1) \pi \tag{9.104}
\end{align*}
$$

The magnitude condition for values of $s$ satisfying (9.103) is

\begin{equation*}
T_{0} \frac{\left|p_{a 1}\right| \cdot\left|p_{a 2}\right| \cdots\left|p_{f 1}\right| \cdot\left|p_{f 2}\right| \cdots}{\left|z_{a 1}\right| \cdot\left|z_{a 2}\right| \cdots \cdot\left|z_{f 1}\right| \cdot\left|z_{f 2}\right| \cdots} \frac{\left|s-z_{a 1}\right| \cdot\left|s-z_{a 2}\right| \cdots \cdot\left|s-z_{f 1}\right| \cdot\left|s-z_{f 2}\right| \cdots}{\left|s-p_{a 1}\right| \cdot\left|s-p_{a 2}\right| \cdots \cdot\left|s-p_{f 1}\right| \cdot\left|s-p_{f 2}\right| \cdots}=1 \tag{9.105}
\end{equation*}
$$

Consider an amplifier with poles and zeros of $T(s)$ as shown in Fig. 9.37. In order to determine if some arbitrary point $X$ is on the root locus, the phase condition of (9.104) is used. Note that the vectors of (9.104) are formed by drawing lines from the various poles and zeros of $T(s)$ to the point $X$ and the angles of these vectors are then substituted in (9.104) to check the phase condition. This is readily done for points $Y$ and $Z$ on the axis.

At $Y$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \angle s_{Y}-z_{1}=0^{\circ} \\
& \angle s_{Y}-p_{1}=0^{\circ}
\end{aligned}
$$

and so on. All angles are zero for point $Y$ and thus the phase condition is not satisfied. This is the case for all points to the right of $p_{1}$.

At Z

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \angle s_{Z}-z_{1}=0^{\circ} \\
& \angle s_{Z}-p_{1}=180^{\circ} \\
& \angle s_{Z}-p_{2}=0^{\circ} \\
& \angle s_{Z}-p_{3}=0^{\circ} \\
& \angle s_{Z}-p_{4}=0^{\circ}
\end{aligned}
$$

In this case, the phase condition of (9.104) is satisfied, and points on the axis between $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$ are on the locus. By similar application of the phase condition, the locus can be shown to exist on the real axis between $p_{3}$ and $z_{1}$ and to the left of $p_{4}$.

In general, if $T(s)$ has all its zeros and poles in the LHP, the locus is situated along the real axis where there is an odd number of poles and zeros of $T(s)$ to the right. In some cases, however, all the zeros of $T(s)$ are not in the LHP. For example, an op amp that uses Miller compensation can have a RHP zero in $a(s)$ and therefore in $T(s)$. If $a(s)$ has at least one RHP zero, at least one of the $-z_{a i}$ terms in (9.102) is negative, rather than positive as assumed in (9.103). If the number of RHP zeros is even, an even number of $-z_{a i}$ terms that are negative appear in the denominator of (9.102). The product of these negative terms is positive, and
therefore (9.103) and (9.104) remain correct. However, if the number of RHP zeros is odd, the product of the $-z_{a i}$ terms in (9.102) is negative. As a result, a minus sign appears on the left-hand side of (9.103) that causes a $\pi$ term to be added on the left side of (9.104). This change to the phase condition is reflected in the following rule.

Rule 2. If $T(s)$ has all its zeros in the LHP or if $T(s)$ has an even number of RHP zeros, the locus is situated along the real axis wherever there is an odd number of poles and zeros of $T(s)$ to the right. However, if $T(s)$ has an odd number of RHP zeros, the locus is situated along the real axis wherever there is an even number of poles and zeros of $T(s)$ to the right.

Consider again the situation in Fig. 9.37. Rule 1 indicates that branches of the locus must start at $p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}$, and $p_{4}$. Rule 2 indicates that the locus exists between $p_{3}$ and $z_{1}$, and thus the branch beginning at $p_{3}$ ends at $z_{1}$. Rule 2 also indicates that the locus exists to the left of $p_{4}$, and thus the branch beginning at $p_{4}$ moves out to negative infinity. The branches beginning at $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$ must also terminate at infinity, which is possible only if these branches break away from the real axis as shown in Fig. 9.38. This can be stated as follows.

Rule 3. All segments of loci that lie on the real axis between pairs of poles (or pairs of zeros) of $T(s)$ must, at some internal break point, branch out from the real axis.

The following rules can be derived. ${ }^{20}$
Rule 4. The locus is symmetrical with respect to the real axis (because complex roots occur only in conjugate pairs).

Figure 9.38 Root-locus construction for the poles and zeros of Fig. 9.37.

Rule 5. Branches of the locus that leave the real axis do so at right angles, as illustrated in Fig. 9.38.

Rule 6. If branches of the locus break away from the real axis, they do so at a point where the vector sum of reciprocals of distances to the poles of $T(s)$ equals the vector sum of reciprocals of distances to the zeros of $T(s)$.

Rule 7. If $T(s)$ has no RHP zeros or an even number of RHP zeros, branches of the locus that terminate at infinity do so asymptotically to straight lines with angles to the real axis of $[(2 n-1) \pi] /\left(N_{p}-N_{z}\right)$ for $n=0,1, \ldots, N_{p}-N_{z}-1$, where $N_{p}$ is the number of poles and $N_{z}$ is the number of zeros. However, if $T(s)$ has an odd number of RHP zeros, the asymptotes intersect the real axis at angles given by $(2 n \pi) /\left(N_{p}-N_{z}\right)$.

Rule 8. The asymptotes of branches that terminate at infinity all intersect on the real axis at a point given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\sigma_{a}=\frac{\sum[\text { poles of } T(s)]-\sum[\text { zeros of } T(s)]}{N_{p}-N_{z}} \tag{9.106}
\end{equation*}
$$

A number of other rules have been developed for sketching root loci, but those described above are adequate for most requirements in amplifier design. The rules are used to obtain a rapid idea of the shape of the root locus in any situation, and to calculate amplifier performance in simple cases. More detailed calculation on circuits exhibiting complicated pole-zero patterns generally require computer calculation of the root locus.

Note that the above rules are all based on the phase condition of (9.104). Once the locus has been sketched, it can then be calibrated with values of low-frequency loop gain $T_{0}$ calculated at any desired point using the magnitude condition of (9.105).

The procedures described above will now be illustrated with examples.

#### EXAMPLE

In Section 9.5.1 the root locus was calculated for an amplifier with three identical poles. This example was chosen because it was analytically tractable. Now consider a more practical case where the amplifier has three nonidentical poles and resistive feedback is applied. It is required to plot the root locus for this amplifier as feedback factor $f$ is varied (thus varying $T_{0}$ ), and it is assumed that variations in $f$ do not cause significant changes in the basic-amplifier transfer function $a(s)$.

Assume that the basic amplifier has a transfer function

$$
\begin{equation*}
a(s)=\frac{100}{\left(1-\frac{s}{p_{1}}\right)\left(1-\frac{s}{p_{2}}\right)\left(1-\frac{s}{p_{3}}\right)} \tag{9.107}
\end{equation*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{aligned}
& p_{1}=-1 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s} \\
& p_{2}=-2 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s} \\
& p_{3}=-4 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}
\end{aligned}
$$

Since the feedback circuit is assumed resistive, loop gain $T(s)$ contains three poles. The root locus is shown in Fig. 9.39, and, for convenience, the numbers are normalized to $10^{6} \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_c6361d8e0343487b8e82g-073.jpg?height=1062&width=1219&top_left_y=209&top_left_x=302)

Figure 9.39 Root-locus example for poles of $T(s)$ at $-1 \times 10^{6},-2 \times 10^{6}$, and $-4 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}$.
Rules 1 and 2 indicate that branches of the locus starting at poles $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$ move toward each other and then split out and asymptote to infinity. The branch starting at pole $p_{3}$ moves out along the negative real axis to infinity.

The breakaway point for the locus between $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$ can be calculated using rule 6 . If $\sigma_{i}$ is the coordinate of the breakaway point, then

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{\sigma_{i}+1}+\frac{1}{\sigma_{i}+2}+\frac{1}{\sigma_{i}+4}=0 \tag{9.108}
\end{equation*}
$$

Solving this quadratic equation for $\sigma_{i}$ gives $\sigma_{i}=-3.22$ or -1.45 . The value -1.45 is the only possible solution because the breakaway point lies between -1 and -2 on the real axis.

The angles of the asymptotes to the real axis can be found using rule 7 and are $\pm 60^{\circ}$ and $180^{\circ}$. The asymptotes meet the real axis at a point whose coordinate is $\sigma_{a}$ given by (9.106), and using (9.106) gives

$$
\sigma_{a}=\frac{(-1-2-4)-0}{3}=-2.33
$$

When these asymptotes are drawn, the locus can be sketched as in Fig. 9.39 noting, from rule 5, that the locus leaves the real axis at right angles. The locus can now be calibrated for loop gain by using the magnitude condition of (9.105). Aspects of interest about the locus may be the loop gain required to cause the poles to become complex, the loop gain required for poles with an angle of $45^{\circ}$ to the negative real axis, and the loop gain required for oscillation (right half-plane poles).

Consider first the loop gain required to cause the poles to become complex. This is a point on the locus on the real axis at $\sigma_{i}=-1.45$. Substituting $s=-1.45$ in (9.105) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
T_{0} \frac{1 \times 2 \times 4}{0.45 \times 0.55 \times 2.55}=1 \tag{9.109}
\end{equation*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{array}{rlr}
\left|p_{1}\right|=1 \quad\left|p_{2}\right|=2 & \left|p_{3}\right|=4 \\
\left|s-p_{1}\right|=0.45 & \left|s-p_{2}\right|=0.55 & \left|s-p_{3}\right|=2.55
\end{array}
$$

and

$$
s=-1.45 \text { at the point being considered }
$$

From (9.109), $T_{0}=0.08$. Thus a very small loop-gain magnitude causes poles $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$ to come together and split.

The loop gain required to cause right half-plane poles can be estimated by assuming that the locus coincides with the asymptote at that point. Thus we assume the locus crosses the imaginary axis at the point

$$
j 2.33 \tan 60^{\circ}=4.0 j
$$

Then the loop gain at this point can be calculated using (9.105) to give

$$
\begin{equation*}
T_{0} \frac{1 \times 2 \times 4}{4.1 \times 4.5 \times 5.7}=1 \tag{9.110}
\end{equation*}
$$

where

$$
\left|s-p_{1}\right|=4.1 \quad\left|s-p_{2}\right|=4.5 \quad\left|s-p_{3}\right|=5.7
$$

and

$$
s=4 j \text { at this point on the locus }
$$

From (9.110), $T_{0}=13.2$. Since $a_{0}=100$ for this amplifier [from (9.107)], the overall gain of the feedback amplifier to $T_{0}=13.2$ is

$$
A_{0}=\frac{a_{0}}{1+T_{0}}=7.04
$$

and

$$
f=\frac{T_{0}}{a_{0}}=0.132
$$

The loop gain when the complex poles make an angle of $45^{\circ}$ with the negative real axis can be calculated by making the assumption that this point has the same real-axis coordinate as the breakaway point. Then, using $(9.105)$ with $s=(-1.45+1.45 j)$, we obtain

$$
T_{0} \frac{1 \times 2 \times 4}{1.52 \times 1.55 \times 2.93}=1
$$

and thus

$$
T_{0}=0.86
$$

Finally, the loop gain required to move the locus out from pole $p_{3}$ is of interest. When the real-axis pole is at -5 , the loop gain can be calculated using (9.105) with $s=-5$ to give

$$
T_{0} \frac{1 \times 2 \times 4}{1 \times 3 \times 4}=1
$$

That is,

$$
T_{0}=1.5
$$

When this pole is at -6 , the loop gain is

$$
T_{0} \frac{1 \times 2 \times 4}{2 \times 4 \times 5}=1
$$

and thus

$$
T_{0}=5
$$

These values are marked on the root locus of Fig. 9.39.
In this example, it is useful to compare the prediction of instability at $T_{0}=13.2$ with the results using the Nyquist criterion. The loop gain in the frequency domain is

$$
\begin{equation*}
T(j \omega)=\frac{T_{0}}{\left(1+\frac{j \omega}{10^{6}}\right)\left(1+\frac{j \omega}{2 \times 10^{6}}\right)\left(1+\frac{j \omega}{4 \times 10^{6}}\right)} \tag{9.111}
\end{equation*}
$$

A series of trial substitutions shows that $\angle T(j \omega)=-180^{\circ}$ for $\omega=3.8 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}$. Note that this is close to the value of $4 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}$ where the root locus was assumed to cross the $j \omega$ axis. Substitution of $\omega=3.8 \times 10^{6}$ in (9.111) gives, for the loop gain at that frequency,

$$
\begin{equation*}
|T(j \omega)|=\frac{T_{0}}{11.6} \tag{9.112}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus, for stability, the Nyquist criterion requires that $T_{0}<11.6$ and this is close to the answer obtained from the root locus. If the point on the $j \omega$ axis where the root locus crossed had been determined more accurately, it would have been found to be at $3.8 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}$, and both methods would predict instability for $T_{0}>11.6$.

It should be pointed out that the root locus for Fig. 9.39 shows the movement of the poles of the feedback amplifier as $T_{0}$ changes. The theory developed in Section 9.5 . 2 showed that the zeros of the feedback amplifier are the zeros of the basic amplifier and the poles of the feedback network. In this case there are no zeros in the feedback amplifier, but this is not always the case. It should be kept in mind that if the basic amplifier has zeros in its transfer function, these may be an important part of the overall transfer function.

The rules for drawing a root locus were presented for varying $T_{0}$, assuming that the poles and zeros of $a(s)$ and $f(s)$ do not change when $T_{0}$ changes. This assumption is often not valid in practice, since changing the circuit to change $T_{0}=a_{0} f$ usually affects at least some of the poles and zeros. Alternatively, these rules can be used to draw a root locus of the poles of a transfer function as the value $x$ of an element in the circuit changes if the closed-loop gain $A(s)$ can be written in the form

$$
\begin{equation*}
A(s)=\frac{M(s)}{G(s)+x H(s)} \tag{9.113}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $M(s), G(s)$, and $H(s)$ are polynomials in $s$, and $G(s)$ and $H(s)$ are not functions of $x$. The poles of $A(s)$ are the roots of $G(s)=0$ when $x=0$ and the roots of $H(s)=0$ when $x \rightarrow \infty$. The roots of $G(s)=0$ are the starting points of the root locus, and the roots of $H(s)=0$ are the ending points of the root locus. The complete locus for all values of $x$ can be drawn by following the rules given in this section. For example, this approach could be used to plot a locus of the poles of the transfer function in (9.27) as the compensation capacitor $C$ varies. (In this case, $x=C$.)

Figure 9.40 Root locus for an op amp with two poles in its transfer function. The feedback is assumed resistive.

### 9.5.3 Root Locus for Dominant-Pole Compensation

Consider an op amp that has been compensated by creation of a dominant pole at $p_{1}$. If we assume the second most dominant pole is at $p_{2}$ and neglect the effect of higher order poles, the root locus when resistive feedback is applied is as shown in Fig. 9.40. Using rules 1 and 2 indicates that the root locus exists on the axis between $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$, and the breakaway point is readily shown to be

$$
\begin{equation*}
\sigma_{i}=\frac{p_{1}+p_{2}}{2} \tag{9.114}
\end{equation*}
$$

using rule 6 . Using rules 7 and 8 shows that the asymptotes are at $90^{\circ}$ to the real axis and meet the axis at $\sigma_{i}$.

As $T_{0}$ is increased, the branches of the locus come together and then split out to become complex. As $T_{0}$ becomes large, the imaginary part of the poles becomes large, and the circuit will then have a high-frequency peak in its overall gain function $A(j \omega)$. This is consistent with the previous viewpoint of gain peaking that occurred with diminishing phase margin.

Assume that maximum bandwidth in this amplifier is required, but that little or no peaking is allowed. This means that with maximum loop gain applied, the poles should not go beyond the points marked $X$ and $Y$ on the locus where an angle of $45^{\circ}$ is made between the negative real axis and a line drawn from $X$ or $Y$ to the origin. At $X$, the loop gain can be calculated using (9.105)

$$
\begin{equation*}
T_{0} \frac{\left|p_{1}\right| \cdot\left|p_{2}\right|}{\left|s-p_{1}\right| \cdot\left|s-p_{2}\right|}=1 \tag{9.115}
\end{equation*}
$$

If $p_{1}$ is a dominant pole, we can assume that $\left|p_{1}\right| \ll\left|p_{2}\right|$ and $\sigma_{i}=p_{2} / 2$. For poles at $45^{\circ}$, $\left|s-p_{1}\right|=\left|s-p_{2}\right| \simeq \sqrt{2}\left|p_{2}\right| / 2$. Thus (9.115) becomes

$$
T_{0}=\frac{1}{\left|p_{1}\right| \cdot\left|p_{2}\right|}\left(\sqrt{2} \frac{\left|p_{2}\right|}{2}\right)^{2}
$$

This gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
T_{0}=\frac{1}{2} \frac{\left|p_{2}\right|}{\left|p_{1}\right|} \tag{9.116}
\end{equation*}
$$

for the value of $T_{0}$ required to produce poles at $X$ and $Y$ in Fig. 9.40. The effect of narrowbanding the amplifier is now apparent. As $\left|p_{1}\right|$ is made smaller, it requires a larger value of $T_{0}$ to move the poles out to $45^{\circ}$. From (9.116), the dominant-pole magnitude $\left|p_{1}\right|$ required to ensure adequate performance with a given $T_{0}$ and $\left|p_{2}\right|$ can be calculated.

### 9.5.4 Root Locus for Feedback-Zero Compensation

The techniques of compensation described earlier in this chapter involved modification of the basic amplifier only. This is the universal method used with op amps that must be compensated for use with a wide variety of feedback networks chosen by the user. However, this method is quite wasteful of bandwidth, as was apparent in the calculations.

In this section, a different method of compensation will be described that involves modification of the feedback path and is generally limited to fixed-gain amplifiers. This method finds application in the compensation of wideband feedback amplifiers where bandwidth is of prime importance. An example is the shunt-series feedback amplifier of Fig. 8.31, which is known as a current feedback pair. The method is generally useful in amplifiers of this type, where the feedback is over two stages, and in circuits such as the series-series triple of Fig. 8.18a.

A shunt-series feedback amplifier including a feedback capacitor $C_{F}$ is shown in Fig. 9.41. The basic amplifier including feedback loading for this circuit is shown in Fig. 9.42. Capacitors $C_{F}$ at input and output have only a minor effect on the circuit transfer function. The feedback circuit for this case is shown in Fig. 9.43 and feedback function $f$ is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
f=\frac{i_{i}}{i_{2}}=-\frac{R_{E}}{R_{F}+R_{E}} \frac{1+R_{F} C_{F} s}{1+\frac{R_{E} R_{F}}{R_{E}+R_{F}} C_{F} s} \tag{9.117}
\end{equation*}
$$

Feedback function $f$ thus contains a zero with a magnitude

$$
\begin{equation*}
\omega_{z}=\frac{1}{R_{F} C_{F}} \tag{9.118}
\end{equation*}
$$

and a pole with a magnitude

$$
\begin{equation*}
\omega_{p}=\frac{R_{E}+R_{F}}{R_{E}} \frac{1}{R_{F} C_{F}} \tag{9.119}
\end{equation*}
$$

Quantity $\left(R_{E}+R_{F}\right) / R_{E}$ is approximately the low-frequency gain of the overall circuit with feedback applied, and, since it is usually true that $\left(R_{E}+R_{F}\right) / R_{E} \gg 1$, the pole magnitude
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_c6361d8e0343487b8e82g-077.jpg?height=504&width=1014&top_left_y=1726&top_left_x=417)

Figure 9.43 Circuit for the calculation of feedback function $f$ for the amplifier of Fig. 9.41.
given by (9.119) is usually much larger than the zero magnitude. This will be assumed and the effects of the pole will be neglected, but if $\left(R_{E}+R_{F}\right) / R_{E}$ becomes comparable to unity, the pole will be important and must be included.

The basic amplifier of Fig. 9.42 has two significant poles contributed by $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$. Although higher magnitude poles exist, these do not have a dominant influence and will be neglected. The effects of this assumption will be investigated later. The loop gain of the circuit of Fig. 9.41 thus contains two forward-path poles and a feedback zero, giving rise to the root locus of Fig. 9.44. For purposes of illustration, the two poles are assumed to be $p_{1}=$ $-10 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}$ and $p_{2}=-20 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}$ and the zero is $z=-50 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}$. For convenience in the calculations, the numbers will be normalized to $10^{6} \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}$.

Assume now that the loop gain of the circuit of Fig. 9.41 can be varied without changing the parameters of the basic amplifier of Fig. 9.42. Then a root locus can be plotted as the loop gain changes, and using rules 1 and 2 indicates that the root locus exists on the axis between $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$, and to the left of $z$. The root locus must thus break away from the axis between $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$ at $\sigma_{1}$ as shown, and return again at $\sigma_{2}$. One branch then extends to the right along the axis to end at the zero while the other branch heads toward infinity on the left. Using rule 6 gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{\sigma_{1}+10}+\frac{1}{\sigma_{1}+20}=\frac{1}{\sigma_{1}+50} \tag{9.120}
\end{equation*}
$$

Solution of (9.120) for $\sigma_{1}$ gives

$$
\sigma_{1}=-84.6 \quad \text { or } \quad-15.4
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_c6361d8e0343487b8e82g-079.jpg?height=550&width=1165&top_left_y=208&top_left_x=329)

Figure 9.44 Root locus for the circuit of Fig. 9.41 assuming the basic amplifier contributes two poles to $T(s)$ and the feedback circuit contributes one zero.

Obviously $\sigma_{1}=-15.4$ and the other value is $\sigma_{2}=-84.6$. Note that these points are equidistant from the zero, and, in fact, it can be shown that in this example the portion of the locus that is off the real axis is a circle centered on the zero. An aspect of the root-locus diagrams that is a useful aid in sketching the loci is apparent from Fig. 9.39 and Fig. 9.44. The locus tends to bend toward zeros as if attracted and tends to bend away from poles as if repelled.

The effectiveness of the feedback zero in compensating the amplifier is apparent from Fig. 9.44. If we assume that the amplifier has poles $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$ and there is no feedback zero, then when feedback is applied the amplifier poles will split out and move parallel to the $j \omega$ axis. For practical values of loop gain $T_{0}$, this would result in "high $Q$ " poles near the $j \omega$ axis, which would give rise to an excessively peaked response. In practice, oscillation can occur because higher magnitude poles do exist and these would tend to give a locus of the kind of Fig. 9.39, where the remote poles cause the locus to bend and enter the right half-plane. (Note that this behavior is consistent with the alternative approach of considering a diminished phase margin to be causing a peaked response and eventual instability.) The inclusion of the feedback zero, however, bends the locus away from the $j \omega$ axis and allows the designer to position the poles in any desired region.

An important point that should be stressed is that the root locus of Fig. 9.44 gives the poles of the feedback amplifier. The zero in that figure is a zero of loop gain $T(s)$ and thus must be included in the root locus. However, the zero is contributed by the feedback network and is not a zero of the overall feedback amplifier. As pointed out in Section 9.5.2, the zeros of the overall feedback amplifier are the zeros of basic amplifier $a(s)$ and the poles of feedback network $f(s)$. Thus the transfer function of the overall feedback amplifier in this case has two poles and no zeros, as shown in Fig. 9.45, and the poles are assumed placed at $45^{\circ}$ to the axis by appropriate choice of $z$. Since the feedback zero affects the root locus but does not appear as a zero of the overall amplifier, it has been called a phantom zero.

On the other hand, if the zero $z$ were contributed by the basic amplifier, the situation would be different. For the same zero, the root locus would be identical but the transfer function of the overall feedback amplifier would then include the zero as shown in Fig. 9.46. This zero would then have a significant effect on the amplifier characteristics. This point is made simply to illustrate the difference between forward path and feedback-path zeros. There is no practical way to introduce a useful forward-path zero in this situation.

Before leaving this subject, we mention the effect of higher magnitude poles on the root locus of Fig. 9.44, and this is illustrated in Fig. 9.47. A remote pole $p_{3}$ will cause the locus to

deviate from the original as shown and produce poles with a larger imaginary part than expected. The third pole, which is on the real axis, may also be significant in the final amplifier. Acceptable performance can usually be obtained by modifying the value of $z$ from that calculated above.

Finally, the results derived in this chapter explain the function of capacitors $C_{P}$ and $C_{F}$ in the circuit of the MC 1553 series-series triple of Fig. 8.21a, which was described in Chapter 8. Capacitor $C_{P}$ causes pole splitting to occur in stage $Q_{2}$ and produces a dominant pole in the basic amplifier, which aids in the compensation. However, as described above, a large value
of $C_{P}$ will cause significant loss of bandwidth in the amplifier, and so a feedback zero is introduced via $C_{F}$, which further aids in the compensation by moving the root locus away from the $j \omega$ axis. The final design is a combination of two methods of compensation in an attempt to find an optimum solution.

## 9.6 Slew Rate ${ }^{8}$

The previous sections of this chapter have been concerned with the small-signal behavior of feedback amplifiers at high frequencies. However, the behavior of feedback circuits with large input signals (either step inputs or sinusoidal signals) is also of interest, and the effect of frequency compensation on the large-signal, high-frequency performance of feedback amplifiers is now considered.

### 9.6.1 Origin of Slew-Rate Limitations

A common test of the high-frequency, large-signal performance of an amplifier is to apply a step input voltage as shown in Fig. 9.48. This figure shows an op amp in a unity-gain feedback configuration and will be used for purposes of illustration in this development. Assuming the op amp is powered from a single supply between 3 V and ground, the input here is chosen to step from 0.5 V to 2.5 V so that the circuit operates linearly well before and well after the step. Suppose initially that the circuit has a single-pole transfer function given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{V_{o}}{V_{i}}(s)=\frac{A}{1+s \tau} \tag{9.121}
\end{equation*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{equation*}
\tau=\frac{1}{2 \pi f_{o}} \tag{9.122}
\end{equation*}
$$

and $f_{o}$ is the $-3-\mathrm{dB}$ frequency. Since the circuit is connected as a voltage follower, the lowfrequency gain $A$ will be close to unity. If we assume that this is so, the response of the circuit to this step input $\left[V_{i}(s)=2 / s\right]$ is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{o}(s)=\frac{1}{1+s \tau} \frac{2}{s} \tag{9.123}
\end{equation*}
$$

using (9.121). Equation 9.123 can be factored to the form

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{o}(s)=\frac{2}{s}-\frac{2}{s+\frac{1}{\tau}} \tag{9.124}
\end{equation*}
$$

From (9.124)

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{o}(t)=2\left(1-e^{-t / \tau}\right) \tag{9.125}
\end{equation*}
$$

Figure 9.49 Response of the circuit of Fig. 9.48 when a $2-\mathrm{V}$ step input is applied. (a) Response predicted by (9.125) for the NE5234 op amp.

The predicted response from (9.125) is shown in Fig. 9.49a using data for the NE5234 op amp with $f_{o} \simeq 2.7 \mathrm{MHz}$. This shows an exponential rise of $V_{o}(t)$ by 2 V and the output reaches 90 percent of its final value in about $0.14 \mu \mathrm{~s}$.

A typical output for the NE5234 op amp in such a test is shown in Fig. 9.49b and exhibits a completely different response. The output voltage is a slow ramp of almost constant slope and takes about $2.6 \mu \mathrm{~s}$ to reach 90 percent of its final value. Obviously the small-signal linear analysis is inadequate for predicting the circuit behavior under these conditions. The response shown in Fig. 9.49b is typical of op-amp performance with a large input step voltage applied. The rate of change of output voltage $d V_{o} / d t$ in the region of constant slope is called the slew rate and is usually specified in $\mathrm{V} / \mu \mathrm{s}$.

The reason for the discrepancy between predicted and observed behavior noted above can be appreciated by examining the circuit of Fig. $9.48 a$ and considering the responses in Fig. 9.49. At $t=0$, the input voltage steps up by +2 V , but the output voltage cannot respond instantaneously and is initially unchanged. Thus the op-amp differential input is $V_{i d}=2 \mathrm{~V}$, which drives the input stage completely out of its linear range of operation. This can be seen by considering a two-stage op amp; simplified schematics for a bipolar and CMOS op amp for use in this analysis are shown in Fig. $9.50 a$ and $b$. The Miller compensation capacitor $C$ connects around the high-gain second stage and causes this stage to act as an integrator. The current from the input stage, which charges the compensation capacitor, is $I_{x}$. The large-signal transfer characteristic from the op-amp differential input voltage $V_{i d}$ to $I_{x}$ is that of a differential pair, which is shown in Fig. 9.50c. From Fig. 9.50c, the maximum current available to charge $C$ is $2 I_{1}$, which is the tail current in the input stage. For a bipolar differential pair, $\left|I_{x}\right| \approx 2 I_{1}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_c6361d8e0343487b8e82g-083.jpg?height=1459&width=938&top_left_y=207&top_left_x=259)

if $\left|V_{i d}\right|>3 V_{T}$. For a MOS differential pair, $\left|I_{x}\right| \approx 2 I_{1}$ if $\left|V_{i d}\right|>\sqrt{2}\left|V_{o V 1}\right|$. (See Chapter 3.) Thus, when $V_{i d}=2 \mathrm{~V}$ as described above, the input stage limits and $I_{x} \approx 2 I_{1}$ (assuming that $\sqrt{2}\left|V_{o v 1}\right|<2 \mathrm{~V}$ for the MOS circuit). The circuit thus operates nonlinearly, and linear analysis fails to predict the behavior. If the input stage did act linearly, the input voltage change of 2 V would produce a very large current $I_{x}$ to charge the compensation capacitor. The fact that this current is limited to the fairly small value of $2 I_{1}$ is the reason for the slew rate being much less than a linear analysis would predict.

Consider a large input voltage applied to the circuits of Fig. 9.50 so that $I_{x}=2 I_{1}$. Then the second stage acts as an integrator with an input current $2 I_{1}$, and the output voltage $V_{o}$ can be written as

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{o}=\frac{1}{C} \int 2 I_{1} d t \tag{9.126}
\end{equation*}
$$

and thus

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d V_{o}}{d t}=\frac{2 I_{1}}{C} \tag{9.127}
\end{equation*}
$$

Equation 9.127 predicts a constant rate of change of $V_{o}$ during the slewing period, which is in agreement with the experimental observation.

The above calculation of slew rate was performed on the circuits of Fig. 9.50, which have no overall feedback. Since the input stage produces a constant output current that is independent of its input during the slewing period, the presence of a feedback connection to the input does not affect the circuit operation during this time. Thus, the slew rate of the amplifier is the same whether feedback is applied or not.

The NE5234 op amp does not quite fit the model shown in Fig. 9.50a because the output of its first stage is differential. Figure 9.51 shows a model that assumes the op-amp common-mode input voltage is low enough that $Q_{1}, Q_{2}$, and $Q_{5}-Q_{7}$ in Fig. 6.36 are off. In practice, the input step in Fig. $9.48 a$ changes the op-amp common-mode input voltage. Although this change affects the biasing of the input stage in the NE5234, it has little effect on the currents that limit the slew rate because the total current that biases the two differential pairs $Q_{1-} Q_{4}$ in Fig. 6.36
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_c6361d8e0343487b8e82g-084.jpg?height=802&width=1156&top_left_y=1447&top_left_x=334)

Figure 9.51 Simplified schematic of the NE5234 op amp.
is constant. Therefore, the change in the op-amp common-mode input voltage is ignored here. The three current sources at the top of Fig. 9.51 model the dc currents set by transistors $Q_{11}$, $Q_{13}$, and $Q_{14}$ in Fig. 6.36 and are assumed constant here. When $V_{i d}=0, I_{C 3}=I_{C 4}=-3 \mu \mathrm{~A}$, ignoring base currents (as is done throughout this analysis for simplicity). The negative signs here stem from the convention that defines transistor collector current as positive when it flows into the collector. To simplify the following description, let $I_{3}=-I_{C 3}$ and $I_{4}=-I_{C 4}$. Then with $V_{i d}=0, I_{3}=I_{4}=3 \mu \mathrm{~A}, I_{C 9}=I_{C 10}=6 \mu \mathrm{~A}$, and capacitor currents $I_{21}=I_{22}=0$, as shown in Fig. 9.51 and calculated in Chapter 6. Immediately after the step input in Fig. 9.48, $Q_{4}$ turns off, $I_{3}=6 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ and $I_{4}=0$. Note that the changes in $I_{3}$ and $I_{4}$ are differential in the sense that one increases and the other decreases while their average value is constant. So we will ignore the common-mode feedback circuit that controls the average voltage to ground at the first-stage outputs and assume the voltage from node Bias ${ }_{\mathrm{CM}}$ to ground ( $V_{\text {biascm }}$ ) is constant.

First, we calculate $I_{C 9}$ immediately after the input step using the assumption that $V_{\text {biascm }}$ is constant by setting $V_{R 9}+V_{b e 9}$ before and after the step equal to each other.

$$
\begin{equation*}
(3 \mu \mathrm{~A}+6 \mu \mathrm{~A}) 22 \mathrm{k} \Omega+V_{T} \ln \left(\frac{6 \mu \mathrm{~A}}{I_{S 9}}\right)=\left(6 \mu \mathrm{~A}+I_{C 9}\right) 22 \mathrm{k} \Omega+V_{T} \ln \left(\frac{I_{C 9}}{I_{S 9}}\right) \tag{9.128a}
\end{equation*}
$$

Simplifying this equation gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
0=\left(I_{C 9}-3 \mu \mathrm{~A}\right) 22 \mathrm{k} \Omega+V_{T} \ln \left(\frac{I_{C 9}}{6 \mu \mathrm{~A}}\right) \tag{9.128b}
\end{equation*}
$$

Solving this equation by trial and error gives $I_{C 9}=3.6 \mu \mathrm{~A}$. Then from KCL at node 9 , $I_{21}=6 \mu \mathrm{~A}-I_{C 9}=2.4 \mu \mathrm{~A}$. As a result, $d V_{9} / d t=2.4 \mu \mathrm{~A} / 5.2 \mathrm{pF}=0.46 \mathrm{~V} / \mu \mathrm{s}$, where $V_{9}$ is the voltage from node 9 to ground.

Next, we calculate $I_{C 10}$ immediately after the input step in a similar manner.

$$
\begin{equation*}
(3 \mu \mathrm{~A}+6 \mu \mathrm{~A}) 22 \mathrm{k} \Omega+V_{T} \ln \left(\frac{6 \mu \mathrm{~A}}{I_{S 10}}\right)=\left(I_{C 10}\right) 22 \mathrm{k} \Omega+V_{T} \ln \left(\frac{I_{C 10}}{I_{S 10}}\right) \tag{9.128c}
\end{equation*}
$$

Simplifying this equation gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
0=\left(I_{C 10}-9 \mu \mathrm{~A}\right) 22 \mathrm{k} \Omega+V_{T} \ln \left(\frac{I_{C 10}}{6 \mu \mathrm{~A}}\right) \tag{9.128d}
\end{equation*}
$$

Solving this equation by trial and error gives $I_{C 9}=8.6 \mu \mathrm{~A}$. Then from KCL at node 10 , $I_{22}=I_{C 10}-6 \mu \mathrm{~A}=2.6 \mu \mathrm{~A}$. Therefore, the voltage across $C_{22}$ increases at a rate of $d\left(V_{o}-\right.$ $\left.V_{10}\right) / d t=2.6 \mu \mathrm{~A} / 5.5 \mathrm{pF}=0.47 \mathrm{~V} / \mu \mathrm{s}$, where $V_{10}$ is the voltage from node 10 to ground. In Fig. 9.51, the amplifier that represents the second and third stages in the NE5234 has negative feedback connected around it through capacitor $C_{22}$. Assuming that the gain of this amplifier is large and that it operates linearly, $V_{o}$ is driven so that $V_{10} \simeq V_{9}$. Therefore, the slew rate of the NE5234 is

$$
\begin{equation*}
d V_{o} / d t=d V_{9} / d t+d\left(V_{o}-V_{10}\right) / d t=(0.46+0.47) \mathrm{V} / \mu \mathrm{s}=0.93 \mathrm{~V} / \mu \mathrm{s} \tag{9.128e}
\end{equation*}
$$

In contrast, the plot in Fig. $9.49 b$ shows that the simulated slew rate is about $0.68 \mathrm{~V} / \mu \mathrm{s}$, and the difference stems partly from ignoring base currents in the calculations above.

### 9.6.2 Methods of Improving Slew-Rate in Two-Stage Op Amps

In order to examine methods of slew-rate improvement, a more general analysis is required. This can be performed using the circuit of Fig. 9.52, which is a general representation of an op amp circuit. The input stage has a small-signal transconductance $g_{m I}$ and, with a large input voltage, can deliver a maximum current $I_{x m}$ to the next stage. The compensation is shown
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_c6361d8e0343487b8e82g-086.jpg?height=413&width=1011&top_left_y=208&top_left_x=416)

Figure 9.52 Generalized representation of an op amp for slew-rate calculations.
as the Miller effect using the capacitor $C$, since this representation describes most two-stage integrated-circuit op amps.

From Fig. 9.52 and using (9.127), we can calculate the slew rate for a large input voltage as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d V_{o}}{d t}=\frac{I_{x m}}{C} \tag{9.129}
\end{equation*}
$$

Consider now small-signal operation. For the input stage, the small-signal transconductance is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\Delta I_{x}}{\Delta V_{i}}=g_{m I} \tag{9.130}
\end{equation*}
$$

For the second stage (which acts as an integrator) the transfer function at high frequencies is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\Delta V_{o}}{\Delta I_{x}}=\frac{1}{s C} \tag{9.131a}
\end{equation*}
$$

and in the frequency domain

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\Delta V_{o}}{\Delta I_{x}}(j \omega)=\frac{1}{j \omega C} \tag{9.131b}
\end{equation*}
$$

Combining (9.130) and (9.131b) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\Delta V_{o}}{\Delta V_{i}}(j \omega)=\frac{g_{m I}}{j \omega C} \tag{9.131c}
\end{equation*}
$$

In our previous consideration of compensation, it was shown that the small-signal, open-loop voltage gain $\left(\Delta V_{o} / \Delta V_{i}\right)(j \omega)$ must fall to unity at or before a frequency equal to the magnitude of the second most dominant pole $\left(\omega_{2}\right)$. If we assume, for ease of calculation, that the circuit is compensated for unity-gain operation with $45^{\circ}$ phase margin as shown in Fig. 9.15, the gain $\left(\Delta V_{o} / \Delta V_{i}\right)(j \omega)$ as given by $(9.131 \mathrm{c})$ must fall to unity at frequency $\omega_{2}$. (Compensation capacitor $C$ must be chosen to ensure that this occurs.) Thus from (9.131c)

$$
1=\frac{g_{m I}}{\omega_{2} C}
$$

and thus

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{C}=\frac{\omega_{2}}{g_{m I}} \tag{9.132}
\end{equation*}
$$

Note that (9.132) was derived on the basis of a small-signal argument. This result can now be substituted in the large-signal equation (9.129) to give

$$
\begin{equation*}
\text { Slew rate }=\frac{d V_{o}}{d t}=\frac{I_{x m}}{g_{m I}} \omega_{2} \tag{9.133}
\end{equation*}
$$

Equation 9.133 allows consideration of the effect of circuit parameters on slew rate, and it is apparent that, for a given $\omega_{2}$, the ratio $I_{x m} / g_{m l}$ must be increased if slew rate is to be increased.

### 9.6.3 Improving Slew-Rate in Bipolar Op Amps

The analysis of the previous section can be applied to a bipolar op amp that uses Miller compensation. In the case of the op amp in Fig. 9.50a, we have $I_{x m}=2 I_{1}, g_{m I}=q I_{1} / k T$, and substitution in (9.133) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\text { Slew rate }=2 \frac{k T}{q} \omega_{2} \tag{9.134}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since both $I_{x m}$ and $g_{m I}$ are proportional to bias current $I_{1}$, the influence of $I_{1}$ cancels in the equation and slew rate is independent of $I_{1}$ for a given $\omega_{2}$. However, increasing $\omega_{2}$ will increase the slew rate, and this course is followed in most high-slew-rate circuits. The limit here is set by the frequency characteristics of the transistors in the IC process, and further improvements depend on circuit modifications as described below.

The above calculation has shown that varying the input-stage bias current of a two-stage bipolar op amp does not change the circuit slew rate. However, (9.133) indicates that for a given $I_{x m}$, slew rate can be increased by reducing the input-stage transconductance. One way this can be achieved is by including emitter-degeneration resistors to reduce $g_{m I}$ as shown in Fig. 9.53. The small-signal transconductance of this input stage can be shown to be

$$
\begin{equation*}
g_{m I}=\frac{\Delta I_{x}}{\Delta V_{i d}}=g_{m 1} \frac{1}{1+g_{m 1} R_{E}} \tag{9.135}
\end{equation*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{equation*}
g_{m 1}=\frac{q I_{1}}{k T} \tag{9.136}
\end{equation*}
$$

The value of $I_{x m}$ is still $2 I_{1}$. Substituting (9.135) in (9.133) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\text { Slew rate }=\frac{2 k T}{q} \omega_{2}\left(1+g_{m 1} R_{E}\right) \tag{9.137}
\end{equation*}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_c6361d8e0343487b8e82g-087.jpg?height=699&width=621&top_left_y=1587&top_left_x=263)

Figure 9.53 Inclusion of emitter resistors in the input stage in Fig. 9.50a to improve slew rate.

Thus the slew rate is increased by the factor $\left[1+\left(g_{m 1} R_{E}\right)\right]$ over the value given by (9.134). The fundamental reason for this is that, for a given bias current $I_{1}$, reducing $g_{m I}$ reduces the compensation capacitor $C$ required, as shown by (9.132).

The practical limit to this technique is due to the fact that the emitter resistors of Fig. 9.53 have a dc voltage across them, and mismatches in the resistor values give rise to an input dc offset voltage. The use of large-area resistors can give resistors whose values match to within 0.2 percent ( 1 part in 500). If the maximum contribution to input offset voltage allowed from the resistors is 1 mV , then these numbers indicate that the maximum voltage drop allowed is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left.I_{1} R_{E}\right|_{\max }=500 \mathrm{mV} \tag{9.138}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left.g_{m 1} R_{E}\right|_{\max }=\left.\frac{q}{k T} I_{1} R_{E}\right|_{\max }=\frac{500}{26}=20 \tag{9.139}
\end{equation*}
$$

Using (9.139) in (9.137) shows that given these data, the maximum possible improvement in slew rate by use of emitter resistors is a factor of 21 times.

Finally, in this description of methods of slew-rate improvement, we mention the Class $A B$ input stage described by Hearn. ${ }^{21}$ In this technique, the small-signal transconductance of the input stage is left essentially unchanged, but the limit $I_{x m}$ on the maximum current available for charging the compensation capacitor is greatly increased. This is done by providing alternative paths in the input stage that become operative for large inputs and deliver large charging currents to the compensation point. This has resulted in slew rates of the order of $30 \mathrm{~V} / \mu \mathrm{s}$ in bipolar op amps , and, as in the previous cases, the limitation is an increase in input offset voltage.

### 9.6.4 Improving Slew-Rate in MOS Op Amps

A two-stage Miller-compensated MOS op amp is shown in Fig. 9.50b, and its slew rate is given by (9.127). From the analysis in Section 9.6.2, (9.133) shows that the slew rate can be increased by increasing $\omega_{2}$. On the other hand, if $\omega_{2}$ is fixed, increasing the ratio $I_{x m} / g_{m I}$ improves the slew rate. Using (1.180), (9.133) can be rewritten as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\text { Slew rate }=\frac{I_{x m}}{g_{m I}} \omega_{2}=\frac{2 I_{1}}{\sqrt{2 k^{\prime}(W / L)_{1} I_{1}}} \omega_{2}=\sqrt{\frac{2 I_{1}}{k^{\prime}(W / L)_{1}}} \omega_{2} \tag{9.140}
\end{equation*}
$$

This equation shows that the slew rate increases if $(W / L)_{1}$ decreases with $I_{1}$ constant. In this case, $g_{m I}=g_{m 1}$ decreases. From (9.132), a smaller compensation capacitor can then be used; therefore, the slew rate in (9.127) increases because $I_{1}$ is unchanged. Equation 9.140 also shows that the slew rate can be increased by increasing $I_{1}$. Assume that $I_{1}$ increases by a factor $x$ where $x>1$. Then the ratio $I_{x m} / g_{m I}$ increases by the factor $\sqrt{x}$ because $g_{m 1}$ is proportional to $\sqrt{I_{1}}$. From (9.132), the compensation capacitor must be increased by the factor $\sqrt{x}$ if $\omega_{2}$ is fixed. With these changes, the slew rate in (9.127) becomes

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d V_{o}}{d t}=\frac{2 x I_{1}}{C \sqrt{x}}=\frac{2 I_{1} \sqrt{x}}{C} \tag{9.141}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since $x>1$, the slew rate is increased.
Alternatively, the ratio $I_{x m} / g_{m I}$ of the input stage can be increased by adding degeneration resistors $R_{S}$ in series with the sources of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ to give

$$
\begin{equation*}
g_{m I}=\frac{g_{m 1}}{1+\left(g_{m 1}+g_{m b 1}\right) R_{S}} \tag{9.142}
\end{equation*}
$$

For fixed $I_{1}$, increasing $R_{S}$ decreases $g_{m I}$ and increases $I_{x m} / g_{m I}$, which increases the slew rate.

These approaches increase the slew rate but have some drawbacks. First, decreasing $g_{m I}$ of the input stage while keeping its bias current constant will usually lower the dc gain of the first stage and hence reduce the dc gain of the entire op amp. Also, increasing $I_{1}$ or reducing $(W / L)_{1}$ tends to increase the input-offset voltage of the op amp, as can be seen from (3.248). Finally, if source-degeneration resistors are added, mismatch between these resistors degrades the input-offset voltage.

For single-stage MOS op amps, such as the telescopic-cascode and folded-cascode op amps , the slew rate is set by the maximum output current divided by the capacitance that loads the output. The maximum output current is equal to the tail current in these op amps.

#### EXAMPLE

Find the output slew rate for the cascode op amp shown in Fig. 9.54.
Assuming the op amp has a large positive differential input voltage applied, $M_{2}$ is cutoff and $I_{\text {TAIL }}$ flows through $M_{1}$. Therefore the drain current in $M_{2 A}$ is zero, and the drain current in $M_{3}$ is $I_{d 3}=-I_{\text {TAIL }}$. The current mirror $M_{3}-M_{4}$ forces $I_{d 3}=I_{d 4}$. It follows that $I_{d 4 A}=$ $I_{d 4}=-I_{\text {TAIL }}$. The current flowing into the load capacitor $C_{L}$ is

$$
I_{o}=-I_{d 2 A}-I_{d 4 A}=-0-\left(-I_{\mathrm{TAIL}}\right)=I_{\mathrm{TAIL}}
$$

Therefore the positive output slew rate is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d V_{o}}{d t}=\frac{I_{o}}{C_{L}}=\frac{I_{\mathrm{TAIL}}}{C_{L}} \tag{9.143}
\end{equation*}
$$

Application of a large negative input forces $M_{1}$ into cutoff so $I_{\text {TAIL }}$ must flow through $M_{2}$. Therefore, $I_{d 4 A}=I_{d 4}=I_{d 3}=0$ and $I_{d 2 A}=I_{d 2}=I_{\text {TAIL }}$. The current $I_{o}$ flowing through $C_{L}$ is

$$
I_{o}=-I_{d 2 A}-I_{d 4 A}=-I_{\mathrm{TAIL}}-0=-I_{\mathrm{TAIL}}
$$

- Hence, the negative slew rate is the opposite of the value in (9.143), $-I_{\text {TAIL }} / C_{L}$.

Figure 9.55 An op amp with capacitive load and feedback. This is the switchedcapacitor integrator of Fig. 6.10 $a$ during $\phi_{2}$, assuming ideal MOS switches.

CMOS op amps are often used without an output stage when the output loading is purely capacitive, as is the case in switched-capacitor circuits. Avoiding an output stage saves power and is possible because low-output resistance is not needed to drive a capacitive load. An example of such a circuit is the switched-capacitor integrator shown in Fig. 6.10a. This circuit is redrawn in Fig. 9.55 when clock phase $\phi_{2}$ is high and $\phi_{1}$ is low, assuming that MOS transistors $M_{1}-M_{4}$ behave like ideal switches. The additional capacitor $C_{i p}$ here models the total parasitic capacitance at the op-amp input and includes the input capacitance of the op amp. A question that arises is: "For the feedback circuit in Fig. 9.55, what value of output load capacitance should be used to compute the slew rate for a single-stage op amp?" When the op amp is slewing, its behavior is nonlinear. Therefore the feedback is not effective and the virtual ground at the negative op-amp input is lost. With the feedback loop broken, the total capacitance seen from the output to ground is

$$
\begin{equation*}
C_{L}+C_{I} \|\left(C_{S}+C_{i p}\right) \tag{9.144}
\end{equation*}
$$

This is the capacitance seen looking from the op-amp output node to ground, with the connection to the op-amp inverting input replaced with an open circuit. The effective output load capacitance in (9.144) is the same as the output load found when the feedback loop is broken to find the return ratio.

For the CMOS op amps considered so far in this section, the slew rate is proportional to a bias current in the op amp. A CMOS op amp with a Class AB input stage can give a slew rate that is not limited by a dc bias current in the op amp. An example ${ }^{22,23}$ is shown in Fig. 9.56. The input voltage is applied between the gates of $M_{1}, M_{2}$ and $M_{3}, M_{4}$. Transistors $M_{1}$ and $M_{4}$ act simply as unity-gain source followers to transfer the input voltage to the gates of $M_{6}$ and $M_{7}$. Diodeconnected transistors $M_{5}$ and $M_{8}$ act as level shifts, which, together with bias current sources $I_{1}$, set the quiescent Class AB current in $M_{2}, M_{3}, M_{6}$, and $M_{7}$. The currents in $M_{3}$ and $M_{7}$ are delivered to the output via cascode current mirrors $M_{9}, M_{10}, M_{13}, M_{14}$ and $M_{11}, M_{12}, M_{15}, M_{16}$. Bias currents can be determined by assuming that the input voltage $V_{i}=0$, giving

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{G S 1}+\left|V_{G S 5}\right|=\left|V_{G S 6}\right|+V_{G S 3} \tag{9.145}
\end{equation*}
$$

Assuming that (1.157) is valid we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{t n}+\sqrt{2 \frac{I_{1}}{k_{n}^{\prime}}\left(\frac{L}{W}\right)_{1}}+\left|V_{t p}\right|+\sqrt{2 \frac{I_{1}}{k_{p}^{\prime}}\left(\frac{L}{W}\right)_{5}}=\left|V_{t p}\right|+\sqrt{2 \frac{I_{B}}{k_{P}^{\prime}}\left(\frac{L}{W}\right)_{6}}+V_{t n}+\sqrt{2 \frac{I_{B}}{k_{n}^{\prime}}\left(\frac{L}{W}\right)_{3}} \tag{9.146}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $I_{B}=\left|I_{D 6}\right|=I_{D 3}=I_{D 2}=\left|I_{D 7}\right|$ is the bias current and subscripts $n$ and $p$ indicate NMOS and PMOS, respectively. The two sides of the input stage are assumed symmetrical. From (9.146) we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
\sqrt{I_{B}}\left[\sqrt{\frac{2}{k_{p}^{\prime}}\left(\frac{L}{W}\right)_{6}}+\sqrt{\frac{2}{k_{n}^{\prime}}\left(\frac{L}{W}\right)_{3}}\right]=\sqrt{I_{1}}\left[\sqrt{\frac{2}{k_{p}^{\prime}}\left(\frac{L}{W}\right)_{5}}+\sqrt{\frac{2}{k_{n}^{\prime}}\left(\frac{L}{W}\right)_{1}}\right] \tag{9.147}
\end{equation*}
$$

Equation 9.147 is the design equation for the input-stage bias current $I_{B}$.

Figure 9.56 CMOS amplifier with a Class AB input stage.

Assuming that the cascode current mirrors in Fig. 9.56 have unity current gain, the bias currents in $M_{9}-M_{16}$ all equal $I_{B}$. To analyze this circuit, we will connect a voltage $V_{i}$ to the noninverting op-amp input and ground the inverting op-amp input. If a positive $V_{i}$ is applied, the magnitude of the currents in $M_{3}$ and $M_{6}$ increase, while the magnitude of the currents in $M_{2}$ and $M_{7}$ decrease. When mirrored to the output, these changes drive $I_{o}$ and $V_{o}$ positive. To calculate the small-signal gain, we neglect body effect. We can consider $M_{6}$ to act as source degeneration for $M_{3}$. The resistance looking into the source of $M_{6}$ is $1 / g_{m 6}$, thus

$$
\begin{equation*}
i_{d 3}=\frac{g_{m 3}}{1+\frac{g_{m 3}}{g_{m 6}}} v_{i} \tag{9.148}
\end{equation*}
$$

Similarly, $M_{2}$ acts as source degeneration for $M_{7}$, so

$$
\begin{equation*}
i_{d 7}=\frac{g_{m 7}}{1+\frac{g_{m 7}}{g_{m 2}}} v_{i}=\frac{g_{m 2}}{1+\frac{g_{m 2}}{g_{m 7}}} v_{i} \tag{9.149}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the right-most expression is found by rearranging. Thus, the transconductance of the amplifier is

$$
\begin{equation*}
G_{m}=\left.\frac{i_{o}}{v_{i}}\right|_{v_{o}=0}=\frac{i_{d 3}+i_{d 7}}{v_{i}}=\frac{2 g_{m 3}}{1+\frac{g_{m 3}}{g_{m 6}}} \tag{9.150}
\end{equation*}
$$

using $g_{m 2}=g_{m 3}$ and $g_{m 6}=g_{m 7}$. If $g_{m 3}=g_{m 6}$, then $G_{m}=g_{m 3}$.

The output resistance of this op amp is just the output resistance of the cascodes in parallel and is

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{o} \approx\left(r_{o 14} g_{m 14} r_{o 13}\right) \|\left(r_{o 15} g_{m 15} r_{o 16}\right) \tag{9.151}
\end{equation*}
$$

Finally, the small-signal voltage gain is

$$
\begin{equation*}
A_{v}=G_{m} R_{o} \tag{9.152}
\end{equation*}
$$

The small-signal analysis above showed that a small positive $V_{i}$ causes a positive $I_{o}$. If $V_{i}$ continues to increase beyond the small-signal linear range of the input stage, $M_{2}$ and $M_{7}$ will be cut off, while $M_{3}$ and $M_{6}$ will be driven to larger values of $\left|V_{g s}\right|$. The currents in $M_{3}$ and $M_{6}$ can increase to quite large values, which gives a correspondingly large positive $I_{o}$. For large negative values of $V_{i}, M_{3}$ and $M_{6}$ turn off, $M_{2}$ and $M_{7}$ conduct large currents, and $I_{o}$ becomes large negative. Thus this circuit is capable of supplying large positive and negative currents to a load capacitance, and the magnitude of these output currents can be much larger than the bias current $I_{B}$ in the input stage. Therefore, this op amp does not display slew-rate limiting in the usual sense.

One disadvantage of this structure is that about half the transistors turn completely off during slewing. As a result, the time required to turn these transistors back on can be an important limitation to the high-frequency performance. To overcome this problem, the op amp can be designed so that the minimum drain currents are set to a nonzero value. ${ }^{24}$

### 9.6.5 Effect of Slew-Rate Limitations on Large-Signal Sinusoidal Performance

The slew-rate limitations described above can also affect the performance of the circuit when handling large sinusoidal signals at higher frequencies. Consider the circuit of Fig. 9.48 with a large sinusoidal signal applied as shown in Fig. 9.57a. Since the circuit is connected as a voltage follower, the output voltage $V_{o}$ will be forced to follow the $V_{i}$ waveform. The maximum value of $d V_{i} / d t$ occurs as the waveform crosses the axis, and if $V_{i}$ is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{i}=\hat{V}_{i} \sin \omega t \tag{9.153}
\end{equation*}
$$

then

$$
\frac{d V_{i}}{d t}=\omega \hat{V}_{i} \cos \omega t
$$

and

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left.\frac{d V_{i}}{d t}\right|_{\max }=\omega \hat{V}_{i} \tag{9.154}
\end{equation*}
$$

As long as the value of $d V_{i} /\left.d t\right|_{\max }$ given by (9.154) is less than the slew-rate limit, the output voltage will closely follow the input. However, if the product $\omega \hat{V}_{i}$ is greater than the slew-rate limit, the output voltage will be unable to follow the input, and waveform distortion of the kind shown in Fig. $9.57 b$ will result. If a sine wave with $\hat{V}_{i}$ equal to the supply voltage is applied to the amplifier, slew limiting will eventually occur as the sine-wave frequency is increased. The frequency at which this occurs is called the full-power bandwidth of the circuit. (In practice, a value of $\hat{V}_{i}$ slightly less than the supply voltage is used to avoid clipping distortion of the type described in Chapter 5.)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_07_c6361d8e0343487b8e82g-093.jpg?height=952&width=651&top_left_y=198&top_left_x=258)

Figure 9.57 (a) Large sinusoidal input voltage applied to the circuit of Fig. 9.48. (b) Output voltage resulting from input (a) showing slew limiting.

EXAMPLE
Calculate the full-power bandwidth of the NE5234. Use $\hat{V}_{i}=1$ V. From (9.154) put

$$
\omega \hat{V}_{i}=\text { slew rate }
$$

Using the slew rate of $0.68 \mathrm{~V} / \mathrm{\mu s}$ found in simulation gives

$$
\omega=\frac{0.68 \mathrm{~V} / \mu \mathrm{s}}{1 \mathrm{~V}}=680 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}
$$

Thus

$$
f=110 \mathrm{kHz}
$$

This means that a NE5234 op amp with a sinusoidal output of 1 V amplitude will begin to show slew-limiting distortion if the frequency exceeds 110 kHz .

## APPENDIX

### A.9.1 ANALYSIS IN TERMS OF RETURN-RATIO PARAMETERS

Much of the analysis in this chapter is based on the ideal block diagram in Fig. 9.1. This block diagram includes the forward gain $a$ and feedback $f$, which are the parameters used in two-port analysis of feedback circuits in Chapter 8. The resulting closed-loop gain expression is

$$
\begin{equation*}
A=\frac{a}{1+T}=\frac{a}{1+a f} \tag{9.155}
\end{equation*}
$$

The block diagram from return-ratio analysis in Fig. 8.42 is the same as Fig. 9.1 if $a$ is replaced by $b, f$ is replaced by $1 / A_{\infty}$, and the direct feedforward $d$ is negligible. (The contribution of feedforward through the feedback network to $a$ is also neglected in the analysis in Sections 9.2-9.5, since feedforward introduces one or more zeros into $a(s)$, but only oneand two-pole $a(s)$ are considered in these sections. Neglecting the feedforward in $a$ or the direct feedthrough $d$ is reasonable if its effect is negligible at and below the frequency where the magnitude of the loop transmission falls to 1.) The corresponding equations from return-ratio analysis are

$$
\begin{equation*}
A=\frac{b}{1+\mathscr{R}}+\frac{d}{1+\mathscr{R}} \approx \frac{b}{1+\mathscr{R}}=\frac{b}{1+\frac{b}{A_{\infty}}} \tag{9.156}
\end{equation*}
$$

For the circuit in Fig. 8.24, $0 \leq 1 / A_{\infty} \leq 1$, and $b$ is positive at low frequencies. Therefore, the equations, graphs, and relationships in Sections $9.2-9.5$ can be expressed in terms of the return-ratio variables by making the following substitutions:

$$
\begin{align*}
& a \rightarrow b  \tag{9.157a}\\
& f \rightarrow 1 / A_{\infty}  \tag{9.157b}\\
& T \rightarrow \mathscr{R}  \tag{9.157c}\\
& a f \rightarrow b / A_{\infty} \tag{9.157d}
\end{align*}
$$

The return ratio can be used to check stability of an amplifier with a single feedback loop because $A_{\infty}$ and $d$ are stable transfer functions associated with passive networks, and $\mathscr{R}(s)$ is stable because it is the signal transfer around a loop that consists of one gain stage or a cascade of stable gain stages. Therefore the zeros of $1+\mathscr{R}(s)$, which are poles of the closed-loop gain $A$, determine the stability of the feedback circuit. ${ }^{25}$ From the Nyquist stability criterion, these zeros are in the left half-plane if a polar plot of $\mathscr{R}(j \omega)$ does not encircle the point $(-1,0)$. In most cases, this stability condition is equivalent to having a positive phase margin. The phase margin is measured at the frequency where $|\Re(j \omega)|=1$.

Since the equations for two-port and return-ratio analyses are not identical, $T(s)$ and $\mathscr{R}(s)$ may be different for a given circuit. ${ }^{26}$ In general, the phase margins using $T$ and $\mathscr{R}$ may differ, but both will have the same sign and therefore will agree on the stability of the feedback circuit.

### A.9.2 ROOTS OF A QUADRATIC EQUATION

A second-order polynomial often appears in the denominator or numerator of a transfer function, and the zeros of this polynomial are the poles or zeros of the transfer function. In this appendix, the relationships between the zeros of a quadratic and its coefficients are explored for a few specific cases of interest. Also, the conditions under which a dominant root exists are derived.

Consider the roots of the quadratic equation

$$
\begin{equation*}
a s^{2}+b s+c=0 \tag{9.158}
\end{equation*}
$$

The two roots of this equation, $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$, are given by the quadratic formula:

$$
\begin{equation*}
r_{1,2}=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a} \tag{9.159}
\end{equation*}
$$

where it is understood that the square root of a positive quantity is positive. Factoring $b$ out of the square root and rearranging gives

$$
\begin{align*}
r_{1,2} & =-\frac{b}{2 a}\left(1 \pm \sqrt{1-\frac{4 a c}{b^{2}}}\right)  \tag{9.160a}\\
& =-\frac{b}{2 a}(1 \pm \sqrt{D}) \tag{9.160b}
\end{align*}
$$

The quantity under the square root in (9.160a) has been replaced by $D$ in (9.160b), where

$$
\begin{equation*}
D=1-\frac{4 a c}{b^{2}} \tag{9.161}
\end{equation*}
$$

Now, consider the locations of the roots if coefficients $a, b$, and $c$ all have the same sign. In this case, both roots are in the left half-plane (LHP), as will be shown next. First, note that if all the coefficients have the same sign, then

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{b}{2 a}>0 \tag{9.162}
\end{equation*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{4 a c}{b^{2}}>0 \tag{9.163}
\end{equation*}
$$

Let us divide (9.163) into two different regions. First, if

$$
\begin{equation*}
0<\frac{4 a c}{b^{2}} \leq 1 \tag{9.164}
\end{equation*}
$$

then $D$ will be positive and less than one. Therefore, $\sqrt{D}<1$, so $1+\sqrt{D}$ and $1-\sqrt{D}$ are both positive. As a result, the roots are both negative and real, because $-b / 2 a<0$.

Now, consider the other region for (9.163), which is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{4 a c}{b^{2}}>1 \tag{9.165}
\end{equation*}
$$

In this case, $D<0$; therefore $\sqrt{D}$ is imaginary. The roots are complex conjugates with a real part of $-b / 2 a$, which is negative. So the roots are again in the LHP. Therefore, when coefficients $a, b$, and $c$ all have the same sign, both roots are in the LHP.

Next, consider the locations of the roots if coefficients $a$ and $b$ have the same sign and $c$ has a different sign. In this case, one real root is in the right half-plane (RHP) and the other is in the LHP. To prove this, first note from (9.161) that $D>1$ here because $4 a c / b^{2}<0$. Therefore both roots are real and $\sqrt{D}>1$, so

$$
\begin{equation*}
1+\sqrt{D}>0 \tag{9.166a}
\end{equation*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{equation*}
1-\sqrt{D}<0 \tag{9.166b}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substituting into (9.160), one root will be positive and the other negative (the sign of $-b / 2 a$ is negative here).

Finally, let us consider the conditions under which LHP roots are real and widely spaced. From (9.160), real LHP roots are widely spaced if

$$
\begin{equation*}
-\frac{b}{2 a}(1+\sqrt{D}) \ll-\frac{b}{2 a}(1-\sqrt{D}) \tag{9.167}
\end{equation*}
$$

or

$$
\begin{equation*}
1+\sqrt{D} \gg 1-\sqrt{D} \tag{9.168}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substituting the expression for $D$ in (9.161) into (9.168) and simplifying leads to an equivalent condition for widely spaced roots, which is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{4 a c}{b^{2}} \ll 1 \tag{9.169}
\end{equation*}
$$

Under this condition, one root is

$$
\begin{equation*}
r_{2}=-\frac{b}{2 a}(1+\sqrt{D}) \approx-\frac{b}{2 a}(1+1)=-\frac{b}{a} \tag{9.170a}
\end{equation*}
$$

The other root is

$$
\begin{align*}
r_{1} & =-\frac{b}{2 a}(1-\sqrt{D}) \\
& =-\frac{b}{2 a}\left(1-\sqrt{1-\frac{4 a c}{b^{2}}}\right)  \tag{9.170b}\\
& \approx-\frac{b}{2 a}\left(1-\left(1-\frac{4 a c}{2 b^{2}}\right)\right) \\
& =-\frac{c}{b}
\end{align*}
$$

where the approximation

$$
\begin{equation*}
\sqrt{1-x} \approx 1-\frac{x}{2} \quad \text { for } \quad|x| \ll 1 \tag{9.171}
\end{equation*}
$$

has been used. Here, $\left|r_{1}\right| \ll\left|r_{2}\right|$ because $\left|r_{1}\right| \approx c / b \ll b / a \approx\left|r_{2}\right|$ (which follows from $\left.4 a c / b^{2} \ll 1\right)$. If these roots are poles, $r_{1}$ corresponds to the dominant pole, and $r_{2}$ gives the nondominant pole. Equations 9.170a and 9.170 b are in agreement with (9.30) through (9.33).

Table 9.1 summarizes the location of the roots of (9.158) for the cases considered in this appendix. When both roots are in the LHP, the roots are both real if (9.164) is satisfied. These roots are widely spaced if (9.169) is satisfied.
