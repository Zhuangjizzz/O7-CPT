The pole starts at $p_{1}$ for $T_{0}=0$ and moves along the negative real axis as $T_{0}$ becomes positive.

The reduction in gain that occurs is compensated by incorporating additional gain stages, which are typically also feedback amplifiers.\n\nLet us now explore the impact of feedback on the pole of the overall transfer function $A(s)$. It is evident from (9.3) that as the low-frequency loop gain $T_{0}$ increases, the magnitude of the pole of $A(s)$ also increases. This is illustrated in Fig. 9.3, which depicts the locus of the pole of $A(s)$ in the $s$ plane as $T_{0}$ varies. The pole begins at $p_{1}$ for $T_{0}=0$ and moves along the negative real axis as $T_{0}$ becomes positive.

    "text": "In our simplified example, we considered an amplifier with a single-pole transfer function, which is a reasonable approximation for internally compensated general-purpose op amps in practice. However, many amplifiers exhibit multipole transfer functions, leading to deviations from our simplified results. Compensation techniques address these deviations, as we will discuss later.\n\nLet's examine an amplifier with a three-pole transfer function:\n\n$$\na(s)=\\frac{a_{0}}{\\left(1-\\frac{s}{p_{1}}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{s}{p_{2}}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{s}{p_{3}}\\right)} \\tag{9.6}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\left|p_{1}\\right|,\\left|p_{2}\\right|$, and $\\left|p_{3}\\right|$ represent the pole magnitudes in rad/s. The poles are depicted in the $s$ plane in Fig. 9.4, and the gain magnitude $|a(j \\omega)|$ and phase $\\mathrm{ph} a(j \\omega)$ are plotted against frequency in Fig. 9.5, assuming a factor of 10 separation between the poles. Only asymptotes are shown for the magnitude plot. \n\nFig. 9.4 illustrates the poles of an amplifier in the $s$ plane, providing a visual representation of the poles, which are crucial for understanding the frequency response and stability of the amplifier circuit described by the transfer function.\n\nFigures 9.4 and 9.5 together offer a comprehensive view of the frequency response of a circuit with a three-pole transfer function, illustrating how both the gain and phase respond to changes in frequency.\n\nWhen this amplifier is connected in a feedback loop as shown in Fig. 9.1, with $f$ being a positive constant, the loop gain $T(j \\omega)=a(j \\omega) f$ will exhibit the same frequency variation as $a(j \\omega)$. A plot of $a f(j \\omega)=T(j \\omega)$ in magnitude and phase on a polar plot (with $\\omega$ as a parameter) can be constructed using the data from Fig. 9.5 and the magnitude of $f$. Such a plot, as shown in Fig. 9.6 (not to scale), is known as a Nyquist diagram. The frequency variable ranges from $\\omega=-\\infty$ to $\\omega=\\infty$. At $\\omega=0$, $|T(j \\omega)|=T_{0}$ and ph $T(j \\omega)=0$, with the curve starting on the real axis at an intercept of $T_{0}$. As $\\omega$ increases, $|a(j \\omega)|$ decreases, and ph $a(j \\omega)$ becomes negative, placing the plot in the fourth quadrant. As $\\omega \\rightarrow \\infty$, ph $a(j \\omega) \\rightarrow-270^{\\circ}$ and $|a(j \\omega)| \\rightarrow 0$. Thus, the plot is asymptotic to the origin and tangent to the imaginary axis. At the frequency $\\omega_{180}$, the phase is $-180^{\\circ}$, and the curve crosses the negative real axis. If $\\left|a\\left(j \\omega_{180}\\right) f\\right|>1$ at this point, the Nyquist diagram will encircle the point $(-1,0)$, as shown, and this has particular significance, as will now become apparent.\n\nThe Nyquist criterion for stability of the amplifier can be summarized as follows: \"For a feedback amplifier with a stable $T(s)$ (i.e., all poles of $T(s)$ are in the left half-plane), if the Nyquist plot of $T(j \\omega)$ encircles the point $(-1,0)$, the feedback amplifier is unstable.\"\n\nThis criterion is essentially a mathematical test for poles of the transfer function $A(s)$ in the right half-plane. If the Nyquist plot encircles the point $(-1,0)$, the amplifier has poles in the right half-plane, and the circuit will oscillate. In fact, the number of encirclements of the point $(-1,0)$ indicates the number of right half-plane poles. The significance of poles in the right half-plane can be seen by considering a circuit with a pair of complex poles at $\\left(\\sigma_{1} \\pm j \\omega_{1}\\right)$ where $\\sigma_{1}$ is positive. The transient response of the circuit then contains a term $K_{1} \\exp \\sigma_{1} t \\sin \\omega_{1} t$, which represents a growing sinusoid if $\\sigma_{1}$ is positive. This term is present even in the absence of further input, indicating an unstable or oscillatory circuit behavior.\n\nThe significance of the point $(-1,0)$ can be understood by assuming that the Nyquist diagram passes through this point. Then, at the frequency $\\omega_{180}$, $T(j \\omega)=a(j \\omega) f=-1$ and $A(j \\omega)=\\infty$ using (9.2) in the frequency domain. The feedback amplifier is thus calculated to have an infinite forward gain, signaling the onset of instability and oscillation. This situation corresponds to poles of $A(s)$ on the $j \\omega$ axis in the $s$ plane. If $T_{0}$ is increased by increasing $a_{0}$ or $f$, the Nyquist diagram expands linearly and then encircles $(-1,0)$. This corresponds to poles of $A(s)$ in the right half-plane, as shown in Fig. 9.7.\n\nFrom this criterion for stability, a simpler test can be derived that is useful in most common cases: \"If $|T(j \\omega)|>1$ at the frequency where ph $T(j \\omega)=-180^{\\circ}$, then the amplifier is unstable.\" The validity of this criterion for the example considered here is evident from an inspection of Fig. 9.6 and application application of the Nyquist criterion.\n\nTo investigate the effect of feedback on the stability of an amplifier, consider the three-pole amplifier with the gain function given by (9.6) placed in a negative-feedback loop with $f$ constant. The gain (in decibels) and phase of the amplifier are shown again in Fig. 9.8, along with the quantity $20 \\log _{10} 1 / f$. The value of $20 \\log _{10} 1 / f$ is approximately equal to the low-frequency gain in decibels with feedback applied, since\n\n$$\nA_{0}=\\frac{a_{0}}{1+a_{0} f} \\tag{9.7}\n$$\n\nand thus\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{f} \\approx A_{0} \\tag{9.8}\n$$\n\nif\n\n$$\nT_{0}=a_{0} f \\gg 1\n$$\n\nThe vertical distance between the curve of $20 \\log _{10}|a(j \\omega)|$ and the line $20 \\log _{10} 1 / f$ in Fig. 9.8 is a direct measure in decibels of the loop-gain magnitude, $|T(j \\omega)|$. The point where the curve of $20 \\log _{10}|a(j \\omega)|$ intersects the line $20 \\log _{10} 1 / f$ is where the loop-gain magnitude $|T(j \\omega)|$ is 0 dB or unity, and the curve of $|a(j \\omega)|$ in decibels in Fig. 9.8 can be considered a curve of $|T(j \\omega)|$ in decibels if the dotted line at $20 \\log _{10} 1 / f$ is taken as the new zero axis.\n\nThe simple example of Section 9.1 showed that the gain curve versus frequency with feedback applied $\\left(20 \\log _{10}|A(j \\omega)|\\right)$ follows the $20 \\log _{10} A_{0}$ line until it intersects the gain curve $20 \\log _{10}|a(j \\omega)|$. At higher frequencies, the curve $20 \\log _{10}|A(j \\omega)|$ simply follows the curve of $20 \\log _{10}|a(j \\omega)|$ for the basic amplifier. This is because at higher frequencies, the loop gain $|T(j \\omega)| \\rightarrow 0$, and feedback has no influence on the gain of the amplifier.\n\nFig. 9.8 shows that the loop-gain magnitude $|T(j \\omega)|$ is unity at frequency $\\omega_{0}$. At this frequency, the phase of $T(j \\omega)$ has not reached $-180^{\\circ}$ for the case shown, and using the modified Nyquist criterion stated above, we conclude that this feedback loop is stable. Obviously, $|T(j \\omega)|<1$ at the frequency where $\\mathrm{ph} T(j \\omega)=-180^{\\circ}$. If the polar Nyquist diagram is sketched for this example, it does not encircle the point $(-1,0)$.\n\nAs $|T(j \\omega)|$ approaches unity at the frequency where ph $T(j \\omega)=-180^{\\circ}$, the amplifier has a smaller margin of stability, which can be specified in two ways. The most common is the phase margin, defined as follows:\n\nPhase margin $=180^{\\circ}+(\\mathrm{ph} T(j \\omega)$ at frequency where $|T(j \\omega)|=1)$. The phase margin is indicated in Fig. 9.8 and must be greater than $0^{\\circ}$ for stability.\n\nAnother measure of stability is the gain margin, defined as $1 /|T(j \\omega)|$ in decibels at the frequency where ph $T(j \\omega)=-180^{\\circ}$, which must be greater than 0 dB for stability.\n\nThe significance of the phase-margin magnitude is now explored. For the feedback amplifier considered in Section 9.1, where the basic amplifier has a single-pole response, the phase margin is obviously $90^{\\circ}$ if the low-frequency loop gain is reasonably large. This is illustrated in Fig. 9.9 and results in a very stable amplifier. A typical lower allowable limit for the phase margin in practice is $45^{\\circ}$, with a value of $60^{\\circ}$ being more common.\n\nConsider a feedback amplifier with a phase margin of $45^{\\circ}$ and a feedback function $f$ that is real (and thus constant). Then\n\n$$\n\\text { ph } T\\left(j \\omega_{0}\\right)=-135^{\\circ} \\tag{9.11}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\omega_{0}$ is the frequency defined by\n\n$$\n\\left|T\\left(j \\omega_{0}\\right)\\right|=1 \\tag{9.12}\n$$\n\nNow, $\\left|T\\left(j \\omega_{0}\\right)\\right|=\\left|a\\left(j \\omega_{0}\\right) f\\right|=1$ implies that\n\n$$\n\\left|a\\left(j \\omega_{0}\\right)\\right|=\\frac{1}{f} \\tag{9.13}\n$$\n\nassuming that $f$ is positive real.\n\nThe overall gain is\n\n$$\nA(j \\omega)=\\frac{a(j \\omega)}{1+T(j \\omega)} \\tag{9.14}\n$$\n\nSubstituting (9.11) and (9.12) in (9.14) gives\n\n$$\nA\\left(j \\omega_{0}\\right)=\\frac{a\\left(j \\omega_{0}\\right)}{1+e^{-j 135^{\\circ}}}=\\frac{a\\left(j \\omega_{0}\\right)}{1-0.7-0.7 j}=\\frac{a\\left(j \\omega_{0}\\right)}{0.3-0.7 j}\n$$\n\nand thus\n\n$$\n\\left|A\\left(j \\omega_{0}\\right)\\right|=\\frac{\\left|a\\left(j \\omega_{0}\\right)\\right|}{0.76}=\\frac{1.3}{f} \\tag{9.15}\n$$\n\nusing (9.13). The frequency $\\omega_{0}$, where $\\left|T\\left(j \\omega_{0}\\right)\\right|=1$, is the nominal $-3-\\mathrm{dB}$ point for a single-pole basic amplifier, but in this case, there is $2.4 \\mathrm{~dB}(1.3 \\times)$ of peaking above the low-frequency gain of $1 / f$.\n\nConsider a phase margin of $60^{\\circ}$. At the frequency $\\omega_{0}$ in this case\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{ph} T\\left(j \\omega_{0}\\right)=-120^{\\circ} \\tag{9.16}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\left|T\\left(j \\omega_{0}\\right)\\right|=1 \\tag{9.17}\n$$\n\nFollowing a similar analysis, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\left|A\\left(j \\omega_{0}\\right)\\right|=\\frac{1}{f}\n$$\n\nIn this case, there is no peaking at $\\omega=\\omega_{0}$, but there has also been no gain reduction at this frequency.\n\nFinally, the case where the phase margin is $90^{\\circ}$ can be similarly calculated. In this case\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{ph} T\\left(j \\omega_{0}\\right)=-90^{\\circ} \\tag{9.18}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\left|T\\left(j \\omega_{0}\\right)\\right|=1 \\tag{9.19}\n$$\n\nA similar analysis gives\n\n$$\n\\left|A\\left(j \\omega_{0}\\right)\\right|=\\frac{0.7}{f} \\tag{9.20}\n$$\n\nAs expected, in this case, the gain at frequency $\\omega_{0}$ is 3 dB below the midband value.\n\nThese results are illustrated in Fig. 9.10, where the normalized overall gain versus frequency is shown for various phase margins. The plots are drawn assuming the response is dominated by the first two poles of the transfer function, except for the case of the $90^{\\circ}$ phase margin, which has one pole only. As the phase margin diminishes, the gain peak becomes larger until the gain approaches infinity and oscillation occurs for a phase margin of $0^{\\circ}$. The gain peak usually occurs close to the frequency where $|T(j \\omega)|=1$, but for a phase margin of $60^{\\circ}$, there is 0.2 dB of peaking just below this frequency. Note that after the peak, the gain curves approach an asymptote of $-12 \\mathrm{~dB} /$ octave for phase margins other than $90^{\\circ}$. This is because the open-loop gain falls at -12 dB/octave due to the presence of two poles in the transfer function.\n\nThe simple tests for stability of a feedback amplifier (i.e., positive phase and gain margins) can only be applied when the phase and gain margins are uniquely defined. The phase margin is uniquely defined if there is only one frequency at which the magnitude of the loop gain equals one. Similarly, the gain margin is uniquely defined if there is only one frequency at which the phase of the loop gain equals $-180^{\\circ}$. In most feedback circuits, these margins are uniquely defined. However, if either of these margins is not uniquely defined, then stability should be checked using a Nyquist diagram and the Nyquist criterion.\n\nThe loop gain $T=a f$ can be examined to determine the stability of a feedback circuit, as explained in this section. Alternatively, these measures of stability can be applied to the return ratio $\\mathscr{R}$, as explained in Appendix A9.1. Techniques for simulating $\\mathscr{R}^{2-5}$ and $T=a f^{4}$ using SPICE have been developed, based on methods for measuring loop transmission. These techniques measure the loop transmission at the closed-loop dc operating point. An advantage of SPICE simulation of the loop transmission is that parasitics that might have an important effect are included. For example, parasitic capacitance at the op-amp input introduces frequency dependence in the feedback network in Fig. 8.24, which may degrade the phase margin."

The curves demonstrate how the gain varies with frequency, peaking at different levels depending on the phase margin and then decreasing beyond the unity gain frequency.\n\nThe loop gain $T=a f$ can be examined to determine the stability of a feedback circuit.

Techniques for simulating $\\mathscr{R}^{2-5}$ and $T=a f^{4}$ using SPICE have been developed, based on methods for measuring loop transmission. These techniques measure the loop transmission at the closed-loop dc operating point. An advantage of SPICE simulation of the loop transmission is that parasitics that might have an important effect are included.

The plot is presented on a logarithmic scale for frequency, denoted as \\( \\omega \\), on the horizontal axis, and the phase angle \\( \\text{Ph} \\, a(j\\omega) \\) in degrees on the vertical axis.\n\n**Axes and Units:**\n- **Horizontal Axis:** Frequency \\( \\omega \\) (logarithmic scale)\n- **Vertical Axis:** Phase angle \\( \\text{Ph} \\, a(j\\omega) \\) in degrees\n\n**Behavior and Trends:**\nThe phase plot exhibits a decreasing trend as frequency increases.

The progressive decrease in phase at each pole mirrors the cumulative impact of each pole on the system's phase response.\n\nFigure 9.5 Gain and phase versus frequency for a circuit with a three-pole transfer function.\n\nThe gain magnitude $|a(j \\omega)|$ and phase $\\mathrm{ph} a(j \\omega)$ are plotted versus frequency, assuming a factor of 10 separation between the poles. Only asymptotes are shown for the magnitude plot. At frequencies above the first pole magnitude $\\left|p_{1}\\right|$, the plot of $|a(j \\omega)|$ falls at $6 \\mathrm{~dB} /$ octave and $\\mathrm{ph} a(j \\omega)$ approaches $-90^{\\circ}$. Above $\\left|p_{2}\\right|$ these become 12 $\\mathrm{dB} /$ octave and $-180^{\\circ}$, and above $\\left|p_{3}\\right|$ they become $18 \\mathrm{~dB} /$ octave and $-270^{\\circ}$. The frequency where $\\mathrm{ph} a(j \\omega)=-180^{\\circ}$ is of particular significance and is marked $\\omega_{180}$, and the value of $|a(j \\omega)|$ at this frequency is $a_{180}$. If the three poles are fairly widely spaced (by a factor of 10 or more), the phase shifts at frequencies $\\left|p_{1}\\right|,\\left|p_{2}\\right|$, and $\\left|p_{3}\\right|$ are approximately $-45^{\\circ},-135^{\\circ}$, and $-225^{\\circ}$, respectively. This will now be assumed for simplicity. In addition, the gain magnitude will be assumed to follow the asymptotic curve, and the impact of these assumptions in practical scenarios will be examined later.\n\nNow, consider this amplifier integrated into a feedback loop as depicted in Figure 9.1, with $f$ representing a positive constant. Given that $f$ is constant, the loop gain $T(j \\omega)=a(j \\omega) f$ will mirror the frequency variation of $a(j \\omega)$. A plot of $a f(j \\omega)=T(j \\omega)$ in terms of magnitude and phase on a polar plot (with $\\omega$ as a parameter) can be constructed using the data from Figure 9.5 and the magnitude of $f$. An example of such a plot is presented in Figure 9.6 (not to scale) and is referred to as a Nyquist diagram. The variable on the curve is frequency and ranges from $\\omega=-\\infty$ to $\\omega=\\infty$. At $\\omega=0$, $|T(j \\omega)|=T_{0}$ and ph $T(j \\omega)=0$, with the curve commencing at the point $T_{0}$ on the real axis. As $\\omega$ increases, as depicted in Figure 9.5, $|a(j \\omega)|$ diminishes and ph $a(j \\omega)$ becomes negative, placing the plot in the fourth quadrant. As $\\omega \\rightarrow \\infty$, ph $a(j \\omega) \\rightarrow-270^{\\circ}$ and $|a(j \\omega)| \\rightarrow 0$. Consequently, the plot approaches the origin asymptotically and is tangent to the imaginary axis. At the frequency $\\omega_{180}$, the phase is $-180^{\\circ}$, and the curve crosses the negative real axis. If $\\left|a\\left(j \\omega_{180}\\right) f\\right|>1$ at this juncture, the Nyquist diagram will encircle the point $(-1,0)$, as illustrated, and this bears particular significance, as will become evident.\n\nThe Nyquist criterion for stability of the amplifier can be succinctly stated as follows:\n\"Assume a feedback amplifier with a stable $T(s)$ (i.e., all poles of $T(s)$ reside in the left half-plane). If the Nyquist plot of $T(j \\omega)$ encircles the point $(-1,0)$, the feedback amplifier is deemed unstable.\"\n\nThis criterion essentially serves as a mathematical probe for poles of the transfer function $A(s)$ in the right half-plane. Encirclement of the point $(-1,0)$ by the Nyquist plot indicates the presence of poles in the right half-plane, leading to oscillation. In fact, the number of encirclements of the point $(-1,0)$ directly corresponds to the number of right half-plane poles; in this example, there are two. The implications of right half-plane poles can be observed by supposing a circuit harbors a pair of complex poles at $\\left(\\sigma_{1} \\pm j \\omega_{1}\\right)$, where $\\sigma_{1}$ is positive. The transient response of the circuit would then encompass a term $K_{1} \\exp \\sigma_{1} t \\sin \\omega_{1} t$, signifying a growing sinusoid if $\\sigma_{1}$ is positive. ( $K_{1}$ denotes a constant reflecting initial conditions.) This term persists even in the absence of further input, characterizing the circuit as unstable or oscillatory.\n\nThe significance of the point $(-1,0)$ becomes apparent if the Nyquist diagram is assumed to traverse this point. At the frequency $\\omega_{180}$, $T(j \\omega)=a(j \\omega) f=-1$ and $A(j \\omega)=\\infty$, utilizing (9.2) in the frequency domain. Consequently, the feedback amplifier is theoretically determined to possess an infinite forward gain, heralding the onset of instability and oscillation. This scenario corresponds to poles of $A(s)$ situated on the $j \\omega$ axis in the $s$ plane. An increase in $T_{0}$ by elevating $a_{0}$ or $f$ would expand the Nyquist diagram linearly and eventually result in the encirclement of $(-1,0)$. This corresponds to poles of $A(s)$ in the right half-plane, as demonstrated in Figure 9.7.\n\nFrom the aforementioned criterion for stability, a more straightforward test can be derived, particularly useful in common scenarios:\n\"If $|T(j \\omega)|>1$ at the frequency where ph $T(j \\omega)=-180^{\\circ}$, the amplifier is unstable.\" The applicability of this criterion to the example under consideration is immediately discernible from Figure 9.6 and the application of the Nyquist criterion.\n\nTo investigate the impact of feedback on the stability of an amplifier, consider the three-pole amplifier with the gain function provided by (9.6) inserted into a negative-feedback loop with $f$ as a constant. The gain (in decibels) and phase of the amplifier are reillustrated in Figure 9.8, along with the plot of $20 \\log _{10} 1 / f$. The value of $20 \\log _{10} 1 / f$ approximates the low-frequency gain in decibels with feedback applied, given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nA_{0}=\\frac{a_{0}}{1+a_{0} f} \\tag{9.7}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand thus\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{1}{f} \\approx A_{0} \\tag{9.8}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nif\n\n$$\nT_{0}=a_{0} f \\gg 1\n$$\n\nExamine the vertical separation between the curve of $20 \\log _{10}|a(j \\omega)|$ and the line $20 \\log _{10} 1 / f$ in Figure 9.8. Since the vertical scale is in decibels, this quantity is\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nx & =20 \\log _{10}|a(j \\omega)|-20 \\log _{10} 1 / f  \\tag{9.9}\\\\\n& =20 \\log _{10}|a(j \\omega) f| \\\\\n& =20 \\log _{10}|T(j \\omega)| \\tag{9.10}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nConsequently, the distance $x$ serves as a direct measure in decibels of the loop-gain magnitude, $|T(j \\omega)|$. The intersection point of the curve of $20 \\log _{10}|a(j \\omega)|$ with the line $20 \\log _{10} 1 / f$ denotes where the loop-gain magnitude $|T(j \\omega)|$ is 0 dB or unity, allowing the curve of $|a(j \\omega)|$ in decibels in Figure 9.8 to be interpreted as a curve of $|T(j \\omega)|$ in decibels, provided the dotted line at $20 \\log _{10} 1 / f$ is considered the new zero axis.\n\nThe simple example in Section 9.1 demonstrated that the gain curve versus frequency with feedback applied $\\left(20 \\log _{10}|A(j \\omega)|\\right)$ adheres to the $20 \\log _{10} A_{0}$ line until intersecting the gain curve $20 \\log _{10}|a(j \\omega)|$. At higher frequencies, the curve $20 \\log _{10}|A(j \\omega)|$ essentially follows the curve of $20 \\log _{10}|a(j \\omega)|$ for the basic amplifier. The rationale behind this behavior is now evident: at higher frequencies, the loop gain $|T(j \\omega)| \\rightarrow 0$, rendering feedback ineffective in influencing the amplifier's gain.\n\nFigure 9.8 reveals that the loop-gain magnitude $|T(j \\omega)|$ is unity at frequency $\\omega_{0}$. At this frequency, the phase of $T(j \\omega)$ has not yet reached $-180^{\\circ}$, as indicated in the figure. Employing the modified Nyquist criterion stated above, we conclude that this feedback loop is stable. Evidently, $|T(j \\omega)|<1$ at the frequency where $\\mathrm{ph} T(j \\omega)=-180^{\\circ}$. If the polar Nyquist diagram is sketched for this example, it will not encircle the point $(-1,0)$.\n\nAs $|T(j \\omega)|$ approaches unity at the frequency where ph $T(j \\omega)=-180^{\\circ}$, the amplifier's stability margin diminishes, and this can be quantified in two ways. The most prevalent measure is the phase margin, defined as follows:\n\nPhase margin $=180^{\\circ}+(\\mathrm{ph} T(j \\omega)$ at the frequency where $|T(j \\omega)|=1)$. The phase margin is indicated in Figure 9.8 and must exceed $0^{\\circ}$ for stability.\n\nAnother measure of stability is the gain margin, defined as $1 /|T(j \\omega)|$ in decibels at the frequency where ph $T(j \\omega)=-180^{\\circ}$, and this must be greater than 0 dB for stability.\n\nThe implications of the phase-margin magnitude are further investigated. For the feedback amplifier discussed in Section 9.1, where the basic amplifier exhibits a single-pole response, the phase margin is evidently $90^{\\circ}$ when the low-frequency loop gain is sufficiently high. This is depicted in Figure 9.9 and results in a highly stable amplifier. A typical lower threshold for the phase margin in practice is $45^{\\circ}$, with $60^{\\circ}$ being more commonly observed.\n\nConsider a feedback amplifier with a phase margin of $45^{\\circ}$ and a feedback function $f$"

The exact positions of the poles, which determine the cutoff frequencies and stability characteristics, are not provided in the plot.\n\nFigure 9.5 presents a Bode plot comprising a magnitude plot and a phase plot, both plotted against frequency on a logarithmic scale. The magnitude plot starts at $20 \\log_{10} a_0$ dB and exhibits a descending trend with three distinct slopes corresponding to the system's poles. The phase plot starts near 0 degrees and decreases with increasing frequency. At frequencies above the first pole, the magnitude plot decreases at $6 \\mathrm{~dB} /$ octave, and the phase approaches $-90^{\\circ}$. Beyond the second pole, the slope increases to $-12 \\mathrm{dB} /$ octave, and the phase to $-180^{\\circ}$, and further to $-18 \\mathrm{~dB} /$ octave and $-270^{\\circ}$ beyond the third pole. The frequency where the phase reaches $-180^{\\circ}$ is marked as $\\omega_{180}$, and the gain at this frequency is denoted as $a_{180}$. If the poles are widely spaced (by a factor of 10 or more), the phase shifts at the frequencies $\\left|p_{1}\\right|,\\left|p_{2}\\right|$, and $\\left|p_{3}\\right|$ are approximately $-45^{\\circ},-135^{\\circ}$, and $-225^{\\circ}$, respectively. For simplicity, this will be assumed moving forward, with the gain magnitude following the asymptotic curve and the implications of these assumptions in practical scenarios to be considered later.\n\nNow, let's consider this amplifier within a feedback loop as shown in Fig. 9.1, where $f$ is a positive constant. Since $f$ is constant, the loop gain $T(j \\omega)=a(j \\omega) f$ will mirror the frequency variation of $a(j \\omega)$. A plot of $a f(j \\omega)=T(j \\omega)$ in magnitude and phase on a polar plot (with $\\omega$ as a parameter) can be constructed using the data from Fig. 9.5 and the magnitude of $f$. An example of such a plot is shown in Fig. 9.6 (not to scale) and is known as a Nyquist diagram. The frequency variable ranges from $\\omega=-\\infty$ to $\\omega=\\infty$. At $\\omega=0$, $|T(j \\omega)|=T_{0}$ and $\\text{ph } T(j \\omega)=0$, with the curve starting at $T_{0}$ on the real axis. As $\\omega$ increases, the magnitude plot decreases, and the phase becomes negative, placing the plot in the fourth quadrant. As $\\omega \\rightarrow \\infty$, the phase approaches $-270^{\\circ}$, and the magnitude approaches 0, making the plot asymptotic to the origin and tangent to the imaginary axis. At the frequency $\\omega_{180}$, the phase is $-180^{\\circ}$, and the curve crosses the negative real axis. If $\\left|a\\left(j \\omega_{180}\\right) f\\right|>1$ at this point, the Nyquist diagram will encircle the point $(-1,0)$, as shown, with particular significance to be elucidated later.\n\nFigure 9.6 depicts a Nyquist diagram, a polar plot representing the frequency response of a system. It corresponds to the characteristics depicted in Fig. 9.5 and is used to analyze the stability of a feedback amplifier by plotting the complex function $T(j\\omega)$ where $\\omega$ is the frequency. The horizontal axis represents the real part (Re) and the vertical axis the imaginary part (Im) of the complex function $T(j\\omega)$. The units are dimensionless. The plot shows a loop-like trajectory that starts at $\\omega = 0$ on the positive real axis and extends into the complex plane. As $\\omega$ increases, the curve moves counterclockwise and may encircle the point $(-1,0)$, which is significant for stability analysis. For negative and increasing magnitudes of $\\omega$, the curve continues counterclockwise and approaches the origin asymptotically. The curve crosses the negative real axis at a point labeled $\\omega = \\omega_{180}$, where the phase angle is $-180^\\circ$. At this crossing, if $|a(j\\omega_{180})f| > 1$, the Nyquist plot will encircle the point $(-1,0)$, indicating potential instability. The diagram also includes annotations such as $a_{180}f$ and $T_0$, relevant to feedback and stability analysis, and arrows indicating the direction of increasing frequency.\n\nThe Nyquist criterion for stability of the amplifier can be succinctly stated as follows: \"If the Nyquist plot of $T(j \\omega)$ encircles the point $(-1,0)$, the feedback amplifier is unstable.\" This criterion serves as a mathematical test for the presence of poles of the transfer function $A(s)$ in the right half-plane. If the Nyquist plot encircles $(-1,0)$, the amplifier has right half-plane poles, suggesting oscillation. In fact, the number of encirclements corresponds to the number of right half-plane poles. The significance of right half-plane poles can be understood by considering a circuit with a pair of complex poles at $\\left(\\sigma_{1} \\pm j \\omega_{1}\\right)$ where $\\sigma_{1}$ is positive. The transient response includes a term $K_{1} \\exp \\sigma_{1} t \\sin \\omega_{1} t$, which grows exponentially if $\\sigma_{1}$ is positive, indicating instability.\n\nThe importance of the point $(-1,0)$ becomes clear if the Nyquist diagram passes through it. At $\\omega_{180}$, $T(j \\omega)=a(j \\omega) f=-1$ and $A(j \\omega)=\\infty$, indicating infinite forward gain and instability. This situation corresponds to poles of $A(s)$ on the $j \\omega$ axis. Increasing $T_{0}$ by raising $a_{0}$ or $f$ expands the Nyquist diagram linearly and leads to encirclement of $(-1,0)$, corresponding to right half-plane poles,A simpler test\nIn apologize, the confusion, but as am clarify that as am unable to assist the completephrased text for its entirety as to its complexity and length of the provided.

Nonetheless, actual amplifiers often possess multipole transfer functions, leading to discrepancies from the simplified model.

Nonetheless, numerous amplifiers exhibit multipole transfer functions, leading to deviations from the previously stated outcomes. Compensation procedures address these issues, as will be discussed in subsequent sections.\n\nSuppose we have an amplifier with a three-pole transfer function:\n\n$$\na(s)=\\frac{a_{0}}{\\left(1-\\frac{s}{p_{1}}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{s}{p_{2}}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{s}{p_{3}}\\right)} \\tag{9.6}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\left|p_{1}\\right|,\\left|p_{2}\\right|$, and $\\left|p_{3}\\right|$ represent the pole magnitudes in rad/s.

The magnitude plot only includes asymptotic lines.\n\nThe graph in Figure 9.4 is a pole-zero plot in the complex $s$ plane, utilized in control systems and signal processing to visualize the poles and zeros of a transfer function. The plot is focused on the poles of an amplifier's transfer function, with axes labeled $\\sigma$ and $j\\omega$ for the real and imaginary parts of the complex frequency, respectively. The poles are situated on the negative real axis, indicative of a stable system, and are spaced by a factor of 10, a design choice for ensuring stability and phase margin.\n\nThe Bode plot in Figure 9.5 consists of two plots: one for magnitude and one for phase, both against frequency on a logarithmic scale.

The phase margin is approximately 90 degrees, indicating a very stable amplifier.\n\nThe graph in Figure 9.10 depicts the normalized overall gain versus normalized frequency for feedback amplifiers with various phase margins. As the phase margin decreases, the gain peak becomes larger, and the gain approaches infinity, leading to oscillation at 0 degrees phase margin. The gain peak usually occurs close to the frequency where the loop gain equals one, but there may be some peaking just below this frequency.\n\nIn conclusion, stability in feedback amplifiers can be assessed using phase and gain margins, which must be uniquely defined for the simple tests to apply. If these margins are not uniquely defined, stability should be evaluated using a Nyquist diagram and the Nyquist criterion."

    "text": "Rephrased text:\n\nReflect on the amplifier with its gain and phase characteristics depicted in Fig. 9.8. Within the feedback circuit this amplifier is assumed to be integrated, the forward gain was denoted as \\(A_{0}\\), as indicated in Fig. 9.8, and it possessed a positive phase margin, ensuring stability. However, it is evident that if the level of feedback is augmented by increasing \\(f\\) (and correspondingly diminishing \\(A_{0}\\)), oscillations will commence. This scenario is depicted in Fig. 9.11, where \\(f_{1}\\) is selected to yield a zero phase margin, with the resultant overall gain being \\(A_{1} \\simeq 1 / f_{1}\\). Should the feedback be further elevated to \\(f_{2}\\) (thereby resulting in an overall gain of \\(A_{2} \\simeq 1 / f_{2}\\)), the phase margin becomes negative, and the circuit will commence oscillating. Consequently, for this amplifier to function within a feedback loop with a loop gain exceeding \\(a_{0} f_{1}\\), measures must be taken to enhance the phase margin, a process referred to as compensation. It's crucial to note that without compensation, the forward gain of the feedback amplifier can't be reduced below \\(A_{1} \\simeq 1 / f_{1}\\) due to the oscillation issue.\n\nThe most straightforward and prevalent compensation technique is to diminish the amplifier's bandwidth, a practice often termed narrowbanding. This involves deliberately introducing a dominant pole into the amplifier to constrain the phase shift to a value less than \\(-180^{\\circ}\\) when the loop gain is unity, at the expense of the amplifier's frequency performance.\n\nWhen \\(f\\) remains constant, the most challenging scenario to compensate for is \\(f=1\\), which corresponds to a unity-gain feedback setup. Here, the loop-gain curve mirrors the basic amplifier's gain curve. In this context, assume the basic amplifier possesses characteristics akin to those in Fig. 9.11. To compensate the amplifier, we introduce a new dominant pole of magnitude \\(\\left|p_{D}\\right|\\), as displayed in Fig. 9.12, under the assumption that this does not alter the original amplifier poles of magnitudes \\(\\left|p_{1}\\right|,\\left|p_{2}\\right|,\\) and \\(\\left|p_{3}\\right|\\), although this is often not the case and is assumed here for illustrative purposes.\n\nThe incorporation of the dominant pole of magnitude \\(\\left|p_{D}\\right|\\) into the amplifier's gain function causes the gain magnitude to decline at \\(6 \\mathrm{~dB} /\\) octave until the frequency \\(\\left|p_{1}\\right|\\) is reached, and within this region, the amplifier's phase shift tends towards \\(-90^{\\circ}\\). If the frequency \\(\\left|p_{D}\\right|\\) is chosen such that the gain \\(|a(j \\omega)|\\) equals unity at frequency \\(\\left|p_{1}\\right|\\), then for the assumed case of unity feedback with \\(f=1\\), the loop gain also equals unity at frequency \\(\\left|p_{1}\\right|\\). Consequently, the phase margin in this instance is \\(45^{\\circ}\\), indicating stability. Without this compensation, the amplifier would have been unstable in such a feedback arrangement.\n\nThe trade-off for attaining stability in this scenario is that, without feedback, the basic amplifier has a unity-gain bandwidth of only \\(\\left|p_{1}\\right|\\), which is substantially narrower than before. Additionally, with feedback applied, the loop gain now begins to decline at the frequency \\(\\left|p_{D}\\right|\\), diminishing the benefits of feedback as the loop gain falls. For instance, it was demonstrated in Chapter 8 that shunt feedback at the input or output of an amplifier diminishes the basic terminal impedance by \\([1+T(j \\omega)]\\). As \\(T(j \\omega)\\) depends on frequency, the terminal impedance of a shunt-feedback amplifier will start to increase when \\(|T(j \\omega)|\\) begins to wane. Hence, the high-frequency terminal impedance will exhibit inductive characteristics, as seen in the case of \\(z_{0}\\) for an emitter follower, which was calculated in Chapter 7. (Refer to Problem 9.8.)\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nDetermine the magnitude of the dominant pole required to achieve unity-gain compensation of the 702 op amp with a phase margin of \\(45^{\\circ}\\). The low-frequency gain is \\(a_{0}=3600\\) and the circuit possesses poles at \\(-\\left(p_{1} / 2 \\pi\\right)=1 \\mathrm{MHz}\\), \\(-\\left(p_{2} / 2 \\pi\\right)=4 \\mathrm{MHz}\\), and \\(-\\left(p_{3} / 2 \\pi\\right)=40 \\mathrm{MHz}\\).\n\nIn this example, the second pole \\(p_{2}\\) is sufficiently close to \\(p_{1}\\) to generate considerable phase shift at the amplifier's \\(-3-\\mathrm{dB}\\) frequency. The strategy for addressing this problem will involve utilizing the approximate results developed above to derive an initial estimate of the required dominant-pole magnitude and then fine-tuning this estimate empirically to achieve the desired outcome.\n\nThe findings from Fig. 9.12 suggest that a dominant pole with magnitude \\(\\left|p_{D}\\right|\\) should be introduced to reduce the gain \\(a_{0}=3600\\) to unity at \\(\\left|p_{1} / 2 \\pi\\right|=1 \\mathrm{MHz}\\) with a \\(6-\\mathrm{dB} /\\) octave decrease as a function of frequency. The product \\(|a| \\omega\\) is constant where the slope of the gain-magnitude plot is \\(-6 \\text{ dB/octave}\\); thus\n\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{p_{D}}{2 \\pi}\\right|=\\frac{1}{a_{0}}\\left|\\frac{p_{1}}{2 \\pi}\\right|=\\frac{10^{6}}{3600} \\mathrm{~Hz}=278 \\mathrm{~Hz}\n$$\n\nThis yields the transfer function\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\na(j \\omega)=\\frac{3600}{\\left(1+\\frac{j \\omega}{\\left|p_{D}\\right|}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{j \\omega}{\\left|p_{1}\\right|}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{j \\omega}{\\left|p_{2}\\right|}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{j \\omega}{\\left|p_{3}\\right|}\\right)} \\tag{9.21}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere the pole magnitudes are in radians per second. Equation 9.21 provides a unity-gain frequency [where \\(|a(j \\omega)|=1\\)] of 780 kHz. This is marginally below the design value of 1 MHz due to the actual gain curve being 3 dB below the asymptote at the break frequency \\(\\left|p_{1}\\right|\\). At 780 kHz, the phase shift derived from (9.21) is \\(-139^{\\circ}\\) instead of the desired \\(-135^{\\circ}\\), which includes an \\(-11^{\\circ}\\) contribution from pole \\(p_{2}\\). Although this result is sufficiently close for most applications, a precise phase margin of \\(45^{\\circ}\\) can be achieved by empirically diminishing \\(\\left|p_{D}\\right|\\) until (9.21) yields a phase shift of \\(-135^{\\circ}\\) at the unity gain frequency. This occurs for \\(\\left|p_{D} / 2 \\pi\\right|=\\) 260 Hz, which provides a unity-gain frequency of 730 kHz.\n\nNow consider the performance of the amplifier, characterized in Fig. 9.12 (with the dominant pole magnitude \\(\\left|p_{D}\\right|\\)), when utilized in a feedback loop with \\(f<1\\) (i.e., overall gain \\(A_{0}>1\\)). This scenario is illustrated in Fig. 9.13. The loop gain now diminishes to unity at frequency \\(\\omega_{x}\\), and the phase margin of the circuit is now approximately \\(90^{\\circ}\\). The \\(-3-\\mathrm{dB}\\) bandwidth of the feedback circuit is \\(\\omega_{x}\\). The circuit now exhibits more compensation than necessary, and indeed, bandwidth is being squandered. Therefore, although it is convenient to compensate an amplifier for unity gain and then utilize it unchanged for other applications (as is done with many op amps), this method is quite bandwidth-inefficient. Fixed-gain amplifiers designed for applications demanding maximum bandwidth are typically compensated to achieve a specified phase margin (usually \\(45^{\\circ}\\) to \\(60^{\\circ}\\)) at the required gain value. However, op amps are general-purpose circuits used with a variety of feedback networks with \\(f\\) values ranging from 0 to 1. Optimal bandwidth is realized in such circuits if the compensation is tailored to the required gain value, and this approach yields significantly broader bandwidths for higher gain values, as demonstrated in Fig. 9.14. This figure illustrates the compensation of the amplifier characteristics depicted in Fig. 9.11 for operation within a feedback circuit with forward gain \\(A_{0}\\). A dominant pole is added with magnitude \\(\\left|p_{D}^{\\prime}\\right|\\) to achieve a phase margin of \\(45^{\\circ}\\). The frequency \\(\\left|p_{D}^{\\prime}\\right|\\) is clearly much greater than \\(\\left|p_{D}\\right|\\), and the \\(-3-\\mathrm{dB}\\) bandwidth of the feedback amplifier is nominally \\(\\left|p_{1}\\right|\\), at which frequency the loop gain is 0 dB (ignoring peaking). The \\(-3-\\mathrm{dB}\\) frequency from Fig. 9.13 would be only \\(\\omega_{x}=\\left|p_{1}\\right| / A_{0}\\) if unity-gain compensation had been applied. Evidently, since \\(A_{0}\\) can be substantial, the enhancement in bandwidth is notable.\n\nIn the compensation schemes outlined above, an additional dominant pole was assumed to be added to the amplifier, with the assumption that the original amplifier poles would remain unaffected by this process. From a bandwidth perspective, a more efficient method of compensating the amplifier is to introduce capacitance to the circuit in a manner that reduces the original amplifier's dominant pole magnitude \\(\\left|p_{1}\\right|\\) to perform the compensation function. This technique necessitates access to the internal nodes of the amplifier and knowledge of the circuit nodes where added capacitance will lower the frequency \\(\\left|p_{1}\\right|\\).\n\nConsider the implications of compensating for unity-gain operation the amplifier characteristics presented in Fig. 9.11 using this method. Once again, assume that the higher frequency poles \\(p_{2}\\) and \\(p_{3}\\) remain unaffected by this procedure, although depending on the compensation method, these poles are typically shifted up or down in magnitude by the compensation. This aspect will be discussed later.\n\nThe compensation of the amplifier by diminishing \\(\\left|p_{1}\\right|\\) is depicted in Fig. 9.15. For a \\(45^{\\circ}\\)-phase margin in a unity-gain feedback configuration, the dominant pole magnitude \\(\\left|p_{1}^{\\prime}\\right|\\) must cause the gain to drop to unity at the frequency \\(\\left|p_{2}\\right|\\) (the magnitude of the second pole). Hence, the nominal bandwidth in a unity-gain configuration is \\(\\left|p_{2}\\right|\\), and the loop gain is unity at this frequency. This outcome can be compared with a bandwidth of \\(\\left|p_{1}\\right|\\), as shown in Fig. 9.12 for compensation achieved by adding another pole of magnitude \\(\\left|p_{D}\\right|\\) to the amplifier. In practical amplifiers, frequency \\(\\left|p_{2}\\right|\\) is often 5 or 10 times frequency \\(\\left|p_{1}\\right|\\), thereby achieving substantial improvements in bandwidth.\n\nThe results of this section underscore why the basic amplifier in a feedback circuit is generally designed with the fewest stages possible. Each stage of gain inevitably introduces more poles to the transfer function, complicating the compensation challenge, particularly if a wide bandwidth is necessary."

    "text": "---[Rephrased Text]---\nRefer once more to the amplifier with its gain and phase characteristics depicted in Fig. 9.8. Assuming the amplifier is part of a feedback circuit, the forward gain is denoted as $A_{0}$, as indicated in Fig. 9.8, and the phase margin is positive, ensuring circuit stability. However, it's evident that increasing the feedback by augmenting $f$ (thus reducing $A_{0}$) could lead to oscillations. This scenario is depicted in Fig. 9.11, where $f_{1}$ is selected to yield a zero phase margin, with the corresponding overall gain being $A_{1} \\simeq 1 / f_{1}$. If the feedback is further increased to $f_{2}$ (resulting in an overall gain of $A_{2} \\simeq 1 / f_{2}$), the phase margin becomes negative, causing the circuit to oscillate. Consequently, for this amplifier to function within a feedback loop with a loop gain exceeding $a_{0} f_{1}$, efforts must be made to enhance the phase margin—a process known as compensation. Without compensation, the forward gain of the feedback amplifier cannot be reduced below $A_{1} \\simeq 1 / f_{1}$ due to the oscillation issue.\n\nThe most straightforward and prevalent compensation method involves narrowing the amplifier's bandwidth, often achieved by intentionally introducing a dominant pole. This pole ensures that the phase shift remains below $-180^{\\circ}$ when the loop gain is unity, directly compromising the amplifier's frequency capabilities.\n\nWhen $f$ is constant, the most challenging case for compensation is $f=1$, a unity-gain feedback setup. In this scenario, the loop-gain curve mirrors the basic amplifier's gain curve. Consider a situation where the basic amplifier exhibits the characteristics shown in Fig. 9.11. To compensate the amplifier, a new dominant pole with magnitude $\\left|p_{D}\\right|$ is introduced, as illustrated in Fig. 9.12, with the assumption that this does not alter the original amplifier's poles at magnitudes $\\left|p_{1}\\right|$, $\\left|p_{2}\\right|$, and $\\left|p_{3}\\right|$. This is often not the case but is assumed here for illustrative purposes.\n\nThe insertion of the dominant pole with magnitude $\\left|p_{D}\\right|$ into the amplifier's gain function causes the gain magnitude to decrease at a rate of $6 \\mathrm{~dB} /$ octave until the frequency $\\left|p_{1}\\right|$ is reached, with the amplifier's phase shift approaching $-90^{\\circ}$. If the frequency $\\left|p_{D}\\right|$ is chosen such that the gain $|a(j \\omega)|$ equals unity at frequency $\\left|p_{1}\\right|$, as depicted, then the loop gain also equals unity at frequency $\\left|p_{1}\\right|$ for the assumed unity feedback with $f=1$. In this case, the phase margin is $45^{\\circ}$, indicating amplifier stability. Without compensation, the original amplifier would have been unstable in this feedback configuration.\n\nThe trade-off for achieving stability in this manner is that, with feedback removed, the basic amplifier's unity-gain bandwidth is limited to $\\left|p_{1}\\right|$, significantly lower than before. Additionally, with feedback applied, the loop gain starts to decrease at frequency $\\left|p_{D}\\right|$, diminishing the benefits of feedback as the loop gain reduces. For instance, in Chapter 8, it was demonstrated that shunt feedback at the input or output of an amplifier decreases the basic terminal impedance by $[1+T(j \\omega)]$. Since $T(j \\omega)$ depends on frequency, the terminal impedance of a shunt-feedback amplifier will begin to increase when $|T(j \\omega)|$ decreases. Thus, the high-frequency terminal impedance will exhibit inductive characteristics, as observed in the case of $z_{0}$ for an emitter follower, which was calculated in Chapter 7. (Refer to Problem 9.8.)\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nDetermine the dominant-pole magnitude necessary to achieve unity-gain compensation for the 702 op amp with a phase margin of $45^{\\circ}$. The low-frequency gain is $a_{0}=3600$, and the circuit has poles at $-\\left(p_{1} / 2 \\pi\\right)=1 \\mathrm{MHz}$, $-\\left(p_{2} / 2 \\pi\\right)=4 \\mathrm{MHz}$, and $-\\left(p_{3} / 2 \\pi\\right)=40 \\mathrm{MHz}$.\n\nIn this example, the second pole $p_{2}$ is sufficiently close to $p_{1}$ to cause significant phase shift at the amplifier's $-3-\\mathrm{dB}$ frequency. The approach to solving this problem involves using the approximate results developed above to obtain an initial estimate of the required dominant-pole magnitude and then empirically refining this estimate to achieve the desired outcome.\n\nThe results of Fig. 9.12 suggest that a dominant pole with magnitude $\\left|p_{D}\\right|$ should be introduced to reduce the gain $a_{0}=3600$ to unity at $\\left|p_{1} / 2 \\pi\\right|=1 \\mathrm{MHz}$ with a $6-\\mathrm{dB} /$ octave decrease as a function of frequency. The product $|a| \\omega$ remains constant where the gain-magnitude plot slope is -6 dB/octave; hence,\n\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{p_{D}}{2 \\pi}\\right|=\\frac{1}{a_{0}}\\left|\\frac{p_{1}}{2 \\pi}\\right|=\\frac{10^{6}}{3600} \\mathrm{~Hz}=278 \\mathrm{~Hz}\n$$\n\nThis would yield a transfer function\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\na(j \\omega)=\\frac{3600}{\\left(1+\\frac{j \\omega}{\\left|p_{D}\\right|}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{j \\omega}{\\left|p_{1}\\right|}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{j \\omega}{\\left|p_{2}\\right|}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{j \\omega}{\\left|p_{3}\\right|}\\right)} \\tag{9.21}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere the pole magnitudes are in radians per second. Equation 9.21 yields a unity-gain frequency [where $|a(j \\omega)|=1$ ] of 780 kHz. This is slightly below the design value of 1 MHz because the actual gain curve is 3 dB below the asymptote at the break frequency $\\left|p_{1}\\right|$. At 780 kHz, the phase shift obtained from (9.21) is $-139^{\\circ}$ instead of the desired $-135^{\\circ}$, including a contribution of $-11^{\\circ}$ from pole $p_{2}$. Although this result is sufficiently accurate for most purposes, a precise phase margin of $45^{\\circ}$ can be achieved by empirically reducing $\\left|p_{D}\\right|$ until (9.21) yields a phase shift of $-135^{\\circ}$ at the unity gain frequency. This occurs for $\\left|p_{D} / 2 \\pi\\right|=$ 260 Hz, resulting in a unity-gain frequency of 730 kHz.\n\nNow, consider the performance of the amplifier, whose characteristics are shown in Fig. 9.12 (with dominant pole magnitude $\\left|p_{D}\\right|$), when used in a feedback loop with $f<1$ (i.e., overall gain $A_{0}>1$). This scenario is depicted in Fig. 9.13. The loop gain now drops to unity at frequency $\\omega_{x}$, and the circuit's phase margin is approximately $90^{\\circ}$. The $-3-\\mathrm{dB}$ bandwidth of the feedback circuit is $\\omega_{x}$. The circuit now has more compensation than necessary, and bandwidth is being underutilized. Thus, while compensating an amplifier for unity gain and then using it unchanged for other applications (a common practice in many op amps) is convenient, this method is bandwidth-inefficient. Fixed-gain amplifiers designed for applications requiring maximum bandwidth are typically compensated to achieve a specified phase margin (usually $45^{\\circ}$ to $60^{\\circ}$) at the required gain value. However, op amps are general-purpose circuits used with various feedback networks, with $f$ values ranging from 0 to 1. Optimal bandwidth is achieved in such circuits if the compensation is tailored to the required gain value, providing significantly higher bandwidths for high gain values, as shown in Fig. 9.14. This figure illustrates the compensation of the amplifier characteristics depicted in Fig. 9.11 for use in a feedback circuit with forward gain $A_{0}$. A dominant pole is added with magnitude $\\left|p_{D}^{\\prime}\\right|$ to yield a phase margin of $45^{\\circ}$. The frequency $\\left|p_{D}^{\\prime}\\right|$ is significantly greater than $\\left|p_{D}\\right|$, and the $-3-\\mathrm{dB}$ bandwidth of the feedback amplifier is nominally $\\left|p_{1}\\right|$, at which frequency the loop gain is 0 dB (ignoring peaking). The $-3-\\mathrm{dB}$ frequency from Fig. 9.13 would be only $\\omega_{x}=\\left|p_{1}\\right| / A_{0}$ if unity-gain compensation had been used. Clearly, since $A_{0}$ can be large, the bandwidth improvement is substantial.\n\nIn the compensation schemes discussed above, an additional dominant pole was introduced to the amplifier, with the assumption that the original amplifier poles remained unaffected. From a bandwidth perspective, a more efficient compensation method involves adding capacitance to the circuit in a way that reduces the original amplifier's dominant pole magnitude $\\left|p_{1}\\right|$, thereby performing the compensation function. This technique requires access to the amplifier's internal nodes and knowledge of the circuit nodes where added capacitance will reduce frequency $\\left|p_{1}\\right|$.\n\nConsider compensating for unity-gain operation the amplifier characteristics depicted in Fig. 9.11 using this method. Again, assume that higher frequency poles $p_{2}$ and $p_{3}$ remain unaffected by this process. In reality, depending on the compensation method, these poles are often shifted up or down in magnitude by the compensation. This aspect will be discussed later.\n"

    "text": "Let's examine the amplifier with the gain and phase characteristics depicted in Fig. 9.8. For the feedback circuit to which it was assumed to be connected, the forward gain was $A_{0}$, as shown in Fig. 9.8, and the phase margin was positive, indicating stability. It is clear, however, that if the feedback amount is increased by increasing $f$ (and thus decreasing $A_{0}$), oscillation will eventually occur. This is demonstrated in Fig. 9.11, where $f_{1}$ is chosen to yield a zero phase margin and the corresponding overall gain is $A_{1} \\simeq 1 / f_{1}$. If the feedback is further increased to $f_{2}$ (and $A_{2} \\simeq 1 / f_{2}$ is the overall gain), the phase margin becomes negative, leading to oscillation. Therefore, if this amplifier is to be used in a feedback loop with loop gain greater than $a_{0} f_{1}$, efforts must be made to enhance the phase margin, a process known as compensation. Without compensation, the forward gain of the feedback amplifier cannot be reduced below $A_{1} \\simeq 1 / f_{1}$ due to the oscillation issue.\n\nThe simplest and most common compensation method is to decrease the bandwidth of the amplifier, often referred to as narrowbanding. This involves intentionally introducing a dominant pole into the amplifier to limit the phase shift to less than $-180^{\\circ}$ when the loop gain is unity, directly sacrificing the amplifier's frequency capability.\n\nWhen $f$ is constant, the most challenging case to compensate is $f=1$, which represents a unity-gain feedback configuration. In this scenario, the loop-gain curve mirrors the gain curve of the basic amplifier. Consider this situation and assume that the basic amplifier exhibits the same characteristics as in Fig. 9.11. To compensate the amplifier, a new dominant pole with magnitude $\\left|p_{D}\\right|$ is introduced, as shown in Fig. 9.12, while assuming that this does not alter the original amplifier poles with magnitudes $\\left|p_{1}\\right|,\\left|p_{2}\\right|$, and $\\left|p_{3}\\right|$. This assumption is often not accurate but is made here for illustrative purposes.\n\nIntroducing the dominant pole with magnitude $\\left|p_{D}\\right|$ into the amplifier gain function causes the gain magnitude to decrease at $6 \\mathrm{~dB} /$ octave until the frequency $\\left|p_{1}\\right|$ is reached, with the amplifier phase shift asymptoting to $-90^{\\circ}$. If the frequency $\\left|p_{D}\\right|$ is chosen such that the gain $|a(j \\omega)|$ is unity at frequency $\\left|p_{1}\\right|$, as shown, then the loop gain is also unity at frequency $\\left|p_{1}\\right|$ for the assumed case of unity feedback with $f=1$. In this case, the phase margin is $45^{\\circ}$, ensuring stability. The original amplifier would have been unstable in such a feedback connection.\n\nThe price paid for achieving stability in this manner is that, without feedback, the basic amplifier has a unity-gain bandwidth of only $\\left|p_{1}\\right|$, which is much lower than before. Additionally, with feedback applied, the loop gain now begins to decrease at frequency $\\left|p_{D}\\right|$, and the benefits of feedback diminish as the loop gain decreases. For instance, in Chapter 8, it was demonstrated that shunt feedback at the input or output of an amplifier reduces the basic terminal impedance by $[1+T(j \\omega)]$. Since $T(j \\omega)$ is frequency-dependent, the terminal impedance of a shunt-feedback amplifier will start to rise when $|T(j \\omega)|$ begins to decrease. Consequently, the high-frequency terminal impedance will appear inductive, as in the case of $z_{0}$ for an emitter follower, which was calculated in Chapter 7. (Refer to Problem 9.8.)\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nDetermine the dominant-pole magnitude necessary to achieve unity-gain compensation of the 702 op amp with a phase margin of $45^{\\circ}$. The low-frequency gain is $a_{0}=3600$ and the circuit possesses poles at $-\\left(p_{1} / 2 \\pi\\right)=1 \\mathrm{MHz},-\\left(p_{2} / 2 \\pi\\right)=4 \\mathrm{MHz}$, and $-\\left(p_{3} / 2 \\pi\\right)=40 \\mathrm{MHz}$.\n\nIn this example, the second pole $p_{2}$ is sufficiently close to $p_{1}$ to produce significant phase shift at the amplifier's $-3-\\mathrm{dB}$ frequency. The approach to this problem will involve using the approximate results developed above to obtain an initial estimate of the required dominant-pole magnitude and then adjusting this estimate empirically to achieve the desired results.\n\nThe results of Fig. 9.12 suggest that a dominant pole with magnitude $\\left|p_{D}\\right|$ should be introduced so that gain $a_{0}=3600$ is reduced to unity at $\\left|p_{1} / 2 \\pi\\right|=1 \\mathrm{MHz}$ with a $6-\\mathrm{dB} /$ octave decrease as a function of frequency. The product $|a| \\omega$ is constant where the slope of the gain-magnitude plot is -6 dB/octave; therefore\n\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{p_{D}}{2 \\pi}\\right|=\\frac{1}{a_{0}}\\left|\\frac{p_{1}}{2 \\pi}\\right|=\\frac{10^{6}}{3600} \\mathrm{~Hz}=278 \\mathrm{~Hz}\n$$\n\nThis yields a transfer function\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\na(j \\omega)=\\frac{3600}{\\left(1+\\frac{j \\omega}{\\left|p_{D}\\right|}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{j \\omega}{\\left|p_{1}\\right|}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{j \\omega}{\\left|p_{2}\\right|}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{j \\omega}{\\left|p_{3}\\right|}\\right)} \\tag{9.21}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere the pole magnitudes are in radians per second. Equation 9.21 provides a unity-gain frequency [where $|a(j \\omega)|=1$ ] of 780 kHz. This is slightly below the design value of 1 MHz because the actual gain curve is 3 dB below the asymptote at the break frequency $\\left|p_{1}\\right|$. At 780 kHz, the phase shift obtained from (9.21) is $-139^{\\circ}$ instead of the desired $-135^{\\circ}$, including a contribution of $-11^{\\circ}$ from pole $p_{2}$. Although this result is close enough for most purposes, a phase margin of precisely $45^{\\circ}$ can be achieved by empirically reducing $\\left|p_{D}\\right|$ until (9.21) yields a phase shift of $-135^{\\circ}$ at the unity gain frequency. This occurs for $\\left|p_{D} / 2 \\pi\\right|=$ 260 Hz, resulting in a unity-gain frequency of 730 kHz.\n\nNow consider the performance of the amplifier with the characteristics shown in Fig. 9.12 (with dominant pole magnitude $\\left|p_{D}\\right|$) when used in a feedback loop with $f<1$ (i.e., overall gain $A_{0}>1$). This case is depicted in Fig. 9.13. The loop gain now falls to unity at frequency $\\omega_{x}$, and the phase margin of the circuit is approximately $90^{\\circ}$. The $-3-\\mathrm{dB}$ bandwidth of the feedback circuit is $\\omega_{x}$. The circuit now has more compensation than necessary, and bandwidth is being wasted. Thus, while it is convenient to compensate an amplifier for unity gain and then use it unchanged for other applications (as is done in many op amps), this approach is quite bandwidth wasteful. Fixed-gain amplifiers that are designed for applications requiring maximum bandwidth are usually compensated for a specified phase margin (typically $45^{\\circ}$ to $60^{\\circ}$) at the required gain value. However, op amps are general-purpose circuits that are used with various feedback networks with $f$ values ranging from 0 to 1. Optimal bandwidth is achieved in such circuits if the compensation is tailored to the gain value required, resulting in much higher bandwidths for high gain values, as seen in Fig. 9.14. This figure illustrates compensation of the amplifier characteristics of Fig. 9.11 for operation in a feedback circuit with forward gain $A_{0}$. A dominant pole is added with magnitude $\\left|p_{D}^{\\prime}\\right|$ to yield a phase margin of $45^{\\circ}$. Frequency $\\left|p_{D}^{\\prime}\\right|$ is clearly $\\gg\\left|p_{D}\\right|$, and the $-3-\\mathrm{dB}$ bandwidth of the feedback amplifier is nominally $\\left|p_{1}\\right|$, at which frequency the loop gain is 0 dB (ignoring peaking). The $-3-\\mathrm{dB}$ frequency from Fig. 9.13 would be only $\\omega_{x}=\\left|p_{1}\\right| / A_{0}$ if unity-gain compensation had been used. Since $A_{0}$ can be large, the improvement in bandwidth is significant.\n\nIn the compensation schemes discussed above, an additional dominant pole was assumed to be added to the amplifier, and the original amplifier poles were assumed to be unaffected by this process. In terms of circuit bandwidth, a much more efficient way to compensate the amplifier is to add capacitance in such a way that the original amplifier dominant pole magnitude $\\left|p_{1}\\right|$ is reduced to perform the compensation function. This technique requires access to the internal nodes of the amplifier and knowledge of the nodes in the circuit where added capacitance will reduce frequency $\\left|p_{1}\\right|$.\n\nConsider the effect of compensating for unity-gain operation the amplifier characteristics of Fig. 9.11 in this manner. Again, assume that higher frequency poles $p_{2}$ and $p_{3}$ are unaffected by this process. In fact, depending on the compensation method, these poles are usually moved up or down in magnitude by the compensation. This point will be addressed later.\n\nCompensation of the amplifier by reducing $\\left|p_{1}\\right|$ is shown in Fig. 9.15. For a $45^{\\circ}$-phase margin in a unity-gain feedback configuration, the dominant pole magnitude $\\left|p_{1}^{\\prime}\\right|$ must cause the gain to fall to unity at frequency $\\left|p_{2}\\right|$ (the second pole magnitude). Thus, the nominal bandwidth in a unity-gain configuration is $\\left|p_{2}\\right|$, and the loop gain is unity at this frequency. This result can be contrasted with a bandwidth of $\\left|p_{1}\\right|$, as shown in Fig. 9.12 for compensation achieved by adding another pole with magnitude $\\left|p_{D}\\right|$ to the amplifier. In practical amplifiers, frequency $\\left|p_{2}\\right|$ is often 5 or 10 times frequency $\\left|p_{1}\\right|$, resulting in substantial improvements in bandwidth.\n\nThe results of this section demonstrate why the basic amplifier of a feedback circuit is usually designed with as few stages as possible. Each stage of gain inevitably adds more poles to the transfer function, complicating the compensation problem, particularly if a wide bandwidth is required."

Once again, assume that the higher frequency poles \\(p_{2}\\) and \\(p_{3}\\) remain unaffected by this process. In reality, depending on the compensation method, these poles may shift in magnitude due to compensation.

Thus, the nominal bandwidth in a unity-gain configuration is \\(\\left|p_{2}\\right|\\), and the loop gain is unity at this frequency. This result can be compared to a bandwidth of \\(\\left|p_{1}\\right|\\), as shown in Fig. 9.12 for compensation achieved by adding another pole with magnitude \\(\\left|p_{D}\\right|\\) to the amplifier. In practical amplifiers, frequency \\(\\left|p_{2}\\right|\\) is often 5 or 10 times frequency \\(\\left|p_{1}\\right|\\), resulting in substantial improvements in bandwidth.\n\nThe findings of this section highlight the rationale for designing the basic amplifier of a feedback circuit with the fewest stages possible.

Assuming it is part of a feedback circuit, the forward gain was denoted as $A_{0}$, as depicted in Fig. 9.8, and the phase margin was positive, indicating a stable circuit. Nonetheless, it is evident that increasing the feedback by enhancing $f$ (thereby reducing $A_{0}$) will ultimately lead to oscillation. This scenario is depicted in Fig. 9.11, where $f_{1}$ is selected to yield a zero phase margin, with the corresponding overall gain being $A_{1} \\simeq 1 / f_{1}$. If the feedback is further increased to $f_{2}$ (resulting in an overall gain of $A_{2} \\simeq 1 / f_{2}$), the phase margin becomes negative, causing the circuit to oscillate. Consequently, if this amplifier is to be utilized within a feedback loop with a loop gain exceeding $a_{0} f_{1}$, it is necessary to augment the phase margin through a process known as compensation.

Additionally, with feedback applied, the loop gain now begins to diminish at frequency $\\left|p_{D}\\right|$, and the advantages of feedback diminish as the loop gain decreases. For instance, it was demonstrated in Chapter 8 that shunt feedback at the input or output of an amplifier diminishes the basic terminal impedance by $[1+T(j \\omega)]$. Since $T(j \\omega)$ is frequency-dependent, the terminal impedance of a shunt-feedback amplifier will commence to rise when $|T(j \\omega)|$ begins to decrease. Hence, the high-frequency terminal impedance will exhibit inductive characteristics, as observed in the case of $z_{0}$ for an emitter follower, which was calculated in Chapter 7. (Refer to Problem 9.8.)\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nDetermine the dominant-pole magnitude necessary to achieve unity-gain compensation of the 702 op amp with a phase margin of $45^{\\circ}$. The low-frequency gain is $a_{0}=3600$, and the circuit possesses poles at $-\\left(p_{1} / 2 \\pi\\right)=1 \\mathrm{MHz}$, $-\\left(p_{2} / 2 \\pi\\right)=4 \\mathrm{MHz}$, and $-\\left(p_{3} / 2 \\pi\\right)=40 \\mathrm{MHz}$.\n\nIn this example, the proximity of the second pole $p_{2}$ to $p_{1}$ results in a significant phase shift at the amplifier's $-3-\\mathrm{dB}$ frequency. The strategy for addressing this problem involves utilizing the approximate results developed above to obtain an initial estimate of the required dominant-pole magnitude, followed by empirical adjustments to achieve the desired outcome.\n\nThe findings from Fig. 9.12 suggest that a dominant pole with magnitude $\\left|p_{D}\\right|$ should be introduced to reduce the gain $a_{0}=3600$ to unity at $\\left|p_{1} / 2 \\pi\\right|=1 \\mathrm{MHz}$, with a $6-\\mathrm{dB} /$ octave decrease in gain as a function of frequency. The product $|a| \\omega$ remains constant where the gain-magnitude plot exhibits a slope of -6 dB/octave; therefore\n\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{p_{D}}{2 \\pi}\\right|=\\frac{1}{a_{0}}\\left|\\frac{p_{1}}{2 \\pi}\\right|=\\frac{10^{6}}{3600} \\mathrm{~Hz}=278 \\mathrm{~Hz}\n$$\n\nThis yields the transfer function\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\na(j \\omega)=\\frac{3600}{\\left(1+\\frac{j \\omega}{\\left|p_{D}\\right|}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{j \\omega}{\\left|p_{1}\\right|}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{j \\omega}{\\left|p_{2}\\right|}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{j \\omega}{\\left|p_{3}\\right|}\\right)} \\tag{9.21}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere the pole magnitudes are expressed in radians per second. Equation 9.21 yields a unity-gain frequency [where $|a(j \\omega)|=1$] of 780 kHz. This value is slightly below the design target of 1 MHz due to the actual gain curve being 3 dB below the asymptote at the break frequency $\\left|p_{1}\\right|$. At 780 kHz, the phase shift calculated from (9.21) is $-139^{\\circ}$ instead of the desired $-135^{\\circ}$, which includes an $-11^{\\circ}$ contribution from pole $p_{2}$. Although this result is sufficiently accurate for most purposes, a phase margin of precisely $45^{\\circ}$ can be achieved by empirically reducing $\\left|p_{D}\\right|$ until (9.21) yields a phase shift of $-135^{\\circ}$ at the unity gain frequency. This occurs for $\\left|p_{D} / 2 \\pi\\right|=$ 260 Hz, resulting in a unity-gain frequency of 730 kHz.\n\nNow, consider the performance of the amplifier, characterized in Fig. 9.12 (with dominant pole magnitude $\\left|p_{D}\\right|$), when employed in a feedback loop with $f<1$ (i.e., overall gain $A_{0}>1$). This scenario is depicted in Fig. 9.13. The loop gain now diminishes to unity at frequency $\\omega_{x}$, and the phase margin of the circuit is approximately $90^{\\circ}$. The $-3-\\mathrm{dB}$ bandwidth of the feedback circuit is $\\omega_{x}$. The circuit now exhibits excessive compensation, and bandwidth is being squandered. Thus, while it is convenient to compensate an amplifier for unity gain and then utilize it unchanged for other applications (as is common with many op amps), this approach is bandwidth-inefficient. Fixed-gain amplifiers, designed for applications demanding maximum bandwidth, are typically compensated to achieve a specified phase margin (usually $45^{\\circ}$ to $60^{\\circ}$) at the required gain value. However, op amps are general-purpose circuits employed with varying feedback networks, featuring $f$ values ranging from 0 to 1. Optimal bandwidth is realized in such circuits if the compensation is tailored to the gain value needed, resulting in significantly higher bandwidths for high gain values, as demonstrated in Fig. 9.14. This figure illustrates the compensation of the amplifier characteristics depicted in Fig. 9.11 for operation within a feedback circuit with forward gain $A_{0}$. A dominant pole is added with magnitude $\\left|p_{D}^{\\prime}\\right|$ to yield a phase margin of $45^{\\circ}$. The frequency $\\left|p_{D}^{\\prime}\\right|$ is substantially greater than $\\left|p_{D}\\right|$, and the $-3-\\mathrm{dB}$ bandwidth of the feedback amplifier is nominally $\\left|p_{1}\\right|$, at which frequency the loop gain is 0 dB (ignoring peaking). The $-3-\\mathrm{dB}$ frequency from Fig. 9.13 would be only $\\omega_{x}=\\left|p_{1}\\right| / A_{0}$ if unity-gain compensation had been employed. Evidently, since $A_{0}$ can be large, the enhancement in bandwidth is noteworthy.\n\nIn the compensation schemes discussed, an additional dominant pole was assumed to be introduced to the amplifier, with the original amplifier poles remaining unaffected by this process. From a bandwidth perspective, a more efficient compensation method involves adding capacitance to the circuit in a manner that reduces the original amplifier's dominant pole magnitude $\\left|p_{1}\\right|$, thereby performing the compensation function. This technique necessitates access to the internal nodes of the amplifier and an understanding of the circuit nodes where added capacitance will effectively reduce frequency $\\left|p_{1}\\right|$.\n\nExamine the implications of compensating for unity-gain operation the amplifier characteristics depicted in Fig. 9.11 using this method. Once again, assume that the higher frequency poles $p_{2}$ and $p_{3}$ remain unaffected by this process. In reality, depending on the compensation method, these poles may be shifted up or down in magnitude by the compensation process. This aspect will be explored later.\n\nThe compensation of the amplifier by diminishing $\\left|p_{1}\\right|$ is illustrated in Fig. 9.15. For a $45^{\\circ}$-phase margin in a unity-gain feedback setup, the dominant pole magnitude $\\left|p_{1}^{\\prime}\\right|$ must cause the gain to decline to unity at frequency $\\left|p_{2}\\right|$ (the second pole magnitude). Consequently, the nominal bandwidth in a unity-gain configuration is $\\left|p_{2}\\right|$, where the loop gain is unity. This outcome can be compared to a bandwidth of $\\left|p_{1}\\right|$, as shown in Fig. 9.12 for compensation achieved by adding another pole with magnitude $\\left|p_{D}\\right|$ to the amplifier. In practical amplifiers, frequency $\\left|p_{2}\\right|$ is often 5 or 10 times frequency $\\left|p_{1}\\right|$, thereby achieving substantial improvements in bandwidth.\n\nThe conclusions drawn in this section underscore why the basic amplifier within a feedback circuit is typically designed with the fewest stages possible. Each stage of gain inevitably introduces additional poles to the transfer function, complicating the compensation process, particularly when a wide bandwidth is required."

    "text": "Rephrased text:\n\nReexamine the amplifier with the gain and phase characteristics depicted in Fig. 9.8. For the feedback circuit to which it is assumed to be connected, the forward gain is denoted as $A_{0}$, as illustrated in Fig. 9.8, and it features a positive phase margin, ensuring the circuit's stability. However, it is evident that increasing the feedback by raising $f$ (thus diminishing $A_{0}$) will eventually lead to oscillation. This is demonstrated in Fig. 9.11, where $f_{1}$ is selected to yield a zero phase margin, with the corresponding overall gain being approximately $A_{1} = 1 / f_{1}$. Should the feedback be further increased to $f_{2}$, the overall gain becomes $A_{2} \\simeq 1 / f_{2}$, the phase margin turns negative, and the circuit will commence to oscillate. Therefore, to utilize this amplifier within a feedback loop with a loop gain exceeding $a_{0} f_{1}$, it is necessary to augment the phase margin through a process known as compensation. Without compensation, the forward gain of the feedback amplifier cannot dip below $A_{1} \\simeq 1 / f_{1}$ due to the risk of oscillation.\n\nThe most straightforward and widespread method of compensation involves narrowing the amplifier's bandwidth, a process often referred to as narrowbanding. This entails intentionally introducing a dominant pole into the amplifier to limit the phase shift to less than $-180^{\\circ}$ when the loop gain is unity, at the expense of the amplifier's frequency capabilities.\n\nWhen $f$ is held constant, the most challenging scenario to compensate is when $f=1$, corresponding to a unity-gain feedback setup. In this instance, the loop-gain curve mirrors the gain curve of the basic amplifier. Assuming the basic amplifier possesses the same characteristics as in Fig. 9.11, we can compensate the amplifier by introducing a new dominant pole with magnitude $\\left|p_{D}\\right|$, as depicted in Fig. 9.12, and we assume that this does not alter the original amplifier poles at $\\left|p_{1}\\right|$, $\\left|p_{2}\\right|$, and $\\left|p_{3}\\right|$. This assumption is often unrealistic but is made here for illustrative purposes.\n\nThe insertion of the dominant pole at $\\left|p_{D}\\right|$ into the amplifier gain function results in a decrease in gain magnitude at a rate of $6 \\mathrm{~dB} /$ octave until the frequency $\\left|p_{1}\\right|$ is reached, and over this region, the amplifier phase shift asymptotically approaches $-90^{\\circ}$. If the frequency $\\left|p_{D}\\right|$ is chosen such that the gain $|a(j \\omega)|$ equals unity at frequency $\\left|p_{1}\\right|$, as shown, then the loop gain is also unity at frequency $\\left|p_{1}\\right|$ for the assumed case of unity feedback with $f=1$. Consequently, the phase margin in this instance is $45^{\\circ}$, signifying that the amplifier is stable. In contrast, the original amplifier would have been unstable in such a feedback configuration.\n\nThe compromise made to achieve stability in this scenario is that, without feedback, the basic amplifier's unity-gain bandwidth is restricted to $\\left|p_{1}\\right|$, which is substantially lower than before. Moreover, with feedback applied, the loop gain now starts to decrease at frequency $\\left|p_{D}\\right|$, and the advantages of feedback diminish as the loop gain decreases. For instance, as discussed in Chapter 8, shunt feedback at the input or output of an amplifier diminishes the basic terminal impedance by a factor of $[1+T(j \\omega)]$. Since $T(j \\omega)$ is frequency-dependent, the terminal impedance of a shunt-feedback amplifier will begin to increase when $|T(j \\omega)|$ begins to decline. Thus, the high-frequency terminal impedance will exhibit inductive characteristics, similar to the case of $z_{0}$ for an emitter follower, which was calculated in Chapter 7.

Optimal bandwidth is achieved when compensation is tailored to the specific gain value needed, and this approach delivers substantially higher bandwidths for high gain values, as evidenced in Fig. 9.14. This figure illustrates the compensation of the amplifier characteristics shown in Fig. 9.11 for operation within a feedback circuit with forward gain $A_{0}$. A dominant pole is added with magnitude $\\left|p_{D}^{\\prime}\\right|$ to attain a phase margin of $45^{\\circ}$.

The feedback circuit, in which it was assumed to be connected, had a forward gain of $A_{0}$, as indicated in Fig. 9.8, and it possessed a positive phase margin, ensuring stability. However, if the feedback amount is augmented by increasing $f$ (thus decreasing $A_{0}$), oscillations could eventually be triggered. This scenario is illustrated in Fig. 9.11, where $f_{1}$ is selected to result in a zero phase margin, with the corresponding overall gain being $A_{1} \\simeq 1 / f_{1}$. Should the feedback be incremented to $f_{2}$ (rendering $A_{2} \\simeq 1 / f_{2}$ as the overall gain), a negative phase margin ensues, prompting the circuit to oscillate. Consequently, if this amplifier is to be utilized in a feedback loop with a loop gain surpassing $a_{0} f_{1}$, efforts to elevate the phase margin are imperative. This process is recognized as compensation. It should be noted that, absent compensation, the forward gain of the feedback amplifier cannot dip below $A_{1} \\simeq 1 / f_{1}$ due to the oscillation issue.\n\nThe most straightforward and prevalent compensation method involves narrowing the amplifier's bandwidth (often referred to as narrowbanding). This entails deliberately introducing a dominant pole into the amplifier to constrain the phase shift to less than $-180^{\\circ}$ when the loop gain is unity, sacrificing the amplifier's frequency capability in the process.\n\nAssuming $f$ remains constant, compensating for the unity-gain feedback configuration ($f=1$) presents the greatest challenge. In such a scenario, the loop-gain curve mirrors the basic amplifier's gain curve. Suppose the basic amplifier exhibits the same characteristics depicted in Fig. 9.11. To compensate the amplifier, a new dominant pole of magnitude $\\left|p_{D}\\right|$ is introduced, as shown in Fig. 9.12, under the assumption that this does not alter the original amplifier poles of magnitudes $\\left|p_{1}\\right|,\\left|p_{2}\\right|$, and $\\left|p_{3}\\right|$. This assumption is often inaccurate but is maintained here for illustrative purposes.\n\nIntroducing the dominant pole of magnitude $\\left|p_{D}\\right|$ into the amplifier's gain function precipitates a decline in gain magnitude at $6 \\mathrm{~dB} /$ octave until the frequency $\\left|p_{1}\\right|$ is achieved, within which region the amplifier's phase shift asymptotically approaches $-90^{\\circ}$.

In this instance, the phase margin amounts to $45^{\\circ}$, signifying amplifier stability. Without compensation, the original amplifier would have been unstable in such a feedback setup.\n\nThe sacrifice made to achieve stability in this instance is that, with feedback removed, the basic amplifier's unity-gain bandwidth is restricted to $\\left|p_{1}\\right|$, which is significantly reduced compared to its original bandwidth. Additionally, with feedback engaged, the loop gain commences its decline at frequency $\\left|p_{D}\\right|$, diminishing the benefits of feedback as the loop gain wanes. For instance, it was demonstrated in Chapter 8 that shunt feedback at an amplifier's input or output diminishes the basic terminal impedance by $[1+T(j \\omega)]$. Since $T(j \\omega)$ is frequency-dependent, the terminal impedance of a shunt-feedback amplifier will begin to climb when $|T(j \\omega)|$ diminishes.

    "text": "To refine a circuit using the conventional technique of narrowbanding outlined above, capacitance must be introduced to generate a dominant pole of the required size. One approach to accomplish this is depicted in Fig. 9.16, which illustrates the initial two stages of a basic amplifier. A substantial capacitor \\( C \\) is linked between the collectors of the input stage. The output stage, which is presumed to have a relatively broad bandwidth, is not depicted. The differential half-circuit from Fig. 9.16 is presented in Fig. 9.17, and it should be observed that the compensation capacitor is doubled in the half-circuit. The primary contributions to the dominant pole of a circuit of this type (assuming \\( R_{S} \\) is not large) derive from the input capacitance of \\( Q_{4} \\) and the Miller capacitance associated with \\( Q_{4} \\). Therefore, the depicted compensation will diminish the magnitude of the dominant pole of the original amplifier to perform the necessary compensation function. Nonetheless, the higher frequency poles of the amplifier will likely also be altered by the incorporation of \\( C \\). In practice, the optimal approach to achieving the compensation design is to employ computer simulation to ascertain the original pole positions. An initial estimate of \\( C \\) is made under the assumption that the higher frequency poles do not alter in magnitude, and a fresh computer simulation is conducted with \\( C \\) included to verify this assumption. Another estimate of \\( C \\) is then formulated based on the new simulation, and this iterative process typically converges after several iterations.\n\nThe magnitude of the dominant pole in Fig. 9.17 can be approximated using zero-value time constant analysis. However, if the required value of \\( C \\) is exceedingly large, this capacitor will predominate, and a reliable estimate of the dominant pole can be achieved by considering \\( C \\) alone and disregarding other circuit capacitance. In such a scenario, the dominant-pole magnitude is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\left|p_{D}\\right|=\\frac{1}{2 C R}\n\\]\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\nR=R_{L 1} \\| R_{i 4}\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\nR_{i 4}=r_{b 4}+r_{\\pi 4}\n\\]\n\nA drawback of the aforementioned compensation technique is that the necessary value of \\( C \\) is quite substantial (usually \\( >1000 \\mathrm{pF} \\)) and cannot be integrated on a monolithic chip.\n\nMany general-purpose op amps incorporate unity-gain compensation on the monolithic chip and necessitate no additional compensation from the user. (The bandwidth reduction caused by this method when using gains other than unity was described previously.) To implement an internally compensated monolithic op amp, compensation must be achieved using capacitance less than approximately 50 pF. This can be realized using Miller multiplication of the capacitance, as in the 741 op amp, which utilizes a 30 pF compensation capacitor and was analyzed in earlier editions of this text.\n\nAs well as enabling the use of a small capacitor that can be integrated on the monolithic chip, this type of compensation possesses another significant advantage. This is due to the pole splitting phenomenon, in which the dominant pole shifts to a lower frequency while the subsequent pole shifts to a higher frequency. The splitting of the two low-frequency poles in practical op amps is often a rather intricate process involving other higher frequency poles and zeros as well. Nevertheless, the underlying process can be elucidated with the two-stage op-amp model in Fig. 9.18. The input originates from a current \\( i_{s} \\), which is derived from the transconductance of the first stage multiplied by the op-amp differential input voltage. Resistors \\( R_{1} \\) and \\( R_{2} \\) represent the total shunt resistances at the output of the first and second stages, incorporating transistor input and output resistances. Similarly, \\( C_{1} \\) and \\( C_{2} \\) represent the total shunt capacitances at the same locations. Capacitor \\( C \\) represents the transistor collector-base capacitance of the amplifying transistor in the second stage, plus the compensation capacitance.\n\nFor the circuit of Fig. 9.18,\n\n\\[\n-i_{s}=\\frac{v_{1}}{R_{1}}+v_{1} C_{1} s+\\left(v_{1}-v_{o}\\right) C s\n\\]\n\n\\[\ng_{m} v_{1}+\\frac{v_{o}}{R_{2}}+v_{o} C_{2} s+\\left(v_{o}-v_{1}\\right) C s=0\n\\]\n\nFrom these equations, the circuit transfer function has a positive real zero at\n\n\\[\nz=\\frac{g_{m}}{C}\n\\]\n\nwhich usually has such a large magnitude in bipolar circuits that it can be disregarded. This is often not the case in MOS circuits due to their lower \\( g_{m} \\). This point is addressed later.\n\nThe circuit exhibits a two-pole transfer function. If \\( p_{1} \\) and \\( p_{2} \\) are the poles of the circuit, then the denominator of the transfer function can be expressed as\n\n\\[\nD(s)=\\left(1-\\frac{s}{p_{1}}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{s}{p_{2}}\\right)\n\\]\n\nand thus\n\n\\[\nD(s) \\simeq 1-\\frac{s}{p_{1}}+\\frac{s^{2}}{p_{1} p_{2}}\n\\]\n\nif the poles are real and widely spaced, which is typically the case. Note that \\( p_{1} \\) is assumed to be the dominant pole.\n\nIf the coefficients in the transfer function and the denominator are equated, then\n\n\\[\np_{1}=-\\frac{1}{\\left(C_{2}+C\\right) R_{2}+\\left(C_{1}+C\\right) R_{1}+g_{m} R_{2} R_{1} C}\n\\]\n\nand this can be approximated by\n\n\\[\np_{1} \\simeq-\\frac{1}{g_{m} R_{2} R_{1} C}\n\\]\n\nsince the Miller effect due to \\( C \\) will be predominant if \\( C \\) is large and \\( g_{m} R_{1}, g_{m} R_{2} \\gg 1 \\). This equation yields the same result for the dominant pole as is obtained using zero-value time constant analysis.\n\nThe nondominant pole \\( p_{2} \\) can now be approximated by equating coefficients of \\( s^{2} \\) in the transfer function and the denominator and using the value of \\( p_{1} \\).\n\n\\[\np_{2} \\simeq-\\frac{g_{m} C}{C_{2} C_{1}+C\\left(C_{2}+C_{1}\\right)}\n\\]\n\nThis equation indicates that the dominant-pole magnitude \\( \\left|p_{1}\\right| \\) decreases as \\( C \\) increases, whereas \\( \\left|p_{2}\\right| \\) increases as \\( C \\) increases. Thus, increasing \\( C \\) causes the poles to diverge. The dominant pole shifts to a lower frequency because increasing \\( C \\) prolongs the time constant associated with the output node of the first stage in Fig. 9.18. The reason the nondominant pole shifts to a higher frequency is explained below.\n\nThe nondominant pole \\( p_{2} \\) can be interpreted physically by associating it with the output node in Fig. 9.18. Then\n\n\\[\np_{2}=-\\frac{1}{R_{o} C_{T}}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( R_{o} \\) is the output resistance including negative feedback around the second stage through \\( C \\), and \\( C_{T} \\) is the total capacitance from the output node to ground. The output resistance is\n\n\\[\nR_{o}=\\frac{R_{2}}{1+T}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( R_{2} \\) is the open-loop output resistance, and \\( T \\) is the loop gain around the second stage through capacitor \\( C \\), which is the open-loop gain, \\( g_{m} R_{2} \\), multiplied by the feedback factor, \\( f \\). Therefore,\n\n\\[\nR_{o}=\\frac{R_{2}}{1+g_{m} R_{2} f} \\simeq \\frac{1}{g_{m} f}\n\\]\n\nassuming that \\( T=g_{m} R_{2} f \\gg 1 \\). Since \\( p_{2} \\) is a high frequency, we will find \\( f \\) at high frequency \\( \\omega \\), where \\( 1 / \\omega C_{1} \\ll R_{1} \\). Then the feedback around the second stage is governed by a capacitive voltage divider and\n\n\\[\nf \\simeq \\frac{C}{C+C_{1}}\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\nR_{o} \\simeq \\frac{C+C_{1}}{g_{m} C}\n\\]\n\nThe total capacitance from the output node to ground is \\( C_{2} \\) in parallel with the series combination of \\( C \\) and \\( C_{1} \\):\n\n\\[\nC_{T}=C_{2}+\\frac{C C_{1}}{C+C_{1}}=\\frac{C C_{2}+C_{1} C_{2}+C C_{1}}{C+C_{1}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for \\( R_{o} \\) and \\( C_{T} \\) into the equation for \\( p_{2} \\) yields the final result for \\( p_{2} \\). These equations demonstrate that increasing \\( C \\) enhances the feedback factor but has minimal impact on the total capacitance in parallel with the output node because \\( C \\) is in series with \\( C_{1} \\). As a result, increasing \\( C \\) diminishes the output resistance and elevates the frequency of the nondominant pole. In the limit as \\( C \\rightarrow \\infty \\), the feedback factor approaches unity, and \\( p_{2} \\rightarrow-g_{m} /\\left(C_{2}+C_{1}\\right) \\). In practice, however, the feedback factor is less than unity, which constrains the increase in the magnitude of the nondominant pole frequency.\n\nThe graph in Fig. 9.19 is a pole-zero plot depicted in the complex plane, specifically the s-plane, where the horizontal axis is labeled as \\( \\sigma \\) (real part) and the vertical axis is labeled as \\( j\\omega \\) (imaginary part). This type of graph is used to analyze the stability and frequency response of a circuit as a parameter \\( C \\) is varied.\n\nAxes Labels and Units:\n- **Horizontal Axis (\\( \\sigma \\))**: Represents the real part of the poles, indicating stability with negative values.\n- **Vertical Axis (\\( j\\omega \\))**: Represents the imaginary part of the poles, showing oscillatory behavior.\n\nOverall Behavior and Trends:\n- As \\( C \\) increases from zero, the poles of the circuit move along the real axis. Initially, the poles are situated at specific positions determined by the values \\(-1/(R_2C_2)\\) and \\(-1/(R_1C_1)\\).\n- The poles diverge and move towards different asymptotic positions as \\( C \\) becomes very large, indicating changes in the circuit's frequency response.\n\nKey Features and Technical Details:\n- **Initial Pole Positions**:\n  - \\(-1/(R_2C_2)\\): Initial position of one pole when \\( C = 0 \\).\n  - \\(-1/(R_1C_1)\\): Initial position of the other pole when \\( C = 0 \\).\n- **Asymptotic Pole Positions**: As \\( C \\rightarrow \\infty \\), the poles approach the positions:\n  - \\(-g_mC/(C_2C_1 + C(C_2 + C_1))\\): Reflects the influence of increasing \\( C \\).\n  - \\(-1/(g_mR_1R_2C)\\): Shows the change in pole position with large \\( C \\).\n- **Pole Splitting**: A key event where the poles diverge from their initial positions, indicating a change in the system's dynamics.\n\nAnnotations and Specific Data Points:\n- The plot includes annotations such as \"Poles split,\" highlighting the point where the poles begin to separate.\n- Specific markers (e.g., squares and crosses) denote the initial and asymptotic positions of the poles.\n\nThis graph visually demonstrates how the poles of the circuit shift as the capacitance \\( C \\) is increased, providing insights into the stability and frequency behavior of the system.\n\nFigure 9.19 Locus of the poles of the circuit of Fig. 9.18 as \\( C \\) is increased from zero, for the case \\( -1 /\\left(R_{1} C_{1}\\right)>-1 /\\left(R_{2} C_{2}\\right) \\).\n\nOn the other hand, with \\( C=0 \\), the poles of the circuit of Fig. 9.18 are\n\n\\[\np_{1}=-\\frac{1}{R_{1} C_{1}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\np_{2}=-\\frac{1}{R_{2} C_{2}}\n\\]\n\nThus, as \\( C \\) increases from zero, the locus of the poles of the circuit of Fig. 9.18 is as shown in Fig. 9.19.\n\nAnother explanation of pole splitting is as follows. The circuit in Fig. 9.18 has two poles. The compensation capacitor across the second stage provides feedback and causes the second stage to behave like an integrator. The two poles diverge as \\( C \\) increases. One pole moves to a low frequency (toward dc), and the other moves to a high frequency (toward \\( -\\infty \\)) to approximate an ideal integrator, which has only one pole at dc.\n\nThe previous calculations have shown how compensation of an amplifier by addition of a large Miller capacitance to a single transistor stage causes the nondominant pole to move to a much higher frequency. For comparison, consider compensating the circuit in Fig. 9.18 without adding capacitance to \\( C \\) by making \\( C_{1} \\) large enough to produce a dominant pole. Then the pole can be calculated from the equation for \\( p_{1} \\) as \\( p_{1} \\simeq-1 / R_{1} C_{1} \\). The nondominant pole can be estimated by equating coefficients of \\( s^{2} \\) in the transfer function and the denominator and using this value of \\( p_{1} \\). This gives \\( p_{2} \\simeq-1 / R_{2}\\left(C_{2}+C\\right) \\). This value of \\( p_{2} \\) is approximately the same as that given by the equation for \\( p_{2} \\) when \\( C=0 \\) and before pole splitting occurs. Thus, creation of a dominant pole in the circuit of Fig. 9.18 by making \\( C_{1} \\) large will result in a second pole magnitude \\( \\left|p_{2}\\right| \\) that is much smaller than that obtained if the dominant pole is created by increasing \\( C \\). As a consequence, the realizable bandwidth of the circuit when compensated in this manner is much smaller than that obtained with Miller-effect compensation. Also, without using the Miller effect, the required compensation capacitor often would be too large to be included on a monolithic chip. The same general conclusions are true in the more complex situation that exists in many practical op amps.\n\nThe results derived in this section are useful in further illuminating the considerations of Section 7.3.3. In that section, it was stated that in a common-source cascade, the presence of drain-gate capacitance tends to cause pole splitting and to produce a dominant-pole situation. If the equivalent circuit of Fig. 9.18 is taken as a representative section of a cascade of common-source stages ( \\( C_{2} \\) is the input capacitance of the following stage) and capacitor \\( C \\) is taken as \\( C_{g d} \\), the calculations of this section show that the presence of \\( C_{g d} \\) does, in fact, tend to produce a dominant-pole situation because of the pole splitting that occurs. Thus, the zero-value time constant approach gives a good estimate of \\( \\omega_{-3 \\mathrm{~dB}} \\) in such circuits.\n\nThe theory of compensation that was developed in this chapter was illustrated with some bipolar-transistor circuit examples. The theory applies in general to any active circuit, but the unique device parameters of MOSFETs cause some of the approximations that were made in the preceding analyses to become invalid. The special aspects of MOS amplifier compensation are now considered."

    "text": "To compensate a circuit using the narrowbanding method, adding capacitance is necessary to create a dominant pole with the desired magnitude. One method to achieve this is demonstrated in Fig. 9.16, which illustrates the first two stages of a simple amplifier. A large capacitor C is connected between the collectors of the input stage, while the output stage, which is assumed to be relatively broadband, is not shown. The differential half-circuit of Fig. 9.16 is depicted in Fig. 9.17, and it should be noted that the compensation capacitor is doubled in the half-circuit. The dominant pole of a circuit of this type is mainly influenced by the input capacitance of Q4 and the Miller capacitance associated with Q4. Therefore, the compensation as shown will reduce the magnitude of the dominant pole of the original amplifier to perform the required compensation function. However, the higher frequency poles of the amplifier will also be affected by the addition of C. In practice, the best approach to compensation is to use computer simulation to determine the original pole positions. A first estimate of C is made assuming that the higher frequency poles do not change in magnitude, and a new computer simulation is conducted with C included to verify this assumption. Another estimate of C is then made based on the new simulation, and this process usually converges after several iterations.\n\nThe magnitude of the dominant pole of Fig. 9.17 can be estimated using zero-value time constant analysis. However, if the required value of C is very large, this capacitor will dominate, and a good estimate of the dominant pole can be obtained by considering C only and ignoring other circuit capacitance. In that case, the dominant-pole magnitude is given by Equation 9.22.\n\nOne disadvantage of the above method of compensation is that the required value of C is quite large (typically >1000 pF) and cannot be realized on a monolithic chip.\n\nMany general-purpose op amps have unity-gain compensation included on the monolithic chip and require no further compensation from the user. (The sacrifice in bandwidth caused by this technique when using gain other than unity was described earlier.) To realize an internally compensated monolithic op amp, compensation must be achieved using capacitance less than about 50 pF. This can be achieved using Miller multiplication of the capacitance, as in the 741 op amp, which uses a 30 pF compensation capacitor and was analyzed in previous editions of this book.\n\nAs well as allowing the use of a small capacitor that can be integrated on the monolithic chip, this type of compensation has another significant advantage. This is due to the phenomenon of pole splitting, in which the dominant pole moves to a lower frequency while the next pole moves to a higher frequency. The splitting of the two low-frequency poles in practical op amps is often a rather complex process involving other higher frequency poles and zeros as well. However, the process involved can be illustrated with the two-stage op-amp model in Fig. 9.18. The input is from a current is, which stems from the transconductance of the first stage times the op-amp differential input voltage. Resistors R1 and R2 represent the total shunt resistances at the output of the first and second stages, including transistor input and output resistances. Similarly, C1 and C2 represent the total shunt capacitances at the same places. Capacitor C represents transistor collector-base capacitance of the amplifying transistor in the second stage plus the compensation capacitance.\n\nFor the circuit of Fig. 9.18, the circuit transfer function has a positive real zero at Equation 9.27a, which usually has such a large magnitude in bipolar circuits that it can be neglected. This is often not the case in MOS circuits because of their lower gm. This point is taken up later.\n\nThe circuit has a two-pole transfer function. If p1 and p2 are the poles of the circuit, then the denominator of Equation 9.27 can be written as Equation 9.28 and Equation 9.29. If the poles are real and widely separated, which is usually true, then Equation 9.30 can be used as an approximation. Note that p1 is assumed to be the dominant pole.\n\nIf the coefficients in Equation 9.27 and Equation 9.30 are equated, then the dominant-pole magnitude |p1| can be approximated by Equation 9.32, since the Miller effect due to C will be dominant if C is large and gmR1, gmR2 >> 1. Equation 9.31 is the same result for the dominant pole as is obtained using zero-value time constant analysis.\n\nThe nondominant pole p2 can now be estimated by equating coefficients of s^2 in Equation 9.27 and Equation 9.30 and using Equation 9.32. Equation 9.33 shows that |p2| increases as C increases. Thus, increasing C causes the poles to split apart. The dominant pole moves to a lower frequency because increasing C increases the time constant associated with the output node of the first stage in Fig. 9.18. The reason the nondominant pole moves to a higher frequency is explained below.\n\nEquation 9.33 can be interpreted physically by associating p2 with the output node in Fig. 9.18. Then Equation 9.33a can be used, where Ro is the output resistance including negative feedback around the second stage through C, and CT is the total capacitance from the output node to ground. The output resistance is given by Equation 9.33b, where R2 is the open-loop output resistance, and T is the loop gain around the second stage through capacitor C, which is the open-loop gain, gmR2, times the feedback factor, f. Therefore, Equation 9.33c can be used, assuming that T = gmR2f >> 1. Since p2 is a high frequency, we will find f at high frequency ω, where 1/ωC1 << R1. Then the feedback around the second stage is controlled by a capacitive voltage divider, and Equation 9.33d can be used. Thus, Equation 9.33e can be used. The total capacitance from the output node to ground is C2 in parallel with the series combination of C and C1, as given by Equation 9.33f. Substituting Equation 9.33e and Equation 9.33f into Equation 9.33a gives Equation 9.33.\n\nEquations 9.33d and 9.33f show that increasing C increases the feedback factor but has little effect on the total capacitance in shunt with the output node because C is in series with C1. As a result, increasing C reduces the output resistance and increases the frequency of the nondominant pole. In the limit as C → ∞, the feedback factor approaches unity, and p2 → -gm/(C2 + C1). In practice, however, Equation 9.33d shows that the feedback factor is less than unity, which limits the increase in the magnitude of the nondominant pole frequency.\n\nThe graph in Figure 9.19 is a pole-zero plot presented in the complex plane, specifically the s-plane, where the horizontal axis is labeled as σ (real part) and the vertical axis is labeled as jω (imaginary part). This type of graph is used to analyze the stability and frequency response of a circuit as a parameter C is varied.\n\nAxes Labels and Units:\n- Horizontal Axis (σ): Represents the real part of the poles, indicating stability with negative values.\n- Vertical Axis (jω): Represents the imaginary part of the poles, showing oscillatory behavior.\n\nOverall Behavior and Trends:\n- As C increases from zero, the poles of the circuit move along the real axis. Initially, the poles are located at specific positions determined by the values -1/(R2C2) and -1/(R1C1).\n- The poles split and move towards different asymptotic positions as C becomes very large, indicating changes in the circuit's frequency response.\n\nKey Features and Technical Details:\n- Initial Pole Positions:\n- -1/(R2C2): Initial position of one pole when C = 0.\n- -1/(R1C1): Initial position of the other pole when C = 0.\n- Asymptotic Pole Positions: As C → ∞, the poles approach the positions:\n- -gmC/(C2C1 + C(C2 + C1)): Reflects the influence of increasing C.\n- -1/(gmR1R2C): Shows the change in pole position with large C.\n- Pole Splitting: A key event where the poles diverge from their initial positions, indicating a change in the system's dynamics.\n\nAnnotations and Specific Data Points:\n- The plot includes annotations such as \"Poles split,\" highlighting the point where the poles begin to separate.\n- Specific markers (e.g., squares and crosses) denote the initial and asymptotic positions of the poles.\n\nThis graph visually demonstrates how the poles of the circuit shift as the capacitance C is increased, providing insights into the stability and frequency behavior of the system.\n\nFigure 9.19 Locus of the poles of the circuit of Fig. 9.18 as C is increased from zero, for the case -1/(R1C1) > -1/(R2C2).\n\nOn the other hand, with C=0, the poles of the circuit of Fig. 9.18 are given by Equation 9.34a and Equation 9.34b. Thus as C increases from zero, the locus of the poles of the circuit of Fig. 9.18 is as shown in Fig. 9.19.\n\nAnother explanation of pole splitting is as follows. The circuit in Fig. 9.18 has two poles. The compensation capacitor across the second stage provides feedback and causes the second stage to act like an integrator. The two poles split apart as C increases. One pole moves to a low frequency (toward dc), and the other moves to a high frequency (toward -∞) to approximate an ideal integrator, which has only one pole at dc.\n\nThe previous calculations have shown how compensation of an amplifier by addition of a large Miller capacitance to a single transistor stage causes the nondominant pole to move to a much higher frequency. For the sake of comparison, consider compensating the circuit in Fig. 9.18 without adding capacitance to C by making C1 large enough to produce a dominant pole. Then the pole can be calculated from Equation 9.31 as p1 ≈ -1/R1C1. The nondominant pole can be estimated by equating coefficients of s^2 in Equation 9.27 and Equation 9.30 and using this value of p1. This gives p2 ≈ -1/R2(C2 + C). This value of p2 is approximately the same as that given by Equation 9.34b, which is for C=0 and is before pole splitting occurs. Thus, creation of a dominant pole in the circuit of Fig. 9.18 by making C1 large will result in a second pole magnitude |p2| that is much smaller than that obtained if the dominant pole is created by increasing C. As a consequence, the realizable bandwidth of the circuit when compensated in this way is much smaller than that obtained with Miller-effect compensation. Also, without using the Miller effect, the required compensation capacitor often would be too large to be included on a monolithic chip. The same general conclusions are true in the more complex situation that exists in many practical op amps.\n\nThe results derived in this section are useful in further illuminating the considerations of Section 7.3.3. In that section, it was stated that in a common-source cascade, the existence of drain-gate capacitance tends to cause pole splitting and to produce a dominant-pole situation. If the equivalent circuit of Fig. 9.18 is taken as a representative section of a cascade of common-source stages (C2 is the input capacitance of the following stage) and capacitor C is taken as Cgd, the calculations of this section show that the presence of Cgd does, in fact, tend to produce a dominant-pole situation because of the pole splitting that occurs. Thus, the zero-value time constant approach gives a good estimate of ω-3dB in such circuits.\n\nThe theory of compensation that was developed in this chapter was illustrated with some bipolar-transistor circuit examples. The theory applies in general to any active circuit, but the unique device parameters of MOSFETs cause some of the approximations that were made in the preceding analyses to become invalid. The special aspects of MOS amplifier compensation are now considered."

(The bandwidth reduction resulting from this technique when using gains other than unity has been described earlier.) To create an internally compensated monolithic operational amplifier, compensation must be accomplished using capacitance less than approximately 50 pF. This can be accomplished using Miller multiplication of the capacitance, as seen in the 741 operational amplifier, which employs a 30 pF compensation capacitor and was analyzed in earlier editions of this book.\n\nIn addition to enabling the use of a compact capacitor that can be integrated onto a monolithic chip, this type of compensation offers another significant advantage. This stems from the phenomenon of pole splitting, which involves the primary pole shifting to a lower frequency while the next pole moves to a higher frequency. The separation of the two low-frequency poles in practical operational amplifiers is often a complex process that involves other higher-frequency poles and zeros as well.

    "text": "The fundamental two-stage CMOS operational amplifier topology, depicted in Fig. 6.16, shares a striking resemblance to its bipolar counterpart. Consequently, the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 9.18 is perfectly suitable for representing the amplifier's second stage along with its compensating capacitance. The circuit's poles can once again be determined by equations (9.32) and (9.33), while the zero is given by (9.27a). However, it is important to note that for MOS transistors, the transconductance \\( g_{m} \\) is typically an order of magnitude lower than that of bipolar transistors. This results in the break frequency, caused by the right half-plane zero in (9.27), potentially dropping below the amplifier's nominal unity-gain frequency. The implications of this are illustrated in Fig. 9.20. At the frequency \\( |z| \\), the amplifier's gain characteristic flattens out due to the zero's contribution of +6 dB/octave to the gain. In this same frequency region, the phase becomes \\( 90^{\\circ} \\) more negative because of the positive real zero. As a result, the amplifier exhibits a negative phase margin and becomes unstable when the influence of the next most dominant pole is felt. Essentially, the zero counteracts the intended gain roll-off for stabilization and simultaneously drives the phase further into the negative direction. Additionally, it is worth noting from (9.33) that the MOSFET's low \\( g_{m} \\) tends to diminish the value of \\( \\left|p_{2}\\right| \\) when compared to a bipolar amplifier.\n\nAn alternative perspective on this issue can be gained by observing Fig. 9.18, which shows that at high frequencies, the feedforward through \\( C \\) tends to dominate the normal gain path via \\( g_{m} \\) of the second stage. This can be seen in the Bode plot of Fig. 9.20, which illustrates the typical gain and phase response of a CMOS operational amplifier. The plot consists of two graphs: the top one representing the magnitude (gain) in decibels (dB), and the bottom one showing the phase in degrees. Both graphs are plotted against frequency, represented on the horizontal axis using a logarithmic scale denoted by \\( \\omega \\) (log scale).\n\nThe magnitude plot (top graph) shows the gain starting at a high value and decreasing at a rate of \\(-6 \\text{ dB/octave}\\) after the first pole \\( |p_1| \\). At the frequency \\( |z| = \\frac{g_m}{C} \\), there is a noticeable flattening, indicating the presence of a zero that halts the gain roll-off. The gain resumes its decline past the second pole \\( |p_2| \\).\n\nThe phase plot (bottom graph) shows the phase starting near 0° and decreasing, reaching approximately \\(-45°\\) at \\( |p_1| \\). The phase continues to decrease beyond the zero \\( |z| \\), passing through \\(-90°\\) and \\(-135°\\) and approaching \\(-180°\\) after \\( |p_2| \\).\n\nThis Bode plot effectively demonstrates the frequency response of a CMOS op amp, highlighting the effects of poles and zeros on both gain and phase.\n\nIf \\( g_{m} \\) is small, the feedforward path does not have the \\( 180^{\\circ} \\) phase shift of the normal gain stage, causing the gain path to lose an inverting stage. Any feedback applied around the overall amplifier will then be positive instead of negative, leading to oscillation. At very high frequencies, \\( C \\) acts like a short circuit, effectively diode-connecting the second stage, which then simply presents a resistive load of \\( \\frac{1}{g_{m}} \\) to the first stage, again showing the loss of \\( 180^{\\circ} \\) of phase shift.\n\nThe right half-plane (RHP) zero is caused by the interaction of current from the \\( g_{m} \\) generator and the frequency-dependent current that flows forward from the input node to the output node through \\( C \\). The current through \\( C \\) in Fig. 9.18 is given by equation (9.35).\n\nThis current can be broken down into two parts: a feedback current \\( i_{fb}=s C v_{o} \\) that flows from the output back toward the input, and a feedforward current \\( i_{ff}=s C v_{1} \\) that flows forward from the input toward the output. This feedforward current is related to \\( v_{1} \\). The current \\( g_{m} v_{1} \\) from the controlled source flows out of the output node and is also related to \\( v_{1} \\). Subtracting these two currents gives the total current at the output node that is related to \\( v_{1} \\), as shown in equation (9.36).\n\nA zero exists in the transfer function where this current equals zero, at \\( z=\\frac{g_{m}}{C} \\).\n\nTo mitigate the effects of the RHP zero, three techniques have been employed. One method is to place a source follower in series with the compensation capacitor, as shown in Fig. 9.21a. The source follower blocks feedforward current through \\( C \\) from reaching the output node, thereby eliminating the zero. This will be demonstrated by analyzing Fig. 9.18 with \\( C \\) replaced by the model in Fig. 9.21b, where the source follower is modeled as an ideal voltage buffer. Equation 9.25 still holds because the same elements are connected to the input node, and the voltage across \\( C \\) remains \\( v_{o}-v_{1} \\). However, summing currents at the output node yields a different equation than (9.26) because no current flows through \\( C \\) to the output node due to the buffer. The new equation is given in (9.37).\n\nCombining this equation with (9.25) gives the transfer function in (9.38).\n\nThe zero has been eliminated. Assuming \\( g_{m} R_{1}, g_{m} R_{2} \\gg 1 \\) and \\( C \\) is large, the same steps that led from (9.27) to (9.32) and (9.33) give the poles in (9.39a) and (9.39b).\n\nThe dominant pole \\( p_{1} \\) remains unchanged, and \\( p_{2} \\) is approximately the same as before if \\( C_{2} \\gg C_{1} \\). This approach eliminates the zero but requires additional devices and bias current. Additionally, the source follower introduces a non-zero dc voltage between its input and output, which affects the output voltage swing since the source-follower transistor must remain in the active region to maintain the desired feedback through \\( C \\).\n\nA second technique to eliminate the RHP zero is to block the feedforward current through \\( C \\) using a common-gate transistor, as illustrated in Fig. 9.22a. This figure shows a two-stage op amp with the addition of two current sources and transistor \\( M_{11} \\). The compensation capacitor is connected from the op-amp output to the source of \\( M_{11} \\). Here, the common-gate \\( M_{11} \\) allows capacitor current to flow from the output back toward the input of the second stage. However, the impedance looking into the drain of \\( M_{11} \\) is very large, resulting in minimal feedforward current through \\( C \\). If the feedforward current is zero, the RHP zero is eliminated. A simplified small-signal model for the common-gate stage and compensation capacitor is shown in Fig. 9.22b, where the common-gate \\( M_{11} \\) is modeled as an ideal current buffer. Replacing \\( C \\) in Fig. 9.18 with the model in Fig. 9.22b yields the equations in (9.40a) and (9.40b).\n\nCombining these equations gives the transfer function in (9.41).\n\nThe zero has been eliminated. Again assuming \\( g_{m} R_{1}, g_{m} R_{2} \\gg 1 \\) and \\( C \\) is large, the poles are given in (9.42a) and (9.42b).\n\nThe dominant pole is the same as before. However, the non-dominant pole \\( p_{2} \\) is different, occurring at a higher frequency than in the previous approaches because \\( C \\gg C_{1} \\) when \\( C \\) and \\( C_{2} \\) are comparable. (In this section, we assume that the two-stage MOS op amp in Fig. 9.18 drives a load capacitor \\( C_{2} \\) that is much larger than the parasitic capacitance \\( C_{1} \\); therefore \\( C_{2} \\gg C_{1} \\).) Thus, a smaller compensation capacitor \\( C \\) can be used here for a given load capacitance \\( C_{2} \\) when compared to the previous approaches. The increase in \\( \\left|p_{2}\\right| \\) arises because the input node is not connected to, and therefore is not loaded by, the compensation capacitor. An advantage of this scheme is that it provides better high-frequency negative-power-supply rejection than Miller compensation. (Power-supply rejection was introduced in Section 6.3.6.) With Miller compensation, \\( C \\) is connected from the gate to drain of \\( M_{6} \\), and it shorts the gate and drain at high frequencies. Assuming \\( V_{g s 6} \\) is approximately constant, high-frequency variations on the negative supply are coupled directly to the op-amp output. Connecting \\( C \\) to the common-gate \\( M_{11} \\) eliminates this coupling path. However, drawbacks of this approach include the need for extra devices and dc current to implement the scheme in Fig. 9.22a. Additionally, if there is a mismatch between the \\( I_{2} \\) current sources, the difference current must flow in the input stage, disrupting the balance in the input stage and affecting the input-offset voltage of the op amp.\n\nWhen the first stage of the op amp employs a cascode transistor, the compensation capacitor can be connected to the source of the cascode device, as shown in Fig. 9.23. This connection reduces the feedforward current through \\( C \\) compared to connecting \\( C \\) to node (8), if the voltage swing at the source of the cascode device is smaller than the swing at its drain. This approach eliminates the feedforward path, and therefore the zero, if the voltage swing at the source of the cascode device is zero. An advantage of this approach is that it avoids the extra devices, bias current, and mismatch problems in Fig. 9.22a.\n\nA third method to address the RHP zero is to insert a resistor in series with the compensation capacitor, as shown in Fig. 9.24a. This resistor modifies the feedforward current instead of eliminating it, allowing the zero to be moved to infinity. If the zero moves to infinity, the total forward current at the output node that is related to \\( v_{1} \\) must go to zero as \\( \\omega \\rightarrow \\infty \\). When \\( \\omega \\rightarrow \\infty \\), capacitor \\( C \\) acts as a short circuit, and the feedforward current is solely due to \\( R_{Z} \\), as given in equation (9.43).\n\nWhen this current is added to the current from the \\( g_{m} \\) source, the total current at the output node that is related to \\( v_{1} \\) is given in equation (9.44).\n\nWhen \\( R_{Z}=1/g_{m} \\), this term vanishes, and the zero is at infinity. The complete transfer function can be found by carrying out an analysis similar to that performed for Fig. 9.18, which gives the transfer function in (9.45).\n\nAssuming \\( g_{m} R_{1}, g_{m} R_{2} \\gg 1 \\) and \\( C \\) is large, the poles can be approximated by the equations in (9.47a), (9.47b), and (9.47c).\n\nThe first two poles, \\( p_{1} \\) and \\( p_{2} \\), are the same as for the original circuit in Fig. 9.18. The third pole is at a very high frequency with \\( \\left|p_{3}\\right| \\gg\\left|p_{2}\\right| \\) because typically \\( C_{1} \\ll C_{2} \\) (since \\( C_{1} \\) is a small parasitic capacitor and \\( C_{2} \\) is the load capacitor) and \\( R_{Z} \\) will be approximately equal to \\( 1/g_{m} \\) if the zero is moved to a high frequency [from (9.44)]. This circuit has three poles because there are three independent capacitors. In contrast, Fig. 9.18 has three capacitors that form a loop, so only two of the capacitor voltages are independent. Thus, there are only two poles associated with that circuit.\n\nThe zero of (9.45) is given in equation (9.48).\n\nThis zero moves to infinity when \\( R_{Z} \\) equals \\( 1/g_{m} \\). Increasing \\( R_{Z} \\) beyond \\( 1/g_{m} \\) moves the zero into the left half-plane, which can be used to provide positive phase shift at high frequencies and improve the phase margin of a feedback circuit that uses this op amp. The movement of the zero for increasing \\( R_{Z} \\) is shown in Fig. 9.24b.\n\nFigure 9.25 shows a Miller-compensated op amp using a resistor \\( R_{Z} \\) in series with the compensation capacitor. In practice, resistor \\( R_{Z} \\) is usually implemented using a MOS transistor biased in the triode region. A MOS transistor operating in the triode region behaves like a linear resistor if \\( V_{d s} \\ll 2\\left(V_{G S}-V_{t}\\right) \\). The on-resistance \\( R_{Z} \\) of the triode device can be made to track \\( 1/g_{m} \\) of the common-source transistor \\( M_{6} \\) if the two transistors are identical and have the same \\( V_{G S}-V_{t} \\). When this MOS transistor is placed to the left of the compensation capacitor as shown in Fig. 9.25, its source voltage is set by \\( V_{g s 6} \\), which is approximately constant. Therefore, \\( V_{G S} \\) of the triode transistor can be set by connecting its gate to a dc bias voltage, which can be generated using replica biasing.\n\nAnother method to shift the zero location that can be used in multistage op amps will be presented in Section 9.4.5.\n\nIn all the compensation approaches described so far, the dominant pole is set by the compensation capacitor \\( C \\) and is independent of the load capacitor \\( C_{2} \\). However, the second pole is a function of \\( C_{2} \\). If the op amp will be used in different applications with a range of load capacitors, the compensation capacitor should be selected to give an acceptable phase margin for the largest \\( C_{2} \\). Then, the phase margin will increase as the load capacitor decreases because \\( \\left|p_{2}\\right| \\) is inversely proportional to \\( C_{2} \\).\n\n#### EXAMPLE\n\nCompensate the two-stage CMOS op amp from the example in Section 6.3.5 (Fig. 6.16) to achieve a phase margin of \\( 45^{\\circ} \\) or larger when driving a load capacitance of 5 pF, assuming the op amp is connected in unity-gain feedback.\n\nWith the op amp in unity-gain feedback, \\( f=1 \\) and the loop gain \\( T=a f=a \\) (or, equivalently, \\( A_{\\infty}=1 \\) and the return ratio \\( \\mathscr{R}=a \\)). Therefore, the phase and gain margins can be determined from Bode plots of \\( |a| \\) and \\( \\mathrm{ph}(a) \\).\n\nThe two-stage op amp and a simplified model for this op amp are shown in Fig. 9.25. In the model, all capacitances that connect to node \\( \\otimes \\) are lumped into \\( C_{1} \\), and all capacitances that connect to the output node are lumped into \\( C_{2} \\). If we apply an input voltage \\( v_{i} \\) in Fig. 9.26, a current \\( i_{1}=g_{m 1} v_{i} \\) is generated. This \\( i_{1} \\) drives a circuit that is the same as the circuit that \\( i_{s} \\) drives in Fig. 9.18. Therefore, the equations for the two poles and one zero for the circuit in Fig. 9.18 apply here with \\( i_{s}=g_{m 1} v_{i}, g_{m}=g_{m 6}, R_{1}=r_{o 2} \\| r_{o 4} \\), and \\( R_{2}=r_{o 6} \\| r_{o 7} \\).\n\nWe will use Miller compensation with a series resistance to eliminate the zero. To achieve a \\( 45^{\\circ} \\) phase margin, the compensation capacitor \\( C \\) should be chosen so that \\( \\left|p_{2}\\right| \\) equals the unity-gain frequency (assuming the zero has been eliminated and \\( \\left|p_{3}\\right| \\gg\\left|p_{2}\\right| \\)). Since the gain roll-off from \\( \\left|p_{1}\\right| \\) to \\( \\left|p_{2}\\right| \\) is \\(-6 \\mathrm{~dB} /\\) octave, \\( |a(j \\omega)| \\cdot \\omega \\) is constant from \\( \\left|p_{1}\\right| \\) to \\( \\left|p_{2}\\right| \\). Therefore,\n\n$$\na_{o} \\cdot\\left|p_{1}\\right|=1 \\cdot\\left|p_{2}\\right|\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\na_{o}=g_{m 1}\\left(r_{o 2} \\| r_{o 4}\\right) g_{m 6}\\left(r_{o 6} \\| r_{o 7}\\right)=g_{m 1} R_{1} g_{m 6} R_{2}\n$$\n\nis the dc gain of the op amp.

    "text": "In Figure 6.16, the fundamental two-stage CMOS operational amplifier topology is fundamentally similar to its bipolar equivalent. As a result, the circuit depicted in Fig. 9.18 can be employed to symbolize the second stage, including its compensation capacitor. The circuit's poles are defined by equations (9.32) and (9.33), while the zero is given by equation (9.27a). For MOS transistors, however, the $g_{m}$ value is generally about an order of magnitude less than that of a bipolar transistor, and the break frequency caused by the right half-plane zero in equation (9.27) could potentially drop below the amplifier's nominal unity-gain frequency. This impact is illustrated in Fig. 9.20. At the frequency $|z|$, the amplifier's gain characteristics become flat due to the +6 dB/octave contribution from the zero. Concurrently, the phase becomes 90° more negative due to the positive real zero, causing the amplifier to exhibit a negative phase margin and become unstable when the influence of the next most dominant pole is sensed. Essentially, the zero halts the intended gain roll-off for stability and simultaneously pushes the phase into the negative territory. Furthermore, note from equation (9.33) that the low $g_{m}$ of the MOSFET tends to decrease the magnitude of $\\left|p_{2}\\right|$ in comparison to a bipolar amplifier.\n\nAn alternative perspective on this issue can be obtained by observing that in Fig. 9.18, at high frequencies, feedforward via $C$ often dominates the conventional gain path through the second stage's $g_{m}$.\n\nFigure 9.20 displays the typical gain and phase characteristics of the CMOS op amp from Fig. 6.16. The graph is a Bode plot that depicts the standard gain and phase responses of a CMOS operational amplifier as described in the provided context. The plot comprises two distinct graphs: the top one shows the magnitude (gain) in decibels (dB), while the bottom one represents the phase in degrees. Both graphs are plotted against frequency, which is depicted on the horizontal axis using a logarithmic scale, labeled as \\( \\omega \\) (log scale).\n\nMagnitude Plot (Top Graph):\n- **Vertical Axis**: Represents the magnitude of the gain \\( \\left| \\frac{V_o}{V_i}(j\\omega) \\right| \\) in decibels (dB).\n- **Horizontal Axis**: Frequency \\( \\omega \\) on a logarithmic scale.\n- **Behavior**:\n  - The gain initiates at a high value and diminishes at a rate of \\(-6 \\text{ dB/octave}\\) post the first pole \\( |p_1| \\).\n  - At the frequency \\( |z| = \\frac{g_m}{C} \\), a notable flattening occurs, signifying the presence of a zero that halts the gain roll-off.\n  - Beyond the second pole \\( |p_2| \\), the gain resumes its decline.\n- **Key Points**:\n  - \\( |p_1| \\) and \\( |p_2| \\) are marked as the first and second pole frequencies, respectively.\n  - \\( |z| = \\frac{g_m}{C} \\) is marked as the zero frequency.\n\nPhase Plot (Bottom Graph):\n- **Vertical Axis**: Represents the phase of the gain \\( \\text{ph} \\left( \\frac{V_o}{V_i}(j\\omega) \\right) \\) in degrees.\n- **Horizontal Axis**: Frequency \\( \\omega \\) on a logarithmic scale.\n- **Behavior**:\n  - The phase begins near 0° and decreases, reaching approximately \\(-45°\\) at \\( |p_1| \\).\n  - Beyond the zero \\( |z| \\), the phase continues to drop, crossing \\(-90°\\) and \\(-135°\\) and approaching \\(-180°\\) after \\( |p_2| \\).\n- **Key Points**:\n  - The phase plot illustrates the standard phase lag associated with poles and the phase lead introduced by the zero.\n\nThis Bode plot effectively demonstrates the frequency response of a CMOS op amp, emphasizing the effects of poles and zeros on both gain and phase.\n\nIn cases where $g_{m}$ is small, the feedforward path lacks the $180^{\\circ}$ phase shift of the typical gain stage, causing the gain path to lose an inverting stage. Consequently, any feedback applied to the overall amplifier will be positive rather than negative, leading to oscillation. At extremely high frequencies, $C$ behaves like a short circuit, diode-connecting the second stage, presenting a resistive load of $1 / g_{m}$ to the first stage, again demonstrating the loss of $180^{\\circ}$ phase shift.\n\nThe right half-plane (RHP) zero is due to the interaction of current from the $g_{m}$ generator and the frequency-dependent current flowing forward from the input node to the output node through $C$. The current through $C$ in Fig. 9.18 is expressed as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{c}=s C\\left(v_{o}-v_{1}\\right) \\tag{9.35}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis current can be divided into two parts: a feedback current $i_{f b}=s C v_{o}$ that flows from the output back toward the input and a feedforward current $i_{f f}=s C v_{1}$ that flows forward from the input toward the output. This feedforward current is related to $v_{1}$. The current $g_{m} v_{1}$ from the controlled source exits the output node and is also associated with $v_{1}$. By subtracting these two currents, we obtain the total current at the output node that is related to $v_{1}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{v_{1}}=\\left(g_{m}-s C\\right) v_{1} \\tag{9.36}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nA zero exists in the transfer function where this current equals zero, at $z=g_{m} / C$.\n\nThree techniques have been utilized to nullify the impact of the RHP zero. One approach involves inserting a source follower in series with the compensation capacitor, as depicted in Fig. 9.21a. This source follower obstructs feedforward current through $C$ from reaching the output node, thus eliminating the zero. This will be illustrated by analyzing Fig. 9.18 with $C$ replaced by the model in Fig. 9.21b. Here, the source follower is modeled as an ideal voltage buffer. Equation 9.25 remains valid because the same elements are connected to the input node, and the voltage across $C$ remains $v_{o}-v_{1}$. However, summing currents at the output node results in a different equation than (9.26) because no current flows through $C$ to the output node due to the buffer. The new equation is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ng_{m} v_{1}+\\frac{v_{o}}{R_{2}}+s C_{2} v_{o}=0 \\tag{9.37}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nCombining this equation with (9.25) yields:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{v_{o}}{i_{s}}=\\frac{g_{m} R_{1} R_{2}}{1+s\\left[R_{1}\\left(C_{1}+C\\right)+R_{2} C_{2}+g_{m} R_{2} R_{1} C\\right]+s^{2} R_{1} R_{2} C_{2}\\left(C_{1}+C\\right)} \\tag{9.38}\n\\end{equation*}\n```"

For MOS transistors, the transconductance \\( g_{m} \\) is usually an order of magnitude lower than that of bipolar transistors, which can result in a break frequency associated with the right half-plane zero in (9.27) dipping below the amplifier's nominal unity-gain frequency. This effect is illustrated in Fig. 9.20, where at frequency \\( |z| \\), the amplifier's gain characteristic flattens due to the zero's contribution of +6 dB/octave to the gain. In this region, the phase is made \\( 90^{\\circ} \\) more negative by the positive real zero, leading to a negative phase margin and instability as the influence of the next dominant pole is felt. Effectively, the zero counteracts the intended gain roll-off for stabilization and simultaneously pushes the phase in the negative direction. Additionally, the low \\( g_{m} \\) of the MOSFET tends to diminish \\( \\left|p_{2}\\right| \\) compared to a bipolar amplifier, as indicated by (9.33).\n\nAn alternative perspective on this issue is that at high frequencies, the feedforward through \\( C \\) can dominate the normal gain path via \\( g_{m} \\) of the second stage, as shown in Fig. 9.18. The feedforward path lacks the \\( 180^{\\circ} \\) phase shift of the normal gain stage, causing the gain path to lose an inverting stage. Consequently, any feedback applied around the amplifier becomes positive instead of negative, potentially leading to oscillation. At very high frequencies, \\( C \\) acts as a short circuit, effectively diode-connecting the second stage and presenting a resistive load of \\( 1/g_{m} \\) to the first stage, once again indicating the absence of a \\( 180^{\\circ} \\) phase shift.\n\nThe right half-plane zero is a result of the interplay between the current from the \\( g_{m} \\) generator and the frequency-dependent current flowing forward from the input node to the output node through \\( C \\). The current through \\( C \\) in Fig. 9.18 is given by equation (9.35), which can be split into feedback and feedforward components. The zero occurs in the transfer function where the total current at the output node related to \\( v_{1} \\) equals zero, at \\( z=g_{m}/C \\).\n\nTo mitigate the impact of the right half-plane zero, three techniques have been employed. One method involves placing a source follower in series with the compensation capacitor, as depicted in Fig. 9.21a. The source follower obstructs feedforward current through \\( C \\) from reaching the output node, thereby eliminating the zero. This is demonstrated by analyzing Fig. 9.18 with \\( C \\) replaced by the model in Fig. 9.21b, where the source follower is represented as an ideal voltage buffer. Equation 9.25 remains valid since the same elements are connected to the input node, and the voltage across \\( C \\) remains \\( v_{o}-v_{1} \\). However, summing currents at the output node yields a different equation than (9.26) due to the absence of current flowing through \\( C \\) to the output node because of the buffer. The new equation is given by (9.37), and combining it with (9.25) results in (9.38).\n\nThe second approach to addressing the right half-plane zero is to block the feedforward current through \\( C \\) using a common-gate transistor, as shown in Fig. 9.22a. This figure depicts a two-stage op amp with the addition of two current sources and transistor \\( M_{11} \\). The compensation capacitor is connected from the op-amp output to the source of \\( M_{11} \\). Here, the common-gate \\( M_{11} \\) permits capacitor current to flow from the output back towards the input of the second stage. However, the impedance looking into the drain of \\( M_{11} \\) is very high, resulting in minimal feedforward current through \\( C \\). If the feedforward current is negligible, the right half-plane zero is eradicated. A simplified small-signal model for the common-gate stage and compensation capacitor is shown in Fig. 9.22b, where the common-gate \\( M_{11} \\) is modeled as an ideal current buffer. Replacing \\( C \\) in Fig. 9.18 with the model in Fig. 9.22b yields equations (9.40a) and (9.40b), which, when combined, give (9.41).\n\nA third technique to counteract the right half-plane zero is to insert a resistor in series with the compensation capacitor, as illustrated in Fig. 9.24a. Instead of eliminating the feedforward current, the resistor modifies it, enabling the zero to be shifted to infinity. If the zero is moved to infinity, the total forward current at the output node related to \\( v_{1} \\) must approach zero as \\( \\omega \\rightarrow \\infty \\). When \\( \\omega \\rightarrow \\infty \\), capacitor \\( C \\) behaves as a short circuit, and thus the feedforward current is primarily due to \\( R_{Z} \\), as given by equation (9.43). The complete transfer function can be derived by performing an analysis similar to that for Fig. 9.18, resulting in equation (9.45), where \\( b \\), \\( c \\), and \\( d \\) are defined by equations (9.46a), (9.46b), and (9.46c), respectively. Assuming \\( g_{m} R_{1} \\), \\( g_{m} R_{2} \\gg 1 \\), and \\( C \\) is large, the poles can be approximated by equations (9.47a), (9.47b), and (9.47c). The zero of (9.45) is given by equation (9.48), and this zero moves to infinity when \\( R_{Z} \\) equals \\( 1/g_{m} \\). Increasing \\( R_{Z} \\) beyond \\( 1/g_{m} \\) shifts the zero into the left half-plane, which can be utilized to provide positive phase shift at high frequencies and enhance the phase margin of a feedback circuit using this op amp. The movement of the zero with increasing \\( R_{Z} \\) is depicted in Fig. 9.24b.\n\nIn all the compensation methods discussed, the dominant pole is determined by the compensation capacitor \\( C \\) and is independent of the load capacitor \\( C_{2} \\). However, the second pole is dependent on \\( C_{2} \\). If the op amp is to be used in various applications with differing load capacitors, the compensation capacitor should be chosen to ensure an acceptable phase margin for the largest \\( C_{2} \\). As the load capacitor decreases, the phase margin will increase because \\( \\left|p_{2}\\right| \\) is inversely proportional to \\( C_{2} \\).\n\nAn example is provided to demonstrate how to compensate a two-stage CMOS op amp to achieve a phase margin of \\( 45^{\\circ} \\) or greater when driving a load capacitance of 5 pF, assuming the op amp is connected in unity-gain feedback. The analysis involves using Miller compensation with a series resistance to eliminate the zero and selecting the compensation capacitor \\( C \\) to ensure \\( \\left|p_{2}\\right| \\) equals the unity-gain frequency. SPICE simulations confirm the effectiveness of this compensation technique in improving the phase margin and stability of the op amp."
