When the gate voltage is very negative, positive charge is attracted to the channel region, resulting in what is called an accumulated channel. In this state, the transistor is off and only leakage current will flow. On the other hand, when a positive voltage is applied to the gate, the channel changes from a p-type to an n-type, allowing current to flow between the drain and the source. The gate-source voltage at which this transition occurs is referred to as the transistor threshold voltage, denoted as V_tn."

As the gate-source voltage increases beyond the threshold, the density of electrons in the channel increases, enhancing the conductance. This relationship can be described by the equation Q_n = C_ox(V_GS - V_tn) = C_ox V_eff, where Q_n is the charge density of electrons and C_ox is the gate capacitance per unit area."

When the gate voltage is very negative, as shown in Fig. 1.9(a), positive charge is attracted to the channel region. Since the substrate is originally doped p-, this negative gate voltage increases the channel doping to p+, resulting in what is called an accumulated channel. The n+ source and drain regions are separated from the p+ channel region by depletion regions, resulting in the equivalent circuit of two back-to-back diodes. Thus, only leakage current will flow even if one of the source or drain voltages becomes large (unless the drain voltage becomes so large as to cause the transistor to break down)."

For small positive gate voltages, the positive carriers in the channel under the gate are initially repulsed and the channel changes from a p- doping level to a depletion region. As a more positive gate voltage is applied, the gate attracts negative charge from the source and drain regions, and the channel becomes an n region with mobile electrons connecting the drain and source regions. In short, a sufficiently large positive gate-source voltage changes the channel beneath the gate to an n region, and the channel is said to be inverted."

It is modeled as an increase in the threshold voltage \\( V_{tn} \\) with increasing source-to-body reverse-bias. This effect occurs because the reverse-bias voltage increases the depletion region width, effectively raising the threshold voltage required to form the channel."

The term \\( \\gamma (\\sqrt{|2\\phi_F + V_{SB}|} - \\sqrt{|2\\phi_F|}) \\) accounts for the increase in threshold voltage due to the body effect."
