Phosphorus (P) and arsenic (As) are examples of donor elements, also termed n-type dopants because the resulting free carriers are negatively charged. In n-type doping, the total number of negative carriers or electrons nearly matches the doping concentration, far exceeding the free electron count in intrinsic silicon. Mathematically,\n\\$\\$\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{n}_{\\mathrm{n}}=\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{D}} \\tag{1.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n$$\nwhere $n_{n}$ is the free-electron concentration in n-type material and $N_{D}$ is the doping concentration (D for donor). Conversely, the number of free holes in n-doped material is significantly lower than in intrinsic silicon and can be expressed [Sze, 1981] as\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{p}_{\\mathrm{n}}=\\frac{\\mathrm{n}_{\\mathrm{i}}^{2}}{\\mathrm{~N}_{\\mathrm{D}}} \\tag{1.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n\\$\\$\n\nLikewise, doping silicon with trivalent atoms, such as boron (B), results in a positive carrier or hole concentration roughly equal to the acceptor concentration, $\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{A}}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{p}_{\\mathrm{p}}=\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{A}} \\tag{1.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand the number of negative carriers in p-type silicon, $\\mathrm{n}_{\\mathrm{p}}$, is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{n}_{\\mathrm{p}}=\\frac{\\mathrm{n}_{\\mathrm{i}}^{2}}{\\mathrm{~N}_{\\mathrm{A}}} \\tag{1.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$"

    "text": "To create a diode, also known as a pn junction, one portion of a semiconductor is doped with n-type material, while an adjacent section is doped with p-type material, as depicted in Fig. 1.1. The diode, or junction, forms between the $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$ region and the n region, where superscripts denote the relative doping levels. For instance, the $\\mathrm{p}^{-}$ bulk region in Fig. 1.1 might have an impurity concentration of $5 \\times 10^{21}$ carriers $/ \\mathrm{m}^{3}$, whereas the $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{n}^{+}$ regions are doped more heavily, reaching values around $10^{25}$ to $10^{27}$ carriers $/ \\mathrm{m}^{3}$. Additionally, the metal contacts to the diode (in this case, aluminum) are connected to the heavily doped regions to prevent the formation of a Schottky diode. (Schottky diodes are discussed on page 13.) Therefore, to avoid creating a Schottky diode, the connection to the n region is actually made via the $\\mathrm{n}^{+}$ region.\n\nIn the $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$ side, a large number of free positive carriers are present, while the n side has many free negative carriers. The holes in the $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$ side tend to disperse or diffuse into the n side, and the free electrons in the n side tend to diffuse to the $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$ side. This process resembles the random diffusion of two gases. This diffusion reduces the concentration of free carriers in the region between the two sides. As the carriers diffuse, they recombine. Each electron that diffuses from the n side to the p side leaves behind a bound positive charge near the transition region. Similarly, each hole that diffuses from the p side leaves behind a bound electron near the transition region. The final result is illustrated in Fig. 1.2. This diffusion of free carriers forms a depletion region at the junction where no free carriers exist, with a net negative charge on the $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$ side and a net positive charge on the n side. The total exposed or bound charge on both sides of the junction must be equal to maintain charge neutrality. This balance causes the depletion region to extend further into the more lightly doped n side than into the $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$ side.\n\nAs these bound charges are revealed, an electric field develops from the n side to the $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$ side. This electric field creates a potential difference between the n and $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$ sides, known as the built-in voltage of the junction.

For instance, if $N_{A} \\gg N_{D}$ (i.e., the p region is more heavily doped), we approximate (1.9) and (1.10) as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{x}_{\\mathrm{n}} \\cong\\left[\\frac{2 \\mathrm{~K}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\varepsilon_{0}\\left(\\Phi_{0}+\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{R}}\\right)}{\\mathrm{qN}}\\right]^{1 / 2} \\mathrm{x}_{\\mathrm{p}} \\cong\\left[\\frac{2 \\mathrm{~K}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\varepsilon_{0}\\left(\\Phi_{0}+\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{R}}\\right) \\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{D}}}{q N_{A}^{2}}\\right]^{1 / 2} \\tag{1.11}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{x_{n}}{x_{p}} \\cong \\frac{N_{A}}{N_{D}} \\tag{1.12}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis scenario is termed a single-sided diode.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 1.3\n\nFor a pn junction with $\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{A}}=10^{25}$ holes $/ \\mathrm{m}^{3}$ and $\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{D}}=10^{22}$ electrons $/ \\mathrm{m}^{3}$, determine the depletion region depths for a 1-V reverse-bias voltage.\n\n#### Solution\n\nGiven $\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{A}} \\gg>\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{D}}$ and $\\Phi_{0}=0.9 \\mathrm{~V}$ from Example 1.2, using (1.11) yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{gather*}\n\\mathrm{x}_{\\mathrm{n}}=\\left[\\frac{2 \\times 11.8 \\times 8.854 \\times 10^{-12} \\times 1.9}{1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\times 10^{22}}\\right]^{1 / 2}=0.50 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}  \\tag{1.13}\\\\\n\\mathrm{x}_{\\mathrm{p}}=\\frac{\\mathrm{x}_{\\mathrm{n}}}{\\left(\\mathrm{~N}_{\\mathrm{A}} / \\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{D}}\\right)}=0.50 \\mathrm{~nm} \\tag{1.14}\n\\end{gather*}\n$$\n\nNote that the depletion region in the lightly doped n region is 1,000 times wider than in the heavily doped p region.\n\nThe charge stored in the depletion region per unit cross-sectional area is calculated by multiplying the depletion width by the immobile charge concentration (approximately q times the doping density). For the n side, multiplying (1.9) by $\\mathrm{qN}_{\\mathrm{D}}$ gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{Q}^{+}=\\left[2 \\mathrm{qK}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\varepsilon_{0}\\left(\\Phi_{0}+\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{R}}\\right) \\frac{\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{A}} \\mathrm{~N}_{\\mathrm{D}}}{\\mathrm{~N}_{\\mathrm{A}}+\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{D}}}\\right]^{1 / 2} \\tag{1.15}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis charge equals $\\mathrm{Q}^{-}$ on the p side due to charge equality.

Thus, the charge stored in the depletion region nonlinearly depends on the applied reverse-bias voltage, modeled by nonlinear depletion capacitance.\n\nFor small reverse-bias voltage changes, the equivalent small-signal capacitance, $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{j}}$, is found by differentiating (1.15) with respect to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{R}}$, resulting in\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{j}=\\frac{\\mathrm{dQ}^{+}}{d V_{R}}=\\left[\\frac{q K_{s} \\varepsilon_{0}}{2\\left(\\Phi_{0}+V_{R}\\right)} \\frac{N_{A} N_{D}}{N_{A}+N_{D}}\\right]^{1 / 2}=\\frac{C_{j 0}}{\\sqrt{1+\\frac{V_{B}}{\\Phi_{0}}}} \\tag{1.17}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $C_{j 0}$ is the zero-bias depletion capacitance per unit area, given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{j} 0=\\sqrt{\\frac{q K_{s} \\varepsilon_{0}}{2 \\Phi_{0}} \\frac{N_{A} N_{D}}{N_{A}+N_{D}}} \\tag{1.18}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor a one-sided diode with $\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{A}} \\gg \\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{D}}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{j}}=\\left[\\frac{\\mathrm{qK}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\varepsilon_{0} \\mathrm{~N}_{\\mathrm{D}}}{2\\left(\\Phi_{0}+\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{R}}\\right)}\\right]^{1 / 2}=\\frac{\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{j} 0}}{\\sqrt{1+\\frac{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{R}}}{\\Phi_{0}}}} \\tag{1.19}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{j 0}=\\sqrt{\\frac{q K_{s} \\varepsilon_{0} N_{D}}{2 \\Phi_{0}}} \\tag{1.20}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nMany junctions in integrated circuits are one-sided, with the lightly doped side being the substrate or well, and the heavily doped side forming contacts to interconnecting metal. From (1.20), the depletion capacitance in these junctions is roughly independent of the heavily doped side's concentration and proportional to the square root of the lightly doped side's concentration. Thus, lighter doping in substrates reduces depletion capacitance, incentivizing the use of lightly doped substrates.\n\nFinally, combining (1.15) and (1.18) gives the immobile charge on either side of a reverse-biased junction as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{Q}=2 \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{j} 0} \\Phi_{0} \\sqrt{1+\\frac{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{R}}}{\\Phi_{0}}} \\tag{1.21}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAs shown in Example 1.6, this equation aids in approximating the large-signal charging or discharging time for a reverse-biased diode.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 1.4\n\nFor a pn junction with $\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{A}}=10^{25}$ holes $/ \\mathrm{m}^{3}$ and $\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{D}}=10^{22}$ electrons $/ \\mathrm{m}^{3}$, calculate the total zero-bias depletion capacitance for a diode area of $10 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\times 10 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ and its depletion capacitance at a 3-V reverse-bias voltage.\n\n#### Solution\n\nUsing (1.20),\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{j 0}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\times 11.8 \\times 8.854 \\times 10^{-12} \\times 10^{22}}{2 \\times 0.9}}=304.7 \\mu \\mathrm{~F} / \\mathrm{m}^{2} \\tag{1.22}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWith a diode area of $100 \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{~m}^{2}$, the total zero-bias depletion capacitance is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{T}-\\mathrm{j} 0}=100 \\times 10^{-12} \\times 304.7 \\times 10^{-6}=30.5 \\mathrm{fF} \\tag{1.23}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAt a 3-V reverse-bias voltage, from (1.19),\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{T}-\\mathrm{j}}=\\frac{30.5 \\mathrm{fF}}{\\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{3}{0.9}\\right)}}=14.7 \\mathrm{fF} \\tag{1.24}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWe observe a decrease in junction capacitance as the depletion region width increases."

Notably, more carriers diffuse from the heavily doped side to the lightly doped side than vice versa.\n\nUpon crossing the depletion region, the carriers significantly elevate the minority charge at the region's edge. These minority carriers then diffuse away from the junction into the bulk, recombining with majority carriers and thereby reducing their concentration. The decreasing gradient of the minority charge concentration, which lessens with distance from the junction, drives the current flow near the junction.\n\nThe majority carriers that recombine with the diffusing minority carriers originate from the metal contacts at the junctions, facilitated by the forward-bias voltage. These majority carriers drift across the bulk from the contacts to the junction due to the applied electric field, resulting in minor potential drops across the bulk, particularly on the lightly doped side. Typical values for these voltage drops range from 50 mV to 0.1 V, primarily influenced by the doping concentration of the lightly doped side, the distance from the contacts to the junction, and the junction's cross-sectional area.\n\nIn the forward-bias region, the current-voltage relationship is exponential and can be expressed (refer to Appendix) as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{D}=I_{S} e^{V_{D} V_{T}} \\tag{1.43}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{D}}$ is the voltage applied across the diode and\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{S} \\propto A_{D}\\left(\\frac{1}{N_{A}}+\\frac{1}{N_{D}}\\right) \\tag{1.44}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n$I_{S}$, termed the scale current, is proportional to the diode junction area, $A_{D}$, and inversely proportional to the doping concentrations."

    "text": "The functionality of n-channel MOS transistors will be outlined, taking into account a simplified cross-sectional view (Fig. 1.9). Here, the source, drain, and substrate are grounded. In this setup, the MOS transistor behaves like a capacitor, with the gate acting as one plate and the silicon surface, beneath the insulating $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ layer, acting as the other plate.\n\nWhen the gate voltage is highly negative (Fig. 1.9(a)), positive charges are drawn to the channel region. As the substrate is $\\mathrm{p}^{-}$ doped, the negative gate voltage boosts the channel doping to $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$, leading to an accumulated channel. The $\\mathrm{n}^{+}$ source and drain regions are separated from the $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$-channel region by depletion regions, creating an equivalent circuit of two back-to-back diodes. Consequently, only leakage current flows, even if one of the source or drain voltages rises significantly (unless the drain voltage becomes excessively large, causing transistor breakdown).\n\nWhen a positive voltage is applied to the gate (Fig. 1.9(b)), the situation reverses. For small positive gate voltages, the positive carriers in the channel beneath the gate are repelled, transforming the channel from a $\\mathrm{p}^{-}$ doping level to a depletion region. As the gate voltage becomes more positive, the gate attracts negative charge from the source and drain regions, turning the channel into an n-region with mobile electrons connecting the drain and source regions. In essence, a sufficiently large positive gate-source voltage converts the channel beneath the gate to an n-region, and the channel is said to be inverted.\n\nThe gate-source voltage at which the electron concentration under the gate equals the hole concentration in the $\\mathrm{p}^{-}$ substrate distant from the gate is known as the transistor threshold voltage, denoted as $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$ (for n-channel transistors). For gate-source voltages exceeding $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$, an n-type channel is present, enabling conduction between the drain and the source. For gate-source voltages below $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$, it is generally assumed that the transistor is off, and no current flows between the drain and the source. However, it should be noted that this assumption of zero drain-source current for a transistor that is off is only an approximation. In reality, for gate voltages around $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$, there is no sharp current change, and for gate-source voltages slightly less than $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$, small amounts of subthreshold current can flow, as discussed in Section 1.4.1.\n\nWhen the gate-source voltage, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{GS}}$, exceeds $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$, the channel is present. As $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{Gs}}$ increases, the electron density in the channel rises. Indeed, the carrier density, and therefore the charge density, is proportional to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{Gs}}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{n}}$, which is often called the effective gate-source voltage and denoted $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$. Specifically, we define\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\equiv \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{GS}}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}} \\tag{1.50}\n$$\n\nThe electron charge density is then given by\n\n$$\nQ_{n}=C_{o x}\\left(V_{G S}-V_{\\mathrm{tn}}\\right)=C_{o x} V_{\\text {eff }} \\tag{1.51}\n$$\n\nHere, $C_{0 x}$ is the gate capacitance per unit area and is expressed as\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{ox}}=\\frac{\\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\varepsilon_{0}}{\\mathrm{t}_{\\mathrm{ox}}} \\tag{1.52}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{ox}}$ is the relative permittivity of $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ (approximately 3.9) and $\\mathrm{t}_{\\mathrm{ox}}$ is the thickness of the thin oxide under the gate. A point to note here is that (1.51) is only accurate when both the drain and the source voltages are zero.\n\nTo determine the total gate capacitance, (1.52) should be multiplied by the effective gate area, WL, where W is the gate width and L is the effective gate length. These dimensions are depicted in Fig. 1.10. Thus, the total gate capacitance, $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{g}}$, is given by\n\n$$\nC_{g}=W L C_{o x} \\tag{1.53}\n$$\n\nand the total charge of the channel, $Q_{T-n}$, is given by\n\n$$\nQ_{T-n}=W L C_{o x}\\left(V_{G S}-V_{t n}\\right)=W L C_{o x} V_{\\text {eff }} \\tag{1.54}\n$$\n\nThe gate capacitance is one of the major load capacitances that circuits must be capable of driving. Gate capacitances are also significant when calculating charge injection, which occurs when a MOS transistor is being turned off because the channel charge, $Q_{T-n}$, must flow from under the gate out through the terminals to other places in the circuit.\n\nNext, if the drain voltage is raised above 0 V, a drain-source potential difference is created, resulting in current flowing from the drain to the source. The relationship between $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ and the drain-source current, $I_{D}$, is the same as for a resistor, assuming $V_{D S}$ is small. This relationship is given [Sze, 1981] by\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}=\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} \\mathrm{Q}_{\\mathrm{n}} \\frac{\\mathrm{~W}}{\\mathrm{~L}} \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{DS}} \\tag{1.55}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mu_{n}$ is the mobility of electrons near the silicon surface, and $Q_{n}$ is the charge concentration of the channel per unit area. Electron mobility is $0.14 \\mathrm{~m}^{2} / \\mathrm{Vs}$ in pure intrinsic silicon, decreasing with increasing dopant concentrations to $\\mu_{n} \\cong 0.01-0.06 \\mathrm{~m}^{2} / \\mathrm{Vs}$ in modern NMOS devices. Note that as the channel length increases, the drain-source current decreases, whereas this current increases as either the charge density or the transistor width increases. Using (1.54) and (1.55) yields\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}=\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\frac{\\mathrm{~W}}{\\mathrm{~L}}\\left(\\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{GS}}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}\\right) \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}=\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\frac{\\mathrm{~W}}{\\mathrm{~L}} \\mathrm{~V}_{\\text {eff}} \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{DS}} \\tag{1.56}\n$$\n\nwhere it should be emphasized that this relationship is only valid for drain-source voltages near zero (i.e., $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ much smaller than $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$).\n\nAs the drain-source voltage increases, the channel charge concentration decreases at the drain end. This decrease is due to the smaller gate-to-channel voltage difference across the thin gate oxide as one moves closer to the drain. In other words, since the drain voltage is assumed to be at a higher voltage than the source, there is an increasing voltage gradient from the source to the drain, resulting in a smaller gate-to-channel voltage near the drain. Since the charge density at a distance $x$ from the source end of the channel is proportional to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{G}}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{ch}}(\\mathrm{x})-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$, as $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{G}}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{ch}}(\\mathrm{x})$ decreases, the charge density also decreases. This effect is illustrated in Fig. 1.11.\n\nNote that at the drain end of the channel, we have\n\n$$\nV_{G}-V_{c h}(L)=V_{G D} \\tag{1.57}\n$$\n\nFor small $V_{D S}$, we saw from (1.56) that $I_{D}$ was linearly related to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$. However, as $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ increases, and the charge density decreases near the drain, the relationship becomes nonlinear. In fact, the linear relationship for $I_{D}$ versus $V_{D S}$ flattens for larger $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$, as shown in Fig. 1.12.\n\nAs the drain voltage is increased, at some point the gate-to-channel voltage at the drain end will decrease to the threshold value $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$ - the minimum gate-to-channel voltage needed for n carriers in the channel to exist. Thus, at the drain end, the channel becomes pinched off, as shown in Fig. 1.13. This pinch-off occurs at $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{GD}}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$, since the channel voltage at the drain end is simply equal to $V_{D}$. Thus, pinch-off occurs for\n\n$$\nV_{D G}>-V_{t n} \\tag{1.58}\n$$\n\nDenoting $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS} \\text {-sat }}$ as the drain-source voltage when the channel becomes pinched off, we can substitute $V_{D G}=V_{D S}-V_{G S}$ into (1.58) and find an equivalent pinch-off expression\n\n$$\nV_{D S}>V_{D S-s a t} \\tag{1.59}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS} \\text {-sat }}$ is given by\n\n$$\nV_{D S-s a t}=V_{G S}-V_{t n}=V_{\\text {eff }} \\tag{1.60}\n$$\n\nThe current flowing through the pinched-off channel region is saturated, similar to a gas under pressure flowing through a very small tube. If the drain-gate voltage rises above this critical pinch-off voltage of $-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$, the charge concentration in the channel remains constant (to a first-order approximation) and the drain current no longer increases with increasing $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$. The result is the current-voltage relationship shown in Fig. 1.14 for a given gate-source voltage. In the region of operation where $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}>\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS} \\text {-sat }}$, the drain current is independent of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ and is called the active region. The region where $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}$ changes linearly with $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ is called the triode region. When MOS transistors are used in analog amplifiers, they almost always are biased in the active region. When they are used in digital logic gates, they often operate in both regions.\n\nIt is sometimes necessary to distinguish between transistors in weak, moderate, and strong inversion. As just discussed, a gate-source voltage greater than $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$ results in an inverted channel, and drain-source current can flow. However, as the gate-source voltage is increased, the channel does not become inverted (i.e., n-region) suddenly, but rather gradually. Thus, it is useful to define three regions of channel inversion with respect to the gate-source voltage.

    "text": "The functionality of n-channel MOS transistors is explained with the aid of simplified cross-sectional diagrams in Fig. 1.9. Initially, when the source, drain, and substrate are grounded, the operation resembles that of a capacitor, with the gate and the silicon surface beneath the insulating SiO2 layer acting as capacitor plates.\n\nWhen a highly negative gate voltage is applied (Fig. 1.9(a)), positive charge is drawn to the channel region. Since the substrate is lightly doped with p-type material, this negative voltage enhances the channel doping to p+ type, creating an accumulated channel. The n+ source and drain regions are separated from the p+ channel by depletion regions, forming an equivalent circuit of two back-to-back diodes. Consequently, only leakage current flows, even with increased source or drain voltage (except at breakdown voltages).\n\nConversely, when a positive voltage is applied to the gate (Fig. 1.9(b)), the channel undergoes a depletion phase for small positive voltages, transitioning from a p-type to a depletion region. As the gate voltage increases further, negative charge is attracted from the source and drain regions, forming an n-type channel with mobile electrons bridging the source and drain. Thus, a sufficiently high positive gate-source voltage transforms the channel beneath the gate into an n-type region, referred to as inversion.\n\nThe gate-source voltage at which the electron concentration equals the hole concentration in the distant p-type substrate is known as the transistor voltage (Vtn). For voltages above Vtn, an n-type channel exists, enabling conduction between the drain and source. Below Vtn, the transistor is considered off, with negligible current flow, although subthreshold currents can occur near Vtn.\n\nWhen the gate-source voltage (VGS) exceeds Vtn, the channel is established, and increasing VGS raises the electron density in the channel, proportional to VGS - Vtn, termed the effective gate-source voltage (Veff). The electron charge density (Qn) is then given by Qn = Cox(VGS - Vtn) = CoxVeff, where Cox is the gate capacitance per unit area.\n\nThe total gate capacitance (Cg) is calculated by multiplying Cox by the effective gate area (WL), where W is the gate width and L is the effective gate length. The total channel charge (QT-n) is similarly derived as QT-n = WLCox(VGS - Vtn) = WLCoxVeff.\n\nThe gate capacitance is a significant load that circuits must drive, and it's crucial for charge injection calculations when a MOS transistor is switched off, as the channel charge must dissipate.\n\nWhen the drain voltage exceeds 0 V, a drain-source voltage difference induces current flow from drain to source. The relationship between VDS and the drain-source current (ID) follows that of a resistor for small VDS values.\n\nThe ID is linearly related to VDS for small values but becomes nonlinear as VDS increases, causing a decrease in channel charge density near the drain due to the reduced gate-to-channel voltage. This nonlinearity is depicted in Fig. 1.12.\n\nPinch-off occurs when the gate-to-channel voltage at the drain end reaches the threshold voltage (Vtn), leading to channel constriction. The pinch-off condition is expressed as VDG > -Vtn. The drain-source voltage at pinch-off (VDS-sat) is equivalent to Veff.\n\nIn the saturation region, the current through the pinched-off channel is constant, resembling a gas under pressure flowing through a narrow tube. Above the pinch-off voltage, the drain current ceases to increase with VDS, resulting in the current-voltage relationship shown in Fig. 1.14.\n\nThe operational regions of a MOSFET include the active region (VDS > VDS-sat), where the drain current is independent of VDS, and the triode region, where ID changes linearly with VDS. In analog amplifiers, MOSFETs are typically biased in the active region, while in digital logic gates, both regions may be utilized.\n\nThe channel inversion is categorized into weak, moderate, and strong inversion based on the gate-source voltage. Strong inversion, typically with Veff > 100 mV, is the standard operating condition for the equations in this section. Weak inversion occurs when VGS is around 100 mV below Vtn, and moderate inversion lies between weak and strong inversion."

    "text": "The fundamental mechanisms of MOS transistors are elucidated here, focusing on the n-channel variant. We begin by examining the simplified cross-sections depicted in Fig. 1.9, where the source, drain, and substrate are grounded, likening the MOS transistor's operation to that of a capacitor. The gate serves as one capacitor plate, while the silicon surface beneath the insulating $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ layer acts as the other.\n\nIn Fig. 1.9(a), where the gate voltage is highly negative, positive charge is drawn to the channel area. The substrate, originally doped $\\mathrm{p}^{-}$, sees its channel doping augmented to $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$ under this negative gate voltage, creating an accumulated channel. The $\\mathrm{n}^{+}$ source and drain regions are flanked by depletion regions, mimicking two back-to-back diodes, allowing only leakage current to flow, irrespective of large source or drain voltages.\n\nConversely, when a positive voltage is applied to the gate, as in Fig. 1.9(b), the scenario reverses. For轻微 positive gate voltages, the positive carriers in the channel beneath the gate are repelled, transforming the channel from a $\\mathrm{p}^{-}$ doping level to a depletion region. As the gate voltage becomes more positive, it attracts negative charge from the source and drain regions, forming an n-region with mobile electrons connecting the drain and source. Thus, a sufficiently high positive gate-source voltage converts the channel under the gate to an n-region, a state known as inversion.\n\nThe gate-source voltage at which the electron concentration under the gate equals the hole concentration in the distant $\\mathrm{p}^{-}$ substrate is termed the transistor threshold voltage, denoted as $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$. For gate-source voltages surpassing $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$, an n-type channel emerges, enabling conduction between the drain and source. Below $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$, the transistor is typically considered off, with negligible current flowing between the drain and source. However, it is important to recognize that this assumption of zero drain-source current for a transistor that is off is an approximation, particularly around $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$, where subthreshold current can occur.\n\nWhen the gate-source voltage, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{GS}}$, exceeds $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$, the channel forms. As $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{GS}}$ rises, so does the electron density in the channel. The carrier density, and by extension, the charge density, is proportional to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{GS}}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$, known as the effective gate-source voltage or $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$. Specifically, we define:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\equiv \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{GS}}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}\n$$\n\nThe electron charge density is then expressed as:\n\n$$\nQ_{n}=C_{o x}\\left(V_{G S}-V_{\\mathrm{tn}}\\right)=C_{o x} V_{\\text {eff }}\n$$\n\nHere, $C_{0 x}$ is the gate capacitance per unit area, given by:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{ox}}=\\frac{\\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\varepsilon_{0}}{\\mathrm{t}_{\\mathrm{ox}}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{ox}}$ is the relative permittivity of $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ (about 3.9) and $\\mathrm{t}_{\\mathrm{ox}}$ is the oxide layer's thickness under the gate. It is important to note that (1.51) holds true only when both the drain and source voltages are zero.\n\nTo calculate the total gate capacitance, (1.52) must be multiplied by the effective gate area, WL, where W is the gate width and L is the effective gate length, as depicted in Fig. 1.10. Hence, the total gate capacitance, $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{g}}$, is:\n\n$$\nC_{g}=W L C_{o x}\n$$\n\nand the total channel charge, $Q_{T-n}$, is:\n\n$$\nQ_{T-n}=W L C_{o x}\\left(V_{G S}-V_{t n}\\right)=W L C_{o x} V_{\\text {eff }}\n$$\n\nThe gate capacitance is a significant load that circuits must drive. It is also crucial in charge injection calculations, which occur when a MOS transistor is being switched off, as the channel charge, $Q_{T-n}$, must dissipate through the terminals to other circuit locations.\n\nWith an increase in drain voltage above 0 V, a drain-source voltage difference arises, prompting current flow from the drain to the source. The relationship between $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ and the drain-source current, $I_{D}$, resembles that of a resistor for small $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$, as given by [Sze, 1981]:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}=\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} \\mathrm{Q}_{\\mathrm{n}} \\frac{\\mathrm{~W}}{\\mathrm{~L}} \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mu_{n}$ is the electron mobility near the silicon surface, and $Q_{n}$ is the channel's charge concentration per unit area. Electron mobility is $0.14 \\mathrm{~m}^{2} / \\mathrm{Vs}$ in pure intrinsic silicon, decreasing with increased dopant concentrations to $\\mu_{n} \\cong 0.01-0.06 \\mathrm{~m}^{2} / \\mathrm{Vs}$ in modern NMOS devices. As the channel length increases, the drain-source current decreases, while it increases with either the charge density or the transistor width. Using (1.54) and (1.55) yields:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}=\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\frac{\\mathrm{~W}}{\\mathrm{~L}}\\left(\\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{GS}}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}\\right) \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}=\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\frac{\\mathrm{~W}}{\\mathrm{~L}} \\mathrm{~V}_{\\text {eff}} \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}\n$$\n\nIt is essential to emphasize that this relationship is valid only for drain-source voltages near zero (i.e., $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ much smaller than $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$).\n\nAs the drain-source voltage rises, the channel charge concentration diminishes at the drain end. This reduction is due to the diminishing gate-to-channel voltage across the thin gate oxide as one approaches the drain. In other words, since the drain voltage is higher than the source, there is a growing voltage gradient from source to drain, leading to a smaller gate-to-channel voltage near the drain. Since the charge density at a distance $x$ from the source end of the channel is proportional to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{G}}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{ch}}(\\mathrm{x})-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$, as $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{G}}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{ch}}(\\mathrm{x})$ decreases, the charge density decreases as well. This effect is depicted in Fig. 1.11.\n\nAt the drain end of the channel, we have:\n\n$$\nV_{G}-V_{c h}(L)=V_{G D}\n$$\n\nFor small $V_{D S}$, we observed from (1.56) that $I_{D}$ was linearly related to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$. However, as $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ increases, and the charge density decreases near the drain, the relationship becomes nonlinear. In fact, the linear relationship for $I_{D}$ versus $V_{D S}$ flattens for larger $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$, as shown in Fig. 1.12.\n\nAs the drain voltage rises, the gate-to-channel voltage at the drain end eventually decreases to the threshold value $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$, the minimum required for n carriers in the channel to exist. Thus, at the drain end, the channel becomes pinched off, as illustrated in Fig. 1.13. This pinch-off occurs at $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{GD}}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$, since the channel voltage at the drain end equals $V_{D}$. Therefore, pinch-off occurs for:\n\n$$\nV_{D G}>-V_{t n}\n$$\n\nDenoting $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS} \\text {-sat }}$ as the drain-source voltage at pinch-off, we can substitute $V_{D G}=V_{D S}-V_{G S}$ into (1.58) to find an equivalent pinch-off expression:\n\n$$\nV_{D S}>V_{D S-s a t}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS} \\text {-sat }}$ is given by:\n\n$$\nV_{D S-s a t}=V_{G S}-V_{t n}=V_{\\text {eff }}\n$$\n\nThe current flowing through the pinched-off channel region is saturated, akin to a gas under pressure flowing through a narrow tube. If the drain-gate voltage surpasses this critical pinch-off voltage of $-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$, the charge concentration in the channel remains constant (to a first-order approximation), and the drain current no longer increases with $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$. This results in the current-voltage relationship shown in Fig. 1.14 for a given gate-source voltage. In the region where $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}>\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS} \\text {-sat }}$, the drain current is independent of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ and is termed the active region. The region where $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}$ changes linearly with $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ is called the triode region. In analog amplifiers, MOS transistors are usually biased in the active region, while in digital logic gates, they often operate in both regions.\n\nIt is sometimes necessary to differentiate between transistors operating in weak, moderate, and strong inversion. As discussed, a gate-source voltage greater than $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$ leads to an inverted channel and allows drain-source current flow. However, as the gate-source voltage increases, the channel does not invert abruptly but rather progressively. Therefore, it is beneficial to define three regions of channel inversion based on the gate-source voltage. In most circuit applications, non-cutoff MOSFETs operate in strong inversion, with $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}>100 \\mathrm{mV}$ (many prudent circuit designers use a minimum value of 200 mV). Strong inversion, as the name implies, occurs when the channel is strongly inverted. It should be noted that all the equation models in this section assume strong inversion operation. Weak inversion takes place when $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{GS}}$ is approximately 100 mV or more below $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$ and is discussed as subthreshold operation in Section 1.4.1. Moderate inversion is the intermediate region between weak and strong inversion."

Given that the substrate is initially doped with p-, this negative gate voltage boosts the channel doping to p+, creating an accumulated channel. The n+ source and drain regions are separated from the p+ channel region by depletion regions, forming an equivalent circuit of two back-to-back diodes. Consequently, only leakage current will flow, even if one of the source or drain voltages becomes large (unless the drain voltage becomes so large as to cause the transistor to break down).\n\nConversely, when a positive voltage is applied to the gate, as shown in Fig. 1.9(b), the situation is reversed. For small positive gate voltages, the positive carriers in the channel beneath the gate are repelled, transforming the channel from a p- doping level to a depletion region. As the gate voltage becomes more positive, it attracts negative charge from the source and drain regions, converting the channel into an n region with mobile electrons connecting the drain and source regions. Essentially, a sufficiently large positive gate-source voltage transforms the channel below the gate into an n region, and the channel is said to be inverted.\n\nThe gate-source voltage at which the concentration of electrons under the gate equals the concentration of holes in the p- substrate far from the gate is commonly known as the transistor threshold voltage, denoted as Vtn (for n-channel transistors). For gate-source voltages higher than Vtn, an n-type channel is present, allowing conduction between the drain and the source. For gate-source voltages lower than Vtn, it is generally assumed that the transistor is off and no current flows between the drain and the source. However, it should be noted that this assumption of zero drain-source current for a transistor that is off is only an approximation. In reality, for gate voltages around Vtn, there is no abrupt current change, and for gate-source voltages slightly less than Vtn, small amounts of subthreshold current can flow, as discussed in Section 1.4.1.\n\nWhen the gate-source voltage, VGS, exceeds Vtn, the channel is present. As VGS increases, the density of electrons in the channel increases. In fact, the carrier density, and therefore the charge density, is proportional to VGS - Vtn, which is often called the effective gate-source voltage and denoted as Veff. Specifically, define:\n\nVeff = VGS - Vtn\n\nThe charge density of electrons is then given by:\n\nQn = Cox(VGS - Vtn) = Cox Veff\n\nHere, Cox is the gate capacitance per unit area and is given by:\n\nCox = Kox ε0 / tox\n\nwhere Kox is the relative permittivity of SiO2 (approximately 3.9) and tox is the thickness of the thin oxide under the gate. It is important to note that this equation is only accurate when both the drain and the source voltages are zero.\n\nTo calculate the total gate capacitance, Cox should be multiplied by the effective gate area, WL, where W is the gate width and L is the effective gate length. These dimensions are shown in Fig. 1.10. Thus, the total gate capacitance, Cg, is given by:\n\nCg = WL Cox\n\nand the total charge of the channel, QT-n, is given by:\n\nQT-n = WL Cox(VGS - Vtn) = WL Cox Veff\n\nThe gate capacitance is one of the major load capacitances that circuits must be capable of driving. Gate capacitances are also important when calculating charge injection, which occurs when a MOS transistor is being turned off because the channel charge, QT-n, must flow from under the gate out through the terminals to other places in the circuit.\n\nNext, if the drain voltage is increased above 0 V, a drain-source potential difference exists, causing current to flow from the drain to the source. The relationship between VDS and the drain-source current, ID, is the same as for a resistor, assuming VDS is small. This relationship is given by:\n\nID = μn Qn(W / L) VDS\n\nwhere μn is the mobility of electrons near the silicon surface, and Qn is the charge concentration of the channel per unit area (looking from the top down). Electron mobility is 0.14 m^2 / Vs in pure intrinsic silicon, decreasing with increasing dopant concentrations to μn ≅ 0.01-0.06 m^2 / Vs in modern NMOS devices. Note that as the channel length increases, the drain-source current decreases, whereas this current increases as either the charge density or the transistor width increases. Using the equations for QT-n and ID results in:\n\nID = μn Cox(W / L)(VGS - Vtn) VDS = μn Cox(W / L) Veff VDS\n\nIt should be emphasized that this relationship is only valid for drain-source voltages near zero (i.e., VDS much smaller than Veff).\n\nAs the drain-source voltage increases, the channel charge concentration decreases at the drain end. This decrease is due to the smaller gate-to-channel voltage difference across the thin gate oxide as one moves closer to the drain. In other words, since the drain voltage is assumed to be at a higher voltage than the source, there is an increasing voltage gradient from the source to the drain, resulting in a smaller gate-to-channel voltage near the drain. Since the charge density at a distance x from the source end of the channel is proportional to VG - Vch(x) - Vtn, as VG - Vch(x) decreases, the charge density also decreases. This effect is illustrated in Fig. 1.11.\n\nNote that at the drain end of the channel, we have:\n\nVG - Vch(L) = VGD\n\nFor small VDS, we saw from the previous equation that ID was linearly related to VDS. However, as VDS increases, and the charge density decreases near the drain, the relationship becomes nonlinear. In fact, the linear relationship for ID versus VDS flattens for larger VDS, as shown in Fig. 1.12.\n\nAs the drain voltage is increased, at some point the gate-to-channel voltage at the drain end will decrease to the threshold value Vtn - the minimum gate-to-channel voltage needed for n carriers in the channel to exist. Thus, at the drain end, the channel becomes pinched off, as shown in Fig. 1.13. This pinch-off occurs at VGD = Vtn, since the channel voltage at the drain end is simply equal to VD. Thus, pinch-off occurs for:\n\nVDG > -Vtn\n\nDenoting VDS-sat as the drain-source voltage when the channel becomes pinched off, we can substitute VDG = VDS - VGS into the equation and find an equivalent pinch-off expression:\n\nVDS > VDS-sat\n\nwhere VDS-sat is given by:\n\nVDS-sat = VGS - Vtn = Veff\n\nThe current traveling through the pinched-off channel region is saturated, similar to a gas under pressure traveling through a very small tube. If the drain-gate voltage rises above this critical pinch-off voltage of -Vtn, the charge concentration in the channel remains constant (to a first-order approximation) and the drain current no longer increases with increasing VDS. The result is the current-voltage relationship shown in Fig. 1.14 for a given gate-source voltage. In the region of operation where VDS > VDS-sat, the drain current is independent of VDS and is called the active region. The region where ID changes linearly with VDS is called the triode region. When MOS transistors are used in analog amplifiers, they almost always are biased in the active region. When they are used in digital logic gates, they often operate in both regions.\n\nIt is sometimes necessary to distinguish between transistors in weak, moderate, and strong inversion. As just discussed, a gate-source voltage greater than Vtn results in an inverted channel, and drain-source current can flow. However, as the gate-source voltage is increased, the channel does not become inverted (i.e., n-region) suddenly, but rather gradually. Thus, it is useful to define three regions of channel inversion with respect to the gate-source voltage. In most circuit applications, non-cutoff MOSFET transistors are operated in strong inversion, with Veff > 100 mV (many prudent circuit designers use a minimum value of 200 mV).

This effect is illustrated in Fig. 1.11.\n\nAt the drain end of the channel, we have:\n\n$$\nV_{G}-V_{c h}(L)=V_{G D} \\tag{1.57}\n$$\n\nFor small $V_{D S}$, we observed from equation (1.56) that $I_{D}$ was linearly related to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$. However, as $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ increases, and the charge density decreases near the drain, the relationship becomes nonlinear. In fact, the linear relationship for $I_{D}$ versus $V_{D S}$ flattens for larger $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$, as shown in Fig. 1.12.\n\nAs the drain voltage is increased, at some point the gate-to-channel voltage at the drain end will decrease to the threshold value $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$ - the minimum gate-to-channel voltage needed for n carriers in the channel to exist. Thus, at the drain end, the channel becomes pinched off, as shown in Fig. 1.13. This pinch-off occurs at $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{GD}}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$, since the channel voltage at the drain end is simply equal to $V_{D}$. Thus, pinch-off occurs for:\n\n$$\nV_{D G}>-V_{t n} \\tag{1.58}\n$$\n\nDenoting $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS} \\text {-sat }}$ as the drain-source voltage when the channel becomes pinched off, we can substitute $V_{D G}=V_{D S}-V_{G S}$ into equation (1.58) and find an equivalent pinch-off expression:\n\n$$\nV_{D S}>V_{D S-s a t} \\tag{1.59}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS} \\text {-sat }}$ is given by:\n\n$$\nV_{D S-s a t}=V_{G S}-V_{t n}=V_{\\text {eff }} \\tag{1.60}\n$$\n\nThe current flowing through the pinched-off channel region is saturated, akin to a gas under pressure flowing through a very narrow tube. If the drain-gate voltage rises above this critical pinch-off voltage of $-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$, the charge concentration in the channel remains constant (to a first-order approximation) and the drain current no longer increases with increasing $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$. The resulting current-voltage relationship is shown in Fig. 1.14 for a given gate-source voltage. In the region of operation where $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}>\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS} \\text {-sat }}$, the drain current is independent of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ and is referred to as the active region. The region where $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}$ changes linearly with $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ is called the triode region. When MOS transistors are used in analog amplifiers, they are almost always biased in the active region. When they are used in digital logic gates, they often operate in both regions.\n\nIt is sometimes necessary to differentiate between transistors in weak, moderate, and strong inversion. As discussed earlier, a gate-source voltage greater than $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$ results in an inverted channel, and drain-source current can flow. However, as the gate-source voltage is increased, the channel does not become inverted (i.e., n-region) abruptly, but rather gradually. Thus, it is useful to define three regions of channel inversion with respect to the gate-source voltage. In most circuit applications, non-cutoff MOSFET transistors are operated in strong inversion, with $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}>100 \\mathrm{mV}$ (many prudent circuit designers use a minimum value of 200 mV). As the name suggests, strong inversion occurs when the channel is strongly inverted. It should be noted that all the equation models in this section assume strong inversion operation. Weak inversion occurs when $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{GS}}$ is approximately 100 mV or more below $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$ and is discussed as subthreshold operation in Section 1.4.1. Finally, moderate inversion is the region between weak and strong inversion."

    "text": "The operational principles of n-channel MOS transistors are elucidated by examining a simplified cross-section as depicted in Fig. 1.9. With the source, drain, and substrate grounded, the MOS transistor behaves akin to a capacitor. The gate serves as one capacitor plate, while the silicon surface beneath the insulating SiO2 layer acts as the other plate.\n\nIn the scenario where the gate voltage is highly negative, as illustrated in Fig. 1.9(a), positive charge is drawn towards the channel area. Given the substrate's original p- doping, the negative gate voltage enhances the channel doping to p+, creating an accumulated channel. The n+ source and drain regions are demarcated from the p+ channel by depletion zones, resulting in a circuit equivalent to two back-to-back diodes. Consequently, only leakage current is present, regardless of any elevated source or drain voltage (except in cases where the drain voltage becomes excessively high, potentially causing transistor breakdown).\n\nConversely, when a positive voltage is applied to the gate, as shown in Fig. 1.9(b), the situation is reversed. With a slight positive gate voltage, the positive carriers in the channel beneath the gate are repelled, transforming the channel from a p- doping level to a depletion region. As the gate voltage becomes more positive, it attracts negative charge from the source and drain regions, forming an n region populated with mobile electrons that bridge the drain and source regions. A sufficiently high positive gate-source voltage alters the channel beneath the gate into an n region, a state referred to as inversion.\n\nThe gate-source voltage at which the electron concentration beneath the gate equals the hole concentration in the distant p- substrate is known as the transistor's threshold voltage, denoted as Vtn. For gate-source voltages exceeding Vtn, an n-type channel exists, enabling conduction between the drain and the source. Below Vtn, it is generally presumed that the transistor is non-conducting, precluding current flow between the drain and the source. However, it is important to recognize that this presumption of zero drain-source current for a transistor that is off is an approximation. In reality, around Vtn, there is no sharp transition in current, and for gate-source voltages marginally below Vtn, subthreshold current can flow, as elaborated in Section 1.4.1.\n\nUpon exceeding the threshold voltage Vtn, a channel is established. With an increase in gate-source voltage VGS, the electron density in the channel rises. Specifically, the carrier density—and thus the charge density—is proportional to VGS - Vtn, termed the effective gate-source voltage or Veff. This relationship is defined as:\n\nQn = Cox(VGS - Vtn) = CoxVeff\n\nHere, Cox represents the gate capacitance per unit area, calculated as:\n\nCox = Koxε0/tox\n\nwhere Kox is the relative permittivity of SiO2 (approximately 3.9) and tox is the thickness of the oxide layer beneath the gate. It is pertinent to note that equation (1.51) holds true only when both the drain and source voltages are at zero.\n\nTo compute the total gate capacitance, equation (1.52) must be multiplied by the effective gate area, WL, with W denoting the gate width and L the effective gate length, as illustrated in Fig. 1.10. Hence, the total gate capacitance, Cg, is:\n\nCg = WLCox\n\nand the total charge in the channel, QT-n, is:\n\nQT-n = WLCox(VGS - Vtn) = WLCoxVeff\n\nGate capacitance is a significant load capacitance that circuits must be capable of driving. It is also crucial in calculating charge injection, which occurs when a MOS transistor is being switched off, necessitating the channel charge QT-n to dissipate from beneath the gate through the circuit terminals.\n\nWhen the drain voltage surpasses 0 V, a drain-source potential difference arises, precipitating current flow from the drain to the source. The relationship between VDS and the drain-source current ID mimics that of a resistor, provided VDS is small. This relationship is expressed by:\n\nID = μnQnW/LVDS\n\nwhere μn is the electron mobility near the silicon surface, and Qn is the channel charge concentration per unit area. Electron mobility is approximately 0.14 m^2/Vs in pure intrinsic silicon, diminishing with increasing dopant levels to μn ≈ 0.01-0.06 m^2/Vs in contemporary NMOS devices. It is worth noting that as the channel length increases, the drain-source current diminishes, whereas it rises with either an increase in charge density or transistor width. Employing equations (1.54) and (1.55) yields:\n\nID = μnCoxW/L(VGS - Vtn)VDS = μnCoxW/LVeffVDS\n\nThis relationship is valid exclusively for drain-source voltages in the vicinity of zero (i.e., VDS much smaller than Veff).\n\nAs the drain-source voltage escalates, the channel charge concentration wanes at the drain end due to the diminished gate-to-channel voltage across the oxide layer near the drain. Since the drain voltage is assumed to be higher than the source, a progressively steeper voltage gradient from source to drain ensues, culminating in a reduced gate-to-channel voltage near the drain. Since the charge density at a distance x from the source end of the channel is proportional to VG - Vch(x) - Vtn, a decrease in VG - Vch(x) leads to a concurrent decrease in charge density. This effect is depicted in Fig. 1.11.\n\nIt is crucial to acknowledge that the relationship between drain-source voltage and drain current of a MOS device is approximately linear when VDS << Veff.\n\nAt the drain end of the channel, we have:\n\nVG - Vch(L) = VGD\n\nFor small VDS, equation (1.56) indicated a linear relationship between ID and VDS. However, as VDS escalates and the charge density diminishes near the drain, the relationship becomes nonlinear. Indeed, the linear ID versus VDS curve flattens for higher VDS, as illustrated in Fig. 1.12.\n\nAs the drain voltage rises, the gate-to-channel voltage at the drain end eventually diminishes to the threshold value Vtn—the minimum gate-to-channel voltage required for the existence of n carriers in the channel. Consequently, at the drain end, the channel becomes pinched off, as depicted in Fig. 1.13. This pinch-off occurs at VGD = Vtn, since the channel voltage at the drain end is simply VD. Thus, pinch-off arises when:\n\nVDG > -Vtn\n\nDenoting VDS-sat as the drain-source voltage at pinch-off, we can substitute VGD = VDS - VGS into equation (1.58) to derive an equivalent pinch-off expression:\n\nVDS > VDS-sat\n\nwhere VDS-sat is given by:\n\nVDS-sat = VGS - Vtn = Veff\n\nThe current flowing through the pinched-off channel region is saturated, akin to a gas under pressure flowing through a narrow tube. Should the drain-gate voltage exceed this critical pinch-off voltage of -Vtn, the charge concentration in the channel remains constant (to a first-order approximation), and the drain current ceases to increase with rising VDS. This yields the current-voltage relationship shown in Fig. 1.14 for a specific gate-source voltage. In the operational region where VDS > VDS-sat, the drain current is independent of VDS and is termed the active region. The region where ID varies linearly with VDS is called the triode region. In analog amplifiers, MOS transistors are predominantly biased in the active region, whereas in digital logic gates, they often operate in both regions.\n\nThe distinction between transistors in weak, moderate, and strong inversion is sometimes required. As previously discussed, a gate-source voltage above Vtn induces an inverted channel and permits drain-source current. However, as the gate-source voltage increases, the channel does not invert abruptly but rather progressively. Therefore, it is useful to delineate three regions of channel inversion relative to the gate-source voltage. In most circuit applications, non-cutoff MOSFET transistors are operated in strong inversion, with Veff > 100 mV (many prudent circuit designers use a minimum of 200 mV). Strong inversion, as the name implies, occurs when the channel is strongly inverted. It should be noted that all equation models in this section presuppose strong inversion operation. Weak inversion arises when VGS is roughly 100 mV or more below Vtn and is discussed as subthreshold operation in Section 1.4.1. Moderate inversion is the intermediate region between weak and strong inversion."

We'll examine the simplified cross-sections depicted in Fig. 1.9, where the source, drain, and substrate are grounded. This arrangement makes the MOS transistor behave like a capacitor, with the gate serving as one capacitor plate and the silicon surface just below the thin $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ insulator as the other.\n\nWhen the gate voltage is severely negative, as illustrated in Fig. 1.9(a), positive charges are drawn to the channel. Because the substrate was initially doped with $\\mathrm{p}^{-}$, this negative gate voltage effectively raises the channel doping to $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$, creating an accumulated channel. The $\\mathrm{n}^{+}$source and drain regions are isolated from the $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$channel by depletion regions, resembling the equivalent circuit of two anti-parallel diodes. Consequently, only leakage current can occur, even if one of the source or drain voltages escalates (unless the drain voltage reaches a level that could cause the transistor to fail).\n\nIn contrast, applying a positive voltage to the gate, as seen in Fig. $1.9(b)$, produces an opposite effect. With small positive gate voltages, the positive carriers under the gate are initially repelled, shifting the channel from $\\mathrm{p}^{-}$doping to a depletion region. As the gate voltage becomes increasingly positive, it draws negative charge from the source and drain regions, transforming the channel into an n-region with mobile electrons that connect the drain and source. In essence, a sufficiently high positive gate-source voltage converts the channel beneath the gate to an n-region, and this state is referred to as inversion.\n\nThe gate-source voltage at which the electron concentration beneath the gate matches the hole concentration in the $\\mathrm{p}^{-}$substrate far from the gate is commonly known as the threshold voltage of the transistor and denoted $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$ (for n-channel transistors). For gate-source voltages above $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$, an n-type channel is formed, enabling conduction between the drain and source. Conversely, for voltages below $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$, it is generally assumed that the transistor is inactive, and no current flows between the drain and source. However, this assumption of zero drain-source current for an off transistor is merely an approximation. In reality, for voltages close to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$, there is no sudden current shift, and for voltages slightly less than $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$, minor subthreshold currents can flow, as elaborated in Section 1.4.1.\n\nWhen the gate-source voltage, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{GS}}$, exceeds $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$, the channel forms. As $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{GS}}$ rises, the electron density in the channel increases. Indeed, the electron density, and thus the charge density, is directly proportional to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{GS}}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$, which is known as the effective gate-source voltage and denoted $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$. Specifically, define\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\equiv \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{GS}}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}} \\tag{1.50}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe electron charge density is then calculated by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nQ_{n}=C_{o x}\\left(V_{G S}-V_{\\mathrm{tn}}\\right)=C_{o x} V_{\\text {eff }} \\tag{1.51}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $C_{0 x}$ is the gate capacitance per unit area and is expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{ox}}=\\frac{\\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\varepsilon_{0}}{\\mathrm{t}_{\\mathrm{ox}}} \\tag{1.52}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwith $\\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{ox}}$ being the relative permittivity of $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ (approximately 3.9) and $\\mathrm{t}_{\\mathrm{ox}}$ being the thickness of the thin oxide under the gate. Note that equation (1.51) is only accurate when both the drain and source voltages are zero.\n\nTo determine the total gate capacitance, equation (1.52) must be multiplied by the effective gate area, WL, where W is the gate width and L is the effective gate length, as depicted in Fig. 1.10. Hence, the total gate capacitance, $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{g}}$, is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{g}=W L C_{o x} \\tag{1.53}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand the total electron charge in the channel, $Q_{T-n}$, is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nQ_{T-n}=W L C_{o x}\\left(V_{G S}-V_{t n}\\right)=W L C_{o x} V_{\\text {eff }} \\tag{1.54}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe gate capacitance is a crucial load capacitance that circuits must be capable of driving. It is also important when calculating charge injection, which occurs during the deactivation of a MOS transistor because the channel charge, $Q_{T-n}$, must travel from under the gate to the terminals and other parts of the circuit.\n\nIf the drain voltage is elevated above 0 V, a drain-source voltage difference is created, leading to current flowing from drain to source. This relationship between $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ and the drain-source current, $I_{D}$, mimics that of a resistor, assuming $\\mathrm{V}_{D S}$ is modest. This relationship is stated by [Sze, 1981] as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}=\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} \\mathrm{Q}_{\\mathrm{n}} \\frac{\\mathrm{~W}}{\\mathrm{~L}} \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{DS}} \\tag{1.55}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mu_{n}$ is the electron mobility near the silicon surface, and $Q_{n}$ is the channel charge concentration per unit area (viewed from above). Electron mobility in pure intrinsic silicon is 0.14 $\\mathrm{m}^{2} / \\mathrm{Vs}$, decreasing to $\\mu_{n} \\cong 0.01-0.06 \\mathrm{~m}^{2} / \\mathrm{Vs}$ in contemporary NMOS devices. Remember that as the channel length grows, the drain-source current diminishes, whereas this current increases as either the charge density or the transistor width increases. Using (1.54) and (1.55) yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}=\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\frac{\\mathrm{~W}}{\\mathrm{~L}}\\left(\\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{GS}}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}\\right) \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}=\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\frac{\\mathrm{~W}}{\\mathrm{~L}} \\mathrm{~V}_{\\text {eff}} \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{DS}} \\tag{1.56}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere it must be emphasized that this relationship is valid only for near-zero drain-source voltages (i.e., $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ much less than $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$).\n```"

Thus, the total gate capacitance, $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{g}}$, is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{g}=W L C_{o x} \\tag{1.53}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand the total charge of the channel, $Q_{T-n}$, is expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nQ_{T-n}=W L C_{o x}\\left(V_{G S}-V_{t n}\\right)=W L C_{o x} V_{\\text {eff }} \\tag{1.54}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe gate capacitance is one of the significant load capacitances that circuits must be capable of driving. Gate capacitances are also crucial when calculating charge injection, which occurs when a MOS transistor is being turned off, as the channel charge, $Q_{T-n}$, must flow from under the gate out through the terminals to other parts of the circuit.\n\nAdditionally, if the drain voltage is increased beyond 0 V, a drain-source potential difference is created. This difference leads to current flowing from the drain to the source. The relationship between $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ and the drain-source current, $I_{D}$, is analogous to that of a resistor, assuming $V_{D S}$ is small. This relationship is given [Sze, 1981] by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}=\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} \\mathrm{Q}_{\\mathrm{n}} \\frac{\\mathrm{~W}}{\\mathrm{~L}} \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{DS}} \\tag{1.55}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mu_{n}$ is the mobility of electrons near the silicon surface, and $Q_{n}$ is the charge concentration of the channel per unit area (viewed from above). Electron mobility is $0.14 \\mathrm{~m}^{2} / \\mathrm{Vs}$ in pure intrinsic silicon, decreasing with increasing dopant concentrations to $\\mu_{n} \\cong 0.01-0.06 \\mathrm{~m}^{2} / \\mathrm{Vs}$ in modern NMOS devices. It is important to note that as the channel length increases, the drain-source current decreases, whereas this current increases as either the charge density or the transistor width increases. Utilizing equations (1.54) and (1.55) yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}=\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\frac{\\mathrm{~W}}{\\mathrm{~L}}\\left(\\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{GS}}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}\\right) \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}=\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\frac{\\mathrm{~W}}{\\mathrm{~L}} \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{DS}} \\tag{1.56}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere it should be emphasized that this relationship is valid only for drain-source voltages near zero (i.e., $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ much smaller than $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$ ).\n\nAs the drain-source voltage increases, the channel charge concentration diminishes at the drain end. This decrease is due to the smaller gate-to-channel voltage difference across the thin gate oxide as one approaches the drain. In other words, since the drain voltage is assumed to be higher than the source voltage, there is an increasing voltage gradient from the source to the drain, resulting in a smaller gate-to-channel voltage near the drain. Since the charge density at a distance $x$ from the source end of the channel is proportional to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{G}}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{ch}}(\\mathrm{x})-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$, as $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{G}}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{ch}}(\\mathrm{x})$ decreases, the charge density also decreases. This effect is illustrated in Fig. 1.11.\n\nAt the drain end of the channel, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{G}-V_{c h}(L)=V_{G D} \\tag{1.57}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor small $V_{D S}$, we saw from (1.56) that $I_{D}$ was linearly related to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$. However, as $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ increases, and the charge density decreases near the drain, the relationship becomes nonlinear. In fact, the linear relationship for $I_{D}$ versus $V_{D S}$ flattens for larger $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$, as shown in Fig. 1.12.\n\nAs the drain voltage is increased, at some point, the gate-to-channel voltage at the drain end will decrease to the threshold value $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$ - the minimum gate-to-channel voltage required for n carriers in the channel to exist. Thus, at the drain end, the channel becomes pinched off, as depicted\nThe operational principles of MOS transistors will be outlinedated using the n-channel variant as a reference.

With the source, drain, and substrate all grounded, the MOS transistor behaves akin to a capacitor. The gate serves as one plate, while the silicon surface beneath the insulating SiO2 layer acts as the second plate.\n\nIn the scenario where the gate voltage is highly negative, as illustrated in Fig. 1.9(a), the channel region attracts positive charge. The substrate, initially doped with p-, experiences an increased doping level to p+ due to the negative gate voltage, leading to an accumulated channel. The n+ source and drain regions are isolated from the p+ channel region by depletion zones, creating an equivalent circuit of two back-to-back diodes. Consequently, only leakage current flows, even if the voltage of one of the source or drain terminals becomes significant (except in cases where the drain voltage is excessively high, causing transistor breakdown).\n\nConversely, when a positive voltage is applied to the gate, as shown in Fig. 1.9(b), the situation is reversed. For modest positive gate voltages, the positive carriers in the channel beneath the gate are repelled, transforming the channel from a p- doping level to a depletion region. As the gate voltage becomes more positive, it attracts negative charge from the source and drain regions, establishing an n region with mobile electrons connecting the drain and source regions. Essentially, a sufficiently high positive gate-source voltage converts the channel beneath the gate into an n region, and the channel is considered inverted.\n\nThe gate-source voltage at which the electron concentration beneath the gate equals the hole concentration in the distant p- substrate is known as the transistor's threshold voltage, denoted as Vtn. For gate-source voltages exceeding Vtn, an n-type channel is present, allowing conduction between the drain and source. For gate-source voltages below Vtn, it is generally assumed that the transistor is off, with no current flowing between the drain and source. However, it is important to recognize that this assumption of zero drain-source current for a transistor that is off is an approximation. In reality, for gate voltages around Vtn, there is no sudden current change, and for gate-source voltages slightly below Vtn, minor subthreshold current can flow, as explored in Section 1.4.1.\n\nWhen the gate-source voltage, VGS, surpasses Vtn, the channel is formed. As VGS increases, the electron density in the channel rises. Specifically, the carrier density, and hence the charge density, is proportional to VGS - Vtn, often referred to as the effective gate-source voltage and denoted as Veff. This can be expressed as:\n\nVeff = VGS - Vtn\n\nThe charge density of electrons is then given by:\n\nQn = Cox(VGS - Vtn) = CoxVeff\n\nHere, Cox represents the gate capacitance per unit area, defined as:\n\nCox = Koxε0/tox\n\nwhere Kox is the relative permittivity of SiO2 (approximately 3.9) and tox is the thickness of the thin oxide layer beneath the gate. It is important to note that equation (1.51) is only accurate when both the drain and source voltages are zero.\n\nTo determine the total gate capacitance, equation (1.52) should be multiplied by the effective gate area, WL, where W is the gate width and L is the effective gate length, as shown in Fig. 1.10. Thus, the total gate capacitance, Cg, is given by:\n\nCg = WLCox\n\nand the total charge of the channel, QT-n, is given by:\n\nQT-n = WLCox(VGS - Vtn) = WLCoxVeff\n\nThe gate capacitance is one of the primary load capacitances that circuits must be capable of driving. Gate capacitances are also significant when calculating charge injection, which occurs when a MOS transistor is being turned off since the channel charge, QT-n, must flow from beneath the gate out through the terminals to other parts of the circuit.\n\nNext, if the drain voltage is elevated above 0 V, a drain-source potential difference is created, causing current to flow from the drain to the source. The relationship between VDS and the drain-source current, ID, is analogous to that of a resistor, assuming VDS is small. This relationship is expressed by:\n\nID = μnQn(W/L)VDS\n\nwhere μn denotes the mobility of electrons near the silicon surface, and Qn represents the charge concentration of the channel per unit area. Electron mobility is approximately 0.14 m^2/Vs in pure intrinsic silicon, decreasing with increasing dopant concentrations to μn ≈ 0.01-0.06 m^2/Vs in modern NMOS devices. It is important to note that as the channel length increases, the drain-source current decreases, while this current increases with either the charge density or the transistor width. Using equations (1.54) and (1.55) leads to:\n\nID = μnCox(W/L)(VGS - Vtn)VDS = μnCox(W/L)VeffVDS\n\nwhere it should be emphasized that this relationship is only valid for drain-source voltages near zero (i.e., VDS much smaller than Veff).\n\nThe diagram in Fig. 1.10 provides a cross-sectional view of a MOS transistor, highlighting its crucial dimensions and components. The primary elements depicted in the diagram include the gate, SiO2 layer, n+ regions, n channel, dimensions L and W, thickness of the oxide layer (tox), and the direction of current flow.\n\nFig. 1.10 illustrates the important dimensions of a MOS transistor.\n\nWhen the drain-source voltage increases, the channel charge concentration diminishes at the drain end. This reduction is due to the decreasing gate-to-channel voltage difference across the thin gate oxide as one approaches the drain. In other words, since the drain voltage is assumed to be higher than the source voltage, there is an increasing voltage gradient from the source to the drain, resulting in a smaller gate-to-channel voltage near the drain.

This effect is depicted in Fig. 1.11.\n\nIt is important to note that at the drain end of the channel, we have:\n\nVG - Vch(L) = VGD\n\nFor small VDS, we observed from equation (1.56) that ID was linearly related to VDS. However, as VDS increases, and the charge density decreases near the drain, the relationship becomes nonlinear. In fact, the linear relationship for ID versus VDS flattens for larger VDS, as shown in Fig. 1.12.\n\nAs the drain voltage rises, there comes a point where the gate-to-channel voltage at the drain end drops to the threshold value Vtn - the minimum gate-to-channel voltage required for n carriers to exist in the channel.

    "text": "The functionality of n-channel MOS transistors is elucidated below, utilizing the simplified cross-sectional illustrations in Fig. 1.9. Initially, it is observed that the source, drain, and substrate are grounded, likening the MOS transistor's operation to that of a capacitor. Here, the gate assumes the role of one capacitor plate, whereas the silicon surface, beneath the insulating SiO2 layer, acts as the other plate.\n\nUpon the application of a highly negative gate voltage, as depicted in Fig. 1.9(a), positive charges are drawn towards the channel area. Given that the substrate is initially doped with p-type impurities, this negative gate voltage intensifies the channel doping to p-type, leading to the formation of an accumulated channel. This results in a configuration analogous to two back-to-back diodes, allowing only leakage current to pass, irrespective of elevated source or drain voltages.\n\nConversely, applying a positive voltage to the gate, as shown in Fig. 1.9(b), elicits an opposite reaction. With轻微 positive gate voltages, the positive charge carriers in the channel beneath the gate are repelled, transforming the channel from a p-type to a depletion region. As the gate voltage becomes more positive, it attracts negative charges from the source and drain regions, thereby creating an n-type channel replete with mobile electrons bridging the source and drain regions. Essentially, a sufficiently high positive gate-source voltage modifies the channel beneath the gate into an n-type region, marking the channel as inverted.\n\nThe gate-source voltage at which the electron concentration beneath the gate equals the hole concentration in the remote p-type substrate is recognized as the transistor's threshold voltage, denoted as Vtn. For gate-source voltages surpassing Vtn, an n-type channel exists, enabling conduction between the drain and the source. Conversely, for gate-source voltages below Vtn, the transistor is typically assumed to be off, precluding current flow between the drain and the source. However, it is important to note that this assumption of zero drain-source current for a transistor that is off is not absolute, particularly around the threshold voltage, where subthreshold current may occur.\n\nThe charge density of electrons within the channel is directly proportional to the effective gate-source voltage, defined as Veff and calculated as VGS minus Vtn. The electron charge density is expressed as Qn = Cox(VGS - Vtn) = CoxVeff, where Cox represents the gate capacitance per unit area. The gate capacitance is a significant load capacitance that circuits must be capable of driving, and it plays a crucial role in charge injection calculations when a MOS transistor is being switched off.\n\nAs the drain voltage surpasses 0 V, a drain-source voltage gradient is established, prompting current flow from the drain to the source. The relationship between VDS and the drain-source current, ID, adheres to that of a resistor, provided VDS is minimal. This relationship is defined by the equation ID = μnQnW/LVDS, where μn denotes the electron mobility and Qn represents the channel charge concentration per unit area.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge that as the channel length increases, the drain-source current diminishes, whereas an increase in charge density or transistor width leads to an increase in current. Incorporating the aforementioned equations yields ID = μnCoxW/L(VGS - Vtn)VDS = μnCoxW/LVeffVDS, with the proviso that this relationship holds true for drain-source voltages in the vicinity of zero.\n\nAs the drain-source voltage escalates, the channel charge concentration diminishes towards the drain end. This reduction is attributable to the diminishing gate-to-channel voltage differential across the thin gate oxide as one approaches the drain. Consequently, the charge density diminishes in tandem with the decreasing gate-to-channel voltage. This effect is depicted in Fig. 1.11.\n\nFor small VDS, the relationship between ID and VDS is linear. However, as VDS increases and the charge density wanes near the drain, the relationship becomes nonlinear. This is exemplified in Fig. 1.12, where the linear relationship between ID and VDS flattens for larger VDS values.\n\nAs the drain voltage is heightened, the gate-to-channel voltage at the drain end diminishes to the threshold value Vtn, heralding the onset of channel pinch-off, as illustrated in Fig. 1.13. This pinch-off occurs when VGD = Vtn, signifying that the channel voltage at the drain end is equivalent to VD. Consequently, pinch-off takes place for VDG > -Vtn. Denoting VDS-sat as the drain-source voltage at which the channel becomes pinched off, we can derive an expression for pinch-off, VDS > VDS-sat.\n\nThe current flowing through the pinched-off channel region is saturated, akin to a gas under pressure traversing a narrow conduit. Should the drain-gate voltage exceed this critical pinch-off voltage of -Vtn, the charge concentration in the channel remains relatively constant, and the drain current ceases to increase with VDS. This yields the current-voltage relationship depicted in Fig. 1.14 for a specific gate-source voltage. In the operational region where VDS > VDS-sat, the drain current is independent of VDS and is termed the active region. The region where ID varies linearly with VDS is known as the triode region. In analog amplifiers, MOS transistors are predominantly biased in the active region, whereas in digital logic gates, they often operate in both regions.\n\nIt is occasionally necessary to differentiate between transistors operating in weak, moderate, and strong inversion. A gate-source voltage exceeding Vtn results in an inverted channel and facilitates drain-source current flow. However, as the gate-source voltage increases, the channel does not abruptly invert but rather transitions gradually. Hence, it is beneficial to delineate three regions of channel inversion based on the gate-source voltage. In most circuit applications, non-cutoff MOSFET transistors operate in strong inversion, characterized by Veff > 100 mV. Strong inversion occurs when the channel is highly inverted, and it is pertinent to note that all the equation models presented in this section presuppose strong inversion operation. Weak inversion ensues when VGS is approximately 100 mV or more below Vtn and is discussed as subthreshold operation in Section 1.4.1. Moderate inversion constitutes the intermediate region between weak and strong inversion."

In a substrate initially doped p-, this negative gate voltage elevates the channel doping to p+, creating an accumulated channel. The n+ source and drain regions are divided from the p+ channel by depletion regions, forming an equivalent circuit of two back-to-back diodes. Consequently, only leakage current will flow, regardless of the magnitude of the source or drain voltage (unless the drain voltage is so high as to cause transistor breakdown).\n\nConversely, when a positive voltage is applied to the gate, as shown in Fig. 1.9(b), the scenario is reversed. For modest positive gate voltages, the positive carriers in the channel beneath the gate are repelled, transforming the channel from a p- doping level to a depletion region.

As VGS increases, the electron density in the channel increases. Indeed, the carrier density, and thus the charge density, is proportional to VGS - Vtn, commonly referred to as the effective gate-source voltage and denoted Veff.

Electron mobility is 0.14 m^2/Vs in pure intrinsic silicon, decreasing with increasing dopant concentrations to μn ≅ 0.01-0.06 m^2/Vs in modern NMOS devices. It is important to note that as the channel length increases, the drain-source current decreases, while this current increases with either the charge density or the transistor width. Utilizing the equations for QT-n and ID yields:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}=\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\frac{\\mathrm{~W}}{\\mathrm{~L}}\\left(\\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{GS}}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}\\right) \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}=\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\frac{\\mathrm{~W}}{\\mathrm{~L}} \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}\n$$\n\nIt should be emphasized that this relationship is only valid for drain-source voltages near zero (i.e., VDS much smaller than Veff).\n\nAs the drain-source voltage increases, the channel charge concentration diminishes at the drain end. This decrease is due to the reduced gate-to-channel voltage across the thin gate oxide as one approaches the drain. In other words, since the drain voltage is assumed to be higher than the source, there is an increasing voltage gradient from the source to the drain, resulting in a smaller gate-to-channel voltage near the drain. Since the charge density at a distance x from the source end of the channel is proportional to VG - Vch(x) - Vtn, as VG - Vch(x) decreases, the charge density also decreases. This effect is illustrated in Fig. 1.11.\n\nAt the drain end of the channel, we have:\n\n$$\nV_{G}-V_{c h}(L)=V_{G D}\n$$\n\nFor small VDS, we observed that ID was linearly related to VDS. However, as VDS increases, and the charge density decreases near the drain, the relationship becomes nonlinear. In fact, the linear relationship for ID versus VDS flattens for larger VDS, as shown in Fig. 1.12.\n\nAs the drain voltage is increased, at some point the gate-to-channel voltage at the drain end will decrease to the threshold value Vtn - the minimum gate-to-channel voltage required for n carriers in the channel to exist. Thus, at the drain end, the channel becomes pinched off, as depicted\nThe functionality of an n-channel MOS transistor\nTransistor is described, focusing on a simplified cross-section as depicted in Fig. 1.9, where the source, drain, and substrate are all grounded. In this setup, the MOS transistor's operation is akin to that of a capacitor, with the gate serving as one capacitor\nThe functionality of n-channel MOS transistors will be explained using a simplified cross-section as shown in Fig. 1.9, with the source, drain, and substrate all grounded. In this configuration, the MOS transistor operates like a capacitor, with the gate as one plate and the silicon surface beneath the insulating SiO2 layer as the other plate."

    "text": "The triode region equation for a MOS transistor describes the relationship between the drain current and the gate-source and drain-source voltages. It can be demonstrated (refer to Appendix) that this relationship is expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}=\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{ox}}\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{~W}}{\\mathrm{~L}}\\right)\\left[\\left(\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{GS}}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}\\right) \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}-\\frac{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}^{2}}{2}\\right] \\tag{1.61}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAs $V_{D S}$ rises, $I_{D}$ also increases until the channel near the drain pinches off, after which $I_{D}$ no longer rises. This pinch-off occurs when $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DG}}=-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$, or approximately,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{D S}=V_{G S}-V_{t n}=V_{\\text {eff }} \\tag{1.62}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAt the pinch-off edge, the drain current from (1.61) and the drain current in the active region (which, to a first-order approximation, remains constant with respect to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$) must be equal. Thus, the active region equation can be derived by substituting (1.62) into (1.61), resulting in\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{D}=\\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} C_{o x}}{2}\\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)\\left(V_{G S}-V_{t n}\\right)^{2} \\tag{1.63}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}>\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$, the current remains constant at the value given by (1.63), neglecting second-order effects like channel-length modulation. This equation is crucial for describing the large-signal operation of a MOS transistor. It should be noted that (1.63) represents a square-law current-voltage relationship for a MOS transistor in the active region, whereas a BJT transistor exhibits an exponential current-voltage relationship in the active region.\n\nKey Point: For $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}>\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, the MOS device displays a square-law current-voltage relationship.\n\nAs mentioned, (1.63) suggests that the drain current, $I_{D}$, is independent of the drain-source voltage, valid only to a first-order approximation. The primary source of error is the reduction in channel length as $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ increases. To observe this effect, consider Fig. 1.15, which depicts a cross-section of a transistor in the\nimage_name:Fig. 1.15\ndescription:Fig. 1.15 illustrates a cross-section of a MOSFET transistor in the active region, highlighting the channel length reduction when \\( V_{\\mathrm{DS}} > V_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\).

A pinched-off region with minimal charge exists between the drain and the channel. The voltage at the channel's drain-end is fixed at $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{Gs}}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$. The voltage difference between the drain and the channel's near end lies across a short depletion region, often termed the pinch-off region. As $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ exceeds $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$, this depletion region around the drain junction widens in a square-root relationship with $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$. This widening decreases the effective channel length, which in turn increases the drain current, a phenomenon known as channel-length modulation.\n\nTo derive an equation accounting for channel-length modulation, we first use (1.11) and denote the depletion region width by $\\mathrm{x}_{\\mathrm{d}}$, resulting in\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathrm{x}_{\\mathrm{d}} & \\cong \\mathrm{k}_{\\mathrm{ds}} \\sqrt{V_{\\mathrm{D}-\\mathrm{ch}}+\\Phi_{0}}  \\tag{1.64}\\\\\n& =\\mathrm{k}_{\\mathrm{ds}} \\sqrt{V_{\\mathrm{DG}}+\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}+\\Phi_{0}}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{k}_{\\mathrm{ds}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\mathrm{~K}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\varepsilon_{0}}{\\mathrm{qN}}} \\tag{1.65}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwith units of $m / \\sqrt{V}$. Note that $N_{A}$ is used here since the $n$-type drain region is more heavily doped than the p-type channel (i.e., $N_{D} \\gg N_{A}$). By applying a Taylor approximation for $I_{D}$ around its operating value of $V_{D S}=V_{G S}-V_{t n}=V_{\\text {eff }}$, we find $I_{D}$ to be\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{D}=I_{D-s a t}+\\left(\\frac{\\partial I_{D}}{\\partial L}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial V_{D S}}\\right) \\Delta V_{D S} \\cong I_{D-s a t}\\left(1+\\frac{k_{d s}\\left(V_{D S}-V_{\\text {eff }}\\right)}{2 L \\sqrt{V_{D G}+V_{t n}+\\Phi_{0}}}\\right) \\tag{1.66}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $I_{D \\text {-sat }}$ is the drain current when $V_{D S}=V_{\\text {eff }}$, ignoring channel-length modulation. In deriving (1.66), we used the relationship $\\partial \\mathrm{L} / \\partial \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}=-\\partial \\mathrm{x}_{\\mathrm{d}} / \\partial \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$. Typically, (1.66) is written as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{D}=\\frac{\\mu_{n} C_{o x}}{2}\\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)\\left(V_{G S}-V_{t n}\\right)^{2}\\left[1+\\lambda\\left(V_{D S}-V_{\\text {eff }}\\right)\\right] \\tag{1.67}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the output impedance constant (in $\\mathrm{V}^{-1}$) given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\lambda=\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{ds}}}{2 L \\sqrt{V_{D G}+V_{t n}+\\Phi_{0}}}=\\frac{k_{d s}}{2 L \\sqrt{V_{D S}-V_{\\text {eff }}+\\Phi_{0}}} \\tag{1.68}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation (1.67) remains accurate until $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ becomes large enough to introduce second-order effects, known as short-channel effects. For instance, (1.67) assumes that current flow down the channel is not velocity-saturated, where increasing the electric field no longer boosts carrier speed. Short-channel effects cause $I_{D}$ to deviate from (1.67)'s prediction, discussed in Section 1.4. Eventually, for very high $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$, the transistor will break down.\n\nA graph of $I_{D}$ versus $V_{D S}$ for various $V_{G S}$ values is shown in Fig. 1.16. Note the slight (but nonzero) slope in the active region, indicating $I_{D}$'s minor dependence on $V_{D S}$.\nimage_name:Fig. 1.16\ndescription:Fig. 1.16 displays a plot of drain current ($I_{D}$) versus drain-source voltage ($V_{DS}$) for different gate-source voltages ($V_{GS}$) in an n-channel MOSFET.\n\n1. **Graph Type and Function:**\n- A characteristic curve graph for a MOSFET transistor, showing the $I_{D}$-$V_{DS}$ relationship for various $V_{GS}$ values.\n\n2. **Axes and Units:**\n- The x-axis represents $V_{DS}$ in volts (V).\n- The y-axis represents $I_{D}$ in amperes (A).\n- Both axes use a linear scale.\n\n3. **Behavior and Trends:**\n- Multiple curves correspond to different $V_{GS}$ values.\n- For low $V_{DS}$, curves rise steeply, indicating the triode region.\n- As $V_{DS}$ increases, curves flatten, entering the active (saturation) region where $I_{D}$ is relatively constant.\n- The slope in the active region is small, showing a weak $I_{D}$ dependence on $V_{DS}$.\n- Short-channel effects are indicated at higher $V_{DS}$, causing deviation from ideal behavior.\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The transition from triode to active region is marked by $V_{DS} = (V_{GS} - V_{tn})$, shown by a dashed line.\n- Curves shift upwards with increasing $V_{GS}$, indicating higher $I_{D}$.\n- The \"Short-channel effects\" region shows where actual device behavior deviates.\n\n5. **Annotations:**\n- Regions labeled \"Triode region,\" \"Active region,\" and \"Short-channel effects.\"\n- An arrow indicates increasing $V_{GS}$.\n- The condition $V_{GS} > V_{tn}$ is noted.\n\nFig. 1.16 $\\quad I_{D}$ versus $V_{D S}$ for different $V_{G S}$ values.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 1.8\n\nDetermine $I_{D}$ for an $n$-channel transistor with doping concentrations of $N_{D}=10^{25}$ electrons $/ \\mathrm{m}^{3}$, $\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{A}}=5 \\times 10^{22}$ holes $/ \\mathrm{m}^{3}, \\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{ox}}=270 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} / \\mathrm{V}^{2}, \\mathrm{~W} / \\mathrm{L}=5 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} / 0.5 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}, \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{GS}}=0.8 \\mathrm{~V}, \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}=0.45 \\mathrm{~V}$, and $V_{D S}=V_{\\text {eff }}$.

    "text": "The triode region equation for a MOS transistor describes the relationship between the drain current and the gate-source and drain-source voltages. It can be demonstrated (refer to Appendix) that this relationship is expressed by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}=\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{ox}}\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{~W}}{\\mathrm{~L}}\\right)\\left[\\left(\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{GS}}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}\\right) \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}-\\frac{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}^{2}}{2}\\right] \\tag{1.61}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAs $V_{D S}$ rises, $I_{D}$ also increases until the channel near the drain pinches off, at which point $I_{D}$ ceases to increase further. This pinch-off occurs when $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DG}}=-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$, or approximately,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{D S}=V_{G S}-V_{t n}=V_{\\text {eff }} \\tag{1.62}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAt the verge of pinch-off, the drain current from (1.61) must match the drain current in the active region, which, to a first-order approximation, remains constant with respect to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$. Consequently, the active region equation can be derived by substituting (1.62) into (1.61), yielding\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{D}=\\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} C_{o x}}{2}\\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)\\left(V_{G S}-V_{t n}\\right)^{2} \\tag{1.63}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}>\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$, the current remains constant at the value given by (1.63), disregarding second-order effects like channel-length modulation. This equation is arguably the most crucial for describing the large-signal behavior of a MOS transistor. It is important to note that (1.63) represents a square-law current-voltage relationship for a MOS transistor in the active region, whereas a BJT transistor exhibits an exponential current-voltage relationship in the active region.\n\nKey Point: For $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}>\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, the MOS device displays a square-law current-voltage relationship.\n\nAs previously mentioned, (1.63) suggests that the drain current, $I_{D}$, is independent of the drain-source voltage, a fact valid only to a first-order approximation. The primary source of error stems from the channel length decreasing as $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ increases. To observe this effect, consider Fig. 1.15, which depicts a cross-section of a transistor in the active region. A pinched-off region with minimal charge exists between the drain and the channel. The voltage at the channel's end near the drain is fixed at $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{Gs}}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$. The voltage difference between the drain and the channel's near end spans a short depletion region often termed the pinch-off region. As $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ exceeds $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$, this depletion region around the drain junction widens in a square-root relationship with $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$. This widening reduces the effective channel length, which in turn increases the drain current, a phenomenon known as channel-length modulation.\n\nTo derive an equation accounting for channel-length modulation, we first utilize (1.11) and denote the depletion region's width by $\\mathrm{x}_{\\mathrm{d}}$, resulting in\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathrm{x}_{\\mathrm{d}} & \\cong \\mathrm{k}_{\\mathrm{ds}} \\sqrt{V_{\\mathrm{D}-\\mathrm{ch}}+\\Phi_{0}}  \\tag{1.64}\\\\\n& =\\mathrm{k}_{\\mathrm{ds}} \\sqrt{V_{\\mathrm{DG}}+\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}+\\Phi_{0}}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{k}_{\\mathrm{ds}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\mathrm{~K}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\varepsilon_{0}}{\\mathrm{qN}}} \\tag{1.65}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand has units of $m / \\sqrt{V}$. Note that $N_{A}$ is used here since the $n$-type drain region is more heavily doped than the p-type channel (i.e., $N_{D} \\gg N_{A}$ ). By applying a Taylor approximation for $I_{D}$ around its operating value of $V_{D S}=V_{G S}-V_{t n}=V_{\\text {eff }}$, we find $I_{D}$ to be given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{D}=I_{D-s a t}+\\left(\\frac{\\partial I_{D}}{\\partial L}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial V_{D S}}\\right) \\Delta V_{D S} \\cong I_{D-s a t}\\left(1+\\frac{k_{d s}\\left(V_{D S}-V_{\\text {eff }}\\right)}{2 L \\sqrt{V_{D G}+V_{t n}+\\Phi_{0}}}\\right) \\tag{1.66}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $I_{D \\text {-sat }}$ is the drain current when $V_{D S}=V_{\\text {eff }}$, or equivalently, the drain current忽略ing channel-length modulation. Note that in deriving the final equation of (1.66), we have used the relationship $\\partial \\mathrm{L} / \\partial \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}=-\\partial \\mathrm{x}_{\\mathrm{d}} / \\partial \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$. Typically, (1.66) is written as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{D}=\\frac{\\mu_{n} C_{o x}}{2}\\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)\\left(V_{G S}-V_{t n}\\right)^{2}\\left[1+\\lambda\\left(V_{D S}-V_{\\text {eff }}\\right)\\right] \\tag{1.67}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the output impedance constant (in units of $\\mathrm{V}^{-1}$ ) given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\lambda=\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{ds}}}{2 L \\sqrt{V_{D G}+V_{t n}+\\Phi_{0}}}=\\frac{k_{d s}}{2 L \\sqrt{V_{D S}-V_{\\text {eff }}+\\Phi_{0}}} \\tag{1.68}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation (1.67) remains accurate until $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ becomes large enough to invoke second-order effects, often referred to as short-channel effects. For instance, (1.67) assumes that current flow down the channel is not velocity-saturated, meaning that increasing the electric field no longer boosts carrier speed. Short-channel effects cause $I_{D}$ to deviate from the prediction of (1.67) and are discussed in Section 1.4. Ultimately, for very high $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ values, the transistor will experience breakdown.\n\nA plot of $I_{D}$ versus $V_{D S}$ for various $V_{G S}$ values is shown in Fig. 1.16. Note that in the active region, the slight (but nonzero) slope indicates a minor dependence of $I_{D}$ on $V_{D S}$.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 1.8\n\nDetermine $I_{D}$ for an $n$-channel transistor with doping concentrations of $N_{D}=10^{25}$ electrons $/ \\mathrm{m}^{3}$, $\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{A}}=5 \\times 10^{22}$ holes $/ \\mathrm{m}^{3}, \\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{ox}}=270 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} / \\mathrm{V}^{2}, \\mathrm{~W} / \\mathrm{L}=5 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} / 0.5 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}, \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{GS}}=0.8 \\mathrm{~V}, \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}=0.45 \\mathrm{~V}$, and $V_{D S}=V_{\\text {eff }}$.

This equation is crucial for describing the large-signal behavior of a MOS transistor. It is important to note that (1.63) represents a square-law current-voltage relationship for a MOS transistor in the active region, whereas a BJT transistor exhibits an exponential current-voltage relationship in the active region.\n\nKey Point: For $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}>\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, the MOS device displays a square-law current-voltage relationship.\n\nAs previously mentioned, (1.63) suggests that the drain current, $I_{D}$, is independent of the drain-source voltage, valid only to a first-order approximation.

A pinched-off region with minimal charge exists between the drain and the channel. The voltage at the channel's drain-end is fixed at $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{Gs}}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$. The voltage difference between the drain and the channel's near end spans a short depletion region, often termed the pinch-off region. As $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ exceeds $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$, this depletion region's width increases in a square-root relationship with $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$. This width increase reduces the effective channel length, which in turn boosts the drain current, a phenomenon known as channel-length modulation.\n\nTo derive an equation accounting for channel-length modulation, we first use (1.11) and denote the depletion region's width as $\\mathrm{x}_{\\mathrm{d}}$, resulting in\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathrm{x}_{\\mathrm{d}} & \\cong \\mathrm{k}_{\\mathrm{ds}} \\sqrt{V_{\\mathrm{D}-\\mathrm{ch}}+\\Phi_{0}}  \\tag{1.64}\\\\\n& =\\mathrm{k}_{\\mathrm{ds}} \\sqrt{V_{\\mathrm{DG}}+\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}+\\Phi_{0}}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{k}_{\\mathrm{ds}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\mathrm{~K}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\varepsilon_{0}}{\\mathrm{qN}}} \\tag{1.65}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwith units of $m / \\sqrt{V}$. Note that $N_{A}$ is used here since the $n$-type drain region is more heavily doped than the p-type channel (i.e., $N_{D} \\gg N_{A}$ ). By applying a Taylor approximation for $I_{D}$ around its operating value of $V_{D S}=V_{G S}-V_{t n}=V_{\\text {eff }}$, we find $I_{D}$ to be\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{D}=I_{D-s a t}+\\left(\\frac{\\partial I_{D}}{\\partial L}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial V_{D S}}\\right) \\Delta V_{D S} \\cong I_{D-s a t}\\left(1+\\frac{k_{d s}\\left(V_{D S}-V_{\\text {eff }}\\right)}{2 L \\sqrt{V_{D G}+V_{t n}+\\Phi_{0}}}\\right) \\tag{1.66}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $I_{D \\text {-sat }}$ is the drain current at $V_{D S}=V_{\\text {eff }}$, ignoring channel-length modulation. In deriving (1.66), we used the relationship $\\partial \\mathrm{L} / \\partial \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}=-\\partial \\mathrm{x}_{\\mathrm{d}} / \\partial \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$. Typically, (1.66) is written as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{D}=\\frac{\\mu_{n} C_{o x}}{2}\\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)\\left(V_{G S}-V_{t n}\\right)^{2}\\left[1+\\lambda\\left(V_{D S}-V_{\\text {eff }}\\right)\\right] \\tag{1.67}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the output impedance constant (in $\\mathrm{V}^{-1}$) given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\lambda=\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{ds}}}{2 L \\sqrt{V_{D G}+V_{t n}+\\Phi_{0}}}=\\frac{k_{d s}}{2 L \\sqrt{V_{D S}-V_{\\text {eff }}+\\Phi_{0}}} \\tag{1.68}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation (1.67) remains accurate until $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ becomes large enough to introduce second-order effects, known as short-channel effects. For instance, (1.67) assumes that current flow in the channel is not velocity-saturated, meaning increasing the electric field no longer boosts carrier speed. Short-channel effects cause $I_{D}$ to deviate from (1.67)'s prediction, as discussed in Section 1.4. Eventually, for very high $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ values, the transistor will break down.\n\nA graph of $I_{D}$ versus $V_{D S}$ for various $V_{G S}$ values is shown in Fig. 1.16.

Thus, the active region equation is derived by substituting (1.62) into (1.61), resulting in\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{D}=\\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} C_{o x}}{2}\\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)\\left(V_{G S}-V_{t n}\\right)^{2} \\tag{1.63}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}>\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$, the current remains constant at the value given by (1.63), neglecting second-order effects like channel-length modulation. This equation is crucial for describing the large-signal operation of a MOS transistor. It is important to note that (1.63) represents a square-law current-voltage relationship for a MOS transistor in the active region, whereas a BJT transistor exhibits an exponential current-voltage relationship in the active region.\n\nKey Point: For $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}>\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, the MOS device displays a square-law current-voltage relationship.\n\nAs previously mentioned, (1.63) suggests that the drain current, $I_{D}$, is independent of the drain-source voltage, valid only to a first-order approximation. The primary source of error is the reduction in channel length as $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ increases. To observe this effect, consider Fig. 1.15, which depicts a cross-section of a transistor in the active region. A pinched-off region with minimal charge exists between the drain and the channel. The voltage at the channel's drain-end is fixed at $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{Gs}}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$. The voltage difference between the drain and the channel's near end spans a short depletion region, often termed the pinch-off region. As $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ exceeds $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$, this depletion region widens in a square-root relationship with $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$. This widening decreases the effective channel length, which in turn increases the drain current, a phenomenon known as channel-length modulation.\n\nTo derive an equation accounting for channel-length modulation, we first use (1.11) and denote the depletion region width by $\\mathrm{x}_{\\mathrm{d}}$, resulting in\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathrm{x}_{\\mathrm{d}} & \\cong \\mathrm{k}_{\\mathrm{ds}} \\sqrt{V_{\\mathrm{D}-\\mathrm{ch}}+\\Phi_{0}}  \\tag{1.64}\\\\\n& =\\mathrm{k}_{\\mathrm{ds}} \\sqrt{V_{\\mathrm{DG}}+\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}+\\Phi_{0}}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{k}_{\\mathrm{ds}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\mathrm{~K}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\varepsilon_{0}}{\\mathrm{qN}}} \\tag{1.65}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand has units of $m / \\sqrt{V}$. Note that $N_{A}$ is used here since the $n$-type drain region is more heavily doped than the p-type channel (i.e., $N_{D} \\gg N_{A}$ ). By applying a Taylor approximation for $I_{D}$ around $V_{D S}=V_{G S}-V_{t n}=V_{\\text {eff }}$, we find $I_{D}$ to be\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{D}=I_{D-s a t}+\\left(\\frac{\\partial I_{D}}{\\partial L}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial V_{D S}}\\right) \\Delta V_{D S} \\cong I_{D-s a t}\\left(1+\\frac{k_{d s}\\left(V_{D S}-V_{\\text {eff }}\\right)}{2 L \\sqrt{V_{D G}+V_{t n}+\\Phi_{0}}}\\right) \\tag{1.66}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $I_{D \\text {-sat }}$ is the drain current at $V_{D S}=V_{\\text {eff }}$, ignoring channel-length modulation. In deriving (1.66), we used $\\partial \\mathrm{L} / \\partial \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}=-\\partial \\mathrm{x}_{\\mathrm{d}} / \\partial \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$. Typically, (1.66) is written as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{D}=\\frac{\\mu_{n} C_{o x}}{2}\\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)\\left(V_{G S}-V_{t n}\\right)^{2}\\left[1+\\lambda\\left(V_{D S}-V_{\\text {eff }}\\right)\\right] \\tag{1.67}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the output impedance constant (in $\\mathrm{V}^{-1}$) given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\lambda=\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{ds}}}{2 L \\sqrt{V_{D G}+V_{t n}+\\Phi_{0}}}=\\frac{k_{d s}}{2 L \\sqrt{V_{D S}-V_{\\text {eff }}+\\Phi_{0}}} \\tag{1.68}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation (1.67) remains accurate until $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ becomes large enough to introduce second-order effects, known as short-channel effects. For instance, (1.67) assumes that current flow down the channel is not velocity-saturated, where increasing the electric field no longer boosts carrier speed. Short-channel effects cause $I_{D}$ to deviate from (1.67)'s prediction, as discussed in Section 1.4. Eventually, at very high $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ values, the transistor will break down.\n\nFig. 1.16 plots $I_{D}$ versus $V_{D S}$ for various $V_{G S}$ values. Note the slight (but nonzero) slope in the active region, indicating $I_{D}$'s minor dependence on $V_{D S}$.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 1.8\n\nDetermine $I_{D}$ for an $n$-channel transistor with doping concentrations of $N_{D}=10^{25}$ electrons $/ \\mathrm{m}^{3}$, $\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{A}}=5 \\times 10^{22}$ holes $/ \\mathrm{m}^{3}, \\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{ox}}=270 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} / \\mathrm{V}^{2}, \\mathrm{~W} / \\mathrm{L}=5 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} / 0.5 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}, \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{GS}}=0.8 \\mathrm{~V}, \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}=0.45 \\mathrm{~V}$, and $V_{D S}=V_{\\text {eff }}$. Assuming $\\lambda$ remains constant, estimate the new $I_{D}$ if $V_{D S}$ increases by 0.5 V.\n\n#### Solution\n\nFrom (1.65), we obtain\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{k}_{\\mathrm{ds}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 11.8 \\times 8.854 \\times 10^{-12}}{1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\times 5 \\times 10^{22}}}=162 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{~m} / \\sqrt{\\mathrm{V}}\n$$\n\nThis value is used in (1.68) to find $\\lambda$ as\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\frac{162 \\times 10^{-9}}{2 \\times 0.5 \\times 10^{-6} \\times \\sqrt{0.9}}=0.171 \\mathrm{~V}^{-1}\n$$\n\nUsing (1.67), for $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}=0.4 \\mathrm{~V}$,\n\n$$\nI_{D 1}=\\left(\\frac{270 \\times 10^{-6}}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{5}{0.5}\\right)(0.35)^{2}(1)=165 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}\n$$\n\nFor $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{Ds}}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}+0.5 \\mathrm{~V}=0.9 \\mathrm{~V}$,\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D} 2}=165 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\times(1+\\lambda \\times 0.5)=180 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}\n$$\n\nThis example illustrates a nearly 10 percent increase in drain current for a 0.5 V rise in drain-source voltage."

Central to this model is the voltage-controlled current source, $\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m}} \\mathrm{v}_{\\mathrm{gs}}$, where $\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m}}$, the transistor's transconductance, is given by\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m}}=\\frac{\\partial \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}}{\\partial \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{GS}}} \\tag{1.71}\n$$\n\nWithin the active region, we utilize equation (1.63), which is provided here for convenience,\n\n$$\nI_{D}=\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{o x}\\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)\\left(V_{G S}-V_{t n}\\right)^{2}=\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{o x}\\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right) V_{\\text {eff }}^{2} \\tag{1.72}\n$$\n\nApplying the derivative as shown in (1.71), we find\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m}}=\\frac{\\partial I_{D}}{\\partial V_{G S}}=\\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}\\left(V_{G S}-V_{t n}\\right)=\\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L} V_{\\text {eff }} \\tag{1.73}\n$$\n\nor more simply,\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m}}=\\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L} V_{\\text {eff }} \\tag{1.74}\n$$\n\nHere, the effective gate-source voltage, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$, is defined as $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }} \\equiv \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{GS}}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$. Hence, the transconductance of a MOSFET is directly proportional to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$.\n\nThere are instances where expressing $g_{m}$ in terms of $I_{D}$ rather than $V_{G s}$ is preferable. From (1.72), we derive\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{Gs}}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{ox}}(\\mathrm{~W} / \\mathrm{L})}} \\tag{1.75}\n$$\n\nThe second term in (1.75) represents the effective gate-source voltage, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$, where\n\n$$\nV_{\\text {eff }}=V_{G S}-V_{t n}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2 I_{\\mathrm{D}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} C_{o x}(W / L)}} \\tag{1.76}\n$$\n\nSubstituting (1.76) into (1.74) yields an alternative expression for $\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m}}$.\n\nThe low-frequency, small-signal model for an active MOSFET as shown in Fig. 1.17 includes a voltage source, two voltage-controlled current sources, and a resistor. The current $i_d$ flows from the node $v_d$ through the resistor $r_{ds}$.\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m}}=\\sqrt{2 \\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L} I_{\\mathrm{D}}} \\tag{1.77}\n$$\n\nThus, the transistor transconductance is proportional to $\\sqrt{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}}$ for a MOSFET. A third expression for $\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m}}$ is obtained by rearranging (1.77) and using (1.76) to get\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m}}=\\frac{2 I_{\\mathrm{D}}}{V_{\\text {eff }}} \\tag{1.78}\n$$\n\nAn important point to note is that the square-root relationship for transconductance $g_{m}=\\sqrt{2 \\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} C_{0 x}(W / L) I_{\\mathrm{D}}}$ is beneficial for circuit analysis when device dimensions are fixed. However, the simpler expression $\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m}}=2 \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}} / \\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$ is more useful during the preliminary stages of circuit design when transistor dimensions have not yet been decided.\n\nIt is important to recognize that this expression is independent of $\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{ox}}$ and $\\mathrm{W} / \\mathrm{L}$, and it connects the transconductance to the ratio of drain current to effective gate-source voltage. However, it may lead to confusion for novice analog designers, as it seems to suggest that transconductance is proportional to drain current, whereas (1.77) indicates a square-root relationship. This discrepancy is resolved by understanding that increasing $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}$ while maintaining $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$ constant implies a proportional increase in (W/L). Therefore, (1.77) is applicable for analysis when transistor sizes are known, whereas the simplified expression in (1.78) can be quite useful during initial circuit design when the sizes of the transistors are yet to be established.\n\nDesign often starts with a series of transistor voltage-current measurements, obtained either through experimentation or simulation, from which the designer can estimate device constants such as $\\mu_{n} C_{o x}, V_{t n}$, etc., based on the relationships discussed above.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 1.9\n\nThe drain current for a specific NMOS device with an aspect ratio $\\mathrm{W} / \\mathrm{L}=10$ is plotted in Fig. 1.18(a) against $V_{G S}$ for constant drain, source, and body voltages. Using this data, estimate $\\mu_{n} C_{o x}$ and $V_{t n}$.\n\n#### Solution\n\nBy differentiating the data in Fig. 1.18(a), we obtain the plot of $\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m}}=\\delta \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}} / \\delta \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{Gs}}$ in Fig. 1.18(b). According to the square-law equation (1.74), this plot should exhibit linearity in the active region, intersecting the line $g_{m}=0$ at $V_{\\text {eff }}=0$. Thus, extrapolating the linear portion of the curve in Fig. 1.18(b) yields an intersection at $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{Gs}}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$. In this instance, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}} \\cong 450 \\mathrm{mV}$. Moreover, (1.73) indicates that the slope of the $\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m}}$ versus $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{GS}}$ curve should be $\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} \\mathrm{C}_{o x}(\\mathrm{W} / \\mathrm{L})$ in active operation. In Fig. 1.18(b), this slope is approximately $2.7 \\mathrm{~mA} / \\mathrm{V}^{2}$, corresponding to a value of $\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} \\mathrm{C}_{o x}=270 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} / \\mathrm{V}^{2}$. These are approximate values, especially since (1.74) is derived without considering channel-length modulation. Nonetheless, they are valuable during design for rapid and rough estimation of the device sizes, currents, and voltages necessary to achieve a desired $\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m}}$.\n\nThe second voltage-controlled current-source in Fig. 1.17, represented as $\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\mathrm{v}_{\\mathrm{s}}$, models the body effect on the small-signal drain current, $i_{d}$. When the source is connected to small-signal ground, or when its voltage remains relatively constant, this current source can be disregarded. When the body effect is significant, we have\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{s}}=\\frac{\\partial \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}}{\\partial \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{SB}}}=\\frac{\\partial \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}}{\\partial \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}} \\frac{\\partial \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}}{\\partial \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{SB}}} \\tag{1.79}\n$$\n\nThe resistor, $r_{d s}$, depicted in Fig. 1.17, accounts for the finite output impedance, modeling the channel-length modulation and its impact on the drain current due to changes in $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$. Utilizing (1.67), which is provided here for convenience,\n\n$$\nI_{D}=\\frac{\\mu_{n} C_{o x}}{2}\\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)\\left(V_{G S}-V_{t n}\\right)^{2}\\left[1+\\lambda\\left(V_{D S}-V_{\\text {eff }}\\right)\\right] \\tag{1.84}\n$$\n\nwe find\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r_{d s}}=g_{d s}=\\frac{\\partial I_{D}}{\\partial V_{D S}}=\\lambda\\left(\\frac{\\mu_{n} C_{o x}}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)\\left(V_{G S}-V_{t n}\\right)^{2}=\\lambda I_{D-\\text { sat }} \\cong \\lambda I_{D} \\tag{1.85}\n$$\n\nwhere the approximation holds when $\\lambda$ is small, allowing us to approximate the drain bias current as being the same as $I_{D-\\text { sat }}$. Therefore,\n\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{ds}} \\cong \\frac{1}{\\lambda \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}} \\tag{1.86}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\frac{\\mathrm{k}_{\\mathrm{ds}}}{2 \\mathrm{~L} \\sqrt{\\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{Ds}}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{eff}}+\\Phi_{0}}} \\tag{1.87}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{k}_{\\mathrm{ds}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\mathrm{~K}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\varepsilon_{0}}{\\mathrm{qN}}} \\tag{1.88}\n$$\n\nAn important observation is that small signal $r_{d s}$ is proportional to $\\mathrm{L} / \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}$.\n\nSubstituting (1.87) into (1.86) reveals that $r_{\\mathrm{ds}}$ is proportional to $\\mathrm{L} / \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}$. It should be noted that (1.86) is often empirically adjusted to account for second-order effects.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 1.10\n\nDerive the low-frequency model parameters for an n-channel transistor with doping concentrations of $\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{D}}=10^{25}$ electrons $/ \\mathrm{m}^{3}, \\mathrm{~N}_{\\mathrm{A}}=5 \\times 10^{22}$ holes $/ \\mathrm{m}^{3}, \\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{ox}}=270 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} / \\mathrm{V}^{2}, \\mathrm{~W} / \\mathrm{L}=5 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} / 0.5 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}, \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{GS}}=0.8 \\mathrm{~V}$, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}=0.45 \\mathrm{~V}$, and $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$. Assume $\\gamma=0.25 \\sqrt{\\mathrm{~V}}$ and $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{SB}}=0.5 \\mathrm{~V}$. What is the new value of $\\mathrm{r}_{\\mathrm{ds}}$ if the drain-source voltage is increased by 0.5 V?\n\n#### Solution\n\nGiven these parameters, we have\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m}}=\\frac{2 \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}}{\\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{eff}}}=\\frac{2 \\times 165 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}}{0.35 \\mathrm{~V}}=0.94 \\mathrm{~mA} / \\mathrm{V}\n$$\n\nThe Fermi potential of the body at room temperature with $\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{A}}=5 \\times 10^{22}$ holes $/ \\mathrm{m}^{3}$ is $\\phi_{F}=(\\mathrm{kT} / \\mathrm{q})$ $\\ln \\left(N_{A} / n_{i}\\right) \\cong 0.38 \\mathrm{~V}$, and from (1.83) we obtain\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{s}}=\\frac{0.25 \\times 0.94 \\times 10^{-3}}{2 \\sqrt{0.5+0.766}}=0.104 \\mathrm{~mA} / \\mathrm{V}\n$$\n\nIt is noted that this source-bulk transconductance value is about 1/9th that of the gate-source transconductance. For $r_{d s}$, we use (1.86) to find\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{r}_{\\mathrm{ds}}=\\frac{1}{0.171 \\times 165 \\times 10^{-6}}=35 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega\n$$\n\nConsidering that $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}=0.35 \\mathrm{~V}$, if $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{Ds}}$ is increased to 0.85 V, the new value for $\\lambda$ is\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\frac{162 \\times 10^{-9}}{2\\left(0.5 \\times 10^{-6}\\right) \\sqrt{1.4}}=0.137 \\mathrm{~V}^{-1}\n$$\n\nresulting in a new value of $r_{d s}$ given by\n\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{ds}}=\\frac{1}{\\lambda \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D} 2}}=\\frac{1}{0.137 \\times 180 \\times 10^{-6}} \\cong 41 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega\n$$\n\n#### EXAMPLE 1.11\n\nIn Fig. 1.19(a), the drain current of a particular NMOS device is plotted against its $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ with constant gate, source, and body voltages. Using this data, estimate the device parameter $\\lambda$.\n\n#### Solution\n\nFirst, rearrange (1.85) into\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\frac{g_{\\mathrm{ds}}}{I_{D-\\text { sat }}}=\\left(\\frac{\\partial I_{D}}{\\partial V_{D S}}\\right) \\frac{1}{I_{D-\\text { sat }}}\n$$\n\nThus, a plot of $\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{ds}} / \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}=\\left(\\partial \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}} / \\partial \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}\\right) / \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}$ against $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ for a constant value of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{GS}}$ will be roughly flat in strong inversion, providing a rough estimate of $\\lambda$. This is illustrated for the current example in Fig. 1.19(b), yielding a value of $\\lambda=0.45 \\mathrm{~V}^{-1}$. It should be noted that estimates obtained in this manner are approximate, as $r_{d s}$ is subject to many higher-order effects, particularly at short channel lengths where $\\lambda$ may vary by $50 \\%$ or even more.\n\nAn alternative low-frequency model, known as a T model, is depicted in Fig. 1.20. This T model can often lead to simpler equations and is frequently employed by experienced designers for rapid analysis. At first glance, it may seem that this model allows for nonzero gate current, but a quick check verifies that the drain current must always equal the source current, and hence, the gate current must always be zero. Consequently, when utilizing the T model, one assumes from the outset that the gate current is zero.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 1.12\n\nDetermine the T model parameter, $r_{\\mathrm{s}}$, for the transistor in Example 1.10.\n\n#### Solution\n\nThe value of $r_{s}$ is simply the reciprocal of $g_{m}$, leading to\n\n$$\nr_{s}=\\frac{1}{g_{m}}=\\frac{1}{0.94 \\times 10^{-3}}=1.06 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega\n$$\n\nThe value of $r_{\\mathrm{ds}}$ remains unchanged, either $35 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$ or $41 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$, depending on the drain-source voltage."

According to the square-law equation (1.74), this plot should be linear in the active region and intersect the line $g_{m}=0$ at $V_{\\text {eff }}=0$. Therefore, extrapolating the linear portion of the curve in Fig. 1.18(b) provides an intersection at $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{Gs}}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$.

This discrepancy is resolved by understanding that increasing \\( I_{\\text{D}} \\) while maintaining \\( V_{\\text{eff}} \\) constant implies a proportional increase in \\( \\frac{W}{L} \\). Therefore, (1.77) is useful for analysis with given transistor sizes, whereas the simple expression in (1.78) is quite useful during initial circuit design when transistor sizes are yet to be determined.\n\nDesign often starts with a set of transistor voltage-current measurements, obtained through experimentation or simulation, from which the designer can estimate device constants \\( \\mu_{\\text{n}} C_{\\text{ox}}, V_{\\text{tn}} \\), etc., based on the relationships presented above.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 1.9\n\nThe drain current for a specific NMOS device with an aspect ratio \\( \\frac{W}{L} = 10 \\) is plotted in Fig. 1.18(a) versus \\( V_{\\text{GS}} \\) for constant drain, source, and body voltages. From this data, estimate \\( \\mu_{\\text{n}} C_{\\text{ox}} \\) and \\( V_{\\text{tn}} \\).\n\n#### Solution\n\nBy taking the derivative of Fig. 1.18(a), we obtain the plot of \\( g_{\\text{m}} = \\frac{\\partial I_{\\text{D}}}{\\partial V_{\\text{GS}}} \\) in Fig. 1.18(b). Based on the square-law equation (1.74), this plot should be linear in the active region and intersect the line \\( g_{\\text{m}} = 0 \\) at \\( V_{\\text{eff}} = 0 \\). Hence, extrapolating the linear portion of the curve in Fig. 1.18(b) provides an intersection at \\( V_{\\text{GS}} = V_{\\text{tn}} \\). In this case, \\( V_{\\text{tn}} \\cong 450 \\text{ mV} \\). Furthermore, (1.73) indicates that the slope of the \\( g_{\\text{m}} \\) versus \\( V_{\\text{GS}} \\) curve should be \\( \\mu_{\\text{n}} C_{\\text{ox}} \\left( \\frac{W}{L} \\right) \\) in active operation. In Fig. 1.18(b), this slope is approximately \\( 2.7 \\text{ mA/V}^2 \\), which corresponds to a value of \\( \\mu_{\\text{n}} C_{\\text{ox}} = 270 \\mu \\text{A/V}^2 \\). These are approximate values, particularly since (1.74) is derived without considering channel-length modulation. However, these values are very useful during design for quickly and roughly estimating the device sizes, currents, and voltages required to achieve a desired \\( g_{\\text{m}} \\).\n\nThe second voltage-controlled current source in Fig. 1.17, represented as \\( g_{\\text{s}} v_{\\text{s}} \\), models the body effect on the small-signal drain current, \\( i_{\\text{d}} \\). When the source is connected to small-signal ground, or when its voltage does not change significantly, then this current source can be ignored. When the body effect cannot be ignored, we have:\n\n\\[\ng_{\\text{s}} = \\frac{\\partial I_{\\text{D}}}{\\partial V_{\\text{SB}}} = \\frac{\\partial I_{\\text{D}}}{\\partial V_{\\text{tn}}} \\frac{\\partial V_{\\text{tn}}}{\\partial V_{\\text{SB}}} \\tag{1.79}\n\\]\n\nUsing (1.81), which gives \\( V_{\\text{tn}} \\) as:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{tn}} = V_{\\text{tn}0} + \\gamma \\left( \\sqrt{V_{\\text{SB}} + |2 \\phi_{\\text{F}}|} - \\sqrt{|2 \\phi_{\\text{F}}|} \\right) \\tag{1.81}\n\\]\n\nwe find:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial V_{\\text{tn}}}{\\partial V_{\\text{SB}}} = \\frac{\\gamma}{2 \\sqrt{V_{\\text{SB}} + |2 \\phi_{\\text{F}}|}} \\tag{1.82}\n\\]\n\nThe negative sign of (1.80) is eliminated by subtracting the current \\( g_{\\text{s}} v_{\\text{s}} \\) from the major component of the drain current, \\( g_{\\text{m}} v_{\\text{gs}} \\), as shown in Fig. 1.17. Thus, using (1.80) and (1.82), we obtain:\n\n\\[\ng_{\\text{s}} = \\frac{\\gamma g_{\\text{m}}}{2 \\sqrt{V_{\\text{SB}} + |2 \\phi_{\\text{F}}|}} \\tag{1.83}\n\\]\n\nIt is noted that although \\( g_{\\text{s}} \\) is nonzero for \\( V_{\\text{SB}} = 0 \\), if the source is connected to the bulk \\( v_{\\text{sb}} \\) is zero and \\( g_{\\text{s}} \\) may be excluded from the model.

Thus:\n\n\\[\nr_{\\text{ds}} \\cong \\frac{1}{\\lambda I_{\\text{D}}} \\tag{1.86}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{k_{\\text{ds}}}{2 L \\sqrt{V_{\\text{DS}} - V_{\\text{eff}} + \\Phi_{0}}} \\tag{1.87}\n\\]\n\nand:\n\n\\[\nk_{\\text{ds}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 K_{\\text{s}} \\varepsilon_{0}}{qN}} \\tag{1.88}\n\\]\n\nKey Point: The small signal \\( r_{\\text{ds}} \\) is proportional to \\( \\frac{L}{I_{\\text{D}}} \\).\n\nSubstituting (1.87) into (1.86) reveals that \\( r_{\\text{ds}} \\) is proportional to \\( \\frac{L}{I_{\\text{D}}} \\). It should be noted here that (1.86) is often empirically adjusted to account for second-order effects.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 1.10\n\nDerive the low-frequency model parameters for an n-channel transistor that has doping concentrations of \\( N_{\\text{D}} = 10^{25} \\) electrons/\\( \\text{m}^3 \\), \\( N_{\\text{A}} = 5 \\times 10^{22} \\) holes/\\( \\text{m}^3 \\), \\( \\mu_{\\text{n}} C_{\\text{ox}} = 270 \\mu \\text{A/V}^2 \\), \\( \\frac{W}{L} = 5 \\mu \\text{m} / 0.5 \\mu \\text{m} \\), \\( V_{\\text{GS}} = 0.8 \\text{ V} \\), \\( V_{\\text{tn}} = 0.45 \\text{ V} \\), and \\( V_{\\text{DS}} = V_{\\text{eff}} \\).

What is the new value of \\( r_{\\text{ds}} \\) if the drain-source voltage is increased by 0.5 V?\n\n#### Solution\n\nSince these parameters are the same as in Example 1.8, we have:\n\n\\[\ng_{\\text{m}} = \\frac{2 I_{\\text{D}}}{V_{\\text{eff}}} = \\frac{2 \\times 165 \\mu \\text{A}}{0.35 \\text{ V}} = 0.94 \\text{ mA/V}\n\\]\n\nThe Fermi potential of the body at room temperature with \\( N_{\\text{A}} = 5 \\times 10^{22} \\) holes/\\( \\text{m}^3 \\) is \\( \\phi_{\\text{F}} = (\\text{kT} / \\text{q}) \\ln \\left( \\frac{N_{\\text{A}}}{n_{\\text{i}}} \\right) \\cong 0.38 \\text{ V} \\), and from (1.83) we have:\n\n\\[\ng_{\\text{s}} = \\frac{0.25 \\times 0.94 \\times 10^{-3}}{2 \\sqrt{0.5 + 0.766}} = 0.104 \\text{ mA/V}\n\\]\n\nIt is noted that this source-bulk transconductance value is about 1/9th that of the gate-source transconductance. For \\( r_{\\text{ds}} \\), we use (1.86) to find:\n\n\\[\nr_{\\text{ds}} = \\frac{1}{0.171 \\times 165 \\times 10^{-6}} = 35 \\text{k}\\Omega\n\\]\n\nRecalling that \\( V_{\\text{eff}} = 0.35 \\text{ V} \\), if \\( V_{\\text{DS}} \\) is increased to 0.85 V, the new value for \\( \\lambda \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{162 \\times 10^{-9}}{2 \\left( 0.5 \\times 10^{-6} \\right) \\sqrt{1.4}} = 0.137 \\text{ V}^{-1}\n\\]\n\nresulting in a new value of \\( r_{\\text{ds}} \\) given by:\n\n\\[\nr_{\\text{ds}} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda I_{\\text{D}2}} = \\frac{1}{0.137 \\times 180 \\times 10^{-6}} \\cong 41 \\text{k}\\Omega\n\\]\n\n#### EXAMPLE 1.11\n\nPlotted in Fig. 1.19(a) is the drain current of a specific NMOS device versus its \\( V_{\\text{DS}} \\) with constant gate, source, and body voltages. From this data, estimate the device parameter \\( \\lambda \\).\n\n#### Solution\n\nFirst, rearrange (1.85) into:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{g_{\\text{ds}}}{I_{\\text{D-sat}}} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial I_{\\text{D}}}{\\partial V_{\\text{DS}}} \\right) \\frac{1}{I_{\\text{D-sat}}}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, a plot of \\( \\frac{g_{\\text{ds}}}{I_{\\text{D}}} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial I_{\\text{D}}}{\\partial V_{\\text{DS}}} \\right) / I_{\\text{D}} \\) versus \\( V_{\\text{DS}} \\) for a constant value of \\( V_{\\text{GS}} \\) will be roughly flat in strong inversion, providing a rough estimate of \\( \\lambda \\). This is done for the present example in Fig. 1.19(b), yielding a value of \\( \\lambda = 0.45 \\text{ V}^{-1} \\). Estimates obtained in this manner are only approximate since \\( r_{\\text{ds}} \\) is subject to many higher-order effects, especially at short channel lengths where \\( \\lambda \\) may change by 50% or even more.\n\nAn alternate low-frequency model, known as a T model, is shown in Fig. 1.20.

This discrepancy is resolved by acknowledging that increasing $I_{D}$ while maintaining a constant $V_{\\text {eff }}$ necessitates a proportional increase in $(W/L)$.

Determine the new value of $r_{\\mathrm{ds}}$ if the drain-source voltage is increased by 0.5 V.\n\n#### Solution\n\nSince these parameters are consistent with Example 1.8, we have:\n\n$$\ng_{\\mathrm{m}}=\\frac{2 \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}}{\\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{eff}}}=\\frac{2 \\times 165 \\mu \\text{ A}}{0.35 \\text{ V}}=0.94 \\text{ mA/V}\n$$\n\nThe Fermi potential of the body at room temperature with $N_{\\mathrm{A}}=5 \\times 10^{22}$ holes $/ \\mathrm{m}^{3}$ is $\\phi_{F}=(\\mathrm{kT} / \\mathrm{q})$ $\\ln \\left(N_{A} / n_{i}\\right) \\cong 0.38 \\text{ V}$, and from (1.83) we derive:\n\n$$\ng_{\\mathrm{s}}=\\frac{0.25 \\times 0.94 \\times 10^{-3}}{2 \\sqrt{0.5+0.766}}=0.104 \\text{ mA/V}\n$$\n\nIt is observed that this source-bulk transconductance value is approximately 1/9th of the gate-source transconductance. For $r_{d s}$, we use (1.86) to find:\n\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{ds}}=\\frac{1}{0.171 \\times 165 \\times 10^{-6}}=35 \\text{ k}\\Omega\n$$\n\nRecalling that $V_{\\text {eff }}=0.35 \\text{ V}$, if $V_{\\mathrm{Ds}}$ is increased to 0.85 V, the new value for $\\lambda$ is:\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\frac{162 \\times 10^{-9}}{2\\left(0.5 \\times 10^{-6}\\right) \\sqrt{1.4}}=0.137 \\text{ V}^{-1}\n$$\n\nresulting in a new value of $r_{d s}$ given by:\n\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{ds}}=\\frac{1}{\\lambda \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D} 2}}=\\frac{1}{0.137 \\times 180 \\times 10^{-6}} \\cong 41 \\text{ k}\\Omega\n$$\n\n#### EXAMPLE 1.11\n\nUsing the drain current versus $V_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ data plotted in Fig. 1.19(a) for a particular NMOS device with constant gate, source, and body voltages, estimate the device parameter $\\lambda$.\n\n#### Solution\n\nFirst, rearrange (1.85) into:\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\frac{g_{\\mathrm{ds}}}{I_{D-\\text { sat }}}=\\left(\\frac{\\partial I_{D}}{\\partial V_{D S}}\\right) \\frac{1}{I_{D-\\text { sat }}}\n$$\n\nThus, a plot of $g_{\\mathrm{ds}} / I_{D}=\\left(\\partial I_{D} / \\partial V_{D S}\\right) / I_{D}$ versus $V_{D S}$ for a constant value of $V_{G S}$ will exhibit a roughly flat trend in strong inversion, providing an approximate estimate of $\\lambda$. This is demonstrated for the current example in Fig. 1.19(b), yielding a value of $\\lambda=0.45 \\text{ V}^{-1}$. Estimates obtained in this manner are approximate, as $r_{d s}$ is subject to numerous higher-order effects, especially at short channel lengths where $\\lambda$ may vary by $50 \\%$ or more.\n\nAn alternative low-frequency model, known as the T model, is presented in Fig. 1.20. This T model often leads to simpler equations and is predominantly employed by seasoned designers for swift analysis. At first glance, it may seem that this model allows for non-zero gate current. However, a cursory check verifies that the drain current must always equal the source current, and consequently, the gate current must always be zero. Therefore, when utilizing the T model, it is assumed from the outset that the gate current is zero.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 1.12\n\nDetermine the T model parameter, $r_{\\mathrm{s}}$, for the transistor in Example 1.10.\n\n#### Solution\n\nThe value of $r_{s}$ is simply the reciprocal of $g_{m}$, resulting in:\n\n$$\nr_{s}=\\frac{1}{g_{m}}=\\frac{1}{0.94 \\times 10^{-3}}=1.06 \\text{ k}\\Omega\n$$\n\nThe value of $r_{\\mathrm{ds}}$ remains unchanged, either $35 \\text{ k}\\Omega$ or $41 \\text{ k}\\Omega$, depending on the drain-source voltage."

Therefore, it is evident that the transconductance of a MOS transistor is directly proportional to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$.\n\nOccasionally, it is beneficial to express $g_{m}$ in terms of $I_{D}$ instead of $V_{G s}$. From (1.72), we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{Gs}}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{ox}}(\\mathrm{~W} / \\mathrm{L})}} \\tag{1.75}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe second term in (1.75) represents the effective gate-source voltage, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$, which is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {eff }}=V_{G S}-V_{t n}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2 I_{D}}{\\mu_{n} C_{o x}(W / L)}} \\tag{1.76}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nBy substituting (1.76) into (1.74), we derive an alternative representation for $\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m}}$.\n\nFig. 1.17 Illustrates the low-frequency, small-signal model of an active MOS transistor.\nThe transistor's transconductance, $g_{m}$, is proportional to $\\sqrt{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}}$ for a MOS transistor, as shown by equation (1.77).\n\n[^6]image_name:(a)\ndescription:\nThe graph labeled (a) illustrates the drain current ($I_D$) as a function of the gate-to-source voltage ($V_{GS}$) for a specific NMOS device. The x-axis corresponds to $V_{GS}$, ranging from 0 to 0.8 V, and the y-axis corresponds to $I_D$, ranging from 0 to 0.04 mA.\n\n1. **Graph Type and Functionality:**\n- The graph is an I-V characteristic curve, representing the relationship between the drain current ($I_D$) and the gate-to-source voltage ($V_{GS}$) for a MOSFET.\n\n2. **Axes and Units:**\n- The x-axis is labeled as $V_{GS}$ (V), indicating the gate-to-source voltage in volts.\n- The y-axis is labeled as $I_D$ (mA), indicating the drain current in milliamperes.\n\n3. **Behavior and Trends:**\n- Initially, the drain current is close to zero for $V_{GS}$ values up to approximately 0.4 volts, suggesting a threshold behavior.\n- Beyond this point, the current increases rapidly with increasing $V_{GS}$, indicating a nonlinear rise that shows the MOSFET entering the saturation region.\n\n4. **Key Characteristics and Details:**\n- The threshold voltage ($V_{th}$) is inferred to be around 0.4 volts, where the current begins to increase significantly.\n- There are no distinct peaks or valleys in the graph, as the curve shows a continuous rise after the threshold.\n\n5. **Annotations and Data Points:**\n- The graph lacks specific annotations or markers for particular data points, but the trend is clearly visible from the shape of the curve.\nimage_name:(b)\ndescription:\nThe graph labeled (b) depicts the transconductance ($g_m$) as a function of the gate-source voltage ($V_{GS}$) for a MOSFET.

Initially, for $V_{GS}$ values from 0 to approximately 0.4 V, $g_m$ remains close to zero, indicating the MOSFET is in the cutoff or subthreshold region. Beyond 0.4 V, $g_m$ starts to increase linearly, signifying the MOSFET entering the saturation region.\n\nKey Features and Technical Details:\n- **Linear Region:** The linear slope of the $g_m$ curve is indicated as \\( \\mu_n C_{ox}(W/L) = 2.7 \\text{ mA/V}^2 \\).\n- **Threshold Voltage (V_tn):** The graph is annotated with an intersection point at $V_{GS} = 0.45 V$, identified as the threshold voltage (V_tn). This is the point where the MOSFET commences significant conduction.\n\nAnnotations and Specific Data Points:\n- **Linear Slope Annotation:** A dashed line is displayed on the graph to emphasize the linear relationship, with an annotation pointing to the slope value.\n- **Intersection at V_tn:** An arrow points to the intersection at $V_{GS} = 0.45 V$, marking the threshold voltage where the curve begins to rise sharply.\n\nThis graph is valuable for estimating the threshold voltage and the transconductance parameter \\( \\mu_n C_{ox}(W/L) \\) from the MOSFET's I-V characteristics.\n```"

From this data, estimate $\\mu_{n} C_{o x}$ and $V_{t n}$.\n\n#### Solution\n\nBy taking the derivative of Fig. 1.18(a), we obtain the plot of $\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m}}=\\delta \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}} / \\delta \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{Gs}}$ in Fig. 1.18(b). Based on the square-law equation (1.74), this plot should be linear in the active region and intersect the line $g_{m}=0$ at $V_{\\text {eff }}=0$. Therefore, extrapolating the linear portion of the curve in Fig. 1.18(b) provides an intersection at $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{Gs}}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$. In this case, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}} \\cong 450 \\mathrm{mV}$. Moreover, (1.73) indicates that the slope of the $\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m}}$ versus $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{GS}}$ curve should be $\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{ox}}(\\mathrm{W} / \\mathrm{L})$ in active operation. In Fig. 1.18(b), this slope is approximately $2.7 \\mathrm{~mA} / \\mathrm{V}^{2}$, which translates to a value of $\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{ox}}=270 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} / \\mathrm{V}^{2}$. These are approximate values, particularly since (1.74) is derived without considering channel-length modulation. However, these values are very useful during design for quickly and roughly estimating the device sizes, currents, and voltages required to obtain a desired $\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m}}$.\n\nThe second voltage-controlled current-source in Fig. 1.17, shown as $\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\mathrm{v}_{\\mathrm{s}}$, models the body effect on the small-signal drain current, $i_{d}$. When the source is connected to small-signal ground, or when its voltage does not change appreciably, then this current source can be ignored. When the body effect cannot be ignored, we have\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{s}}=\\frac{\\partial \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}}{\\partial \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{SB}}}=\\frac{\\partial \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}}{\\partial \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}} \\frac{\\partial \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}}{\\partial \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{SB}}} \\tag{1.79}\n$$\n\n[^6]"

    "text": "A high-frequency model of a MOSFET in the active region is depicted in Fig. 1.21. The majority of capacitors in the small-signal model are associated with the physical transistor structure. Fig. 1.22 presents a cross-sectional view of a MOS transistor, highlighting the parasitic capacitances at their respective locations. In Fig. 1.22, the largest capacitor is $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{gs}}$. This capacitance primarily arises from the change in channel charge due to variations in $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{GS}}$.

Key components and their interactions are as follows:\n\n1. **Components and Structure:**\n- **Polysilicon Gate:** Located centrally, this acts as the control gate of the MOSFET, with arrows indicating the application of gate-source voltage \\( V_{GS} > V_{tn} \\).\n- **Source and Drain Regions:** These are marked as \\( n^+ \\) regions on either side of the gate, representing heavily doped n-type semiconductor areas.\n- **p+ Field Implant:** Positioned on the left, it controls the electric field and minimizes leakage.\n- **p- Substrate:** This forms the base layer of the transistor.\n- **Aluminum (Al) Contacts:** These are metal connections for the source and drain, facilitating electrical connectivity.\n- **SiO2 Layer:** This oxide layer separates the gate from the channel.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- **Gate-Source Capacitance \\( C_{gs} \\):** A significant parasitic capacitance between the gate and source, impacting the transistor’s switching speed.\n- **Gate-Drain Capacitance \\( C_{gd} \\):** This affects the Miller effect and switching characteristics.\n- **Source-Bulk Capacitance \\( C_{sb} \\):** Capacitance between the source and substrate.\n- **Drain-Bulk Capacitance \\( C_{db} \\):** Capacitance between the drain and substrate.\n- **Overlap Capacitance \\( L_{ov} \\):** Indicated by a dashed line, representing the overlap region contributing to parasitic capacitance.\n- **Source-Substrate Capacitance \\( C_{s-sw} \\):** Associated with the source-well junction.\n- **Drain-Substrate Capacitance \\( C_{d-sw} \\):** Associated with the drain-well junction.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- Voltage conditions such as \\( V_{SB} = 0 \\) and \\( V_{DG} > -V_{tn} \\) are noted, indicating biasing conditions for the MOSFET.\n- Directional arrows show current flow and electric field lines.\n- The effective overlap distance \\( L_{ov} \\) is marked to highlight its contribution to the overlap capacitance.\n\nFig. 1.22 A cross section of an n-channel MOS transistor showing the small-signal capacitances.\n15. Part of the overlap capacitance results from fringe electric fields, so $\\mathrm{L}_{\\mathrm{ov}}$ is usually taken larger than its actual physical overlap to more accurately represent effective overlap capacitances.\n\nThe next largest capacitor in Fig. 1.22 is $\\mathrm{C}_{\\text{sb}}$, the capacitor between the source and the substrate. This capacitor arises from the depletion capacitance of the reverse-biased source junction and includes the channel-to-bulk capacitance (assuming the transistor is on). Its size is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{s b}^{\\prime}=\\left(A_{s}+A_{c h}\\right) C_{j s} \\tag{1.92}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $A_{s}$ is the area of the source junction, $A_{c h}$ is the area of the channel (i.e., $W L$), and $C_{j s}$ is the depletion capacitance of the source junction, expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{is}}=\\frac{\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{j} 0}}{\\sqrt{1+\\frac{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{SB}}}{\\Phi_{0}}}} \\tag{1.93}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nNote that the total effective source area includes the original junction area (when no channel is present) plus the effective channel area.\n\nThe depletion capacitance of the drain is smaller because it excludes the channel area. Here, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{db}}^{\\prime}=\\mathrm{A}_{\\mathrm{d}} \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{jd}} \\tag{1.94}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{jd}}=\\frac{\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{j} 0}}{\\sqrt{1+\\frac{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DB}}}{\\Phi_{0}}}} \\tag{1.95}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand $A_{d}$ is the area of the drain junction.\nThe capacitance $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{gd}}$, often termed the Miller capacitance, is significant when there is a large voltage gain between gate and drain. It primarily results from the overlap between the gate and the drain and fringing capacitance. Its value is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{g d}=C_{o x} W L_{o v} \\tag{1.96}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nKey Point: The gate-drain capacitance $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{gd}}$, also known as the Miller capacitance, arises from the physical overlap of the gate and drain regions and fringing fields. It is particularly important when there is a large voltage gain between gate and drain, with $\\mathrm{L}_{\\mathrm{ov}}$ typically derived empirically.\nTwo other capacitors are often significant in integrated circuits: the source and drain sidewall capacitances, $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{s-sw}}$ and $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{d-sw}}$. These capacitances can be substantial due to highly doped $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$ regions under the thick field oxide, known as field implants. The primary purpose of these regions is to prevent leakage current between transistors. Because they are heavily doped and adjacent to the highly doped source and drain junctions, the sidewall capacitances can lead to significant additional capacitances that must be considered when determining $C_{s b}$ and $C_{d b}$. These sidewall capacitances are especially crucial in modern technologies as dimensions shrink. For the source, the sidewall capacitance is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{s-s w}=P_{s} C_{j-s w} \\tag{1.97}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $P_{s}$ is the perimeter length of the source junction, excluding the side adjacent to the channel, and\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{j-s w}=\\frac{C_{j-s w 0}}{\\sqrt{1+\\frac{V_{S B}}{\\Phi_{0}}}} \\tag{1.98}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIt should be noted that $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{j-sw} 0}$, the sidewall capacitance per unit length at $0-\\mathrm{V}$ bias voltage, can be quite large due to the heavy doping of the field implants.\n\nThe situation is similar for the drain sidewall capacitance, $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{d-sw}}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{d-s w}=P_{d} C_{j-s w} \\tag{1.99}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $P_{d}$ is the drain perimeter excluding the portion adjacent to the gate.\nFinally, the source-bulk capacitance, $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{sb}}$, is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{s b}=C_{s b}^{\\prime}+C_{s-\\mathrm{sw}} \\tag{1.100}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwith the drain-bulk capacitance, $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{db}}$, given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{d b}=C_{d b}^{\\prime}+C_{d-s w} \\tag{1.101}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n#### EXAMPLE 1.13\n\nAn n-channel transistor is modeled with the following capacitance parameters: $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{j}}=2.4 \\times 10^{-4} \\mathrm{pF} /(\\mu \\mathrm{m})^{2}$, $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{j-sw}}=2.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\mathrm{pF} / \\mu \\mathrm{m}$, $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{ox}}=1.9 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{pF} /(\\mu \\mathrm{m})^{2}$, $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{ov}}=2.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\mathrm{pF} / \\mu \\mathrm{m}$.
