For this comparator, what is the smallest input that can be resolved with an error rate of $10^{-12}$? Netlist: The graph in Fig. 10.1 is a probability curve, specifically a sigmoid or S-curve, depicting the likelihood of a high output logic level from a comparator as a function of varying input voltage. The horizontal axis represents the input voltage in millivolts (mV), ranging from -10 mV to +10 mV. The vertical axis represents the probability of the comparator output being high, ranging from 0 to 1. The curve starts at a low probability near 0 when the input voltage is around -10 mV. As the input voltage increases, the probability of a high output rises sharply, forming an S-shaped curve. The curve transitions from low to high probability around the 0 to 5 mV range, indicating the region where the comparator is most sensitive to input changes. At an input voltage of 3 mV, the probability of a high output is 50%, which indicates the input offset of the comparator. At an input voltage of 4.28 mV, the probability reaches 90%, suggesting a high confidence level in the output being high. The graph includes dashed lines marking the 50% probability at 3 mV and the 90% probability at 4.28 mV, which are critical points for assessing the comparator’s performance.
