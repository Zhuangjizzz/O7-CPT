From the formula for channel charge, we can calculate the amount of channel charge of Q3, Q4 (when on) to be QCH3=QCH4=-(5µm)(0.2µm)(8.5fF/µm²)((1.8V-0.9V)-0.45V)=-3.8fC. All of the dc feedback current is charge transferred through the switched capacitor C3. Thus, the charge being transferred through this capacitor must equal the charge injected by both Q3, Q4 (assuming the input is at zero volts and therefore does not contribute charge). The charge transfer into C3 is given by QC3=-C3vout. Now, we estimate that half the channel charges of Q3 and Q4 are injected to the virtual ground node by the following reasoning. When ϕ1a turns off, half the channel charge of Q4 goes into the virtual ground while half of its charge is placed at the node between Q3 and Q4. When ϕ2a goes high, the second charge escapes to ground, but when ϕ2a goes low, half of its channel charge is left between Q3 and Q4 and is passed into the virtual ground when ϕ1a goes high again. As a result, we can write the following charge equation, 1/2(QCH3+QCH4)=QC3, which can be used to find QC3, and hence the output voltage from the formula vout=3.8fC/0.4pF=9.5mV. Thus, we see that this output dc offset value is affected by the size of capacitors used (in particular, C3) as well as the switch sizes and power-supply voltage."
