    "text": "Integrating A/D converters are commonly used for achieving high-accuracy data conversion for slow-moving signals. These converters have very low offset and gain errors, and they are highly linear. Additionally, they require a minimal amount of circuitry for implementation. Integrating converters have traditionally been used in measurement instruments such as voltage or current meters.\n\nA simplified diagram of a dual-slope integrating converter is shown in Fig. 17.1. The term \"dual-slope\" refers to the converter performing its conversion in two phases, (I) and (II), as described in Fig. 17.2:\n\nPhase (I) Phase (I) consists of a fixed time interval of length $T_{1}$, determined by running the counter for $2^{\\mathrm{N}}$ clock cycles. Thus, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nT_{1}=2^{\\mathrm{N}} \\mathrm{~T}_{\\mathrm{clk}} \\tag{17.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $T_{\\text{clk}}$ is the period for one clock cycle. During this interval, switch $S_{1}$ is connected to $-V_{\\text{in}}$ such that $V_{x}$ ramps up proportional to the magnitude of $V_{\\text{in}}$. Assuming $V_{x}$ is initially equal to zero (due to a pulse on $S_{2}$), and $V_{\\text{in}}$ is constant, we have the following relationship for $V_{x}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{x}(t)=-\\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{(-V_{\\text{in}})}{R_{1} C_{1}} \\mathrm{~d} \\tau=\\frac{V_{\\text{in}}}{R_{1} C_{1}} t \\tag{17.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, at the end of phase (I), the value of $V_{x}$ is equal to $V_{\\text{in}} T_{1} / R_{1} C_{1}$.\n\nPhase (II) Phase (II) occurs for a variable amount of time, $T_{2}$, as shown in Fig. 17.2 for three different input voltages. At the beginning of this phase, the counter is reset and switch $S_{1}$ is connected to $V_{\\text{ref}}$, resulting in a constant slope for the decaying voltage at $V_{x}$. To obtain the digital output value, the counter counts until $V_{x}$ is less than zero, at which point that count value equals the digitized value of the input signal, $V_{\\text{in}}$. Thus, assuming the digital output count is normalized so that the largest count is unity, the counter output, $B_{\\text{out}}$, can be defined as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nB_{\\text{out}}=b_{1} 2^{-1}+b_{2} 2^{-2}+\\cdots+b_{N-1} 2^{-(N-1)}+b_{N} 2^{-N} \\tag{17.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nT_{2}=2^{N} B_{\\text{out}} T_{clk}=\\left(b_{1} 2^{N-1}+b_{2} 2^{N-2}+\\cdots+b_{N-1} 2+b_{N}\\right) T_{clk} \\tag{17.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nTo understand why this count gives the correct value, we find the equation for $V_{x}$ during phase (II) to be given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{x}(t) & =-\\int_{T_{1}}^{t} \\frac{V_{\\text{ref}}}{R_{1} C_{1}} d \\tau+V_{x}(T_{1}) \\\\\n& =\\frac{-V_{\\text{ref}}}{R_{1} C_{1}}(t-T_{1})+\\frac{V_{\\text{in}} T_{1}}{R_{1} C_{1}} \\tag{17.5}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSince $V_{x}$ equals zero when $t=T_{1}+T_{2}$, we can write\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n0=\\frac{-V_{\\text{ref}} T_{2}}{R_{1} C_{1}}+\\frac{V_{\\text{in}} T_{1}}{R_{1} C_{1}} \\tag{17.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand thus $T_{2}$ is related to $T_{1}$ by the following relationship:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nT_{2}=T_{1}\\left(\\frac{V_{\\text{in}}}{V_{\\text{ref}}}\\right) \\tag{17.7}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nCombining (17.7) with (17.1) and (17.4), we find\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nB_{\\text{out}}=b_{1} 2^{-1}+b_{2} 2^{-2}+\\cdots+b_{N-1} 2^{-(N-1)}+b_{N} 2^{-N}=\\frac{V_{\\text{in}}}{V_{\\text{ref}}} \\tag{17.8}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nas expected.\n\nKey Point: Dual-slope integrating conversion proceeds first by integrating the input for a fixed time period, then applying a known input to the integrator and measuring the time required for the integrator output to return to zero.\n\nFrom (17.8), we see that in a dual-slope conversion (i.e., two phases), the digital output does not depend on the time constant, $R_{1} C_{1}$. In fact, the value of this time constant need only be stable during a single conversion for proper operation. However, $R_{1}$ and $C_{1}$ should be chosen such that a reasonable large peak value of $V_{x}$ is obtained without clipping to reduce noise effects. It is also possible to perform a single-slope conversion where only one integration phase is needed, however the integration time would then be a function of the time-constant value, $R_{1} C_{1}$, and a gain error would most likely occur.\n\nAlthough a dual-slope converter does not suffer from gain error, it can have an offset error due to opamp offset and other factors. Such an offset error can be calibrated out by going to a quad-slope conversion. In a quad-slope conversion, a dual-slope conversion is performed twice: once with the input connected to ground (or other known dc quantity), and then with the input connected to the signal to be converted, $V_{\\text{in}}$. A subtraction of the two output words causes the offset error to be reduced to zero.\n\nKey Point: Dual-slope conversion does not require accuracy in defining the integration time constant. Offset errors can be calibrated by performing an additional conversion using a known dc input quantity.\n\nThe conversion speed for these types of converters is quite slow. For example, in a dual-slope converter, the worst-case conversion speed occurs when $V_{\\text{in}}$ equals $V_{\\text{ref}}$. In this case, the number of clock cycles to perform a conversion is $2^{\\mathrm{N}+1}$. Thus for a 16-bit converter with a clock frequency equal to 1 MHz, the worst-case conversion rate is around 7.6 Hz.\n\nFinally, it should be mentioned that by a careful choice for $T_{1}$, certain frequency components superimposed on the input signal can be significantly attenuated. Note that this converter effectively \"integrates and dumps\" the input signal. If we relax the assumption that $V_{\\text{in}}$ is constant in (17.2), we see that before being converted $V_{\\text{in}}$ is actually integrated over a time window $T_{1}$ in duration,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\int_{0}^{T_{1}} \\frac{V_{\\text{in}}(\\tau)}{R_{1} C_{1}} d \\tau \\tag{17.9}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhich is equivalent to convolution by a rectangular time function. Since the Fourier transform of a rectangular pulse is a \"$\\sin(x)/x$\" type response, we have an effective input filter with a transfer function,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n|H(f)|=\\left|\\frac{\\sin \\left(\\pi fT_{1}\\right)}{\\left(\\pi fT_{1}\\right)}\\right| \\tag{17.10}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nTherefore, integrating converters have a low-pass response, with nulls at all integer multiples of $f=1/T_{1}$.\n\nKey Point: Integrating converters inherently filter the input with a $\\sin(x)/x$ frequency response.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 17.1\n\nIf the input signal, $V_{\\text{in}}$, is a dc level with power line noise of 60 Hz superimposed on it, choose $T_{1}$ to filter out the power line noise.\n\n#### Solution\n\nWrite $V_{\\text{in}}$ as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text{in}}=V_{\\text{in(ideal)}}+V_{\\text{in(60 Hz)}} \\tag{17.11}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $V_{\\text{in(ideal)}}$ is the desired dc signal level and $V_{\\text{in(60 Hz)}}$ is the interfering 60 Hz noise; or mathematically,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text{in(60 Hz)}}=A \\sin (120 \\pi t+\\phi) \\tag{17.12}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere A and $\\phi$ are arbitrary magnitude and phase values. Now substituting this relationship for $V_{\\text{in}}$ into (17.2), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{x}(T_{1})=-\\int_{0}^{T_{1}} \\frac{(-V_{\\text{in}})}{R_{1} C_{1}} d \\tau=-\\int_{0}^{T_{1}} \\frac{(-V_{\\text{in(ideal)}})}{R_{1} C_{1}} d \\tau-\\int_{0}^{T_{1}} \\frac{(-V_{\\text{in(60 Hz)}})}{R_{1} C_{1}} d \\tau \\tag{17.13}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHowever, the last term in (17.13) can be shown to equal zero when $T_{1}$ is an integer multiple of $1/(60 \\text{ Hz})$ (i.e., 16.67 ms). In this way, the peak value, $V_{x}(T_{1})$, remains correct so that the conversion is performed without error. Note that for this same value of $T_{1}$, the harmonics of 60 Hz are also suppressed (i.e., 120 Hz, 180 Hz, 240 Hz, etc.). The converter's frequency response is shown in Fig. 17.3 with $T_{1}=1/(60 \\text{ Hz})$. Note that full suppression is achieved at harmonics of 60 Hz, as expected.\n\nIn fact, other frequencies are also attenuated but not fully suppressed as are the harmonics of $1/T_{1}$. Note the $-20 \\text{ dB/decade}$ slope in Fig. 17.3, so that higher frequencies are attenuated more.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 17.2\n\nIt is desired to build a 16-bit two-slope integrating A/D such that a maximum input signal of $V_{\\text{in}}=3 \\text{ V}$ results in the peak voltage of $V_{x}$ being 4 V. In addition, input noise signals at 50 Hz and harmonics should be significantly attenuated. Find the required RC time constant and clock rate. Also, find the attenuation of a noise signal around 1 kHz superimposed on the input signal.\n\n#### Solution\n\nSince 50 Hz and harmonics are to be rejected, we choose\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nT_{1}=\\frac{1}{50}=20 \\text{ ms} \\tag{17.14}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, for a 16-bit converter, we require a clock frequency of\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nf_{\\text{clk}}=\\frac{1}{T_{\\text{clk}}}=\\frac{2^{16}}{T_{1}}=3.28 \\text{ MHz} \\tag{17.15}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nTo find the RC time constant needed, we note that at the end of phase (I), $V_{x}$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{x}=\\frac{V_{\\text{in}} T_{1}}{R_{1} C_{1}} \\tag{17.16}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand using the values of $V_{x}=4 \\text{ V}$, $V_{\\text{in}}=3 \\text{ V}$, and $T_{1}=20 \\text{ ms}$ results in\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{1} C_{1}=15 \\text{ ms} \\tag{17.17}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFinally, the attenuation of a 1 kHz signal is infinite since it is a harmonic of 50 kHz. However, as seen in (17.10), attenuation is reduced halfway between harmonics, so we find the gain for an input signal at 975 Hz to be\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n|H(f)|=\\left|\\frac{\\sin (\\pi \\times 975 \\text{ Hz} \\times 20 \\text{ ms})}{\\pi \\times 975 \\text{ Hz} \\times 20 \\text{ ms}}\\right|=16.3 \\times 10^{-3} \\tag{17.18}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhich implies the attenuation is 36 dB."

It employs a dual-slope integration technique to convert an analog input voltage (\\( -V_{in} \\)) into a digital output (\\( B_{out} \\)). The integration period is controlled by switches \\( S_1 \\) and \\( S_2 \\), and the output is determined by a counter that measures the time for the integrated voltage to reach zero.\n\nFigure 17.2 illustrates the operation of an integrating (dual slope) A/D converter for three different input voltages (\\( -V_{in1}, -V_{in2}, -V_{in3} \\)). It is a time-domain waveform graph with time on the x-axis and \\( V_x \\) on the y-axis. The graph is divided into two phases: Phase (I) and Phase (II).\n\n1. **Phase (I):** During this phase, \\( V_x \\) increases linearly from zero to a peak value. The slope is determined by the input voltage (\\( -V_{in} \\)). Three different slopes are shown, corresponding to the three input voltages, with \\( -V_{in3} \\) having the steepest slope and \\( -V_{in1} \\) the shallowest. The duration of this phase is marked as \\( T_1 \\).\n\n2. **Phase (II):** This phase starts at the peak of each line from Phase (I) and shows a constant negative slope, indicating a linear decrease in \\( V_x \\) back to zero. The slopes in this phase are constant and identical for all three input voltages, representing the discharge phase of the integration process. The time taken for \\( V_x \\) to return to zero is marked as \\( T_2 \\), which varies for each input voltage.\n\n3. **Key Features:**\n   - The graph demonstrates how different input voltages affect the time for the integrated voltage to reach zero during Phase (II).\n   - The peak values during Phase (I) correspond to the magnitude of the input voltages.\n   - \\( T_1 \\) is constant across all scenarios, while \\( T_2 \\) varies, showcasing the dual-slope method's dependence on the input voltage.\n\n4. **Annotations:**\n   - The graph is annotated with labels for each phase and the input voltages.\n   - The transition between phases is marked with a vertical dashed line, indicating the switch from charging to discharging in the integration process.\n\nThis graph effectively illustrates the dual-slope integration process by depicting the relationship between input voltage and the integration time required to return to zero, a crucial aspect of the A/D conversion method used in this circuit.\n\nFigure 17.2 depicts the operation of the integrating converter for three different input voltages.\n\nCombining equations (17.7), (17.1), and (17.4), we find:\n\n\\[ B_{out} = b_1 2^{-1} + b_2 2^{-2} + \\cdots + b_{N-1} 2^{-(N-1)} + b_N 2^{-N} = \\frac{V_{in}}{V_{ref}} \\tag{17.8} \\]\n\nas expected.\n\nKey Point: Dual-slope integrating conversion involves integrating the input for a fixed time period, then applying a known input to measure the time required for the integrator output to return to zero.\n\nFrom (17.8), we observe that in a dual-slope conversion, the digital output is independent of the time constant, \\( R_1 C_1 \\). The value of this time constant only needs to be stable during a single conversion for proper operation. However, \\( R_1 \\) and \\( C_1 \\) should be chosen to achieve a reasonable peak \\( V_x \\) without clipping to minimize noise effects. A single-slope conversion is also possible, requiring only one integration phase, but the integration time would then depend on the time-constant value, \\( R_1 C_1 \\), likely introducing gain error.\n\nAlthough a dual-slope converter is free from gain error, it can suffer from offset error due to op-amp offset and other factors. Such offset error can be calibrated out by using a quad-slope conversion. In a quad-slope conversion, a dual-slope conversion is performed twice: once with the input grounded (or connected to another known dc quantity), and then with the input connected to the signal to be converted, \\( V_{in} \\). Subtracting the two output words reduces the offset error to zero.\n\nKey Point: Dual-slope conversion does not require precise definition of the integration time constant. Offset errors can be calibrated by performing an additional conversion using a known dc input quantity.\n\nThe conversion speed of these converters is quite slow. For instance, in a dual-slope converter, the worst-case conversion speed occurs when \\( V_{in} \\) equals \\( V_{ref} \\). In this case, the number of clock cycles needed for a conversion is \\( 2^{N+1} \\). Thus, for a 16-bit converter with a 1 MHz clock frequency, the worst-case conversion rate is about 7.6 Hz.\n\nAdditionally, by carefully selecting \\( T_1 \\), certain frequency components superimposed on the input signal can be significantly attenuated. The converter effectively \"integrates and dumps\" the input signal. If we relax the assumption that \\( V_{in} \\) is constant in (17.2), we see that before conversion, \\( V_{in} \\) is actually integrated over a time window of \\( T_1 \\) duration:\n\n\\[ \\int_{0}^{T_1} \\frac{V_{in}(\\tau)}{R_1 C_1} d\\tau \\tag{17.9} \\]\n\nwhich is equivalent to convolution with a rectangular time function. Since the Fourier transform of a rectangular pulse is a \" \\( \\sin(x) / x \\)\" type response, we have an effective input filter with a transfer function:\n\n\\[ |H(f)| = \\left|\\frac{\\sin(\\pi f T_1)}{(\\pi f T_1)}\\right| \\tag{17.10} \\]\n\nTherefore, integrating converters have a low-pass response, with nulls at all integer multiples of \\( f = 1 / T_1 \\).\n\nKey Point: Integrating converters inherently filter the input with a \\( \\sin(x) / x \\) frequency response.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 17.1\n\nIf the input signal, \\( V_{in} \\), is a dc level with power line noise of 60 Hz superimposed on it, choose \\( T_1 \\) to filter out the power line noise.\n\n#### Solution\n\nExpress \\( V_{in} \\) as:\n\n\\[ V_{in} = V_{in(ideal)} + V_{in(60 Hz)} \\tag{17.11} \\]\n\nwhere \\( V_{in(ideal)} \\) is the desired dc signal level and \\( V_{in(60 Hz)} \\) is the interfering 60 Hz noise; or mathematically:\n\n\\[ V_{in(60 Hz)} = A \\sin(120\\pi t + \\phi) \\tag{17.12} \\]\n\nwhere A and \\( \\phi \\) are arbitrary magnitude and phase values. Now substitute this relationship for \\( V_{in} \\) into (17.2):\n\n\\[ V_x(T_1) = -\\int_{0}^{T_1} \\frac{(-V_{in})}{R_1 C_1} d\\tau = -\\int_{0}^{T_1} \\frac{(-V_{in(ideal)})}{R_1 C_1} d\\tau - \\int_{0}^{T_1} \\frac{(-V_{in(60 Hz)})}{R_1 C_1} d\\tau \\tag{17.13} \\]\n\nThe last term in (17.13) equals zero when \\( T_1 \\) is an integer multiple of \\( 1 / (60 Hz) \\) (i.e., 16.67 ms). In this way, the peak value, \\( V_x(T_1) \\), remains correct so that the conversion is error-free. Note that for this same \\( T_1 \\), the harmonics of 60 Hz are also suppressed (i.e., 120 Hz, 180 Hz, 240 Hz, etc.). The converter's frequency response is shown in Figure 17.3 with \\( T_1 = 1 / (60 Hz) \\). Full suppression is achieved at harmonics of 60 Hz, as expected.\n\nOther frequencies are also attenuated but not fully suppressed as are the harmonics of \\( 1 / T_1 \\). Note the \\( -20 dB/ \\) decade slope in Figure 17.3, indicating that higher frequencies are more attenuated.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 17.2\n\nYou aim to build a 16-bit two-slope integrating A/D such that a maximum input signal of \\( V_{in} = 3 V \\) results in a peak \\( V_x \\) of 4 V. Additionally, input noise signals at 50 Hz and harmonics should be significantly attenuated. Find the required RC time constant and clock rate. Also, find the attenuation of a noise signal around 1 kHz superimposed on the input signal.\n\n#### Solution\n\nTo reject 50 Hz and its harmonics, choose:\n\n\\[ T_1 = \\frac{1}{50} = 20 ms \\tag{17.14} \\]\n\nThus, for a 16-bit converter, a clock frequency of:\n\n\\[ f_{clk} = \\frac{1}{T_{clk}} = \\frac{2^{16}}{T_1} = 3.28 MHz \\tag{17.15} \\]\n\nis required. To find the RC time constant needed, note that at the end of phase (I), \\( V_x \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ V_x = \\frac{V_{in} T_1}{R_1 C_1} \\tag{17.16} \\]\n\nUsing \\( V_x = 4 V \\), \\( V_{in} = 3 V \\), and \\( T_1 = 20 ms \\) results in:\n\n\\[ R_1 C_1 = 15 ms \\tag{17.17} \\]\n\nFinally, the attenuation of a 1 kHz signal is infinite since it is a harmonic of 50 kHz. However, as seen in (17.10), attenuation is reduced halfway between harmonics, so the gain for an input signal at 975 Hz is:\n\n\\[ |H(f)| = \\left|\\frac{\\sin(\\pi \\times 975 Hz \\times 20 ms)}{\\pi \\times 975 Hz \\times 20 ms}\\right| = 16.3 \\times 10^{-3} \\tag{17.18} \\]\n\nimplying an attenuation of 36 dB."

The time taken for Vx to return to zero is marked as T2, which varies for each input voltage.\n\n3. **Key Features:**\n- The graph demonstrates how different input voltages affect the time it takes for the integrated voltage to reach zero during Phase (II).\n- The peak values during Phase (I) correspond to the magnitude of the input voltages.\n- T1 is constant across all three scenarios, while T2 varies, demonstrating the dual-slope method's dependence on the input voltage.\n\n4. **Annotations:**\n- The graph is annotated with labels for each phase and the input voltages.\n- The transition between phases is marked with a vertical dashed line, indicating the point where the integration switches from charging to discharging.\n\nThis graph effectively illustrates the dual-slope integration process by showing the relationship between input voltage and the integration time required to return to zero, a crucial aspect of the A/D conversion method used in this circuit.\n\nFig. 17.2 Operation of the integrating converter for three different input voltages.\n\n$$\nT_2 = 2^N B_{out} T_{clk} = (b_1 2^{N-1} + b_2 2^{N-2} + \\cdots + b_{N-1} 2 + b_N) T_{clk}\n$$\n\nTo understand why this count provides the correct value, the equation for \\( V_x \\) during phase (II) is derived as:\n\n$$\nV_x(t) = \\frac{-V_{ref}}{R_1 C_1} (t - T_1) + \\frac{V_{in} T_1}{R_1 C_1}\n$$\n\nSince \\( V_x \\) equals zero when \\( t = T_1 + T_2 \\), the relationship between \\( T_2 \\) and \\( T_1 \\) is:\n\n$$\nT_2 = T_1 \\left(\\frac{V_{in}}{V_{ref}}\\right)\n$$\n\nCombining this with the previous equations, the digital output is found to be:\n\n$$\nB_{out} = b_1 2^{-1} + b_2 2^{-2} + \\cdots + b_{N-1} 2^{-(N-1)} + b_N 2^{-N} = \\frac{V_{in}}{V_{ref}}\n$$\n\nA key point of dual-slope integrating conversion is that it first integrates the input for a fixed time period and then applies a known input to measure the time needed for the integrator output to return to zero.\n\nThe digital output of a dual-slope conversion does not depend on the time constant \\( R_1 C_1 \\). The value of this time constant only needs to be stable during a single conversion. However, \\( R_1 \\) and \\( C_1 \\) should be chosen to achieve a sufficiently large peak \\( V_x \\) without clipping to minimize noise effects. A single-slope conversion is also possible but would make the integration time dependent on \\( R_1 C_1 \\), likely introducing gain errors.\n\nAlthough a dual-slope converter avoids gain errors, offset errors can occur due to op-amp offset and other factors. These can be calibrated out using a quad-slope conversion, which performs a dual-slope conversion twice: once with the input grounded and once with the signal to be converted. Subtracting the two output words reduces offset errors.\n\nAnother key point is that dual-slope conversion does not demand precision in defining the integration time constant, and offset errors can be calibrated by performing an additional conversion with a known dc input.\n\nThe conversion speed of these converters is relatively slow. For instance, in a dual-slope converter, the slowest conversion speed occurs when \\( V_{in} \\) equals \\( V_{ref} \\). In this case, the number of clock cycles for a conversion is \\( 2^{N+1} \\). Thus, for a 16-bit converter with a 1 MHz clock frequency, the slowest conversion rate is about 7.6 Hz.\n\nCareful selection of \\( T_1 \\) can significantly attenuate certain frequency components superimposed on the input signal. The converter effectively \"integrates and dumps\" the input signal. If \\( V_{in} \\) is not constant, it is integrated over a time window \\( T_1 \\):\n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T_1} \\frac{V_{in}(\\tau)}{R_1 C_1} d\\tau\n$$\n\nThis is equivalent to convolution by a rectangular time function. Since the Fourier transform of a rectangular pulse is a \"sinc\" function, the converter acts as an input filter with a transfer function:\n\n$$\n|H(f)| = \\left|\\frac{\\sin(\\pi f T_1)}{\\pi f T_1}\\right|\n$$\n\nIntegrating converters have a low-pass response, with notches at all integer multiples of \\( f = 1/T_1 \\).\n\n#### EXAMPLE 17.1\n\nIf the input signal \\( V_{in} \\) includes power line noise of 60 Hz, \\( T_1 \\) should be chosen to filter out this noise.\n\n#### Solution\n\nExpress \\( V_{in} \\) as:\n\n$$\nV_{in} = V_{in(ideal)} + V_{in(60 Hz)}\n$$\n\nwhere \\( V_{in(ideal)} \\) is the desired dc signal level and \\( V_{in(60 Hz)} \\) is the 60 Hz noise. Mathematically:\n\n$$\nV_{in(60 Hz)} = A \\sin(120\\pi t + \\phi)\n$$\n\nwhere A and \\( \\phi \\) are arbitrary magnitude and phase values. Substituting this into the equation for \\( V_x \\), the term for \\( V_{in(60 Hz)} \\) integrates to zero when \\( T_1 \\) is an integer multiple of \\( 1/(60 Hz) \\) (i.e., 16.67 ms). This ensures the conversion is error-free and suppresses harmonics of 60 Hz.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 17.2\n\nTo build a 16-bit two-slope integrating A/D converter that filters out 50 Hz noise and harmonics, find the required RC time constant and clock rate. Also, calculate the attenuation of a noise signal around 1 kHz.\n\n#### Solution\n\nChoose \\( T_1 \\) as:\n\n$$\nT_1 = \\frac{1}{50} = 20 \\text{ ms}\n$$\n\nFor a 16-bit converter, the clock frequency is:\n\n$$\nf_{clk} = \\frac{2^{16}}{T_1} = 3.28 \\text{ MHz}\n$$\n\nTo find the RC time constant, use:\n\n$$\nV_x = \\frac{V_{in} T_1}{R_1 C_1}\n$$\n\nWith \\( V_x = 4 \\text{ V} \\), \\( V_{in} = 3 \\text{ V} \\), and \\( T_1 = 20 \\text{ ms} \\), the RC time constant is:\n\n$$\nR_1 C_1 = 15 \\text{ ms}\n$$\n\nThe attenuation of a 1 kHz signal is significant since it is a harmonic of 50 kHz. However, attenuation is reduced halfway between harmonics. For an input signal at 975 Hz, the gain is:\n\n$$\n|H(f)| = \\left|\\frac{\\sin(\\pi \\times 975 \\text{ Hz} \\times 20 \\text{ ms})}{\\pi \\times 975 \\text{ Hz} \\times 20 \\text{ ms}}\\right| = 16.3 \\times 10^{-3}\n$$\n\nThis implies an attenuation of 36 dB."

These converters exhibit minimal offset and gain errors, and are highly linear. Additionally, the incorporation of these converters requires a minimal amount of circuitry. Historically, integrating converters have been utilized in various applications, including measurement instruments like voltmeters and ammeters.\n\nAn illustrative diagram of a dual-slope integrating converter can be found in Figure 17.1. The term \"dual-slope\" denotes the conversion process being split into two phases, identified as (I) and (II), as depicted in Figure 17.2. During Phase (I), the counter operates for a fixed time interval $\\mathrm{T}_{1}$, corresponding to $2^{\\mathrm{N}}$ clock cycles. Therefore, the interval is given by:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{T}_{1}=2^{\\mathrm{N}} \\mathrm{~T}_{\\mathrm{clk}} \\tag{17.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHere, $T_{\\text {clk }}$ signifies the duration of a single clock cycle. During this time frame, switch $S_{1}$ is connected to $-V_{\\text {in }}$, causing $V_{x}$ to ramp up in proportion to the amplitude of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}}$. Assuming $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {in }}$ remains constant and $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {x}}$ starts at zero, the relationship for $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ is as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}(\\mathrm{t})=-\\int_{0}^{\\mathrm{t}} \\frac{\\left(-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}}\\right)}{\\mathrm{R}_{1} \\mathrm{C}_{1}} \\mathrm{~d} \\tau=\\frac{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}}}{\\mathrm{R}_{1} \\mathrm{C}_{1}} t \\tag{17.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nConsequently, at the conclusion of Phase (I), the value of $V_{x}$ equals $V_{i n} T_{1} / R_{1} C_{1}$.\n\nPhase (II) During Phase (II), which spans a variable duration $\\mathrm{T}_{2}$ as depicted in Figure 17.2, the counter resets, and switch $S_{1}$ is connected to $V_{\\text {ref }}$, leading to a constant slope for the decreasing voltage at $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$. The digital output value is derived by counting until $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ falls below zero, which corresponds to the digitized version of the input signal, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}}$.

The integration period is regulated by switches S1 and S2, and the output is ascertained by a counter that measures the time it takes for the integrated voltage to reach zero.\n\nFig. 17.1 Integrating (dual slope) A/D converter.\nimage_name:Fig. 17.2\ndescription:Figure 17.2 displays the operational characteristics of an integrating (dual slope) A/D converter across three distinct input voltages (-Vin1, -Vin2, -Vin3). Representing a time-domain waveform with the x-axis labeled 'Time' and the y-axis labeled 'Vx', the graph is split into two phases: Phase (I) and Phase (II).\n\n1. **Phase (I):** In Phase (I), the voltage Vx increases linearly from zero to a peak value. The slope of the line is governed by the input voltage (-Vin). The graph presents three distinct slopes, corresponding to three different input voltages (-Vin1, -Vin2, -Vin3), with -Vin3 exhibiting the steepest slope and -Vin1 the least. This phase is labeled T1.\n\n2. **Phase (II):** Phase (II) initiates at the peak of each line from Phase (I) and illustrates a consistent negative slope, indicating the linear decrease in Vx to zero. The slopes in this phase are constant and identical for all three input voltages, reflecting the discharge phase of the integration process. The time taken for Vx to return to zero is designated as T2, which varies depending on the input voltage.\n\n3. **Key Features:**\n- The graph depicts how different input voltages impact the time it takes for the integrated voltage to reach zero during Phase (II).\n- The peak values during Phase (I) correspond to the magnitude of the input voltages.\n- T1 is constant across all three scenarios, whereas T2 varies, illustrating the dual-slope method's dependence on the input voltage.\n\n4. **Annotations:**\n- The graph is annotated with labels for each phase and the input voltages.\n- The transition between phases is indicated by a vertical dashed line, showing the point where the integration switches from charging to discharging.\n\nThis graph vividly illustrates the dual-slope integration process by illustrating the relationship between input voltage and the integration time necessary to return to zero, a pivotal aspect of the A/D conversion method implemented in this circuit.\n\nFig. 17.2 Operation of the integrating converter for three different input voltages.\nand we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nT_{2}=2^{N} B_{\\text {out }} T_{c l k}=\\left(b_{1} 2^{N-1}+b_{2} 2^{N-2}+\\cdots+b_{N-1} 2+b_{N}\\right) T_{c l k} \\tag{17.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nTo understand why this count yields the correct value, we derive the equation for $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ during phase (II), which is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{x}(t) & =-\\int_{T_{1}}^{t} \\frac{V_{\\text {ref }}}{R_{1} C_{1}} d \\tau+V_{x}\\left(T_{1}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\frac{-V_{\\text {ref }}}{R_{1} C_{1}}\\left(t-T_{1}\\right)+\\frac{V_{\\text {in }} T_{1}}{R_{1} C_{1}} \\tag{17.5}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSince $V_{x}$ is zero when $t=T_{1}+T_{2}$, we can write\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n0=\\frac{-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\mathrm{~T}_{2}}{\\mathrm{R}_{1} \\mathrm{C}_{1}}+\\frac{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}} \\mathrm{~T}_{1}}{\\mathrm{R}_{1} \\mathrm{C}_{1}} \\tag{17.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand thus $T_{2}$ is related to $T_{1}$ through the following relationship:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{T}_{2}=\\mathrm{T}_{1}\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{in}}}{\\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{ret}}}\\right) \\tag{17.7}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nBy combining (17.7) with (17.1) and (17.4), we find\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nB_{\\text {out }}=b_{1} 2^{-1}+b_{2} 2^{-2}+\\cdots+b_{N-1} 2^{-(N-1)}+b_{N} 2^{-N}=\\frac{V_{\\text {in }}}{V_{\\text {ref }}} \\tag{17.8}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nas anticipated.\n\nKey Point: Dual-slope integrating conversion initially integrates the input over a fixed time period, followed by applying a known input and measuring the time for the integrator output to return to zero.\n\nFrom (17.8), it is evident that in dual-slope conversion (with two phases), the digital output is independent of the time constant, $\\mathrm{R}_{1} \\mathrm{C}_{1}$. Indeed, the only requirement for this time constant is stability during a single conversion for accurate operation. Nevertheless, $\\mathrm{R}_{1}$ and $\\mathrm{C}_{1}$ should be selected to achieve a reasonable large peak value of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ without clipping to minimize noise effects. It is also feasible to execute a single-slope conversion with only one integration phase, but the integration time would then depend on the time-constant value, $\\mathrm{R}_{1} \\mathrm{C}_{1}$, and a gain error may arise.\n\nDespite not being subject to gain error, a dual-slope converter can exhibit an offset error due to opamp offset and other factors. This offset error can be corrected by performing a quad-slope conversion. In a quad-slope conversion, a dual-slope conversion is conducted twice: once with the input connected to ground (or another known DC quantity), and then with the input connected to the signal to be converted, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}}$. Subtracting the two output words will nullify the offset error.\n\nKey Point: Dual-slope conversion does not necessitate precise definition of the integration time constant. Offset errors can be calibrated by an extra conversion using a known DC input quantity.\n\nThe conversion speed for these converters is rather slow. For instance, in a dual-slope converter, the maximum conversion speed is when $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {in }}$ is equal to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {ref }}$. In this scenario, the number of clock cycles required for a conversion is $2^{\\mathrm{N}+1}$. Thus, for a 16-bit converter with a clock frequency of 1 MHz, the maximum conversion rate is approximately 7.6 Hz.\n\nIn summary, by carefully selecting $T_{1}$, specific frequency components present in the input signal can be significantly reduced. It is worth noting that this converter essentially integrates and discards the input signal. If we relax the assumption that $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {in }}$ is constant in (17.2), we see that $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {in }}$ is actually integrated over a time window $T_{1}$ before conversion,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\int_{0}^{T_{1}} \\frac{V_{\\text {in }}(\\tau)}{R_{1} C_{1}} d \\tau \\tag{17.9}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhich is akin to convolution by a rectangular time function. As the Fourier transform of a rectangular pulse yields a \" $\\sin (\\mathrm{x}) / x$ \" type response, we obtain an effective input filter with a transfer function,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n|H(f)|=\\left|\\frac{\\sin \\left(\\pi \\mathrm{fT}_{1}\\right)}{\\left(\\pi \\mathrm{fT} \\mathrm{~T}_{1}\\right)}\\right| \\tag{17.10}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nConsequently, integrating converters exhibit a low-pass response with nulls at all integer multiples of $f=1 / T_{1}$.\n\nKey Point: Integrating converters inherently filter the input with a $\\sin x / x$ frequency response.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 17.1\n\nIf the input signal, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}}$, contains power line noise of 60 Hz superimposed on a DC level, choose $\\mathrm{T}_{1}$ to filter out the power line noise.\n\n#### Solution\n\nExpress $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {in }}$ as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {in }}=V_{\\text {in(ideal) }}+V_{\\text {in(60 Hz) }} \\tag{17.11}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {in(ideal) }}$ denotes the intended DC signal level and $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}(60 \\mathrm{~Hz})}$ represents the 60 Hz noise interference. Alternatively, mathematically:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{i n(60 H z)}=A \\sin (120 \\pi t+\\phi) \\tag{17.12}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere A and $\\phi$ denote arbitrary magnitude and phase values. Now, substitute this relationship for $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {in }}$ into (17.2), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{x}\\left(T_{1}\\right)=-\\int_{0}^{T_{1}} \\frac{\\left(-V_{\\text {in }}\\right)}{R_{1} C_{1}} d \\tau=-\\int_{0}^{T_{1}} \\frac{\\left(-V_{\\text {in (ideal })}\\right)}{R_{1} C_{1}} d \\tau-\\int_{0}^{T_{1}} \\frac{\\left(-V_{\\text {in }(60 H z)}\\right)}{R_{1} C_{1}} d \\tau \\tag{17.13}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHowever, the last term in (17.13) can be shown to be zero when $T_{1}$ is an integer multiple of $1 /(60 \\mathrm{~Hz})$ (i.e., 16.67 ms). In this manner, the peak value, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}\\left(\\mathrm{T}_{1}\\right)$, remains accurate, ensuring error-free conversion. Notably, for this same value of $\\mathrm{T}_{1}$, the harmonics of 60 Hz are also suppressed (i.e., $120 \\mathrm{~Hz}, 180 \\mathrm{~Hz}, 240$ Hz , etc.). The converter's frequency response is shown in Figure 17.3 with $T_{1}=1 /(60 \\mathrm{~Hz})$. Note that full suppression is achieved at harmonics of 60 Hz , as expected.\n\nIn reality, other frequencies are also attenuated but not fully suppressed as are the harmonics of $1 / T_{1}$. Notice the $-20 \\mathrm{~dB} /$ decade slope in Figure 17.3, which implies higher frequencies are attenuated more.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 17.2\n\nThe aim is to construct a 16-bit two-slope integrating $A / D$ converter such that a maximum input signal of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {in }}=3 \\mathrm{~V}$ leads to the peak voltage $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ being 4 V. Additionally, input noise signals at 50 Hz and harmonics should be significantly reduced. Determine the required RC time constant and clock rate. Also, calculate the attenuation of a noise signal at around 1 kHz, which is superimposed on the input signal.\n\n#### Solution\n\nSince 50 Hz and harmonics are to be rejected, we choose\nimage_name:Fig. 17.3 Magnitude response of the effective input filter\ndescription:This figure illustrates a Bode plot of the magnitude response of an effective input filter for an integrating-type converter.

The y-axis represents the magnitude |H(f)| in decibels (dB), from 0 dB to -40 dB.\n\nThe plot depicts a series of attenuations and peaks. The magnitude response starts at 0 dB at low frequencies and decreases, following a general slope of -20 dB per decade, as indicated by the dashed line. This slope represents the general trend of attenuation as frequency increases.\n\nNotable features include:\n- A marked dip in magnitude at 60 Hz, indicating significant attenuation.\n- Subsequent peaks and valleys occur at harmonic frequencies, specifically at 120 Hz, 180 Hz, 240 Hz, and 300 Hz, with the magnitude of these peaks decreasing progressively.\n\nThis pattern indicates that the filter effectively attenuates signals at 50 Hz and its harmonics, while allowing some periodic increase in response at higher harmonics, though at reduced levels.

The term \"dual-slope\" refers to the converter's two-phase conversion process, (I) and (II), as illustrated in Fig. 17.2:\n\nPhase (I) This phase is a fixed time interval of length $T_1$, determined by running the counter for $2^N$ clock cycles. Thus, we have\n\n$$\nT_1 = 2^N T_{clk} \\tag{17.1}\n$$\n\nwhere $T_{clk}$ is the period for one clock cycle. During this interval, switch $S_1$ is connected to $-V_{in}$, causing $V_x$ to ramp up proportional to the magnitude of $V_{in}$. Assuming $V_x$ is initially zero (due to a pulse on $S_2$), and $V_{in}$ is constant, we have the following relationship for $V_x$:\n\n$$\nV_x(t) = -\\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{(-V_{in})}{R_1 C_1} d\\tau = \\frac{V_{in}}{R_1 C_1} t \\tag{17.2}\n$$\n\nThus, at the end of phase (I), the value of $V_x$ is equal to $V_{in} T_1 / R_1 C_1$.\n\nPhase (II) This phase occurs for a variable amount of time, $T_2$, as shown in Fig. 17.2 for three different input voltages. At the beginning of this phase, the counter is reset and switch $S_1$ is connected to $V_{ref}$, resulting in a constant slope for the decaying voltage at $V_x$. To obtain the digital output value, the counter counts until $V_x$ is less than zero, at which point that count value equals the digitized value of the input signal, $V_{in}$. Thus, assuming the digital output count is normalized so that the largest count is unity, the counter output, $B_{out}$, can be defined as\n\n$$\nB_{out} = b_1 2^{-1} + b_2 2^{-2} + \\cdots + b_{N-1} 2^{-(N-1)} + b_N 2^{-N} \\tag{17.3}\n$$\n\nand we have\n\n$$\nT_2 = 2^N B_{out} T_{clk} = (b_1 2^{N-1} + b_2 2^{N-2} + \\cdots + b_{N-1} 2 + b_N) T_{clk} \\tag{17.4}\n$$\n\nTo see why this count gives the correct value, we find the equation for $V_x$ during phase (II) to be given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_x(t) & = -\\int_{T_1}^{t} \\frac{V_{ref}}{R_1 C_1} d\\tau + V_x(T_1) \\\\\n& = \\frac{-V_{ref}}{R_1 C_1}(t - T_1) + \\frac{V_{in} T_1}{R_1 C_1} \\tag{17.5}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSince $V_x$ equals zero when $t = T_1 + T_2$, we can write\n\n$$\n0 = \\frac{-V_{ref} T_2}{R_1 C_1} + \\frac{V_{in} T_1}{R_1 C_1} \\tag{17.6}\n$$\n\nand thus $T_2$ is related to $T_1$ by the following relationship:\n\n$$\nT_2 = T_1\\left(\\frac{V_{in}}{V_{ref}}\\right) \\tag{17.7}\n$$\n\nCombining (17.7) with (17.1) and (17.4), we find\n\n$$\nB_{out} = b_1 2^{-1} + b_2 2^{-2} + \\cdots + b_{N-1} 2^{-(N-1)} + b_N 2^{-N} = \\frac{V_{in}}{V_{ref}} \\tag{17.8}\n$$\n\nas expected.\n\nKey Point: Dual-slope integrating conversion proceeds first by integrating the input for a fixed time period, then applying a known input to the integrator and measuring the time required for the integrator output to return to zero.\n\nFrom (17.8), we see that in a dual-slope conversion (i.e., two phases), the digital output does not depend on the time constant, $R_1 C_1$. In fact, the value of this time constant need only be stable during a single conversion for proper operation. However, $R_1$ and $C_1$ should be chosen such that a reasonable large peak value of $V_x$ is obtained without clipping to reduce noise effects. It is also possible to perform a single-slope conversion where only one integration phase is needed, however the integration time would then be a function of the time-constant value, $R_1 C_1$, and a gain error would most likely occur.\n\nAlthough a dual-slope converter does not suffer from gain error, it can have an offset error due to opamp offset and other factors. Such an offset error can be calibrated out by going to a quad-slope conversion. In a quad-slope conversion, a dual-slope conversion is performed twice: once with the input connected to ground (or other known dc quantity), and then with the input connected to the signal to be converted, $V_{in}$. A subtraction of the two output words causes the offset error to be reduced to zero.\n\nKey Point: Dual-slope conversion does not require accuracy in defining the integration time constant. Offset errors can be calibrated by performing an additional conversion using a known dc input quantity.\n\nThe conversion speed for these types of converters is quite slow. For example, in a dual-slope converter, the worst-case conversion speed occurs when $V_{in}$ equals $V_{ref}$. In this case, the number of clock cycles to perform a conversion is $2^{N+1}$. Thus for a 16-bit converter with a clock frequency equal to 1 MHz, the worst-case conversion rate is around 7.6 Hz.\n\nFinally, it should be mentioned that by a careful choice for $T_1$, certain frequency components superimposed on the input signal can be significantly attenuated. Note that this converter effectively \"integrates and dumps\" the input signal. If we relax the assumption that $V_{in}$ is constant in (17.2), we see that before being converted $V_{in}$ is actually integrated over a time window $T_1$ in duration,\n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T_1} \\frac{V_{in}(\\tau)}{R_1 C_1} d\\tau \\tag{17.9}\n$$\n\nwhich is equivalent to convolution by a rectangular time function. Since the Fourier transform of a rectangular pulse is a \" $\\sin(x) / x$ \" type response, we have an effective input filter with a transfer function,\n\n$$\n|H(f)| = \\left|\\frac{\\sin(\\pi fT_1)}{(\\pi fT_1)}\\right| \\tag{17.10}\n$$\n\nTherefore, integrating converters have a low-pass response, with nulls at all integer multiples of $f = 1 / T_1$.\n\nKey Point: Integrating converters inherently filter the input with a $\\sin x / x$ frequency response.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 17.1\n\nIf the input signal, $V_{in}$, is a dc level with power line noise of 60 Hz superimposed on it, choose $T_1$ to filter out the power line noise.\n\n#### Solution\n\nWrite $V_{in}$ as\n\n$$\nV_{in} = V_{in(ideal)} + V_{in(60 Hz)} \\tag{17.11}\n$$\n\nwhere $V_{in(ideal)}$ is the desired dc signal level and $V_{in(60 Hz)}$ is the interfering 60 Hz noise; or mathematically,\n\n$$\nV_{in(60 Hz)} = A \\sin(120 \\pi t + \\phi) \\tag{17.12}\n$$\n\nwhere A and $\\phi$ are arbitrary magnitude and phase values. Now substituting this relationship for $V_{in}$ into (17.2), we have\n\n$$\nV_x(T_1) = -\\int_{0}^{T_1} \\frac{(-V_{in})}{R_1 C_1} d\\tau = -\\int_{0}^{T_1} \\frac{(-V_{in(ideal)})}{R_1 C_1} d\\tau - \\int_{0}^{T_1} \\frac{(-V_{in(60 Hz)})}{R_1 C_1} d\\tau \\tag{17.13}\n$$\n\nHowever, the last term in (17.13) can be shown to equal zero when $T_1$ is an integer multiple of $1 /(60 Hz)$ (i.e., 16.67 ms). In this way, the peak value, $V_x(T_1)$, remains correct so that the conversion is performed without error. Note that for this same value of $T_1$, the harmonics of 60 Hz are also suppressed (i.e., $120 Hz, 180 Hz, 240 Hz$, etc.). The converter's frequency response is shown in Fig. 17.3 with $T_1 = 1 /(60 Hz)$. Note that full suppression is achieved at harmonics of 60 Hz, as expected.\n\nIn fact, other frequencies are also attenuated but not fully suppressed as are the harmonics of $1 / T_1$. Note the $-20 dB /$ decade slope in Fig. 17.3, so that higher frequencies are attenuated more.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 17.2\n\nIt is desired to build a 16-bit two-slope integrating A/D such that a maximum input signal of $V_{in} = 3 V$ results in the peak voltage of $V_x$ being 4 V. In addition, input noise signals at 50 Hz and harmonics should be significantly attenuated. Find the required RC time constant and clock rate. Also, find the attenuation of a noise signal around 1 kHz superimposed on the input signal.\n\n#### Solution\n\nSince 50 Hz and harmonics are to be rejected, we choose\n\n$$\nT_1 = \\frac{1}{50} = 20 ms \\tag{17.14}\n$$\n\nThus, for a 16-bit converter, we require a clock frequency of\n\n$$\nf_{clk} = \\frac{1}{T_{clk}} = \\frac{2^{16}}{T_1} = 3.28 MHz \\tag{17.15}\n$$\n\nTo find the RC time constant needed, we note that at the end of phase (I), $V_x$ is given by\n\n$$\nV_x = \\frac{V_{in} T_1}{R_1 C_1} \\tag{17.16}\n$$\n\nand using the values of $V_x = 4 V, V_{in} = 3 V$, and $T_1 = 20 ms$ results in\n\n$$\nR_1 C_1 = 15 ms \\tag{17.17}\n$$\n\nFinally, the attenuation of a 1 kHz signal is infinite since it is a harmonic of 50 kHz. However, as seen in (17.10), attenuation is reduced halfway between harmonics, so we find the gain for an input signal at 975 Hz to be\n\n$$\n|H(f)| = \\left|\\frac{\\sin(\\pi \\times 975 Hz \\times 20 ms)}{\\pi \\times 975 Hz \\times 20 ms}\\right| = 16.3 \\times 10^{-3} \\tag{17.18}\n$$\n\nwhich implies the attenuation is 36 dB.\n"

A traditional application that has historically utilized integrating converters includes measuring devices such as voltmeters and ammeters.\n\nA basic illustration of a dual-slope integrating converter is depicted in Figure 17.1. The term \"dual-slope\" signifies that the conversion process is divided into two phases, designated as (I) and (II), as demonstrated in Figure 17.2:\n\nDuring Phase (I), which spans a fixed time duration of $\\mathrm{T}_{1}$, the counter operates for $2^{\\mathrm{N}}$ clock cycles.

The charging period is controlled via switches S1 and S2, and the output is determined by a counter measuring the time taken for the integrated voltage to reach zero.\n\nFig. 17.1 Integrating (dual slope) A/D converter.\nimage_name:Fig. 17.2\ndescription:Figure 17.2 depicts the functioning of an integrating (dual slope) A/D converter under three distinct input voltages (-Vin1, -Vin2, -Vin3). It illustrates a time-domain waveform with the x-axis denoted as 'Time' and the y-axis labeled 'Vx'. The graph is divided into two phases: Phase (I) and Phase (II).\n\n1. **Phase (I):** The voltage Vx increases linearly from zero to a maximum value during this phase. The slope of the line is determined by the input voltage (-Vin). Three different slopes are illustrated, corresponding to three different input voltages (-Vin1, -Vin2, -Vin3), with -Vin3 exhibiting the steepest slope and -Vin1 the gentlest. The duration of this phase is noted as T1.\n\n2. **Phase (II):** This phase commences at the peak of each line from Phase (I) and shows a consistent negative slope, indicating the discharge of the integrated voltage back to zero. The slopes in this phase are constant for all three input voltages, representing the discharge phase of the integration process.

In reality, this time constant needs only to be stable during a single conversion for proper operation. However, $\\mathrm{R}_{1}$ and $\\mathrm{C}_{1}$ should be selected to ensure a reasonable large peak value of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ without distortion to reduce noise effects. It is also feasible to carry out a single-slope conversion, where only one integration phase is necessary. Nevertheless, the integration time would then be dependent on the time-constant value, $\\mathrm{R}_{1} \\mathrm{C}_{1}$, and gain errors are likely to occur.\n\nAlthough a dual-slope converter is immune to gain errors, it may experience offset errors due to operational amplifier offset and other factors. Such an offset error can be mitigated by employing a quad-slope conversion. In a quad-slope conversion, a dual-slope conversion is performed twice: once with the input connected to ground (or another known dc quantity), and then with the input connected to the signal to be converted, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}}$. Subtracting the two output words reduces the offset error to zero.\n\nKey Point: The dual-slope conversion process does not necessitate accuracy in determining the integration time constant. Offset errors can be calibrated by conducting an additional conversion using a known dc input quantity.\n\nThe conversion speed for these types of converters is relatively slow. For instance, in a dual-slope converter, the worst-case conversion speed occurs when $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {in }}$ equals $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {ref }}$. In such cases, the number of clock cycles required for a conversion is $2^{\\mathrm{N}+1}$. Thus, for a 16-bit converter with a clock frequency of 1 MHz, the worst-case conversion rate is approximately 7.6 Hz.\n\nIn conclusion, by carefully selecting $\\mathrm{T}_{1}$, certain frequency components superimposed on the input signal can be substantially diminished. It is important to note that this converter effectively \"integrates and discharges\" the input signal. If we relax the assumption that $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {in }}$ is constant in (17.2), we recognize that before conversion, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {in }}$ is essentially integrated over a time window $T_{1}$, which is equivalent to convolution with a rectangular time function. As the Fourier transform of a rectangular pulse yields a \"sin(x)/x\" response, we possess an effective input filter with a transfer function:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n|H(f)|=\\left|\\frac{\\sin \\left(\\pi \\mathrm{fT}_{1}\\right)}{\\left(\\pi \\mathrm{fT} \\mathrm{~T}_{1}\\right)}\\right| \\tag{17.10}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nTherefore, integrating converters exhibit a low-pass response, with nulls at all integer multiples of $f=1 / T_{1}$.\n\nKey Point: Integrating converters inherently filter the input with a $\\sin x / x$ frequency response.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 17.1\n\nIf the input signal, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}}$, is a dc level with power line noise of 60 Hz superimposed on it, select $\\mathrm{T}_{1}$ such that the power line noise is filtered out.\n\n#### Solution\n\nExpress $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {in }}$ as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {in }}=V_{\\text {in(ideal) }}+V_{\\text {in(60 Hz) }} \\tag{17.11}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {in(ideal) }}$ is the desired dc signal level and $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}(60 \\mathrm{~Hz})}$ is the interfering 60 Hz noise; or mathematically,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{i n(60 H z)}=A \\sin (120 \\pi t+\\phi) \\tag{17.12}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere A and $\\phi$ are arbitrary magnitude and phase values. Now, substitute this relationship for $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {in }}$ into (17.2), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{x}\\left(T_{1}\\right)=-\\int_{0}^{T_{1}} \\frac{\\left(-V_{\\text {in }}\\right)}{R_{1} C_{1}} d \\tau=-\\int_{0}^{T_{1}} \\frac{\\left(-V_{\\text {in (ideal })}\\right)}{R_{1} C_{1}} d \\tau-\\int_{0}^{T_{1}} \\frac{\\left(-V_{\\text {in }(60 H z)}\\right)}{R_{1} C_{1}} d \\tau \\tag{17.13}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHowever, the last term in (17.13) can be proven to be zero when $T_{1}$ is an integer multiple of $1 /(60 \\mathrm{~Hz})$ (i.e., 16.67 ms). In this way, the peak value, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}\\left(\\mathrm{T}_{1}\\right)$, remains correct so that the conversion is carried out without error. Note that for this same value of $\\mathrm{T}_{1}$, the harmonics of 60 Hz are also suppressed (i.e., $120 \\mathrm{~Hz}, 180 \\mathrm{~Hz}, 240$ Hz , etc.).

These converters boast minimal offset and gain errors, in addition to their exceptional linearity. Furthermore, their implementation is simplified by the requirement of minimal circuitry. Historically, integrating converters have found significant application in measurement instruments, such as voltmeters or ammeters.\n\nA simplified diagram of a dual-slope integrating converter is presented in Fig. 17.1. The term \"dual-slope\" refers to the converter's two-phase conversion process, (I) and (II), as depicted in Fig. 17.2:\n\n**Phase (I)** This phase consists of a fixed time interval, $T_1$, which is determined by the counter running for $2^N$ clock cycles. Hence, we have:\n\n$$\nT_1 = 2^N T_{clk} \\tag{17.1}\n$$\n\nwhere $T_{clk}$ represents the period of one clock cycle. During this interval, switch $S_1$ is connected to $-V_{in}$, causing $V_x$ to ramp up in proportion to the magnitude of $V_{in}$. Assuming $V_x$ is initially zero due to a pulse on $S_2$, and considering $V_{in}$ to be constant, the relationship for $V_x$ is:\n\n$$\nV_x(t) = \\frac{V_{in}}{R_1 C_1} t \\tag{17.2}\n$$\n\nConsequently, at the end of phase (I), the value of $V_x$ is equal to $\\frac{V_{in} T_1}{R_1 C_1}$.\n\n**Phase (II)** Phase (II) lasts for a variable duration, $T_2$, as illustrated in Fig. 17.2 for three different input voltages. At the beginning of this phase, the counter is reset, and switch $S_1$ is connected to $V_{ref}$, resulting in a constant slope for the decaying voltage at $V_x$. To obtain the digital output value, the counter counts until $V_x$ falls below zero. At this point, the count value corresponds to the digitized value of the input signal, $V_{in}$. Assuming the digital output count is normalized such that the largest count is unity, the counter output, $B_{out}$, can be expressed as:\n\n$$\nB_{out} = b_1 2^{-1} + b_2 2^{-2} + \\cdots + b_{N-1} 2^{-(N-1)} + b_N 2^{-N} \\tag{17.3}\n$$\n\nThe circuit depicted in Fig. 17.1 is an integrating (dual slope) A/D converter. It employs a dual-slope integration method to convert an analog input voltage (-Vin) into a digital output (Bout). The integration period is governed by switches S1 and S2, and the output is determined by a counter that measures the time it takes for the integrated voltage to reach zero.\n\nFig. 17.2 illustrates the operation of an integrating (dual slope) A/D converter for three different input voltages (-Vin1, -Vin2, -Vin3). It is a time-domain waveform with the x-axis labeled as 'Time' and the y-axis labeled as 'Vx'. The graph is divided into two phases: Phase (I) and Phase (II).\n\n1. **Phase (I):** During this phase, the voltage Vx increases linearly from zero to a peak value. The slope of the line is determined by the input voltage (-Vin). There are three different slopes shown, corresponding to three different input voltages (-Vin1, -Vin2, -Vin3), with -Vin3 having the steepest slope and -Vin1 the shallowest. The duration of this phase is marked as T1.\n\n2. **Phase (II):** This phase begins at the peak of each line from Phase (I) and shows a constant negative slope, indicating a linear decrease in Vx back to zero. The slopes in this phase are constant and identical for all three input voltages, representing the discharge phase of the integration process. The time taken for Vx to return to zero is marked as T2, which varies for each input voltage.\n\n3. **Key Features:**\n- The graph demonstrates how different input voltages affect the time it takes for the integrated voltage to reach zero during Phase (II).\n- The peak values during Phase (I) correspond to the magnitude of the input voltages.\n- T1 is constant across all three scenarios, while T2 varies, demonstrating the dual-slope method's dependence on the input voltage.\n\n4. **Annotations:**\n- The graph is annotated with labels for each phase and the input voltages.\n- The transition between phases is marked with a vertical dashed line, indicating the point where the integration switches from charging to discharging.\n\nThis graph effectively illustrates the dual-slope integration process by showing the relationship between input voltage and the integration time required to return to zero, a crucial aspect of the A/D conversion method used in this circuit.\n\nFig. 17.2 Operation of the integrating converter for three different input voltages.\n\nWe have:\n\n$$\nT_2 = 2^N B_{out} T_{clk} = (b_1 2^{N-1} + b_2 2^{N-2} + \\cdots + b_{N-1} 2 + b_N) T_{clk} \\tag{17.4}\n$$\n\nTo understand why this count yields the correct value, we derive the equation for $V_x$ during phase (II) as follows:\n\n$$\nV_x(t) = -\\int_{T_1}^{t} \\frac{V_{ref}}{R_1 C_1} d\\tau + V_x(T_1) = \\frac{-V_{ref}}{R_1 C_1}(t - T_1) + \\frac{V_{in} T_1}{R_1 C_1} \\tag{17.5}\n$$\n\nSince $V_x$ equals zero when $t = T_1 + T_2$, we can write:\n\n$$\n0 = \\frac{-V_{ref} T_2}{R_1 C_1} + \\frac{V_{in} T_1}{R_1 C_1} \\tag{17.6}\n$$\n\nThus, $T_2$ is related to $T_1$ by the following relationship:\n\n$$\nT_2 = T_1 \\left(\\frac{V_{in}}{V_{ref}}\\right) \\tag{17.7}\n$$\n\nCombining (17.7) with (17.1) and (17.4), we find:\n\n$$\nB_{out} = b_1 2^{-1} + b_2 2^{-2} + \\cdots + b_{N-1} 2^{-(N-1)} + b_N 2^{-N} = \\frac{V_{in}}{V_{ref}} \\tag{17.8}\n$$\n\nas expected.\n\nKey Point: Dual-slope integrating conversion involves integrating the input for a fixed time period, followed by applying a known input to the integrator and measuring the time required for the integrator output to return to zero.\n\nFrom (17.8), we observe that in a dual-slope conversion (i.e., two phases), the digital output is independent of the time constant, $R_1 C_1$. In fact, the value of this time constant need only be stable during a single conversion for proper operation. However, $R_1$ and $C_1$ should be chosen such that a reasonable large peak value of $V_x$ is obtained without clipping to reduce noise effects. It is also possible to perform a single-slope conversion where only one integration phase is needed, but the integration time would then be a function of the time-constant value, $R_1 C_1$, and a gain error would most likely occur.\n\nAlthough a dual-slope converter does not suffer from gain error, it can have an offset error due to opamp offset and other factors. Such an offset error can be calibrated out by employing a quad-slope conversion. In a quad-slope conversion, a dual-slope conversion is performed twice: once with the input connected to ground (or other known dc quantity), and then with the input connected to the signal to be converted, $V_{in}$. A subtraction of the two output words causes the offset error to be reduced to zero.\n\nKey Point: Dual-slope conversion does not require accuracy in defining the integration time constant. Offset errors can be calibrated by performing an additional conversion using a known dc input quantity.\n\nThe conversion speed for these types of converters is quite slow. For example, in a dual-slope converter, the worst-case conversion speed occurs when $V_{in}$ equals $V_{ref}$. In this case, the number of clock cycles to perform a conversion is $2^{N+1}$. Thus for a 16-bit converter with a clock frequency equal to 1 MHz, the worst-case conversion rate is around 7.6 Hz.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that by a careful choice for $T_1$, certain frequency components superimposed on the input signal can be significantly attenuated. Note that this converter effectively \"integrates and dumps\" the input signal. If we relax the assumption that $V_{in}$ is constant in (17.2), we see that before being converted, $V_{in}$ is actually integrated over a time window $T_1$ in duration:\n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T_1} \\frac{V_{in}(\\tau)}{R_1 C_1} d\\tau \\tag{17.9}\n$$\n\nwhich is equivalent to convolution by a rectangular time function. Since the Fourier transform of a rectangular pulse is a \" $\\sin(x) / x$ \" type response, we have an effective input filter with a transfer function:\n\n$$\n|H(f)| = \\left|\\frac{\\sin(\\pi f T_1)}{(\\pi f T_1)}\\right| \\tag{17.10}\n$$\n\nTherefore, integrating converters have a low-pass response, with nulls at all integer multiples of $f = 1 / T_1$.\n\nKey Point: Integrating converters inherently filter the input with a $\\sin(x) / x$ frequency response.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 17.1\n\nIf the input signal, $V_{in}$, is a dc level with power line noise of 60 Hz superimposed on it, choose $T_1$ to filter out the power line noise.\n\n#### Solution\n\nWrite $V_{in}$ as:\n\n$$\nV_{in} = V_{in(ideal)} + V_{in(60 Hz)} \\tag{17.11}\n$$\n\nwhere $V_{in(ideal)}$ is the desired dc signal level and $V_{in(60 Hz)}$ is the interfering 60 Hz noise; or mathematically:\n\n$$\nV_{in(60 Hz)} = A \\sin(120 \\pi t + \\phi) \\tag{17.12}\n$$\n\nwhere A and $\\phi$ are arbitrary magnitude and phase values. Now substituting this relationship for $V_{in}$ into (17.2), we have:\n\n$$\nV_x(T_1) = -\\int_{0}^{T_1} \\frac{(-V_{in})}{R_1 C_1} d\\tau = -\\int_{0}^{T_1} \\frac{(-V_{in(ideal)})}{R_1 C_1} d\\tau - \\int_{0}^{T_1} \\frac{(-V_{in(60 Hz)})}{R_1 C_1} d\\tau \\tag{17.13}\n$$\n\nHowever, the last term in (17.13) can be shown to equal zero when $T_1$ is an integer multiple of $1 / (60 Hz)$ (i.e., 16.67 ms). In this way, the peak value, $V_x(T_1)$, remains correct so that the conversion is performed without error. Note that for this same value of $T_1$, the harmonics of 60 Hz are also suppressed (i.e., 120 Hz, 180 Hz, 240 Hz, etc.). The converter's frequency response is shown in Fig. 17.3 with $T_1 = 1 / (60 Hz)$. Note that full suppression is achieved at harmonics of 60 Hz, as expected.\n\nIn fact, other frequencies are also attenuated but not fully suppressed as are the harmonics of $1 / T_1$. Note the $-20 dB /$ decade slope in Fig. 17.3, so that higher frequencies are attenuated more.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 17.2\n\nIt is desired to build a 16-bit two-slope integrating A/D such that a maximum input signal of $V_{in} = 3 V$ results in the peak voltage of $V_x$ being 4 V. In addition, input noise signals at 50 Hz and harmonics should be significantly attenuated. Find the required RC time constant and clock rate. Also, find the attenuation of a noise signal around 1 kHz superimposed on the input signal.\n\n#### Solution\n\nSince 50 Hz and harmonics are to be rejected, we choose:\n\n$$\nT_1 = \\frac{1}{50} = 20 ms \\tag{17.14}\n$$\n\nThus, for a 16-bit converter, we require a clock frequency of:\n\n$$\nf_{clk} = \\frac{1}{T_{clk}} = \\frac{2^{16}}{T_1} = 3.28 MHz \\tag{17.15}\n$$\n\nTo find the RC time constant needed, we note that at the end of phase (I), $V_x$ is given by:\n\n$$\nV_x = \\frac{V_{in} T_1}{R_1 C_1} \\tag{17.16}\n$$\n\nand using the values of $V_x = 4 V$, $V_{in} = 3 V$, and $T_1 = 20 ms$ results in:\n\n$$\nR_1 C_1 = 15 ms \\tag{17.17}\n$$\n\nFinally, the attenuation of a 1 kHz signal is infinite since it is a harmonic of 50 kHz. However, as seen in (17.10), attenuation is reduced halfway between harmonics, so we find the gain for an input signal at 975 Hz to be:\n\n$$\n|H(f)| = \\left|\\frac{\\sin(\\pi \\times 975 Hz \\times 20 ms)}{\\pi \\times 975 Hz \\times 20 ms}\\right| = 16.3 \\times 10^{-3} \\tag{17.18}\n$$\n\nwhich implies the attenuation is 36 dB.\n\nFig. 17.3 illustrates the magnitude response of an effective input filter for an integrating-type converter with $T_1 = 1 / (60 Hz)$. The graph is a Bode plot with the x-axis representing frequency in hertz, displayed on a logarithmic scale, ranging from 10 Hz to 300 Hz. The y-axis represents the magnitude |H(f)| in decibels (dB), ranging from 0 dB to -40 dB.\n\nThe plot shows a series of attenuations and peaks. The magnitude response starts at 0 dB at low frequencies and decreases, following a general slope of -20 dB per decade, as indicated by the dashed line. This slope represents the general trend of attenuation as frequency increases.\n\nSignificant features include:\n- A pronounced dip in magnitude at 60 Hz, where the response reaches a minimum, showing significant attenuation.\n- Subsequent peaks and valleys occur at harmonic frequencies, specifically at 120 Hz, 180 Hz, 240 Hz, and 300 Hz, with the magnitude of these peaks decreasing progressively.\n\nThis pattern indicates that the filter effectively attenuates signals at 50 Hz and its harmonics, while allowing some periodic increase in response at higher harmonics, though at reduced levels. The design is likely intended to reject power line noise and its harmonics efficiently."

Stability of this time constant is only required during a single conversion for accurate operation. However, $R_1$ and $C_1$ should be selected to achieve a sufficiently large peak $V_x$ without clipping to minimize noise effects. A single-slope conversion, where only one integration phase is employed, is possible, but the integration time would then depend on the time constant, $R_1 C_1$, likely introducing gain error.\n\nAlthough a dual-slope converter is free from gain error, it may experience offset error due to operational amplifier offset and other factors. This offset error can be compensated for by employing a quad-slope conversion. In a quad-slope conversion, a dual-slope conversion is conducted twice: once with the input grounded (or another known DC level) and once with the input signal to be converted, $V_{in}$. Subtracting the two output values effectively eliminates the offset error.\n\nA significant characteristic of dual-slope conversion is its insensitivity to the accuracy of the integration time constant. Offset errors can be adjusted by conducting an additional conversion using a known DC input.\n\nThe conversion speed for integrating converters is relatively slow. In a dual-slope converter, the slowest conversion speed occurs when $V_{in}$ equals $V_{ref}$. In this scenario, the number of clock cycles required for conversion is $2^{N+1}$. Therefore, for a 16-bit converter with a 1 MHz clock frequency, the slowest conversion rate is approximately 7.6 Hz.\n\nIt is worth noting that by selecting an appropriate $T_1$, certain frequency components riding on the input signal can be substantially reduced. This converter effectively 'integrates and dumps' the input signal.

Assuming the largest possible count is normalized to one, the counter output, $B_{out}$, is defined as:\n\n$$\nB_{out} = b_1 2^{-1} + b_2 2^{-2} + \\cdots + b_{N-1} 2^{-(N-1)} + b_N 2^{-N}\n$$\n\nand we find\n\n$$\nT_2 = 2^N B_{out} T_{clk} = (b_1 2^{N-1} + b_2 2^{N-2} + \\cdots + b_{N-1} 2 + b_N) T_{clk}\n$$\n\nTo understand why this count yields the correct value, the equation for $V_x$ during phase (II) is given by:\n\n$$\nV_x(t) = -\\int_{T_1}^{t} \\frac{V_{ref}}{R_1 C_1} d\\tau + V_x(T_1)\n$$\n\nSince $V_x$ equals zero when $t = T_1 + T_2$, we can write\n\n$$\n0 = \\frac{-V_{ref} T_2}{R_1 C_1} + \\frac{V_{in} T_1}{R_1 C_1}\n$$\n\nThus, $T_2$ is related to $T_1$ by:\n\n$$\nT_2 = T_1 \\left(\\frac{V_{in}}{V_{ref}}\\right)\n$$\n\nCombining this with equations (17.1) and (17.4), we obtain\n\n$$\nB_{out} = b_1 2^{-1} + b_2 2^{-2} + \\cdots + b_{N-1} 2^{-(N-1)} + b_N 2^{-N} = \\frac{V_{in}}{V_{ref}}\n$$\n\nas anticipated.\n\nThe key aspect of dual-slope integrating conversion is the integration of the input over a fixed time period followed by the application of a known reference to the integrator, measuring the time for the integrator output to return to zero.\n\nFrom equation (17.8), it's evident that in a dual-slope conversion, the digital output is independent of the time constant, $R_1 C_1$. Stability of this time constant is only required during a single conversion for accurate operation. However, $R_1$ and $C_1$ should be selected to achieve a sufficiently large peak $V_x$ without clipping to minimize noise effects. A single-slope conversion, where only one integration phase is employed, is possible, but the integration time would then depend on the time constant, $R_1 C_1$, likely introducing gain error.\n\nAlthough a dual-slope converter is free from gain error, it may experience offset error due to operational amplifier offset and other factors. This offset error can be compensated for by employing a quad-slope conversion. In a quad-slope conversion, a dual-slope conversion is conducted twice: once with the input grounded (or another known DC level) and once with the input signal to be converted, $V_{in}$. Subtracting the two output values effectively eliminates the offset error.\n\nA significant characteristic of dual-slope conversion is its insensitivity to the accuracy of the integration time constant. Offset errors can be adjusted by conducting an additional conversion using a known DC input.\n\nThe conversion speed for integrating converters is relatively slow. In a dual-slope converter, the slowest conversion speed occurs when $V_{in}$ equals $V_{ref}$. In this scenario, the number of clock cycles required for conversion is $2^{N+1}$. Therefore, for a 16-bit converter with a 1 MHz clock frequency, the slowest conversion rate is approximately 7.6 Hz.\n\nIt is worth noting that by selecting an appropriate $T_1$, certain frequency components riding on the input signal can be substantially reduced. This converter effectively 'integrates and dumps' the input signal. If we relax the assumption that $V_{in}$ is constant, we see that before conversion, $V_{in}$ is actually integrated over a time window of $T_1$ duration,\n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T_1} \\frac{V_{in}(\\tau)}{R_1 C_1} d\\tau\n$$\n\nwhich is akin to convolution with a rectangular time function. As the Fourier transform of a rectangular pulse is a 'sinc' function, an effective input filter with a transfer function is created:\n\n$$\n|H(f)| = \\left|\\frac{\\sin(\\pi f T_1)}{(\\pi f T_1)}\\right|\n$$\n\nHence, integrating converters exhibit a low-pass frequency response, with zeros at all integer multiples of $f = 1/T_1$.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 17.1\n\nIf the input signal, $V_{in}$, is a DC level with power line noise at 60 Hz added to it, choose $T_1$ to filter out the power line noise.\n\n#### Solution\n\nExpress $V_{in}$ as\n\n$$\nV_{in} = V_{in(ideal)} + V_{in(60 Hz)}\n$$\n\nwhere $V_{in(ideal)}$ is the desired DC signal level, and $V_{in(60 Hz)}$ is the interfering 60 Hz noise. Mathematically,\n\n$$\nV_{in(60 Hz)} = A \\sin(120 \\pi t + \\phi)\n$$\n\nwhere A and $\\phi$ are arbitrary magnitude and phase values. Substituting this into equation (17.2), we have\n\n$$\nV_x(T_1) = -\\int_{0}^{T_1} \\frac{(-V_{in})}{R_1 C_1} d\\tau = -\\int_{0}^{T_1} \\frac{(-V_{in(ideal)})}{R_1 C_1} d\\tau - \\int_{0}^{T_1} \\frac{(-V_{in(60 Hz)})}{R_1 C_1} d\\tau\n$$\n\nHowever, the last term in the above equation equals zero when $T_1$ is an integer multiple of $1/(60 Hz)$ (i.e., 16.67 ms). In this manner, the peak value, $V_x(T_1)$, remains accurate for the conversion to be error-free. Note that for this same value of $T_1$, the harmonics of 60 Hz are also suppressed (i.e., 120 Hz, 180 Hz, 240 Hz, etc.). The converter's frequency response is depicted in Fig. 17.3 with $T_1 = 1/(60 Hz)$. Full suppression is achieved\npopular method for achieving high-precision data conversion on very slow-moving signals. These types of converters have very low offset and gain errors in addition to being highly linear. A further advantage of integrating converters is the small amount of circuitry required in their implementation. One application that has traditionally made use of integrating converters is measurement instruments such as voltage or current meters.\n\nA simplified diagram for a dual-slope integrating converter is shown in Fig. 17.1. Dual-slope refers to this converter performing its conversion in two phases, (I) and (II), in the following manner (Fig. 17.2):\n\nPhase (I) Phase (I) is a fixed time interval of length $T_1$ determined by running the counter for $2^N$ clock cycles. Thus, we have\n\n$$\nT_1 = 2^N T_{clk}\n$$\n\nwhere $T_{clk}$ is the period for one clock cycle. During this interval, switch $S_1$ is connected to $-V_{in}$ such that $V_x$ ramps up proportional to the magnitude of $V_{in}$. Assuming $V_x$ is initially equal to zero (due to a pulse on $S_2$), and $V_{in}$ is constant, we have the following relationship for $V_x$:\n\n$$\nV_x(t) = \\frac{V_{in}}{R_1 C_1} t\n$$\n\nThus, at the end of phase (I), the value of $V_x$ is equal to $\\frac{V_{in} T_1}{R_1 C_1"

The graph is segmented into two phases: Phase (I) and Phase (II).\n\n1. **Phase (I):** During this phase, the voltage Vx increases linearly from zero to a peak value. The slope of the line is influenced by the input voltage (-Vin).

Furthermore, the value of this time constant needs to be stable only during a single conversion for correct operation. Nonetheless, $\\mathrm{R}_{1}$ and $\\mathrm{C}_{1}$ should be selected such that a substantial peak value of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ is achieved without exceeding the limits to reduce noise effects. It is also feasible to execute a single-slope conversion, where only one integration phase is necessary; however, the integration time would then be contingent upon the time-constant value, $\\mathrm{R}_{1} \\mathrm{C}_{1}$, and a gain error would likely arise.\n\nEven though a dual-slope converter is immune to gain error, it can experience an offset error due to opamp offset and other factors. Such an offset error can be corrected by performing a quad-slope conversion. In a quad-slope conversion, a dual-slope conversion is conducted twice: once with the input connected to ground (or another known direct current quantity), and then with the input connected to the signal to be converted, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}}$. Subtracting the two output words eliminates the offset error entirely.\n\nKey Point: The dual-slope conversion does not necessitate accuracy in determining the integration time constant. Offset errors can be calibrated out by executing an additional conversion using a known direct current input quantity.\n\nThe conversion rate for these converters is relatively slow. For instance, in a dual-slope converter, the worst-case conversion rate happens when $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {in }}$ equals $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {ref }}$. In this instance, the number of clock cycles required to complete a conversion is $2^{\\mathrm{N}+1}$. Thus, for a 16-bit converter with a clock frequency of 1 MHz, the worst-case conversion rate is approximately 7.6 Hz.\n\nIt is also worth noting that by meticulously selecting $\\mathrm{T}_{1}$, certain frequency components superimposed on the input signal can be considerably diminished. Note that this converter effectively \"integrates and discards\" the input signal. If we relax the assumption that $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {in }}$ is constant in (17.2), we realize that $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {in }}$ is actually integrated over a time window $T_{1}$ prior to conversion,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\int_{0}^{T_{1}} \\frac{V_{\\text {in }}(\\tau)}{R_{1} C_{1}} d \\tau \\tag{17.9}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhich is akin to convolution with a rectangular time function.

Now, substitute this relationship into (17.2), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{x}\\left(T_{1}\\right)=-\\int_{0}^{T_{1}} \\frac{\\left(-V_{\\text {in }}\\right)}{R_{1} C_{1}} d \\tau=-\\int_{0}^{T_{1}} \\frac{\\left(-V_{\\text {in (ideal })}\\right)}{R_{1} C_{1}} d \\tau-\\int_{0}^{T_{1}} \\frac{\\left(-V_{\\text {in }(60 H z)}\\right)}{R_{1} C_{1}} d \\tau \\tag{17.13}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHowever, the last term in (17.13) can be demonstrated to be zero when $T_{1}$ is an integer multiple of $1 /(60 \\mathrm{~Hz})$ (i.e., 16.67 ms ). In this manner, the peak value, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}\\left(\\mathrm{T}_{1}\\right)$, remains correct, ensuring the conversion is performed without error. Note that for this same value of $\\mathrm{T}_{1}$, the harmonics of 60 Hz are also suppressed (i.e., $120 \\mathrm{~Hz}, 180 \\mathrm{~Hz}, 240$ Hz , etc.). The converter's frequency response is depicted in Figure 17.3 with $T_{1}=1 /(60 \\mathrm{~Hz})$. Note that full suppression is achieved at harmonics of 60 Hz, as expected.\n\nIn reality, other frequencies are also diminished but not fully suppressed as are the harmonics of $1 / T_{1}$.

The time taken for Vx to return to zero is denoted as T2, which varies depending on the input voltage.\n\n3. **Key Features:**\n- The graph shows how different input voltages influence the time taken for the integrated voltage to reach zero during Phase (II).\n- The peak values during Phase (I) correspond to the magnitudes of the input voltages.\n- T1 is constant across all three scenarios, while T2 varies, demonstrating the dual-slope method's reliance on the input voltage.\n\n4. **Annotations:**\n- The graph is annotated with labels for each phase and the input voltages.\n- The transition between phases is marked with a vertical dashed line, indicating the switch from charging to discharging.\n\nThis graph effectively explains the dual-slope integration process by illustrating the connection between input voltage and the integration time needed for Vx to reach zero, a critical aspect of the A/D conversion method used in this circuit.\n\nFig. 17.2 Operation of the integrating converter for three different input voltages.\nAdditionally,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nT_{2}=2^{N} B_{\\text {out }} T_{c l k}=\\left(b_{1} 2^{N-1}+b_{2} 2^{N-2}+\\cdots+b_{N-1} 2+b_{N}\\right) T_{c l k} \\tag{17.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe validity of this count is demonstrated by deriving the equation for $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ during phase (II), resulting in\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{x}(t) & =-\\int_{T_{1}}^{t} \\frac{V_{\\text {ref }}}{R_{1} C_{1}} d \\tau+V_{x}\\left(T_{1}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\frac{-V_{\\text {ref }}}{R_{1} C_{1}}\\left(t-T_{1}\\right)+\\frac{V_{\\text {in }} T_{1}}{R_{1} C_{1}} \\tag{17.5}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSince $V_{x}$ equals zero when $t=T_{1}+T_{2}$, we can express\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n0=\\frac{-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\mathrm{~T}_{2}}{\\mathrm{R}_{1} \\mathrm{C}_{1}}+\\frac{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}} \\mathrm{~T}_{1}}{\\mathrm{R}_{1} \\mathrm{C}_{1}} \\tag{17.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHence, $T_{2}$ is connected to $T_{1}$ by the following relationship:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{T}_{2}=\\mathrm{T}_{1}\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{in}}}{\\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{ret}}}\\right) \\tag{17.7}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nCombining (17.7) with (17.1) and (17.4), we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nB_{\\text {out }}=b_{1} 2^{-1}+b_{2} 2^{-2}+\\cdots+b_{N-1} 2^{-(N-1)}+b_{N} 2^{-N}=\\frac{V_{\\text {in }}}{V_{\\text {ref }}} \\tag{17.8}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nas anticipated.\n\nKey Point: The dual-slope integrating conversion first integrates the input for a fixed period, then applies a known input to the integrator and measures the time until the integrator output returns to zero.\n\nFrom (17.8), it is evident that in a dual-slope conversion, the digital output does not depend on the time constant, $\\mathrm{R}_{1} \\mathrm{C}_{1}$. In reality, this time constant only needs to be stable during a single conversion for correct operation. However, $\\mathrm{R}_{1}$ and $\\mathrm{C}_{1}$ should be selected to obtain a substantial peak value of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ without distortion to minimize noise effects. It is also possible to conduct a single-slope conversion with only one integration phase, but the integration time would then be dependent on the time-constant value, $\\mathrm{R}_{1} \\mathrm{C}_{1}$, and a gain error would likely arise.\n\nDespite not suffering from gain error, a dual-slope converter may still have an offset error due to operational amplifier offset and other factors. Such offset error can be nullified by performing a quad-slope conversion. In a quad-slope conversion, a dual-slope conversion is executed twice: first with the input connected to ground or another known DC quantity, then with the input connected to the signal to be converted, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}}$. Subtracting the two output words eliminates the offset error entirely.\n\nKey Point: The dual-slope conversion does not necessitate precision in the definition of the integration time constant. Offset errors can be corrected by conducting an additional conversion with a known DC input quantity.\n\nThe conversion speed for these converters is generally slow. For instance, in a dual-slope converter, the worst-case conversion speed happens when $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {in }}$ equals $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {ref }}$. In this instance, the number of clock cycles required for a conversion is $2^{\\mathrm{N}+1}$. Thus, for a 16-bit converter with a clock frequency of 1 MHz, the worst-case conversion rate is approximately 7.6 Hz.\n\nIn conclusion, through meticulous selection of $\\mathrm{T}_{1}$, certain frequency components superimposed on the input signal can be substantially attenuated. This converter effectively \"integrates and discharges\" the input signal. If we relax the assumption that $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {in }}$ is constant in (17.2), we find that before conversion, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {in }}$ is integrated over a time window $T_{1}$ in duration,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\int_{0}^{T_{1}} \\frac{V_{\\text {in }}(\\tau)}{R_{1} C_{1}} d \\tau \\tag{17.9}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhich is equivalent to convolution with a rectangular time function. Since the Fourier transform of a rectangular pulse is a \" $\\sin (\\mathrm{x}) / x$ \" type response, the converter has a low-pass frequency response, nulls at all integer multiples of $f=1 / T_{1}$.\n\nKey Point: Integrating converters inherently filter the input signal with a $\\sin x / x$ frequency response.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 17.1\n\nIf the input signal, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}}$, consists of a DC level with power line noise of 60 Hz superimposed on it, choose $\\mathrm{T}_{1}$ to filter out the power line noise.\n\n#### Solution\n\nExpress $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {in }}$ as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {in }}=V_{\\text {in(ideal) }}+V_{\\text {in(60 Hz) }} \\tag{17.11}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {in(ideal) }}$ is the desired DC signal level, and $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}(60 \\mathrm{~Hz})}$ is the disruptive 60 Hz noise; or mathematically,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{i n(60 H z)}=A \\sin (120 \\pi t+\\phi) \\tag{17.12}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere A and $\\phi$ are arbitrary magnitude and phase values. Substituting this relationship for $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {in }}$ into (17.2) yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{x}\\left(T_{1}\\right)=-\\int_{0}^{T_{1}} \\frac{\\left(-V_{\\text {in }}\\right)}{R_{1} C_{1}} d \\tau=-\\int_{0}^{T_{1}} \\frac{\\left(-V_{\\text {in (ideal })}\\right)}{R_{1} C_{1}} d \\tau-\\int_{0}^{T_{1}} \\frac{\\left(-V_{\\text {in }(60 H z)}\\right)}{R_{1} C_{1}} d \\tau \\tag{17.13}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHowever, the last term in (17.13) can be proven to equal zero when $T_{1}$ is an integer multiple of $1 /(60 \\mathrm{~Hz})$ (i.e., 16.67 ms). This ensures that the peak value, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}\\left(\\mathrm{T}_{1}\\right)$, remains accurate, allowing the conversion to be executed without error. Furthermore, for the same value of $\\mathrm{T}_{1}$, the harmonics of 60 Hz are also suppressed (i.e., $120 \\mathrm{~Hz}, 180 \\mathrm{~Hz}, 240$ Hz, etc.). The converter's frequency response is illustrated in Figure 17.3 with $T_{1}=1 /(60 \\mathrm{~Hz})$. Full suppression is achieved at harmonics of 60 Hz, as expected.\n\nIndeed, other frequencies are also attenuated but not fully suppressed, similar to the harmonics of $1 / T_{1}$. The graph exhibits a $-20 \\mathrm{~dB} /$ decade slope, indicating that higher frequencies are attenuated more.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 17.2\n\nThe goal is to construct a 16-bit two-slope integrating $A / D$ converter such that a maximum input signal of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {in }}=3 \\mathrm{~V}$ yields a peak voltage of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ at 4 V. Furthermore, the input noise signals at 50 Hz and its harmonics should be significantly reduced. Determine the necessary RC time constant and clock rate. Additionally, find the attenuation of a noise signal around 1 kHz superimposed on the input signal.\n\n#### Solution\n\nSince 50 Hz and harmonics must be rejected, we select\nimage_name:Fig. 17.3 Magnitude response of the effective input filter\ndescription:Figure 17.3 is a Bode plot representing the magnitude response of an effective input filter for an integrating-type converter. The x-axis displays frequency in hertz on a logarithmic scale, ranging from 10 Hz to 300 Hz. The y-axis presents the magnitude |H(f)| in decibels (dB), ranging from 0 dB to -40 dB.\n\nThe plot shows a series of attenuations and peaks. The magnitude response begins at 0 dB at low frequencies and diminishes, following a general slope of -20 dB per decade, as indicated by the dashed line. This slope signifies the general trend of attenuation as frequency increases.\n\nNotable features include:\n- A distinct dip in magnitude at 60 Hz, where the response attains a minimum, indicating significant attenuation.\n- Subsequent peaks and troughs occur at harmonic frequencies, specifically at 120 Hz, 180 Hz, 240 Hz, and 300 Hz, with the magnitude of these peaks decreasing progressively.\n\nThis pattern indicates that the filter effectively attenuates signals at 50 Hz and its harmonics, while allowing some periodic increase in response at higher harmonics, albeit at reduced levels. The design appears to reject power line noise and its harmonics efficiently.\n\nFig. 17.3 Magnitude response of the effective input filter for an integrating-type converter with $T_{1}=1 /(60 \\mathrm{~Hz})$\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{T}_{1}=\\frac{1}{50}=20 \\mathrm{~ms} \\tag{17.14}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, for a 16-bit converter, we require a clock frequency of\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{f}_{\\mathrm{clk}}=\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{~T}_{\\mathrm{clk}}}=\\frac{2^{16}}{\\mathrm{~T}_{1}}=3.28 \\mathrm{MHz} \\tag{17.15}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nTo determine the required RC time constant, note that at the end of phase (I), $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}=\\frac{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}} \\mathrm{~T}_{1}}{\\mathrm{R}_{1} \\mathrm{C}_{1}} \\tag{17.16}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nUsing the values of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}=4 \\mathrm{~V}, \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{in}}=3 \\mathrm{~V}$, and $\\mathrm{T}_{1}=20 \\mathrm{~ms}$ yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{R}_{1} \\mathrm{C}_{1}=15 \\mathrm{~ms} \\tag{17.17}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFinally, the attenuation of a $1-\\mathrm{kHz}$ signal is infinite since it is a harmonic of 50 kHz."

At the start of this phase, the counter is reset, and switch $S_{1}$ is connected to $V_{\\text {ref }}$, leading to a constant slope for the decreasing voltage at $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$. The digital output value is determined by counting until $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ falls below zero, at which point the count equals the digitized value of the input signal, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}}$. Assuming the digital output count is normalized so that the maximum count is one, the counter output, $\\mathrm{B}_{\\text {out }}$, can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{B}_{\\text {out }}=\\mathrm{b}_{1} 2^{-1}+\\mathrm{b}_{2} 2^{-2}+\\cdots+\\mathrm{b}_{\\mathrm{N}-1} 2^{-(\\mathrm{N}-1)}+\\mathrm{b}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2^{-\\mathrm{N}} \\tag{17.3}\n$$\n\nand we have\n\n$$\nT_{2}=2^{N} B_{\\text {out }} T_{c l k}=\\left(b_{1} 2^{N-1}+b_{2} 2^{N-2}+\\cdots+b_{N-1} 2+b_{N}\\right) T_{c l k} \\tag{17.4}\n$$\n\nTo understand why this count yields the correct value, we derive the equation for $V_{x}$ during phase (II):\n\n$$\nV_{x}(t) =-\\int_{T_{1}}^{t} \\frac{V_{\\text {ref }}}{R_{1} C_{1}} d \\tau+V_{x}\\left(T_{1}\\right) =\\frac{-V_{\\text {ref }}}{R_{1} C_{1}}\\left(t-T_{1}\\right)+\\frac{V_{\\text {in }} T_{1}}{R_{1} C_{1}} \\tag{17.5}\n$$\n\nGiven that $V_{x}$ equals zero when $t=T_{1}+T_{2}$, we can write\n\n$$\n0=\\frac{-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\mathrm{~T}_{2}}{\\mathrm{R}_{1} \\mathrm{C}_{1}}+\\frac{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}} \\mathrm{~T}_{1}}{\\mathrm{R}_{1} \\mathrm{C}_{1}} \\tag{17.6}\n$$\n\nThus, $T_{2}$ is related to $T_{1}$ by:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{T}_{2}=\\mathrm{T}_{1}\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{in}}}{\\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{ret}}}\\right) \\tag{17.7}\n$$\n\nCombining (17.7) with (17.1) and (17.4), we obtain\n\n$$\nB_{\\text {out }}=b_{1} 2^{-1}+b_{2} 2^{-2}+\\cdots+b_{N-1} 2^{-(N-1)}+b_{N} 2^{-N}=\\frac{V_{\\text {in }}}{V_{\\text {ref }}} \\tag{17.8}\n$$\n\nas anticipated.\n\nKey Point: Dual-slope integrating conversion involves integrating the input for a set time period, then applying a known input to measure the time needed for the integrator output to return to zero.\n\nFrom (17.8), it's clear that in a dual-slope conversion, the digital output is independent of the time constant, $\\mathrm{R}_{1} \\mathrm{C}_{1}$.

Such offset error can be mitigated by employing a quad-slope conversion. In a quad-slope conversion, a dual-slope conversion is conducted twice: once with the input grounded (or connected to another known dc quantity) and once with the input connected to the signal to be converted, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}}$.

    "text": "Successive-approximation A/D converters are among the most favored methods for implementing A/D converters, thanks to their remarkable versatility. They can deliver reasonably swift conversion times or achieve relatively high accuracy, all while operating with minimal power consumption. These advantages stem from the fact that successive-approximation converters necessitate only moderate circuit complexity. In their simplest form, they require just a single comparator, a set of capacitors with switches, and a small amount of digital control logic.\n\nTo grasp the fundamental operation of successive-approximation converters, familiarity with the binary search algorithm is beneficial. To illustrate a binary search, consider the game of guessing a random number between 1 and 128, where only yes/no questions are permitted. The initial question might be, \"Is the number greater than 64?\" If the response is yes, the next question asks if the number exceeds 96. Conversely, if the first answer is no, the subsequent question inquires if the number is greater than 32. This process of halving the search space continues until the number is identified. Generally, a binary search halves the search space with each step, allowing the desired data to be located in N steps for a dataset of size $2^{\\mathrm{N}}$.\n\nimage_name:Fig. 17.4\ndescription:The flow graph in Fig. 17.4 illustrates the successive-approximation method used in analog-to-digital conversion. The process initiates with the 'Start' block, marking the beginning of the successive approximation procedure. The system's input is a signed analog voltage, designated as \\( V_{in} \\).\n\n1. **Main Components:**\n- **Sample Block:** The process begins by sampling the input voltage \\( V_{in} \\) and setting the digital-to-analog converter (D/A) output \\( V_{D/A} \\) to 0. The index \\( i \\) is also initialized to 1.\n- **Comparator:** A decision block compares \\( V_{in} \\) with \\( V_{D/A} \\).\n- **Binary Decision Blocks:** The comparison results in two possible paths:\n- If \\( V_{in} > V_{D/A} \\), the bit \\( b_i \\) is set to 1.\n- If \\( V_{in} \\leq V_{D/A} \\), the bit \\( b_i \\) is set to 0.\n- **Update Blocks:** Based on the outcome, \\( V_{D/A} \\) is adjusted:\n- If \\( b_i = 1 \\), \\( V_{D/A} \\) increases by \\( V_{ref}/2^{i+1} \\).\n- If \\( b_i = 0 \\), \\( V_{D/A} \\) decreases by \\( V_{ref}/2^{i+1} \\).\n- **Index Increment Block:** The index \\( i \\) is incremented by 1.\n- **Loop Condition Block:** This block checks if \\( i \\) is greater than or equal to \\( N \\), where \\( N \\) is the converter's resolution.\n\n2. **Flow of Information or Control:**\n- The process starts with sampling \\( V_{in} \\) and setting initial conditions.\n- A loop repeatedly compares \\( V_{in} \\) with \\( V_{D/A} \\), adjusts \\( V_{D/A} \\) based on the comparison, and increments \\( i \\).\n- This loop persists until the resolution limit \\( N \\) is reached, ensuring the binary representation of \\( V_{in} \\) is determined.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n- The diagram includes annotations like \\( V_{in} \\), \\( V_{D/A} \\), \\( b_i \\), and \\( V_{ref} \\), which are essential for understanding the conversion process.\n- The loop condition \\( i \\geq N \\) acts as the termination point for the conversion.\n\n4. **Overall System Function:**\n- The successive-approximation approach aims to convert an analog input voltage \\( V_{in} \\) into a digital output by iteratively refining the approximation of \\( V_{in} \\).

    "text": "The direct method of employing a separate $\\mathrm{D} / \\mathrm{A}$ converter and aligning it with the input voltage (within one LSB) can be adapted to the flow graph depicted in Fig. 17.6. Here, the error signal V is the discrepancy between the input signal, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}}$, and the $\\mathrm{D} / \\mathrm{A}$ output, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{D} / \\mathrm{A}}$. Consequently, V is perpetually compared to ground, as illustrated at the top of the flow graph, with the objective of setting this error within one LSB of zero.\n\nOne of the pioneering switched-capacitor analog systems employing this method is the charge-redistribution MOS A/D converter [McCreary, 1975]. In this converter, the sample and hold, D/A converter, and the comparator's difference section are integrated into a single circuit. The unipolar configuration is illustrated in Fig. 17.7 and operates as follows:\n\n1. **Sample Mode**: Initially, all capacitors are charged to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}}$ while the comparator is reset to its threshold voltage via $\\mathbf{S}_{2}$. During this phase, the capacitor array executes the sample-and-hold function.\n2. **Hold Mode**: Subsequently, the comparator is released from reset by opening $\\mathbf{s}_{2}$, and all capacitors are connected to ground. This transition causes $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$, initially zero, to shift to $-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}}$, thereby retaining the input signal, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}}$, on the capacitor array. (This step is occasionally combined with the first bit time during bit cycling.) Ultimately, $s_{1}$ is toggled to apply $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}}$ to the capacitor array during bit cycling.\n3. **Bit Cycling**: Next, the largest capacitor (e.g., the 16 C capacitor here) is connected to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}}$. $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ then adjusts to $\\left(-\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}} + \\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}} / 2\\right)$. If $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ is negative, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}}$ exceeds $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}} / 2$, and the MSB capacitor remains linked to $V_{\\text{ref}}$. Consequently, $b_{1}$ is deemed 1. Otherwise, the MSB capacitor reconnects to ground, and $b_{1}$ is considered 0. This process iterates $N$ times, with progressively smaller capacitors being switched, until conversion concludes.\n\nTo achieve precise division by two, an additional unit capacitor of size C is incorporated, ensuring the total capacitance is $2^{\\mathrm{N}} \\mathrm{C}$ rather than $\\left(2^{\\mathrm{N}} - 1\\right) \\mathrm{C}$. Additionally, the capacitor bottom plates should connect to the $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}}$ side, not the comparator side, to minimize parasitic capacitance at node $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$. Although parasitic capacitance at $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ does not induce conversion errors with an ideal comparator, it does attenuate the voltage $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$.\n\nSigned $A / D$ conversion can be achieved by incorporating a $-\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}}$ input. If $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ is negative initially, proceed as in the unipolar scenario using $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}}$. If $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ is positive, utilize $-\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}}$ and test for $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ greater than zero when deciding whether to maintain the capacitors connected to $-V_{\\text{ret}}$.\n\n**Key Point**: The precision of successive-approximation converters often hinges on the D/A converter's accuracy. In charge-redistribution converters, this role is fulfilled by a set of comparators whose matching is crucial during each bit cycling.\n\n**Fig. 17.6 Description**: This flow graph illustrates a modified successive approximation process for a charge-redistribution converter. It starts with the \"Start\" block, indicating process initiation. The \"Sample\" block follows, where the input voltage \\( V_{\\text{in}} \\) is sampled, and the index \\( i \\) initializes to 1, marking the beginning of bit cycling.\n\nThe flow then moves to a decision block checking if the voltage \\( V \\) exceeds zero, determining the subsequent path:\n\n1. **If \\( V > 0 \\)**:\n   - Set bit \\( b_i \\) to 1.\n   - Update voltage \\( V \\) to \\( V - V_{\\text{ref}} / 2^{i+1} \\), subtracting a fraction of the reference voltage based on the current bit position.\n   - Increment index \\( i \\) by 1.\n\n2. **If \\( V \\leq 0 \\)**:\n   - Set bit \\( b_i \\) to 0.\n   - Update voltage \\( V \\) to \\( V + V_{\\text{ref}} / 2^{i+1} \\), adding a fraction of the reference voltage.\n   - Increment index \\( i \\) by 1.\n\nAfter updating voltage and index, the process checks if \\( i \\) exceeds \\( N \\), the total bit count. If \\( i \\leq N \\), it loops back to the decision block for the next bit. If \\( i > N \\), the process ends at the \"Stop\" block.\n\nThis flow graph effectively describes a binary search algorithm in analog-to-digital conversion, where each bit decision relies on comparing the current voltage with zero and adjusting accordingly. The process continues until all bits are determined, resulting in a digital approximation of the input voltage.\n\n**Fig. 17.7 Description**: This 5-bit unipolar charge-redistribution A/D converter operates in three modes: sample, hold, and bit cycling. During sample mode, Vx is near zero, and capacitors sample the input voltage Vin. In hold mode, capacitors redistribute charge. During bit cycling, switches b1 to b5 determine the digital output by comparing Vx to the reference voltage Vref.\n\n**EXAMPLE 17.4 Solution**:\n\nInitially, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}} = 0$ in sample mode. In hold mode, capacitors switch, and the charge on $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ shares between the 32 C total converter capacitance and the 8 C parasitic capacitance, resulting in:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}} = \\frac{32}{32+8} \\times -\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}} = -0.984 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{17.19}\n$$\n\nDuring the first bit cycling, $b_{1}$ switches, yielding:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}} = -0.984 + \\frac{16}{40} \\times 5 \\mathrm{~V} = 1.016 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{17.20}\n$$\n\nSince this exceeds zero, $b_{1}$ reverts to ground, and $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ returns to -0.984 V, setting $b_{1} = 0$.\n\nNext, $b_{2}$ switches, resulting in:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}} = -0.984 + \\frac{8}{40} \\times 5 \\mathrm{~V} = 0.016 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{17.21}\n$$\n\nAlso exceeding zero, $b_{2} = 0$, and $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ resets to -0.984 V.\n\nWhen $b_{3}$ switches, we get:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}} = -0.984 + \\frac{4}{40} \\times 5 = -0.484 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{17.22}\n$$\n\nBeing less than zero, $b_{3} = 1$, and $b_{3}$ stays connected to $V_{\\text{ref}}$.\n\nNext, $b_{4}$ switches, leading to:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}} = -0.484 + \\frac{2}{40} \\times 5 = -0.234 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{17.23}\n$$\n\nAlso less than zero, $b_{4} = 1$, and this switch remains connected to $V_{\\text{ref}}$.\n\nFinally, $b_{5}$ switches, resulting in:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}} = -0.234 + \\frac{1}{40} \\times 5 = -0.109 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{17.24}\n$$\n\nAgain less than zero, $b_{5} = 1$.\n\nThus, the output is $B_{\\text{out}} = 00111$, and $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ is within a $V_{\\text{LSB}}$ of ground $\\left(\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{LSB}} = 5 / 32 \\mathrm{~V}\\right)$.\n\nThe same structure can realize signed $\\mathrm{A} / \\mathrm{D}$ conversion using a single $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}}$ with a modified switching arrangement. Referring to Fig. 17.8, assuming $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}}$ ranges between $\\pm \\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}} / 2$, the conversion proceeds as follows:\n\n1. **Sample Mode**: Initially, all capacitors, except the largest, charge to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}}$ while resetting the comparator. For the signed case, the largest capacitor connects to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}} / 2$.\n2. **Hold Mode**: Next, the comparator exits reset, and all capacitors, except the largest, switch to ground. This changes $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$, initially zero, to $-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}} / 2$. The input signal's sign is determined by the comparator output at this stage.\n3. **Bit Cycling**: The largest capacitor (e.g., the 16 C capacitor) switches to ground if $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ is positive (i.e., $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}}$ is negative). If $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ is negative, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}}$ is positive, setting $\\mathrm{b}_{1}$ to 1, and conversion proceeds as in the unipolar case from $b_{2}$. If $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ is positive, $\\mathrm{b}_{1}$ is set to 0, the largest capacitor switches to ground, making $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}} = -\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}} / 2 - \\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}} / 4$ (negative), and conversion follows the unipolar case from $\\mathrm{b}_{2}$. Post-conversion, digital recoding may be necessary for the desired output code.\n\nThis signed $A / D$ approach has drawbacks: $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}}$ is halved, exacerbating noise issues in high-resolution A/Ds. Additionally, any MSB capacitor error introduces both offset and sign-dependent gain errors, causing integral nonlinearity errors.\n\n**Fig. 17.8 Description**: This 5-bit signed charge-redistribution A/D converter operates in three modes: sample, hold, and bit cycling. Capacitors and switches sample and hold the input voltage (Vin) and reference voltage (Vref/2) for conversion. The OpAmp drives the SAR logic.\n\n**Fig. 17.9 Description**: This resistor-capacitor hybrid A/D converter uses resistor strings and capacitor arrays for analog-to-digital conversion. Initially, capacitors charge to Vin while resetting the comparator, followed by successive approximation to find adjacent resistor nodes with voltages exceeding the input."

Additionally, $b_{1}$ is deemed 1. Otherwise, the MSB capacitor is reconnected to ground, and $b_{1}$ is considered 0. This process iterates $N$ times, with progressively smaller capacitors being switched, until the conversion concludes.\n\nTo achieve precise division by two, an extra unit capacitor of size C is included, ensuring the total capacitance is $2^{\\mathrm{N}} \\mathrm{C}$ instead of $\\left(2^{\\mathrm{N}} - 1\\right) \\mathrm{C}$. Moreover, the capacitor bottom plates should connect to the $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}}$ side, not the comparator side, to minimize parasitic capacitance at node $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$. Although parasitic capacitance at $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ does not induce conversion errors with an ideal comparator, it does diminish the voltage $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$.\n\nA signed $A / D$ conversion can be achieved by incorporating a $-\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}}$ input. If $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ is negative initially, proceed as in the unipolar case using $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}}$. If $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ is positive, use $-\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}}$ and test for $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ being greater than zero when deciding whether to keep the capacitors connected to $-V_{\\text{ref}}$ or not.\n\n**Key Point**: The precision of successive-approximation converters often hinges on the D/A converter's accuracy. In charge-redistribution converters, this role is fulfilled by a set of comparators whose matching is crucial during each bit cycling.\n\n**Fig. 17.6**: This flowchart illustrates a modified successive approximation process for a charge-redistribution converter. It starts with the \"Start\" block, marking the process's initiation. The subsequent block, labeled \"Sample,\" involves sampling the input voltage \\( V_{\\text{in}} \\) and initializing the index \\( i \\) to 1, commencing the bit cycling process.\n\nThe flow then moves to a decision block that checks if the voltage \\( V \\) exceeds zero, determining the subsequent path:\n\n1. **If \\( V > 0 \\)**:\n   - The bit \\( b_i \\) is set to 1.\n   - The voltage \\( V \\) updates to \\( V - V_{\\text{ref}} / 2^{i+1} \\), subtracting a fraction of the reference voltage based on the current bit position.\n   - The index \\( i \\) increments by 1.\n\n2. **If \\( V \\leq 0 \\)**:\n   - The bit \\( b_i \\) is set to 0.\n   - The voltage \\( V \\) updates to \\( V + V_{\\text{ref}} / 2^{i+1} \\), adding a fraction of the reference voltage.\n   - The index \\( i \\) increments by 1.\n\nAfter updating the voltage and index, the process checks if \\( i \\) exceeds \\( N \\), the total bit count. If \\( i \\leq N \\), the process loops back to the decision block for the next bit. If \\( i > N \\), the process ends at the \"Stop\" block.\n\nThis flowchart effectively describes a binary search algorithm for analog-to-digital conversion, where each bit decision relies on comparing the current voltage with zero and adjusting the voltage accordingly. The process continues until all bits are determined, resulting in a digital approximation of the input voltage.\n\n**Fig. 17.6**: Flow graph for a modified successive approximation (divided remainder).\n\n#### **EXAMPLE 17.4**\n\nDetermine the intermediate node voltages at $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ during the operation of the 5-bit charge-redistribution converter in Fig. 17.7, given $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}} = 1.23 \\mathrm{~V}$ and $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}} = 5 \\mathrm{~V}$. Assume a parasitic capacitance of 8 C at node $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$.\n\n#### **Solution**\n\nInitially, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}} = 0$ during sample mode. During hold mode, all capacitors switch, and the charge on $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ is shared between the 32 C total converter capacitance and the 8 C parasitic capacitance, resulting in:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}} = \\frac{32}{32+8} \\times -\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}} = -0.984 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{17.19}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n**1. Sample Mode**: The circuit is a 5-bit unipolar charge-redistribution A/D converter. During sample mode, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ is approximately 0. The capacitors configure to sample the input voltage $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}}$. During hold mode, the capacitors switch to redistribute charge. During bit cycling, switches $b_{1}$ to $b_{5}$ determine the digital output by comparing $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ to the reference voltage $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}}$.\n\n**2. Hold Mode**: This is a 5-bit unipolar charge-redistribution A/D converter. The circuit operates in three modes: sample, hold, and bit cycling. Each bit cycling step adjusts the voltage at node $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ based on $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}}$ and $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}}$. The SAR (Successive Approximation Register) determines the digital output by comparing voltages.\n\n**3. Bit Cycling**: This circuit is a 5-bit unipolar charge-redistribution A/D converter. It uses capacitors and switches to sample and hold the input voltage, then performs bit cycling to convert the analog signal to a digital output using SAR logic.\n\n**Fig. 17.7**: A 5-bit unipolar charge-redistribution A/D converter.\n\nDuring the first bit cycling, $b_{1}$ switches, resulting in:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}} = -0.984 + \\frac{16}{40} \\times 5 \\mathrm{~V} = 1.016 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{17.20}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince this result exceeds zero, switch $b_{1}$ reverts to ground, and $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ returns to -0.984 V, thus $b_{1} = 0$.\n\nNext, $b_{2}$ switches, yielding:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}} = -0.984 + \\frac{8}{40} \\times 5 \\mathrm{~V} = 0.016 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{17.21}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis also exceeds zero, so $b_{2} = 0$, and $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ resets to -0.984 V by switching $b_{2}$ back to ground.\n\nWhen $b_{3}$ switches, we get:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}} = -0.984 + \\frac{4}{40} \\times 5 = -0.484 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{17.22}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince this result is negative, $b_{3} = 1$, and switch $b_{3}$ remains connected to $V_{\\text{ref}}$.\n\nNext, $b_{4}$ switches, resulting in:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}} = -0.484 + \\frac{2}{40} \\times 5 = -0.234 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{17.23}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhich is also negative, so $b_{4} = 1$, and this switch stays connected to $V_{\\text{ref}}$.\n\nFinally, $b_{5}$ switches, resulting in:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}} = -0.234 + \\frac{1}{40} \\times 5 = -0.109 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{17.24}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhich is also negative, so $b_{5} = 1$.\n\nThus, the output is $B_{\\text{out}} = 00111$, and $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ is within a $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{LSB}}$ of ground $\\left(\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{LSB}} = 5 / 32 \\mathrm{~V}\\right)$.\n\nThe same structure as the unipolar case can realize a signed $A / D$ conversion using a single $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}}$ with a slightly modified switching arrangement. Referring to Fig. 17.8, assuming $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}}$ ranges between $\\pm \\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}} / 2$, the conversion proceeds as follows:\n\n1. **Sample Mode**: Initially, all capacitors, except the largest one, charge to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}}$ while the comparator resets to its threshold voltage. For the signed case, the largest capacitor connects to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}} / 2$.\n2. **Hold Mode**: Next, the comparator exits reset, and all capacitors, except the largest, switch to ground. This changes $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$, initially zero, to $-\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}} / 2$. At this step's end, the input signal's sign is determined by the comparator output.\n3. **Bit Cycling**: Subsequently, the largest capacitor (e.g., the 16 C capacitor) switches to ground if $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ is positive (i.e., when $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}}$ is less than zero). If $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ is negative, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}}$ is positive, and $\\mathrm{b}_{1}$ is set to 1, proceeding as in the unipolar case from $b_{2}$ until conversion completes. If $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ is positive, $\\mathrm{b}_{1}$ is set to 0, the largest capacitor switches to ground, making $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ $-\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}} / 2 - \\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}} / 4$ (a negative value), and the process continues as in the unipolar case from $\\mathrm{b}_{2}$. Digital recoding may be necessary post-conversion to achieve the desired output code.\n\nThis approach for signed $A / D$ conversion has the drawback that $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}}$ is attenuated by a factor of two, exacerbating noise issues for high-resolution A/Ds. Additionally, any error in the MSB capacitor now induces both offset and sign-dependent gain errors, leading to integral nonlinearity errors.\n\n**1.

The SAR determines the digital output by comparing voltages.\n\n**Bit Cycling Description**: This circuit is a 5-bit unipolar charge-redistribution A/D converter. It uses capacitors and switches to sample and hold $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}}$, then performs bit cycling to convert the analog signal to a digital output using SAR logic.\n\nDuring the first bit cycling, $b_1$ is switched, resulting in:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}} = -0.984 + \\frac{16}{40} \\times 5 = 1.016 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{17.20}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince this is greater than zero, $b_1$ is reversed to ground, and $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ returns to -0.984 V, setting $b_1 = 0$.\n\nNext, $b_2$ is switched, yielding:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}} = -0.984 + \\frac{8}{40} \\times 5 = 0.016 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{17.21}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis is also greater than zero, so $b_2 = 0$, and $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ reverts to -0.984 V by switching $b_2$ back to ground.\n\nWhen $b_3$ is switched, we get:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}} = -0.984 + \\frac{4}{40} \\times 5 = -0.484 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{17.22}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince this is less than zero, $b_3 = 1$, and $b_3$ remains connected to $V_{\\text{ref}}$.\n\nNext, $b_4$ is switched, resulting in:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}} = -0.484 + \\frac{2}{40} \\times 5 = -0.234 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{17.23}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis is also less than zero, so $b_4 = 1$, and $b_4$ stays connected to $V_{\\text{ref}}$.\n\nFinally, $b_5$ is switched, giving:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}} = -0.234 + \\frac{1}{40} \\times 5 = -0.109 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{17.24}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis is less than zero, so $b_5 = 1$.\n\nThus, the output is $B_{\\text{out}} = 00111$, and $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ is within a $V_{\\text{LSB}}$ of ground $\\left(\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{LSB}} = 5 / 32 \\mathrm{~V}\\right)$.\n\nThe same structure can realize signed $A/D$ conversion using a single $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}}$ with a slightly modified switching arrangement. Referring to Fig. 17.8, assuming $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}}$ is between $\\pm \\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}} / 2$, the conversion proceeds as follows:\n\n1. **Sample Mode**: Initially, all capacitors except the largest are charged to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}}$ while the comparator is reset to its threshold voltage. For the signed case, the largest capacitor connects to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}} / 2$.\n2. **Hold Mode**: The comparator is released from reset, and all capacitors except the largest are switched to ground. This changes $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ from zero to $-\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}} / 2$. The input signal's sign is determined by the comparator output at this step.\n3. **Bit Cycling**: The largest capacitor (e.g., the 16 C capacitor) switches to ground if $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ is positive (i.e., $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}}$ is negative). If $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ is negative, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}}$ is positive, and $b_1$ is set to 1, proceeding as in the unipolar case from $b_2$ onwards. If $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ is positive, $b_1$ is set to 0, the largest capacitor switches to ground, making $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}} = -\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}} / 2 - \\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}} / 4$ (negative), and the process continues from $b_2$ as in the unipolar case. Digital recoding may be needed post-conversion to obtain the desired output code.\n\nThis signed $A/D$ approach has the drawback of attenuating $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}}$ by a factor of two, increasing noise issues for high-resolution A/Ds. Additionally, any error in the MSB capacitor now causes both offset and sign-dependent gain errors, leading to integral nonlinearity errors.\n\n**Fig. 17.8 Description**: This circuit diagram shows a 5-bit signed charge-redistribution A/D converter in sample mode.

    "text": "The approach of employing a dedicated $\\mathrm{D} / \\mathrm{A}$ converter and aligning it to the input voltage (within one LSB) can be adapted to the flow graph depicted in Fig. 17.6. Here, the error signal V is the discrepancy between the input signal, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}}$, and the $\\mathrm{D} / \\mathrm{A}$ output, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{D} / \\mathrm{A}}$. Consequently, V is perpetually compared to ground, as illustrated at the top of the flow graph, with the objective of setting this error margin within one LSB of zero.\n\nOne of the pioneering switched-capacitor analog systems utilizing this method is the charge-redistribution MOS A/D converter [McCreary, 1975]. In this converter, the sample and hold, D/A converter, and the comparator's difference section are integrated into a single circuit. The unipolar configuration is shown in Fig. 17.7 and functions as follows:\n\n1. **Sample Mode:** Initially, all capacitors are charged to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}}$ while the comparator is reset to its threshold voltage via $\\mathbf{S}_{2}$. During this phase, note that the capacitor array executes the sample-and-hold function.\n2. **Hold Mode:** Subsequently, the comparator is released from reset by opening $\\mathbf{S}_{2}$, and all capacitors are connected to ground. This transition causes $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$, initially zero, to shift to $-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}}$, thereby retaining the input signal, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}}$, on the capacitor array. (This step sometimes coincides with the first bit time during bit cycling.) Finally, $s_{1}$ is toggled to apply $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}}$ to the capacitor array during bit cycling.\n3. **Bit Cycling:** Next, the largest capacitor (e.g., the 16 C capacitor here) is connected to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}}$. $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ then adjusts to $\\left(-\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}} + \\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}} / 2\\right)$. If $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ is negative, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}}$ exceeds $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}} / 2$, and the MSB capacitor remains linked to $V_{\\text{ref}}$. Consequently, $b_{1}$ is deemed 1. Otherwise, the MSB capacitor reconnects to ground, and $b_{1}$ is considered 0. This process repeats $N$ times, with progressively smaller capacitors being switched, until the conversion concludes.\n\nTo achieve precise division by two, an additional unit capacitor of size C is included, ensuring the total capacitance is $2^{\\mathrm{N}} \\mathrm{C}$ instead of $\\left(2^{\\mathrm{N}}-1\\right) \\mathrm{C}$. Furthermore, the capacitor bottom plates should connect to the $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}}$ side, not the comparator side, to minimize parasitic capacitance at node $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$.

If $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ is negative at the initial step, proceed as in the unipolar case using $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}}$.

The SAR (Successive Approximation Register) determines the digital output by comparing voltages.\n\n**3. Bit Cycling**: This circuit is a 5-bit unipolar charge-redistribution A/D converter. It uses capacitors and switches to sample and hold the input voltage, then performs bit cycling to convert the analog signal to a digital output using SAR logic.\n\n**Fig. 17.7**: A 5-bit unipolar charge-redistribution A/D converter.\n\nDuring the first bit cycling, $b_1$ switches, resulting in:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}} = -0.984 + \\frac{16}{40} \\times 5 \\mathrm{~V} = 1.016 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{17.20}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince this result is greater than zero, $b_1$ reverses back to ground, and $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ returns to -0.984 V, setting $b_1 = 0$.\n\nNext, $b_2$ switches, yielding:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}} = -0.984 + \\frac{8}{40} \\times 5 \\mathrm{~V} = 0.016 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{17.21}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis is also greater than zero, so $b_2 = 0$, and $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ resets to -0.984 V by switching $b_2$ back to ground.\n\nWhen $b_3$ switches, we get:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}} = -0.984 + \\frac{4}{40} \\times 5 = -0.484 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{17.22}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince this is less than zero, $b_3 = 1$, and $b_3$ remains connected to $V_{\\text{ref}}$.\n\nNext, $b_4$ switches, resulting in:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}} = -0.484 + \\frac{2}{40} \\times 5 = -0.234 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{17.23}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis is also less than zero, so $b_4 = 1$, and $b_4$ stays connected to $V_{\\text{ref}}$.\n\nFinally, $b_5$ switches, yielding:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}} = -0.234 + \\frac{1}{40} \\times 5 = -0.109 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{17.24}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis is also less than zero, so $b_5 = 1$.\n\nThus, the output is $B_{\\text{out}} = 00111$, and $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ is within a $V_{\\text{LSB}}$ of ground $\\left(\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{LSB}} = 5 / 32 \\mathrm{~V}\\right)$.\n\nThe same structure used for the unipolar case can realize signed $A/D$ conversion with a single $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}}$ if a slightly modified switching arrangement is used. Referring to Fig. 17.8, assuming $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}}$ is between $\\pm \\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}} / 2$, the conversion proceeds as follows:\n\n1. **Sample Mode**: Initially, all capacitors except the largest one charge to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}}$ while the comparator resets to its threshold voltage. For the signed case, the largest capacitor connects to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}} / 2$.\n2. **Hold Mode**: Next, the comparator releases from reset, and all capacitors except the largest one switch to ground. This causes $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$, initially zero, to change to $-\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}} / 2$. At this step's end, the input signal's sign is determined by the comparator output.\n3. **Bit Cycling**: The largest capacitor (e.g., the 16 C capacitor) switches to ground if $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ is greater than zero (i.e., when $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}}$ is less than zero). If $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ is less than zero, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}}$ is positive, and $b_1$ sets to 1, proceeding as in the unipolar case from $b_2$ until conversion completes. If $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ is greater than zero, $b_1$ sets to 0, the largest capacitor switches to ground, causing $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ to become $-\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}} / 2 - \\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}} / 4$ (a negative value), and the process continues as in the unipolar case from $b_2$. After conversion, some digital recoding may be necessary to achieve the desired output code.\n\nThis method for signed $A/D$ conversion has the drawback that $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}}$ is attenuated by a factor of two, exacerbating noise issues for high-resolution A/Ds. Additionally, any error in the MSB capacitor now causes both offset and sign-dependent gain errors, leading to integral nonlinearity errors.\n\n**1.

    "text": "The direct method of employing a separate $\\mathrm{D} / \\mathrm{A}$ converter and aligning it to the input voltage (within one LSB) can be adapted to the flow graph depicted in Fig. 17.6. Here, the error signal V represents the discrepancy between the input signal, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}}$, and the $\\mathrm{D} / \\mathrm{A}$ output, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{D} / \\mathrm{A}}$. Consequently, V is perpetually compared to ground, as illustrated at the top of the flow graph, with the objective of minimizing this error difference to within one LSB of zero.\n\nOne of the pioneering switched-capacitor analog systems employing this technique is the charge-redistribution MOS A/D converter [McCreary, 1975]. In this converter, the sample and hold, D/A converter, and the comparator's differential section are integrated into a single circuit. The unipolar configuration is illustrated in Fig. 17.7 and operates as follows:\n\n1. **Sample Mode**: Initially, all capacitors are charged to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}}$ while the comparator is reset to its threshold voltage via $\\mathbf{S}_{2}$. During this phase, the capacitor array executes the sample-and-hold function.\n2. **Hold Mode**: Subsequently, the comparator is released from reset by opening $\\mathbf{s}_{2}$, and all capacitors are connected to ground. This transition causes $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$, initially zero, to shift to $-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}}$, thereby retaining the input signal, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}}$, on the capacitor array. (This step sometimes coincides with the first bit time during bit cycling.) Finally, $s_{1}$ is toggled to apply $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}}$ to the capacitor array during bit cycling.\n3. **Bit Cycling**: Next, the largest capacitor (e.g., the 16 C capacitor here) is connected to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}}$. $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ then adjusts to $\\left(-\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}} + \\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}} / 2\\right)$. If $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ is negative, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}}$ exceeds $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}} / 2$, and the MSB capacitor remains connected to $V_{\\text{ref}}$, with $b_{1}$ set to 1. Otherwise, the MSB capacitor reconnects to ground, and $b_{1}$ is 0. This process iterates $N$ times, decrementing the capacitor size each cycle, until conversion concludes.\n\nTo achieve precise division by two, an additional unit capacitor of size C is included, ensuring the total capacitance is $2^{\\mathrm{N}} \\mathrm{C}$ instead of $\\left(2^{\\mathrm{N}} - 1\\right) \\mathrm{C}$. Additionally, the capacitor bottom plates should link to the $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}}$ side, not the comparator side, to reduce parasitic capacitance at node $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$. While parasitic capacitance at $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ does not introduce conversion errors with an ideal comparator, it does diminish the voltage $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$.\n\nImplementing a signed $A / D$ conversion involves adding a $-\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}}$ input. If $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ is negative initially, proceed as in the unipolar scenario using $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}}$. If $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ is positive, use $-\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}}$ and evaluate $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ for positivity when deciding whether to maintain the capacitors' connection to $-V_{\\text{ret}}$.\n\n**Key Point**: The precision of successive-approximation converters often hinges on the D/A converter's accuracy. In charge-redistribution converters, this role is fulfilled by a set of comparators whose matching is crucial during each bit cycling.\n\n**Fig. 17.6 Description**: This flow graph illustrates a modified successive approximation process for a charge-redistribution converter. It starts with a \"Start\" block, marking the process's initiation. The \"Sample\" block follows, where the input voltage \\( V_{\\text{in}} \\) is sampled, and the index \\( i \\) is initialized to 1, commencing the bit cycling process.\n\nThe flow progresses to a decision block that checks if the voltage \\( V \\) exceeds zero, determining the subsequent path:\n\n1. **If \\( V > 0 \\)**:\n   - Set bit \\( b_i \\) to 1.\n   - Update \\( V \\) to \\( V - V_{\\text{ref}} / 2^{i+1} \\), subtracting a fraction of the reference voltage based on the current bit position.\n   - Increment \\( i \\) by 1.\n\n2. **If \\( V \\leq 0 \\)**:\n   - Set bit \\( b_i \\) to 0.\n   - Update \\( V \\) to \\( V + V_{\\text{ref}} / 2^{i+1} \\), adding a fraction of the reference voltage.\n   - Increment \\( i \\) by 1.\n\nAfter updating \\( V \\) and \\( i \\), the process checks if \\( i \\) exceeds \\( N \\), the total bit count. If \\( i \\leq N \\), it loops back to the decision block for the next bit. If \\( i > N \\), the process ends at the \"Stop\" block.\n\nThis flow graph effectively describes a binary search algorithm in analog-to-digital conversion, where each bit decision relies on comparing the current voltage with zero and adjusting accordingly. The process continues until all bits are determined, yielding a digital approximation of the input voltage.\n\n**Fig. 17.7 Description**: This 5-bit unipolar charge-redistribution A/D converter operates in three modes: sample, hold, and bit cycling. During sample mode, $V_x$ is near zero, and capacitors sample $V_{\\text{in}}$. In hold mode, capacitors redistribute charge. During bit cycling, switches $b1$ to $b5$ determine the digital output by comparing $V_x$ to $V_{\\text{ref}}$.\n\n**EXAMPLE 17.4 Solution**:\n\nInitially, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}} = 0$ in sample mode. In hold mode, all capacitors switch, sharing the charge between the 32 C total converter capacitance and the 8 C parasitic capacitance, resulting in:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}} = \\frac{32}{32+8} \\times -\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}} = -0.984 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{17.19}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nDuring the first bit cycling, $b_{1}$ switches, yielding:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}} = -0.984 + \\frac{16}{40} \\times 5 \\mathrm{~V} = 1.016 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{17.20}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince this exceeds zero, $b_{1}$ reverts to ground, and $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ returns to -0.984 V, setting $b_{1} = 0$.\n\nNext, $b_{2}$ switches, resulting in:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}} = -0.984 + \\frac{8}{40} \\times 5 \\mathrm{~V} = 0.016 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{17.21}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAlso exceeding zero, $b_{2} = 0$, and $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ resets to -0.984 V.\n\nWhen $b_{3}$ switches:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}} = -0.984 + \\frac{4}{40} \\times 5 = -0.484 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{17.22}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nBeing less than zero, $b_{3} = 1$, and $b_{3}$ remains connected to $V_{\\text{ref}}$.\n\nNext, $b_{4}$ switches, giving:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}} = -0.484 + \\frac{2}{40} \\times 5 = -0.234 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{17.23}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAlso less than zero, $b_{4} = 1$, and this switch stays connected to $V_{\\text{ref}}$.\n\nFinally, $b_{5}$ switches, resulting in:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}} = -0.234 + \\frac{1}{40} \\times 5 = -0.109 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{17.24}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAgain less than zero, $b_{5} = 1$.\n\nThus, the output is $B_{\\text{out}} = 00111$, with $V_{x}$ within a $V_{\\text{LSB}}$ of ground $\\left(\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{LSB}} = 5 / 32 \\mathrm{~V}\\right)$.\n\nThe same structure can realize a signed $\\mathrm{A} / \\mathrm{D}$ conversion using a single $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}}$ with a modified switching arrangement.

If $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ is negative, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}}$ is positive, setting $\\mathrm{b}_{1}$ to 1, and the conversion follows the unipolar case from $b_{2}$ onwards. If $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ is positive, $\\mathrm{b}_{1}$ is set to 0, the largest capacitor switches to ground, making $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ $-\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{in}} / 2 - \\mathrm{V}_{\\text{ref}} / 4$ (negative), and the conversion proceeds as in the unipolar case from $\\mathrm{b}_{2}$. Post-conversion, some digital recoding may be necessary for the desired output code.\n\nThis signed $A / D$ approach has the drawback of attenuating $V_{\\text{in}}$ by a factor of two, exacerbating noise issues in high-resolution A/Ds. Additionally, any error in the MSB capacitor now causes both offset and sign-dependent gain errors, leading to integral nonlinearity errors.\n\n**Fig. 17.8 Description**: This circuit diagram shows a 5-bit signed charge-redistribution A/D converter.

    "text": "Given that the optimal matching precision of on-chip components is around 0.1 percent, one is restricted to successive approximation converters with 10-bit accuracy specifications unless some form of calibration is employed. A technique for error correction, which has been utilized to achieve 16-bit linear converters, is illustrated in Fig. 17.11 [Lee, 1984]. In this method, the MSB array is implemented using binary-weighted capacitors that establish, for instance, the initial 10 bits.\nimage_name:Fig. 17.10\ndescription:A simplified model of a capacitor array during the sampling phase, used in a charge-redistribution A/D converter with error correction.\n\nFig. 17.10 Simplified model of a capacitor array during the sampling phase.\nimage_name:Fig. 17.11\ndescription:A charge-redistribution A/D converter with error correction, featuring a capacitor array and a sub-dac for the final 6 bits. It includes a cal-dac for calibration to address non-monotonic behavior. The successive-approximation register, control, accumulator, and data register are essential components.\n\nFig. 17.11 A charge-redistribution A/D converter with error correction.\n\nFor a 16-bit converter, the last 6 bits are determined using an additional capacitor and a resistor string known as a sub-dac. Although the combination of an MSB capacitor array and an LSB resistor string is not inherently monotonic, it can be easily autocalibrated at startup by adding a second resistor string known as a cal-dac.\n\nCalibration involves measuring the errors of each capacitor, starting with the largest, calculating the necessary correction terms, and then storing these terms in a data register as $\\mathrm{DV}_{\\mathrm{ei}}$. During regular successive approximation operations, when a specific capacitor is used, its error is neutralized by adding the value stored in the data register to that in an accumulator register, which holds the sum of the correction terms for all other capacitors currently connected to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {ref }}$. No correction terms are measured for the resistor sub-dac, as its accuracy is not critical since it only determines the remaining LSBs.\n\nThe error terms are determined starting with the MSB capacitor, $\\mathrm{C}_{1}$. It is connected to ground while all other capacitors are connected to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {ref }}$ as the comparator is reset. Next, the comparator is taken out of reset, all other capacitors are switched to ground, and $\\mathrm{C}_{1}$ is switched to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {ref }}$. Defining $\\mathrm{C}_{\\text {total }}$ as the sum of all capacitors in the array, the ideal value of $\\mathrm{C}_{1}$ is $\\mathrm{C}_{\\text {total }} / 2$. However, in practice, $\\mathrm{C}_{1}$ deviates from its ideal value, and thus, $\\mathrm{C}_{1}$ can be expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{C}_{1} \\equiv\\left(\\mathrm{C}_{\\text {total }} / 2\\right)+\\Delta \\mathrm{C}_{1} \\tag{17.28}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Delta \\mathrm{C}_{1}$ is the capacitance error (either positive or negative). Consequently, the simplified model shown in Fig. 17.12 (a) results after the switches are reversed.

One error correction technique used to achieve 16-bit linear converters is illustrated in Fig. 17.11 [Lee, 1984]. This method employs binary-weighted capacitors for the MSB array to determine the initial 10 bits.\nimage_name:Fig. 17.10\ndescription:A simplified model of a capacitor array during the sampling phase, used in a charge-redistribution A/D converter with error correction.\n\nFig. 17.10 Simplified model of a capacitor array during sampling.\nimage_name:Fig. 17.11\ndescription:A charge-redistribution A/D converter with error correction, featuring a capacitor array and a sub-dac for the last 6 bits. It includes a cal-dac for calibration to address non-monotonic behavior. The successive-approximation register, control, accumulator, and data register are key components.\n\nFig. 17.11 A charge-redistribution A/D converter with error correction.\n\nFor a 16-bit converter, the final 6 bits are determined using an additional capacitor and a resistor string known as a sub-dac. Although the combination of an MSB capacitor array and an LSB resistor string is not inherently monotonic, it can be easily autocalibrated at startup by adding a second resistor string called a cal-dac.\n\nCalibration involves measuring the errors of each capacitor, starting with the largest, calculating the necessary correction terms, and storing these terms in a data register as $\\mathrm{DV}_{\\mathrm{ei}}$. During regular successive approximation operations, when a specific capacitor is used, its error is canceled by adding the stored value in the data register to that in an accumulator register, which holds the sum of correction terms for all other capacitors connected to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {ref }}$. No correction terms are measured for the resistor sub-dac, as its accuracy is less critical since it only determines the remaining LSBs.\n\nThe error terms are determined starting with the MSB capacitor, $\\mathrm{C}_{1}$. It is connected to ground while all other capacitors are connected to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {ref }}$ as the comparator is reset. Then, the comparator is taken out of reset, all other capacitors are switched to ground, and $\\mathrm{C}_{1}$ is switched to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {ref }}$. Defining $\\mathrm{C}_{\\text {total }}$ as the sum of all capacitors in the array, the ideal value of $\\mathrm{C}_{1}$ is $\\mathrm{C}_{\\text {total }} / 2$. However, in practice, $\\mathrm{C}_{1}$ deviates from this ideal value, so $\\mathrm{C}_{1}$ can be expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{C}_{1} \\equiv\\left(\\mathrm{C}_{\\text {total }} / 2\\right)+\\Delta \\mathrm{C}_{1} \\tag{17.28}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Delta \\mathrm{C}_{1}$ is the capacitance error (positive or negative). Consequently, the simplified model shown in Fig. 17.12 (a) results after the switches are reversed.
