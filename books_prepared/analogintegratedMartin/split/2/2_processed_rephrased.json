    "text": "The initial stage in creating an integrated circuit involves producing a flawless, single-crystalline, lightly doped silicon wafer. To achieve this wafer, the process begins with the formation of metallurgical-grade silicon via a high-temperature chemical reaction in an electrode-arc furnace. Despite being approximately 98 percent pure, this silicon contains too many impurities for integrated circuit applications. Subsequently, a silicon-containing gas is generated and then reduced, leading to the deposition of pure silicon onto thin rods of single-crystalline silicon. However, this deposited electronic-grade silicon is polycrystalline. To obtain single-crystalline silicon, the material is melted again and allowed to cool, during which a single-crystalline ingot is gradually pulled and rotated from the molten silicon using the Czochralski technique. This method initiates with a single-crystal silicon seed, and the rate of pulling and rotation dictates the diameter of the resulting crystalline rod or ingot, typically ranging from 10 to 30 cm (4 to 12 inches) with lengths generally exceeding 1 meter. The production of a silicon ingot can span several days.\n\nKey Point: The initial step in fabricating an integrated circuit is to produce a single-crystalline silicon wafer, measuring 10 to 30 cm in diameter and approximately 1 mm thick. The silicon is either lightly doped or heavily doped with a thin, lightly-doped epitaxial layer on top, where the transistors are formed.\n\nTypically, heavily doped silicon is introduced to the melt prior to pulling the single-crystalline ingot. As the doped silicon diffuses through the molten silicon, a more lightly doped silicon ingot is produced. In our example, boron impurities are added to create a p-type ingot. The ingot is then sliced into wafers using a large diamond saw, with a typical wafer thickness of about 1 mm. After slicing, each wafer is polished with $\\mathrm{Al}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{3}$, chemically etched to eliminate mechanically damaged material, and subsequently fine-polished with $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ particles in an aqueous NaOH solution. Often, the company that manufactures the silicon wafers is different from the one that eventually patterns them into monolithic circuits.\n\nThere are two approaches to setting the background doping level of the surface silicon where all transistors will be fabricated. One method involves controlling the boron impurity levels in the ingot to achieve a $\\mathrm{p}^{-}$wafer concentration of around $\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{A}} \\cong 2 \\times 10^{21}$ donor $/ \\mathrm{m}^{3}$, resulting in a resistivity of 10 to $20 \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{~cm}$.

The alternative method involves starting with a very heavily doped $\\mathrm{p}^{++}$wafer with a low resistivity of around $0.01 \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{~cm}$. On this $\\mathrm{p}^{++}$wafer's surface, a layer of $\\mathrm{p}^{-}$silicon is grown, featuring a higher resistivity of 5 to $20 \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{~cm}$. All devices are constructed within this top epitaxial layer, which can range from 2 to $20 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ in thickness. Utilizing an epitaxial layer allows for more precise control over dopant concentrations, while the underlying $\\mathrm{p}^{++}$substrate provides a low-resistivity ground plane beneath the circuit, aiding in the prevention of latchup, as detailed in Section 2.2.4. In both scenarios, transistors are fabricated in $\\mathrm{p}^{-}$silicon near the wafer's surface."

    "text": "Photolithography is a method where specific parts of a silicon wafer are masked, allowing certain processing steps to be applied to the uncovered areas. While photolithography is integral throughout the production of an integrated circuit, this discussion focuses on its role in preparing the wafer for defining well regions. ${ }^{1}$\n\nThe process for selective well definition is as follows. Initially, a glass mask, $\\mathrm{M}_{1}$, is crafted, delineating the locations of the well regions. This mask is produced by coating it with photographic materials and exposing it to an electron beam, or e beam, in the areas corresponding to the well locations. This exposure renders the well regions on the mask opaque, effectively creating a negative image of one microcircuit layer. Typically, a microcircuit process might require ten to twenty distinct masks, with costs varying significantly based on the smallest feature sizes to be patterned. For instance, a set of masks for a $0.35-\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ CMOS process might cost around $\\$ 30,000$, while masks for the most advanced processes can approach $\\$ 1,000,000$. Due to the precision needed, these masks are often made by a different company than the one processing the integrated circuit. The electron beam's creation of opaque mask regions is guided by a computer using a database derived from the designer's layout, created via computer-aided design (CAD) software.\n\nThe initial step in wafer masking involves thermally growing a thin silicon-dioxide $\\left(\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}\\right)$ layer to protect the microcircuit surface, with details discussed later. Over this $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ layer, a negative photoresist, $\\mathrm{PR}_{1}$, is evenly applied to a thickness of about $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ while the microcircuit spins. Photoresist is a light-sensitive polymer akin to latex. Next, the mask $\\mathrm{M}_{1}$ is positioned near the wafer, and ultraviolet light is projected through it onto the photoresist. Where the light hits, the polymers crosslink or polymerize, making these regions resistant to an organic solvent. This step is depicted in Fig. 2.1.\n\n[^7]Ultraviolet light\nimage_name:Fig. 2.1\ndescription:The image labeled \"Fig. 2.1\" depicts the selective hardening of a photoresist region using a glass mask in microcircuit fabrication. The diagram provides a cross-sectional view of the involved components.\n\n1. **Identification of Components and Structure:**\n- **Glass Mask:** The top layer, identified as a glass mask, features both opaque and translucent regions. The opaque areas block UV light, while the translucent areas allow it to pass.\n- **Photoresist Layer (PR1):** Below the mask is a photoresist layer sensitive to UV light, where selective hardening occurs.\n- **Silicon Dioxide (SiO2) Layer:** Beneath the photoresist is a silicon dioxide layer, part of the substrate structure.\n- **Substrate (p-):** The bottom layer is marked as p-, indicating a semiconductor substrate type.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- **UV Light Exposure:** Arrows indicate the UV light path, passing through the mask's translucent regions and striking the photoresist, causing hardened polymerization in exposed areas.\n- **Opaque Regions:** These mask regions block UV light from reaching parts of the photoresist, keeping them soluble to later solvent use.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- Labels like \"Opaque region,\" \"Translucent region,\" \"Glass mask,\" \"Hardened photoresist, PR1,\" and \"SiO2\" aid in understanding the process components.\n- Arrows showing UV light direction and interaction with the photoresist are crucial for grasping selective hardening.\n\nOverall, this diagram effectively illustrates using a glass mask to selectively harden specific photoresist regions on a microcircuit wafer by controlling UV light exposure.\n\nFig. 2.1 Selectively hardening a region of photoresist using a glass mask.\nAreas where the mask is opaque (the well regions) remain unexposed. The photoresist in these areas is removed using an organic solvent. Subsequently, the remaining photoresist is baked to harden it. After removing the photoresist in the well regions, the exposed $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ may also be etched away with acid (though in some thin-layer processes, it may not be removed). Following this, dopants necessary for well formation are introduced into the silicon via diffusion or ion implantation (directly through the thin oxide if not removed).\n\nThe described procedure uses a negative photoresist, where the exposed photoresist remains post-masking. Positive photoresists also exist, where the exposed photoresist dissolves in organic solvents, leaving photoresist where the mask was opaque. Using both positive and negative resists, a single mask can sometimes serve two steps: first, protecting one region and implanting the complementary region, and second, protecting the complementary region and implanting the original region.\n\nThe feature sizes achievable with photolithography are influenced by the light wavelength used. When circuit features are smaller than the light wavelength (currently 193-nm ultraviolet light), light's wave nature results in photoresist patterns that don't perfectly match the mask. These effects can be partially mitigated by adjusting the mask pattern to better align with the intended designer geometries, a technique known as \"optical proximity correction,\" commonly used for features below 100 nm. Further enhancements have been achieved by immersing the photolithography in a liquid bath, altering the light path for improved resolution and substrate unevenness tolerance. Efforts continue to reduce minimum feature sizes by using shorter photolithography wavelengths (extreme ultraviolet light or even X-rays).\n\nKey Point: Most integrated circuit features are patterned using photolithography, where light passes through a mask to create patterns on the silicon wafer, defining the circuit's physical features like transistor sizes and wiring."

    "text": "Photolithography is a technique where specific areas of a silicon wafer are masked, allowing processing steps to be applied to the unmasked regions. While photolithography is integral throughout the production of integrated circuits, this explanation focuses on its role in preparing the wafer for defining well regions. ${ }^{1}$\n\nThe process for selective well definition is as follows. Initially, a glass mask, $\\mathrm{M}_{1}$, is crafted to specify the locations of the well regions. This mask is made by coating it with photographic materials and exposing it to an electron beam (e beam) in the areas corresponding to the well locations, causing these regions to become opaque or dark. Consequently, the glass mask can be viewed as a negative of one microcircuit layer. Typically, a microcircuit process might require ten to twenty different masks, with costs varying significantly based on the smallest feature sizes to be patterned. For instance, a set of masks for a $0.35-\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ CMOS process might cost around $\\$ 30,000$, while masks for the most advanced processes can approach $\\$ 1,000,000$. Due to the high precision needed, these masks are often, but not always, produced by a company other than the integrated circuit processor. The creation of the mask's opaque regions via the electron beam is guided by a computer using a database derived from the designer's layout, created with computer-aided design (CAD) software.\n\nThe initial step in masking the wafer surface involves thermally growing a thin silicon-dioxide ($\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$) layer to protect the microcircuit surface, a process detailed later. Over this $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ layer, a negative photoresist, $\\mathrm{PR}_{1}$, is uniformly applied to a thickness of about $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ while the microcircuit spins. Photoresist is a light-sensitive polymer akin to latex. Next, the mask $\\mathrm{M}_{1}$ is positioned close to the wafer, and ultraviolet light is projected through the mask onto the photoresist. Where the light hits, the polymers crosslink or polymerize, rendering these regions insoluble to an organic solvent. This step is depicted in Fig. 2.1.\n\n[^7]Ultraviolet light\nimage_name:Fig. 2.1\ndescription:The image labeled \"Fig. 2.1\" depicts the selective hardening of a photoresist region using a glass mask in microcircuit fabrication, shown in a cross-sectional view.\n\n1. **Identification of Components and Structure:**\n- **Glass Mask:** The top layer, a glass mask with opaque and translucent regions, blocks or allows UV light passage.\n- **Photoresist Layer (PR1):** Below the mask, a UV-sensitive photoresist layer undergoes selective hardening.\n- **Silicon Dioxide (SiO2) Layer:** Beneath the photoresist, a silicon dioxide layer forms part of the substrate.\n- **Substrate (p-):** The bottom layer, labeled p-, is a semiconductor substrate type.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- **UV Light Exposure:** Arrows indicate UV light passing through the mask's translucent regions, hardening the photoresist upon contact.\n- **Opaque Regions:** These mask regions block UV light, keeping corresponding photoresist areas soluble to later solvent treatment.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- Labels like \"Opaque region,\" \"Translucent region,\" \"Glass mask,\" \"Hardened photoresist, PR1,\" and \"SiO2\" clarify the process components.\n- Arrows showing UV light direction and interaction with the photoresist are crucial for understanding selective hardening.\n\nOverall, the diagram effectively illustrates how a glass mask controls UV light exposure to selectively harden photoresist regions on a microcircuit wafer.\n\nFig. 2.1 Selectively hardening a region of photoresist using a glass mask.\nRegions where the mask is opaque (the well regions) remain unexposed.

    "text": "Once the photoresist covering the well region is eliminated, the subsequent step involves introducing dopants through the exposed area where the well region will be situated. There are two primary methods for this dopant introduction: diffusion and ion implantation.\n\nIn both implantation techniques, the initial step typically involves removing the $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ in the well region using an acid etch. Following this, the remaining hardened photoresist is stripped away with acetone. This process leaves behind $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ that was protected by the hardened photoresist, effectively masking all nonwell (i.e., substrate) regions.\n\nFor diffusion implantation, the wafers are placed within a quartz tube inside a heated furnace. A dopant-containing gas is then introduced into the tube. When forming an n well, the dopant in the gas is usually phosphorus, although arsenic can also be used, albeit requiring a longer diffusion time. The high temperatures of the diffusion furnace, ranging from 900 to $1100^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, facilitate the vertical and horizontal diffusion of dopants into the silicon. The dopant concentration is highest at the surface and decreases according to a Gaussian profile deeper into the silicon. If a $p$ well is desired, boron is employed as the dopant. The resulting cross section after diffusing the n well is depicted in Fig. 2.2.\n\nAn alternative method for introducing dopants into the silicon wafer is ion implantation. This technique has largely supplanted diffusion due to its superior control over dopant concentration and the thickness of the doped region. In ion implantation, dopants are introduced as ions into the wafer, as illustrated in the functional representation of an ion implanter in Fig. 2.3. Ions are generated by bombarding a gas with electrons from an arc-discharge or cold-cathode source. These ions are then focused and passed through a mass separator, which bends the ion beam and directs it through a narrow slit, purifying the beam. The beam is refocused and accelerated to energies between 10 keV and 1 MeV, with ion currents ranging from $10 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$ to 2 mA. Deflection plates sweep the beam across the wafer, which may also be rotated, and the acceleration potential determines the implantation depth. The beam current and implantation duration dictate the dosage, allowing independent control of depth and dosage. Two issues associated with ion implantation are lattice damage and a narrow doping profile. Lattice damage arises from nuclear collisions displacing substrate atoms, while the narrow profile results in high concentrations over a limited depth, as shown in Fig. 2.4. For instance, arsenic ions accelerated at 100 keV may penetrate about $0.06 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ into silicon, with most ions concentrated within $0.06 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\pm 0.02 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$.

This thermal vibration of atoms allows bonds to reform, broadening the dopant concentration profile for more uniform doping levels, as shown in Fig. 2.4. Note that annealing is performed once during processing, after all implantation steps but before creating any metal layers.\n\nFor n-type dopants, arsenic is used for shallow implantations like source or drain junctions, while phosphorus might be used for wells. Boron is always used for forming p regions.\n\nDespite being more costly, ion implantation has largely replaced diffusion for forming n and p regions due to its superior doping control. Another key advantage is the minimal sideways diffusion, enabling closer device spacing and reducing overlap between gate-source or gate-drain regions in MOS transistors.\n\nThe graph in Fig. 2.4 plots dopant profiles after ion implantation, both before and after annealing. The x-axis represents \"Depth into silicon wafer\" and the y-axis \"Ion dopant concentration,\" with qualitative rather than quantitative units.\n\nThe graph includes two curves: a solid line for the pre-annealing dopant concentration and a dashed line for post-annealing. Before annealing, the concentration rises steeply from the surface, peaks, and then decreases gradually, indicating high surface concentration diminishing with depth. After annealing, the dashed curve shows a broader profile with a lower peak concentration at a slightly greater depth, reflecting more uniform dopant distribution due to annealing.\n\nThis behavior is typical in semiconductor processing, where annealing activates dopants and repairs implantation damage.\n\nFig. 2.4 Dopant profiles after ion implantation both before and after annealing.\n\n[^8]In some modern processes, both p and n wells are created for fabricating NMOS and PMOS devices, respectively, known as a twin-well process."

In ion implantation, dopants are introduced as ions into the wafer, as illustrated in the functional representation of an ion implanter in Fig. 2.3. The ions are generated by bombarding a gas with electrons from an arc-discharge or cold-cathode source, then focused and passed through a mass separator. This separator bends the ion beam, allowing only ions of a specific mass to pass through a narrow slit, thus purifying the beam.

    "text": "Parasitic transistors form across a silicon die wherever a conductor overlies the junction regions of different transistors. If the voltage on a conductor nears the threshold of a subjacent parasitic transistor, unwanted leakage currents may flow between transistors meant to be isolated. To avert this, additional processing steps are employed to ensure these parasitic transistors cannot conduct significant current. Two widely used isolation techniques are local oxidation of silicon (LOCOS) and shallow-trench isolation (STI).\n\nimage_name:Fig. 2.5\ndescription:The image labeled \"Fig. 2.5\" presents a cross-sectional view of a silicon wafer post-oxide definition (OD) patterning, illustrating the Local Oxidation of Silicon (LOCOS) process.\n\n1. **Identification of Components and Structure:**\n- The diagram displays a silicon substrate featuring an \"n well\" region, a doped area designed to host transistors or other semiconductor devices.\n- Above the n well, layers of silicon dioxide (SiO₂) and silicon nitride (Si₃N₄) are visible. The SiO₂ layer, depicted as a thick, shaded area, acts as a field oxide, providing electrical isolation across the wafer.\n- The Si₃N₄ layer is shown as a thin, solid line atop the SiO₂, serving as a mask during oxidation.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- The Si₃N₄ layer controls the oxidation process, defining areas where the SiO₂ layer should not grow.\n- The interaction between Si₃N₄ and SiO₂ is pivotal for LOCOS, as the nitride layer prevents oxidation in specific regions, enabling precise oxide patterning.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- The diagram includes labels for the Si₃N₄ and SiO₂ layers and the n well region, clarifying material composition and structure.\n- The cross-section highlights the field oxide's role in isolating wafer components, crucial for preventing transistor leakage currents.\n\nOverall, the image showcases the LOCOS process, emphasizing the roles of Si₃N₄ and SiO₂ in defining and isolating regions on a silicon wafer to prevent unwanted electrical interactions.\n\n$\\mathrm{p}^{-}$\n\nFig. 2.5 The cross section of the wafer after the oxide definition (OD) regions are patterned.\n\n#### Local Oxidation of Silicon (LOCOS)\n\nLOCOS processing includes the implantation of additional dopants (field-implants) between transistors to ensure parasitic transistors have a high threshold voltage, followed by the creation of thick SiO₂ (field-oxide) layers over the field-implants.\n\nInitially, field-implants are introduced beneath where the field-oxide will grow. For instance, boron is implanted under the field-oxide everywhere except in the n well regions. This implant ensures the silicon under the field-oxide does not invert when a conductor above has a high voltage. For field-oxide in well regions, where p-channel transistors will be located, an n-type implant like arsenic (As) might be used. Often, field-implants under the well region's field-oxide are unnecessary due to the well's heavier doping, which prevents silicon inversion under the field-oxide.\n\nWhen implanting field-implants in the substrate, the wells must first be covered with a protective photoresist, $\\mathrm{PR}_{3}$, to prevent n-well regions from receiving the p-implant. This is achieved using the same mask, $\\mathrm{M}_{1}$, originally used for n-well implantation, but with a positive photoresist that remains in opaque mask areas (i.e., well regions).\n\nAfter dissolving the exposed photoresist, the cross-section in Fig. 2.6 is obtained. Note that all active regions, where transistors will eventually reside, are protected from field-implants by $\\mathrm{Si}_{3} \\mathrm{~N}_{4}$ and $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$. Additionally, the entire well regions are shielded by $\\mathrm{PR}_{3}$. The field-implant is a high-energy, high-doping-level implant. Before growing the field-oxide, $\\mathrm{PR}_{3}$ is removed, leaving the silicon-nitride-silicon-dioxide sandwich intact.\n\nNext, the field-oxide, $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$, is grown. There are two methods for growing $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$. In a wet process, water vapor is introduced over the surface at high temperatures. The water vapor diffuses into the silicon and reacts as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{Si}+2 \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{SiO}_{2}+2 \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\tag{2.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn a dry process, oxygen is introduced over the wafer at a higher temperature than the wet process, reacting as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{Si}+\\mathrm{O}_{2} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{SiO}_{2} \\tag{2.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nimage_name:Fig. 2.6 The cross section when the field-implants are being formed in a LOCOS process.\ndescription:The image labeled \"Fig. 2.6 The cross section when the field-implants are being formed in a LOCOS process\" depicts a cross-sectional view of a semiconductor wafer during the LOCOS process, specifically during field-implant formation.\n\n1. **Identification of Components and Structure:**\n- **Si$_3$N$_4$ (Silicon Nitride) Layer:** This layer is atop the wafer, defining oxidation areas and acting as a mask to prevent oxidation in specific regions.\n- **PR$_3$ (Photoresist):** Applied over the silicon nitride, this layer is used for patterning the nitride during photolithography.\n- **n well:** The diagram shows an n-type well within the silicon substrate, indicating a region doped with n-type impurities.\n- **SiO$_2$ (Silicon Dioxide):** This field oxide layer is being formed in the LOCOS process.\n- **Field-implants:** Shaded regions in the substrate where dopants like boron are implanted to create p-type regions for electrical isolation.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- Boron ions are shown being implanted vertically into the substrate, indicated by arrows.\n- Field-implants are strategically placed to isolate different device areas on the silicon wafer.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- **Boron ions:** Labels indicate the presence of boron ions, used as p-type dopants.\n- **Field-implants:** Areas with field-implants are marked, showing boron ion introduction.\n- Symbols like plus signs indicate the positive charge of boron ions.\n\nOverall, this cross-section illustrates the early stages of the LOCOS process, focusing on field-implant formation for electrical isolation in integrated circuits.\n\n$\\mathrm{p}^{-}$\n\nFig. 2.6 The cross section when the field-implants are being formed in a LOCOS process.\nimage_name:Fig. 2.6 The cross section when the field-implants are being formed in a LOCOS process.\ndescription:The image shows a cross-sectional view of a semiconductor structure during field-implant formation in the LOCOS process, a critical step in integrated circuit fabrication for electrical isolation.\n\n1. **Identification of Components and Structure:**\n- The substrate features an 'n well' region, a doped area within the silicon.\n- Layers of silicon nitride (Si₃N₄) and silicon dioxide (SiO₂) are essential in the LOCOS process.\n- Field-oxide regions are shown as thicker sections above the substrate, indicating oxidation sites.\n- p⁺ field-implants are marked, showing regions with boron ions for electrical isolation.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- Si₃N₄ acts as a mask to prevent oxidation in certain areas, allowing selective field-oxide growth.\n- SiO₂ is a thin oxide layer beneath the nitride, aiding oxidation and protecting the silicon.\n- p⁺ field-implants are strategically placed to enhance isolation by introducing positive charges.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- Labels for Si₃N₄, SiO₂, field-oxide, and p⁺ field-implants clarify each component.\n- The n well is labeled, showing the doped region's boundary.\n- Arrows indicate boron ion implantation and oxidation areas.\n\nOverall, the diagram illustrates the early stages of the LOCOS process, highlighting field-implant formation and the role of various materials in achieving electrical isolation.\n\n$\\mathrm{p}^{-}$\n\nFig. 2.7 The cross section after the field-oxide has been grown in a LOCOS process.\n\nSince both processes occur at high temperatures (around 800 to $1200^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$), the resulting oxide is often termed a thermal oxide.\n\nThe field oxide does not grow where CVD-deposited $\\mathrm{Si}_{3} \\mathrm{~N}_{4}$ remains, as $\\mathrm{Si}_{3} \\mathrm{~N}_{4}$ is relatively inert to water and oxygen. Where oxidation occurs, the volume increases due to added oxygen atoms. Specifically, $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ occupies approximately 2.2 times the volume of the original silicon, extending about 45 percent into and 55 percent above the original silicon surface. The resulting cross section is shown in Fig. 2.7. Note that in this example, the substrate's field-oxide has field-implants beneath it, while the well regions' field-oxide does not.\n\nIn thermal $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ growth, the wet process is faster due to $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$'s faster diffusion in silicon, but the dry process yields denser, higher-quality $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ with less porosity. Sometimes, field-oxide growth starts with a dry process, switches to a wet process, and finishes with a dry process. For thin $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ layers, usually only a dry process is used.\n\nLOCOS is preferred for transistor isolation when feature sizes exceed $0.25 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$. For smaller sizes, the rounded corners of the field-oxide occupy too much space, necessitating improved isolation techniques.\n\n#### Shallow-Trench Isolation (STI)\n\nimage_name:Fig. 2.8\ndescription:The image labeled as Fig. 2.8 illustrates a cross-sectional view of a silicon wafer using shallow-trench isolation (STI) for transistor isolation. The diagram highlights several key components and structures:\n\n1. **Silicon Substrate:** The base layer is a p-type silicon substrate, labeled 'p−', forming the foundation for other structures.\n2. **N Well:** An n-type well within the p-type substrate is depicted, crucial for forming active transistor regions.\n3. **Trenches:** The image features trenches etched into the silicon substrate, a defining feature of STI for isolating transistor regions.\n4. **SiO₂ Layer:** The trenches are filled with silicon dioxide (SiO₂), providing electrical isolation between active regions.\n5. **Si₃N₄ Layer:** A silicon nitride (Si₃N₄) layer is shown on the wafer surface, used to define trench locations during etching.\n6. **Connections and Interactions:** The diagram focuses on physical isolation structures, not showing explicit electrical connections. The SiO₂-filled trenches prevent electrical interference between adjacent transistors.\n7. **Labels and Annotations:** Labels for Si₃N₄, SiO₂, n well, and p-type substrate clarify the materials and regions involved in the STI process.\n\nOverall, the cross-section demonstrates how STI effectively isolates transistors in an integrated circuit using oxide-filled trenches.\n\nFig. 2.8 The resulting wafer cross section when shallow-trench isolation (STI) is used between transistors.\n\nSTI involves etching trenches into the silicon substrate between active regions and filling them with oxide. Like LOCOS, the trench locations are defined by a $\\mathrm{Si}_{3} \\mathrm{~N}_{4}$ layer. The trench-filling process is two-step: first, a thin $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ layer is thermally grown to line the trenches; then, additional oxide is deposited over the wafer, filling the trenches and creating an uneven surface. Finally, the top surface is polished for planarization. These steps occur early in the process flow, before well definition. An example cross-section using STI instead of LOCOS is shown in Fig. 2.8. STI provides effective isolation even for closely spaced transistors and is widely used. However, it involves more steps than LOCOS, making it more expensive. Additionally, trench creation and filling strain the wafer's lattice structure, affecting nearby transistors' electrical characteristics."

Two widely-used isolation techniques are local oxidation of silicon (LOCOS) and shallow-trench isolation (STI).\n\nimage_name:Fig. 2.5\ndescription:The image titled \"Fig. 2.5\" presents a cross-sectional view of a silicon wafer post-oxide definition (OD) patterning, illustrating the Local Oxidation of Silicon (LOCOS) process.\n\n1. **Identification of Components and Structure:**\n- The diagram displays a silicon substrate with an \"n well\" region, a doped area designated for hosting transistors or other semiconductor devices.\n- Overlaying the n well are layers of silicon dioxide (SiO₂) and silicon nitride (Si₃N₄). The SiO₂ layer, depicted as a thick, shaded region, serves as a field oxide, providing electrical isolation across different wafer areas.\n- The Si₃N₄ layer is shown as a thin, solid line atop the SiO₂, acting as a mask during oxidation.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- The Si₃N₄ layer defines regions where oxidation should be inhibited, thereby controlling SiO₂ growth.\n- The interaction between Si₃N₄ and SiO₂ is pivotal for LOCOS, as the nitride layer prevents oxidation in specific areas, enabling precise oxide patterning.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- Labels for the Si₃N₄ and SiO₂ layers, as well as the n well region, are included, clarifying material composition and structure.\n- The cross-section underscores the importance of the field oxide in isolating wafer components, crucial for preventing transistor leakage currents.\n\nOverall, the image depicts the LOCOS process, highlighting the roles of Si₃N₄ and SiO₂ in defining and isolating regions on a silicon wafer to prevent undesired electrical interactions.\n\n$\\mathrm{p}^{-}$\n\nFig. 2.5 The cross section of the wafer after the oxide definition (OD) regions are patterned.\n\n#### Local Oxidation of Silicon (LOCOS)\n\nLOCOS processing includes the implantation of additional dopants (field-implants) between transistors to ensure parasitic transistors have a high threshold voltage, followed by the creation of thick SiO₂ layers (field-oxide) over the field-implants.\n\nInitially, field-implants are introduced beneath where the field-oxide will grow. For instance, boron is implanted beneath the field-oxide everywhere except in the n well regions. This implant ensures the silicon under the field-oxide does not invert (become n-type) when a conductor above has a high voltage. For field-oxide in well regions, where p-channel transistors will be placed, an n-type implant like arsenic (As) might be used. Often, field-implants are unnecessary under the field-oxide of well regions due to the higher doping of the well, which typically prevents silicon inversion under the field-oxide.\n\nWhen implanting field-implants in substrate regions, it's essential to first cover the wells with protective photoresist, $\\mathrm{PR}_{3}$, to prevent n-well regions from receiving the p-implant. This is achieved using the same mask, $\\mathrm{M}_{1}$, originally used for n-well implantation, but with a positive photoresist that remains in opaque (dark) mask areas, corresponding to the well regions.\n\nAfter dissolving the exposed photoresist, the cross-section shown in Fig. 2.6 is obtained. Note that at this stage, all active regions, where transistors will eventually be placed, are protected from field implants by $\\mathrm{Si}_{3} \\mathrm{~N}_{4}$ and $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$. Additionally, the entire well regions are protected by $\\mathrm{PR}_{3}$. The field-implant involves a high-energy, high-doping-level implant. Before growing the field-oxide, $\\mathrm{PR}_{3}$ is removed, but the silicon-nitride-silicon-dioxide layer remains.\n\nNext, the field-oxide, $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$, is grown. There are two methods for growing $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$. In a wet process, water vapor is introduced over the surface at a moderately high temperature. The water vapor diffuses into the silicon and, through intermediate steps, reacts as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{Si}+2 \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{SiO}_{2}+2 \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\tag{2.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn a dry process, oxygen is introduced over the wafer, typically at a higher temperature than the wet process, reacting as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{Si}+\\mathrm{O}_{2} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{SiO}_{2} \\tag{2.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nimage_name:Fig. 2.6 The cross section when the field-implants are being formed in a LOCOS process.\ndescription:The image labeled \"Fig. 2.6 The cross section when the field-implants are being formed in a LOCOS process\" shows a cross-sectional view of a semiconductor wafer during the LOCOS process, specifically during field-implant formation.\n\n1. **Identification of Components and Structure:**\n- **Si₃N₄ (Silicon Nitride) Layer:** This layer atop the wafer defines oxidation areas and acts as a mask to prevent oxidation in specific regions.\n- **PR₃ (Photoresist):** A photoresist layer applied over the silicon nitride is used for patterning the nitride layer during photolithography.\n- **n well:** The diagram indicates an n-type well within the silicon substrate, a region doped with n-type impurities.\n- **SiO₂ (Silicon Dioxide):** This field oxide layer forms during the LOCOS process.\n- **Field-implants:** Shaded regions in the substrate represent dopant implants (e.g., boron) to create p-type regions for electrical isolation.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- Boron ions are implanted vertically into the substrate, as indicated by arrows.\n- Field-implants are strategically placed to isolate different device areas on the silicon wafer.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- Labels for boron ions, field-implants, and other components are included for clarity.\n- Symbols like plus signs indicate the positive charge of boron ions.\n\nOverall, the diagram illustrates the early stages of the LOCOS process, focusing on field-implant formation for electrical isolation in integrated circuits.\n\n$\\mathrm{p}^{-}$\n\nFig. 2.6 The cross section when the field-implants are being formed in a LOCOS process.\nimage_name:Fig. 2.6 The cross section when the field-implants are being formed in a LOCOS process.\ndescription:This image depicts a cross-sectional view of a semiconductor structure during field-implant formation in the LOCOS process, a critical step in integrated circuit fabrication for electrical isolation.\n\n1. **Identification of Components and Structure:**\n- The substrate features an 'n well' region, a doped area within the silicon.\n- Layers of silicon nitride (Si₃N₄) and silicon dioxide (SiO₂) are essential in the LOCOS process.\n- Field-oxide regions are shown as thicker sections above the substrate, indicating where oxidation has occurred.\n- p⁺ field-implants are marked, showing regions where boron ions have been introduced for electrical isolation.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- The Si₃N₄ layer acts as a mask to prevent oxidation in certain areas, allowing selective field-oxide growth.\n- The SiO₂ layer beneath the nitride aids in oxidation and protects the silicon.\n- p⁺ field-implants are strategically placed to enhance isolation by introducing positive charges into the substrate.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- Labels for Si₃N₄, SiO₂, field-oxide, and p⁺ field-implants are included.\n- The n well is clearly marked, showing the doped region's boundary.\n- Arrows indicate the direction of boron ion implantation and affected oxidation areas.\n\nOverall, the diagram effectively illustrates the early stages of the LOCOS process, emphasizing field-implant formation and the roles of various materials in achieving electrical isolation.\n\n$\\mathrm{p}^{-}$\n\nFig. 2.7 The cross section after the field-oxide has been grown in a LOCOS process.\n\nSince both processes occur at high temperatures (around 800 to 1200°C), the resulting oxide is often called a thermal oxide.\n\nThe field oxide does not grow where CVD-deposited Si₃N₄ remains, as Si₃N₄ is relatively inert to water and oxygen. Where oxidation occurs, the volume increases due to added oxygen atoms. Specifically, SiO₂ occupies approximately 2.2 times the volume of the original silicon, extending about 45 percent into and 55 percent above the previous silicon surface. The resulting cross-section is shown in Fig. 2.7. Note that in this example, the field-oxide in the substrate region has underlying field-implants, while the field-oxide in the wells does not.\n\nWhen growing thermal SiO₂, the wet process is faster due to quicker $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ diffusion in silicon, but the dry process yields denser, higher-quality SiO₂ with less porosity. Sometimes, field-oxide growth starts with a dry process, switches to a wet process, and finishes with a dry process. For thin SiO₂ layers, usually only a dry process is used.\n\nLOCOS is preferred for transistor isolation when feature sizes exceed 0.25 μm. At smaller sizes, the rounded corners of the field-oxide occupy too much space, necessitating improved isolation techniques.\n\n#### Shallow-Trench Isolation (STI)\n\nimage_name:Fig. 2.8\ndescription:The image labeled \"Fig. 2.8\" illustrates a cross-sectional view of a silicon wafer using shallow-trench isolation (STI) for transistor isolation. Key components and structures are depicted:\n\n1. **Silicon Substrate:** The base layer is a p-type silicon substrate, labeled 'p−', forming the foundation for other structures.\n2. **N Well:** An n-type well within the p-type substrate is shown, crucial for forming transistor active regions.\n3. **Trenches:** Etched trenches in the silicon substrate are a defining feature of STI, used for isolating different transistor regions.\n4. **SiO₂ Layer:** The trenches are filled with silicon dioxide (SiO₂), providing electrical isolation between active regions.\n5. **Si₃N₄ Layer:** A silicon nitride (Si₃N₄) layer on the wafer surface defines trench locations during etching.\n6. **Connections and Interactions:** The diagram focuses on physical isolation structures, with the SiO₂-filled trenches preventing electrical interference between adjacent transistors.\n7. **Labels and Annotations:** Labels for Si₃N₄, SiO₂, n well, and p-type substrate are included for clarity.\n\nOverall, the cross-section demonstrates how STI achieves effective transistor isolation in integrated circuits using oxide-filled trenches.\n\nFig. 2.8 The resulting wafer cross section when shallow-trench isolation (STI) is used between transistors.\n\nSTI involves etching trenches into the silicon substrate between active regions and filling them with oxide. Similar to LOCOS, trench locations are defined by a Si₃N₄ layer. The trench-filling process is two-step: first, a thin SiO₂ layer is thermally grown to line the trenches; then, additional oxide is deposited over the wafer, filling the trenches and creating an uneven surface. Finally, the top surface is polished to planarize it for further processing. These steps occur early in the process flow, before well definition. An example cross-section using STI instead of LOCOS is shown in Fig. 2.8. STI provides effective isolation even for closely spaced transistors and is widely used. However, it involves more steps than LOCOS, making it more expensive. Additionally, trench creation and filling strain the silicon lattice, affecting nearby transistor electrical characteristics."

Should the electrical potential on a conductor near the threshold voltage of an underlying parasitic transistor, unwanted leakage currents may flow between transistors meant to be isolated. To avert this, additional processing is undertaken to ensure these parasitic transistors cannot conduct significant current. Two widely used isolation techniques are local oxidation of silicon (LOCOS) and shallow-trench isolation (STI).\n\nimage_name:Fig. 2.5\ndescription:Figure 2.5 presents a cross-sectional view of a silicon wafer post-oxide definition (OD) patterning, illustrating the LOCOS process.\n\n1. **Component Identification and Structure:**\n- The diagram features a silicon substrate with an \"n well\" region, a doped area for hosting transistors or semiconductor devices.\n- Above the n well, layers of silicon dioxide (SiO₂) and silicon nitride (Si₃N₄) are depicted. The SiO₂ layer, shown as a thick shaded region, acts as a field oxide, providing electrical isolation across the wafer.\n- The Si₃N₄ layer, represented by a thin solid line atop the SiO₂, serves as a mask during oxidation.\n\n2. **Interconnections and Interactions:**\n- The Si₃N₄ layer defines oxidation-free zones, controlling SiO₂ growth.\n- The interaction between Si₃N₄ and SiO₂ is pivotal for LOCOS, as the nitride layer prevents oxidation in specific areas, enabling precise oxide patterning.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- The diagram labels the Si₃N₄ and SiO₂ layers and the n well region, clarifying material composition and structure.\n- The cross-section highlights the field oxide's role in isolating wafer components, crucial for preventing transistor leakage currents.\n\nOverall, the image showcases the LOCOS process, emphasizing the roles of Si₃N₄ and SiO₂ in defining and isolating wafer regions to prevent unwanted electrical interactions.\n\n$\\mathrm{p}^{-}$\n\nFig. 2.5 The cross section of the wafer post-oxide definition (OD) patterning.\n\n#### Local Oxidation of Silicon (LOCOS)\n\nLOCOS processing includes implanting additional dopants (field-implants) between transistors to ensure parasitic transistors have a high threshold voltage, followed by creating thick SiO₂ (field-oxide) layers over the field-implants.\n\nInitially, field-implants are placed beneath the future field-oxide growth sites. For instance, boron is implanted under the field-oxide everywhere except the n well regions. This implant ensures the silicon under the field-oxide does not invert when a conductor above it carries a high voltage. For field-oxide in well regions, where p-channel transistors will be located, an n-type implant like arsenic (As) might be used. Often, field-implants are unnecessary under the well region field-oxide due to the well's heavier doping, which prevents silicon inversion under the field-oxide.\n\nWhen implanting field-implants in the substrate, the wells must first be covered with protective photoresist, $\\mathrm{PR}_{3}$, to prevent n-well regions from receiving the p-implant. This is achieved using the same mask, $\\mathrm{M}_{1}$, originally used for n-well implantation, but with a positive photoresist that remains in opaque mask areas, corresponding to the wells.\n\nAfter dissolving the exposed photoresist, the cross-section in Fig. 2.6 is obtained. Note that all active regions, where transistors will eventually reside, are protected from field implants by Si₃N₄ and SiO₂. Additionally, the entire well regions are shielded by $\\mathrm{PR}_{3}$. The field-implant involves a high-energy, high-doping-level implant. Before growing the field-oxide, $\\mathrm{PR}_{3}$ is removed, leaving the silicon-nitride-silicon-dioxide stack.\n\nThe next step is growing the field-oxide, SiO₂. There are two methods for SiO₂ growth. In the wet process, water vapor is introduced over the surface at a moderately high temperature. The water vapor diffuses into the silicon and, through intermediate steps, reacts as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{Si}+2 \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{SiO}_{2}+2 \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\tag{2.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn the dry process, oxygen is introduced over the wafer, typically at a higher temperature than the wet process, reacting as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{Si}+\\mathrm{O}_{2} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{SiO}_{2} \\tag{2.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nimage_name:Fig. 2.6 The cross section during field-implant formation in a LOCOS process.\ndescription:Figure 2.6 depicts a cross-sectional view of a semiconductor wafer during the LOCOS process, specifically when field implants are being formed.\n\n1. **Component Identification and Structure:**\n- **Si₃N₄ Layer:** A silicon nitride layer atop the wafer defines oxidation zones.\n- **PR₃ (Photoresist):** A photoresist layer over the silicon nitride, used for patterning the nitride during photolithography.\n- **n well:** An n-type well within the silicon substrate, indicating n-doped regions.\n- **SiO₂ Layer:** The field oxide layer being formed in the LOCOS process.\n- **Field-implants:** Shaded substrate regions where dopants (e.g., boron) are implanted for electrical isolation.\n\n2. **Interconnections and Interactions:**\n- Boron ions are implanted vertically into the substrate, as indicated by arrows.\n- Field-implants are strategically placed to isolate different device areas on the wafer.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- Labels for boron ions, field-implants, and other components clarify their presence and function.\n- Symbols like plus signs indicate the positive charge of boron ions.\n\nOverall, this cross-section illustrates the early LOCOS stages, focusing on field-implant formation for electrical isolation in integrated circuits.\n\n$\\mathrm{p}^{-}$\n\nFig. 2.6 The cross section during field-implant formation in a LOCOS process.\nimage_name:Fig. 2.6 The cross section during field-implant formation in a LOCOS process.\ndescription:This image shows a cross-sectional view of a semiconductor structure during field-implant formation in the LOCOS process, a critical step in integrated circuit fabrication for electrical isolation.\n\n1. **Component Identification and Structure:**\n- The diagram includes a substrate with an 'n well' region, a doped area within the silicon.\n- Layers of silicon nitride (Si₃N₄) and silicon dioxide (SiO₂) are essential in the LOCOS process.\n- Field-oxide regions are thicker, protruding sections above the substrate, indicating oxidation sites.\n- p⁺ field-implants are marked, showing boron ion-implanted areas for electrical isolation.\n\n2. **Interconnections and Interactions:**\n- The Si₃N₄ layer masks specific areas to prevent oxidation, allowing selective field-oxide growth.\n- The SiO₂ layer beneath the nitride aids in oxidation and protects the silicon.\n- p⁺ field-implants are strategically placed to enhance isolation by introducing positive charges.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- Labels for Si₃N₄, SiO₂, field-oxide, and p⁺ field-implants clearly mark each component.\n- The n well is labeled, showing the doped region boundary.\n- Arrows indicate boron ion implantation directions and affected oxidation areas.\n\nOverall, the diagram effectively illustrates the early LOCOS stages, emphasizing field-implant formation and material roles in achieving electrical isolation.\n\n$\\mathrm{p}^{-}$\n\nFig. 2.7 The cross section post-field-oxide growth in a LOCOS process.\n\nBoth wet and dry processes occur at high temperatures (around 800 to $1200^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$), resulting in what is sometimes termed thermal oxide.\n\nThe field oxide does not grow where CVD-deposited Si₃N₄ remains, as Si₃N₄ is relatively inert to water and oxygen. Where oxidation occurs, volume increases due to added oxygen atoms. Specifically, SiO₂ occupies approximately 2.2 times the original silicon volume. This expansion causes the SiO₂ to extend about 45 percent into and 55 percent above the original silicon surface. The resulting cross-section is shown in Fig. 2.7. Note that in our example, the substrate region's field-oxide has underlying field-implants, while the well regions' field-oxide does not.\n\nIn thermal SiO₂ growth, the wet process is faster due to quicker $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ diffusion in silicon, but the dry process yields denser, higher-quality SiO₂ with less porosity. Sometimes, field-oxide growth starts with a dry process, switches to wet, and finishes with dry. For thin SiO₂ layers, typically only a dry process is used.\n\nLOCOS is preferred for transistor isolation when feature sizes exceed $0.25 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$. At smaller sizes, the field-oxide's rounded corners occupy too much space, necessitating improved isolation techniques.\n\n#### Shallow-Trench Isolation (STI)\n\nimage_name:Fig. 2.8\ndescription:Figure 2.8 illustrates a cross-sectional view of a silicon wafer using STI for transistor isolation. The diagram highlights key components and structures:\n\n1. **Silicon Substrate:** The base layer is a p-type silicon substrate, labeled 'p−'.\n2. **N Well:** An n-type well within the p-type substrate, crucial for forming transistor active regions.\n3. **Trenches:** Etched trenches in the silicon substrate, a defining STI feature for isolating transistor regions.\n4. **SiO₂ Layer:** Trenches filled with silicon dioxide (SiO₂), providing electrical isolation.\n5. **Si₃N₄ Layer:** A silicon nitride layer on the wafer surface, defining trench locations during etching.\n6. **Interconnections and Interactions:** The diagram focuses on physical isolation structures, with the SiO₂-filled trenches preventing electrical interference between transistors.\n7. **Labels and Annotations:** Labels for Si₃N₄, SiO₂, n well, and p-type substrate clarify the materials and regions involved in STI.\n\nOverall, the cross-section demonstrates STI implementation for effective transistor isolation in integrated circuits using oxide-filled trenches.\n\nFig. 2.8 The wafer cross section with STI between transistors.\n\nSTI involves etching trenches into the silicon substrate between active regions and filling them with oxide. Like LOCOS, trench locations are defined by a Si₃N₄ layer. Trench filling is a two-step process: first, a thin SiO₂ layer is thermally grown to line the trenches; then, additional oxide is deposited over the wafer, filling the trenches and creating an uneven surface. Finally, the surface is polished to planarize it for further processing. These steps occur early in the process flow, before well definition. An example cross-section with STI instead of LOCOS is shown in Fig. 2.8. STI provides effective isolation even for closely spaced transistors and is widely used. However, it involves more steps than LOCOS, making it more expensive. Additionally, trench creation and filling strain the wafer's lattice structure, affecting nearby transistors' electrical characteristics."

Similar to the field-oxide in LOCOS, trench locations are defined by a $\\mathrm{Si}_{3} \\mathrm{~N}_{4}$ layer. The trench-filling process is two-step: first, a thin $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ layer is thermally grown to line the trenches; then, additional oxide is deposited over the entire wafer, filling the trenches and creating an uneven surface. Finally, the top surface is polished to planarize it for further processing. These steps are performed early in the process flow, before well definition. An example wafer cross-section using STI instead of LOCOS is shown in Fig. 2.8. STI provides effective isolation even for closely spaced transistors and is widely used. However, it requires more steps than LOCOS, making it more expensive. Additionally, trench creation and filling strain the wafer's lattice structure, impacting the electrical characteristics of nearby transistors."

    "text": "Once the initial layer of $\\mathrm{CVD} \\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ is deposited, the wafer undergoes annealing. As previously discussed in this section, annealing involves heating the wafer in an inert gas environment (such as nitrogen) for a duration (typically 15 to 30 minutes) at temperatures reaching $1000^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. This thermal treatment repairs lattice damage from ion implantations, spreads the dopant concentration profiles, and enhances the density of the deposited $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$.\n\nSubsequently, interconnect metal is applied across the wafer. Traditionally, aluminum (AI) has been the metal of choice for interconnects. However, alternative metals with lower diffusion rates into silicon during microcircuit operation are now used. Copper, for instance, is gaining popularity due to its lower resistivity, which is crucial for thin wires and those carrying high currents.

    "text": "In the process of creating a design layout, it's common for the designer to avoid manually generating the geometric patterns for all masks, as certain masks are typically generated automatically by the layout software. For instance, the masks used for the $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{n}^{+}$ regions that form the source and drain are usually produced automatically. Additionally, the layout software often allows designers to operate directly in the final dimensions they desire. The program then automatically adjusts the mask sizes to compensate for lateral diffusion or etching losses, resulting in masks that may be larger or smaller. For example, a designer might sketch a polysilicon line with the intention of creating a transistor with a $0.1-\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ length. The program could then generate a mask with a $0.12-\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ line width, accounting for junction overlap due to lateral diffusion and polysilicon loss from etching.\n\nIn contemporary layout software, pre-designed circuit cells are frequently stored in a library and can be parametrically resized and adapted during the overall layout process, with corresponding geometries for each layer being automatically generated. Often, as these cells are interconnected, the software may automatically position and route them. The designer can then make interactive adjustments to this automatically generated layout. Consequently, the layout process becomes increasingly automated as more cells are added to the library. However, the designer must maintain direct control over the layout of critical cells, particularly when miniaturization or high-speed circuit requirements are paramount. For example, it's uncommon to allow automatic generation of a memory cell layout where space and capacitive bus loading are crucial factors. Thus, a digital microcircuit designer must possess a thorough understanding of the design rules that dictate the necessary layout for the manufacturing process.\n\nThe two most critical masks are those defining the active (OD) region and the gate polysilicon. Where these two masks intersect determines the channel region of MOS transistors. Consider Figures 2.14(a) and 2.14(b), which depict a simplified MOS transistor and the corresponding layout of the active and polysilicon masks, respectively. In Figure 2.14(b), the polysilicon mask extends vertically, and the length of the polysilicon that intersects the active region determines the transistor width (W), while the width of the polysilicon line represents the transistor length (L).\n\nDesign rules for transistor layout are often defined in terms of $\\lambda$, which is half the minimum permissible gate length. This simplification allows many design rules to be universally expressed, independent of the specific minimum channel length (i.e., $2 \\lambda$). Figure 2.14(b) also shows the smallest possible transistor that can be fabricated in a given process when a contact must be made to each junction, along with various minimum dimensions expressed in terms of $\\lambda$.\n\nWhen we use $\\lambda$ to express design rules, we assume that each mask has a worst-case alignment error of less than $0.75 \\lambda$. This ensures that the relative misalignment between any two masks is less than $1.5 \\lambda$. To prevent destructive short circuits due to overlapping regions in a microcircuit, a separation of $2 \\lambda$ in the layout is required. For instance, in Figure 2.14(b), if the poly and contact masks overlap, the metal used to connect the source junction could short-circuit to the gate polysilicon, causing the transistor to be perpetually off. To avoid this, contact openings must be at least $2 \\lambda$ away from the polysilicon gates.\n\nAnother potential disaster due to misalignment is a gate that doesn't fully cover the active region, which could lead to a short circuit between the source and drain. To prevent this, the design rule dictates that polysilicon must always extend at least $2 \\lambda$ beyond the active region.\n\nAnother design rule states that active regions should encircle contacts by at least $1 \\lambda$. Even if there is an overlap between the active-region mask and the contact mask, no catastrophic short circuits will occur as long as there is sufficient overlap to ensure a good connection between the aluminum interconnect and the junction. Given the maximum relative misalignment of $1.5 \\lambda$, having the source (or drain) region encircle the contact by $1 \\lambda$ and ensuring a minimum contact width of $2 \\lambda$ guarantees an overlap of at least $1.5 \\lambda$.\n\nThese design rules are essential for estimating the minimum dimensions of a junction area and perimeter before a transistor layout is finalized. For instance, if a contact is to be made to a junction in Figure 2.14, the active region must extend beyond the polysilicon region by at least $5 \\lambda$. Therefore, the minimum area of a small junction with a contact is given by $A_{s}=A_{d}=5 \\lambda \\mathrm{~W}$, where W is the transistor width. Similarly, the perimeter of a junction with a contact is $P_{s}=P_{d}=10 \\lambda+W$. These estimates can be used to approximate parasitic capacitances in transistor models and in SPICE simulations for more accurate determination of these capacitances. However, they are rough estimates, and the actual layout may vary.\n\nThe key point is that finite tolerances during integrated circuit manufacturing impose constraints on the minimum sizes and spacing of transistor and interconnect features, expressed as multiples of $\\lambda$. These constraints affect parasitic capacitances and, ultimately, the circuit bandwidth that an analog designer can anticipate.\n\nTo minimize junction capacitance, a single junction can sometimes be shared between two transistors. For example, in the series connection of two transistors shown in Figure 2.16(a), the active, poly, and contact masks might be laid out as shown in Figure 2.16(b), where a single junction is shared between transistors $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$. This significantly reduces the area and perimeter compared to the estimates provided by equations (2.4) and (2.5). In a SPICE simulation, the area and perimeter should be divided by 2 when specified for each transistor, or all area and perimeter can be specified for one transistor and set to zero for the other, since the junction is shared.\n\nMinimizing the junction capacitance is crucial, and experienced designers prioritize identifying critical nodes and investigating layouts that reduce junction capacitance before laying out important high-speed cells.\n\nAdditional design rules are necessary, as illustrated by the layout of a digital inverter in Figure 2.17. The n-well must surround the p-channel active region and its $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$ junctions by at least $3 \\lambda$, and the minimum spacing between the n-well and n-channel transistor junctions in the substrate is $5 \\lambda$. These rules are crucial to prevent short circuits. A $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$-substrate tie can be closer to a well, typically $2 \\lambda$ away, as it is always connected to ground and separated from the well by a reverse-biased junction. Due to these spacing requirements, the closest an n-channel transistor can be placed to a p-channel transistor is $8 \\lambda$.\n\nIn Figure 2.17, metal is used to connect the junctions of the p-channel and n-channel transistors, and it must overlap any underlying contacts by at least $\\lambda$. A typical minimum width for the first-level metal might be $2 \\lambda$, the same as the minimum width for polysilicon, but it can be wider, as shown in Figure 2.17, where it is $4 \\lambda$ wide.\n\nA single contact opening, known as a butting contact, is used to connect both the p-channel transistor source and an $\\mathrm{n}^{+}$-well tie to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DD}}$. Under the contact, half will be doped $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$ (the p-channel junction) and half $\\mathrm{n}^{+}$ (the well tie). For the n-channel transistor, a butting contact connects the n-channel source to a $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$-substrate tie, both connected to ground. Design rules specify maximum distances between transistors and well (or substrate) ties and between substrate ties to prevent latch-up.\n\nAs a final example, the layout of a large transistor is described. Wide transistors are often composed of smaller transistors connected in parallel to reduce series gate resistance and junction capacitances, as shown in Figure 2.18(a). Figure 2.18(b) shows the corresponding circuit, and Figure 2.18(c) presents the same circuit redrawn to clarify the parallel transistor configuration. Node 1 has a smaller total junction area and perimeter than node 2, resulting in less junction capacitance. Therefore, node 1 should be connected to the more critical node in the circuit. Additionally, the use of multiple contacts minimizes voltage drops due to the higher resistivity of silicon junctions compared to the metal overlaying them.\n\nDesign rules also dictate the minimum pitch between polysilicon and metal interconnects, which might be $2 \\lambda, 2 \\lambda$, and $3 \\lambda$ for poly, metal 1, and metal 2, respectively. Metal 2 requires a larger minimum pitch due to its greater distance from the silicon surface. Minimum widths for poly, metal 1, and metal 2 might also be $2 \\lambda, 2 \\lambda$, and $3 \\lambda$, respectively.\n\nThis concludes the introduction to layout and design rules. In modern processes, many more design rules exist than those described. However, the rationale for using and applying these rules remains consistent with the principles outlined. Finally, it's worth noting that in contemporary integrated circuit layout, design rules are typically integrated into the layout CAD program and are automatically verified as the layout progresses."

Take, for instance, the $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{n}^{+}$ masks applied to the source and drain regions, which are typically produced without manual input. Furthermore, the software may permit designers to operate directly within the final intended dimensions. The layout program then adjusts the size of the masks to counteract any lateral diffusion or etching loss, resulting in either larger or smaller dimensions. For example, a designer might draw a polysilicon line to achieve a transistor length of $0.1-\\mu \\mathrm{m}$. The program could then generate a mask with a $0.12-\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ line width to compensate for lateral diffusion and etching-related polysilicon loss.\n\nModern layout programs often include pre-designed circuit cells stored in a library. These cells can be parametrically resized during the layout process, with the corresponding geometries for each layer being automatically produced. When connecting these cells, the program may handle their placement and routing automatically. Designers can then modify this auto-generated layout as needed. As technology advances, the layout process becomes increasingly automated with a wider array of cells at the designer's disposal. However, manual control over critical cells is still necessary, particularly when dealing with compact layouts or high-speed circuits. For example, the layout of a memory cell, where space and capacitive loading are crucial, would rarely be entrusted to automation. Consequently, digital microcircuit designers must be well-versed in the design rules that dictate the layout process for their specific manufacturing technology.\n\nThe most crucial masks are those defining the active (OD) region and the gate polysilicon. The overlap between these two masks forms the channel region in MOS transistors. Consider Figures 2.14(a) and 2.14(b), which depict a simplified MOS transistor and its corresponding layout masks. In Figure 2.14(b), the poly mask extends vertically, and the length of the poly that intersects the active-region mask determines the transistor width (W), while the width of the poly line defines the transistor length (L).\n\nDesign rules for transistor layout frequently utilize a parameter, $\\lambda$, which represents half the minimum gate length. This approach allows for concise expression of many design rules, independent of the actual minimum channel length (i.e., $2 \\lambda$). Figure 2.14(b) illustrates the smallest feasible transistor in a given process, accounting for contact dimensions. It also presents various minimum dimensions in terms of $\\lambda$.\n\nWhen using $\\lambda$ to express design rules, it's assumed that each mask has a worst-case alignment error of less than $0.75 \\lambda$. This ensures that the relative misalignment between any two masks is under $1.5 \\lambda$. To prevent destructive short circuits due to overlapping regions in a microcircuit, a separation of $2 \\lambda$ in the layout is necessary. For instance, in Figure 2.14(b), the poly mask and contact mask must be positioned to avoid overlap, as any交集 would short-circuit the transistor.\n\nAdditional design rules dictate that active regions should encircle contacts by at least $1 \\lambda$. While some overlap between the active-region mask and the contact mask may occur, it does not lead to catastrophic shorts as long as sufficient overlap exists to ensure a proper connection between the aluminum interconnect and the junction. Given the maximum relative misalignment of $1.5 \\lambda$, having the source (or drain) region surround the contact by $1 \\lambda$ and maintaining a minimum contact width of $2 \\lambda$ guarantees an overlap of at least $1.5 \\lambda$.\n\nThese design rules help estimate the minimum dimensions of a junction area and perimeter before a transistor is laid out. For example, in Figure 2.14, if a contact is to be made to a junction, the active region must extend beyond the polysilicon region by at least $5 \\lambda$. Thus, the minimum area of a small junction with a contact is given by Equation (2.4), and the perimeter by Equation (2.5). These estimates are useful for approximating parasitic capacitances in transistor models and for simulating circuits in SPICE. However, they are rough estimates, and the actual layout may vary.\n\nThe design rules, expressed in terms of $\\lambda$, impose constraints on the minimum sizes and spacing of transistor and interconnect features due to manufacturing tolerances. These constraints impact parasitic capacitances and, ultimately, the circuit bandwidth that an analog designer can anticipate.\n\nIn some cases, to minimize junction capacitance, a single junction may be shared between two transistors. For instance, in the series connection of two transistors shown in Figure 2.16(a), the layout in Figure 2.16(b) demonstrates a shared junction. The area and perimeter of this junction are significantly smaller than those estimated by Equations (2.4) and (2.5). In SPICE simulations, the area and perimeter should be halved when specified for each transistor, or the values could be assigned to one transistor with the other's set to zero.\n\nMinimizing the junction capacitance is so critical that experienced designers prioritize identifying the most critical nodes and exploring layouts that reduce their junction capacitance.\n\nAdditional design rules are necessary, as illustrated by the layout of a digital inverter in Figure 2.17. For instance, the n-well surrounding the p-channel active region must extend at least $3 \\lambda$ beyond it, and the minimum spacing between the n well and the n-channel transistor junctions in the substrate is $5 \\lambda$. These rules prevent short circuits and ensure proper circuit operation. The layout also demonstrates the use of metal to connect the junctions of p-channel and n-channel transistors, with specific rules for minimum overlap and width.\n\nFigure 2.18(a) shows a layout where four transistors with a common gate are connected in parallel to form a larger transistor. Figures 2.18(b) and 2.18(c) depict the corresponding circuit diagrams. This configuration reduces series gate resistance and junction capacitance. The layout highlights the use of multiple contacts to minimize impedance and the importance of connecting the equivalent large transistor to the more critical node to optimize performance.\n\nDesign rules also define the minimum pitch and widths for polysilicon and metal interconnects, which vary depending on the level of the metal and its distance from the silicon surface. These rules ensure proper electrical characteristics and prevent issues like latch-up.\n\nIn modern integrated circuit design, the layout CAD program typically incorporates design rules and automatically checks compliance as the layout progresses, simplifying the design process."

This accounts for the junction overlap due to lateral diffusion and the polysilicon loss due to etching.\n\nModern layout programs often have pre-designed circuit cells stored in libraries, which can be parametrically adjusted to the required size during the overall layout. The corresponding geometries for every layer are then automatically generated. As these cells are connected, the program might automatically place and route them. The designer can interactively modify this auto-generated layout, making the process increasingly automated over time. However, the designer must still directly manage the layout of critical cells, particularly when compact layouts or high-speed circuits are required. For example, it's uncommon to allow a computer to automatically generate the layout of a memory cell where space and capacitive loading of the interconnects are crucial. Therefore, a digital microcircuit designer must be well-versed in the design rules that dictate the layout for the chosen fabrication process.\n\nThe two most critical masks are those for the active (OD) region and the gate polysilicon. The overlap of these masks defines the channel region of MOS transistors. For instance, Figure 2.14(a) presents a simplified view of a MOS transistor, and Figure 2.14(b) shows the corresponding layout of the active mask and the polysilicon mask. In Figure 2.14(b), the poly mask extends vertically, and the length of the poly overlapping the active-region mask represents the transistor width, W. The width of the poly line is the transistor length, L, as indicated in Figure 2.14.\n\nDesign rules for transistor layout are often framed in terms of a parameter, $\\lambda$, which is half the minimum allowable gate length. This allows many design rules to be expressed simply, independent of the actual minimum channel length (i.e., $2 \\lambda$). Figure 2.14(b) also shows the smallest feasible transistor in a given process when a contact must be made to each junction, and it includes various minimum dimensions expressed in terms of $\\lambda$.\n\nWhen using $\\lambda$ to express design rules, we assume that each mask has a worst-case alignment of less than $0.75 \\lambda$. This ensures that the relative misalignment between any two masks is under $1.5 \\lambda$. If an overlap between two regions of a microcircuit could cause a destructive short circuit, then a separation of $2 \\lambda$ in the layout guarantees this will not occur. For example, in Figure 2.14(b), if the poly mask and the contact mask overlap, it could short-circuit the metal used to contact the source junction to the gate poly, causing the transistor to be always off, as shown in Figure 2.15. If the source is connected to ground, this error also short-circuits the gate-to-ground. To prevent this, contact openings must be kept at least $2 \\lambda$ away from the polysilicon gates.\n\nAnother example of a catastrophic failure due to misalignment is a gate that doesn't fully span the active region, also shown in Figure 2.15. Since junctions are implanted everywhere in the active region except under the gate, this misalignment causes a short circuit between the source and the drain, hence the design rule that polysilicon must always extend at least $2 \\lambda$ past the active region.\n\nAnother design rule is that active regions should encircle contacts by at least $1 \\lambda$. If there's an overlap between the active-region mask's edge and the contact mask, there won't be disastrous shorts as long as there's sufficient overlap between the contact and the active masks to ensure a good connection between the aluminum interconnect and the junction. With a maximum relative misalignment of $1.5 \\lambda$, having the source (or drain) region encircle the contact by $1 \\lambda$ and a minimum contact width of $2 \\lambda$ ensures an overlap of at least $1.5 \\lambda$."

These rules help estimate the minimum dimensions of junction areas and perimeters before transistor layout, which is essential for accurate parasitic capacitance estimation in transistor models and SPICE simulations.\n\nIn some cases, to minimize capacitance, a single junction can be shared between two transistors, significantly reducing the area and perimeter compared to individual junctions. Designers must also consider additional rules, such as the minimum spacing between n-wells and junctions of n-channel transistors, and the use of butting contacts to connect both p-channel transistor sources and n-well ties to VDD.\n\nThe layout of a large transistor typically involves connecting smaller transistors in parallel to reduce series gate resistance and junction capacitance. The layout must also adhere to minimum pitch and width rules for polysilicon and metal interconnects, which vary depending on the level of the interconnect and the topography of the silicon surface.\n\nIn conclusion, while modern layout programs offer significant automation, designers must still apply a deep understanding of design rules to ensure the reliable operation of integrated circuits, especially for critical cells. The automation and rules are continuously evolving to meet the demands of advanced circuit designs."

For instance, the masks for the $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{n}^{+}$ regions used for the source and drain are typically generated automatically. The software may also allow the designer to operate directly within the final desired dimensions. The program then automatically adjusts the mask sizes to account for lateral diffusion or etching loss, resulting in masks that may be larger or smaller in dimension. For example, a designer might sketch a polysilicon line for a transistor with a $0.1-\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ length, and the program might produce a mask with a $0.12-\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ line width. This increased mask size accounts for the junction overlap due to lateral diffusion and the polysilicon loss due to etching.\n\nModern layout programs often have pre-performed and stored layouts for some circuit cells in a library. During the overall layout process, these cells can be parametrically adapted to the necessary size, with the corresponding geometries for each layer being automatically generated. Frequently, when these cells are being connected, they may be automatically placed and routed by the program. The designer can then interactively modify the automatically generated layout. As a result, the layout process becomes increasingly automated as more cells become available. However, the designer must maintain direct control over the layout of critical cells, particularly when the layout needs to be compact or the resulting circuits need to be fast. For example, it is uncommon to allow the computer to automatically generate the layout of a memory cell where space and capacitive loading of the connecting buses are critical. Therefore, a digital microcircuit designer must be well-versed in the design rules that govern the layout required for the process used.\n\nThe two most crucial masks are those for the active (OD) region and for the gate polysilicon. The overlap of these two masks defines the channel region of MOS transistors. For example, in Figure 2.14(a), a simplified view of a MOS transistor is shown, and Figure 2.14(b) displays the corresponding layout of the active mask and the polysilicon, or poly, mask. In Figure 2.14(b), the poly mask extends vertically. The length of the poly that intersects the active-region mask is the transistor width, W, and the width of the poly line is the transistor length, L, as Figure 2.14 illustrates.\n\nThe design rules for transistor layout are often defined in terms of a quantity, $\\lambda$, where $\\lambda$ is half the minimum permitted gate length. This allows many design rules to be expressed simply, independent of the true minimum channel length (i.e., $2 \\lambda$). Figure 2.14(b) shows the smallest possible transistor that can be achieved in a given process when a contact must be made to each junction, as well as many of the minimum dimensions in terms of $\\lambda$.\n\nWhen design rules are expressed in terms of $\\lambda$, it is assumed that each mask has a worst-case alignment of less than $0.75 \\lambda$. This ensures that the relative misalignment between any two masks is less than $1.5 \\lambda$. If an overlap between any two regions of a microcircuit could result in a destructive short circuit, then a separation between the corresponding regions in the layout of $2 \\lambda$ guarantees this will never occur. For example, consider the poly mask and the contact mask in Figure 2.14(b). If these two regions overlap in the microcircuit, then the metal used to contact the source junction is also short-circuited to the gate poly, causing the transistor to be always turned off, as shown in Figure 2.15. If the source happens to be connected to ground, this error also short-circuits the gate-to-ground. To prevent this type of short, the contact openings must be kept at least $2 \\lambda$ away from the polysilicon gates.\n\nAnother example of a catastrophic failure due to misalignment is a gate that does not fully cross the active region (also shown in Figure 2.15). Since the junctions are implanted everywhere in the active region except under the gate, this misalignment causes a short circuit between the source and the drain—thus the design rule that polysilicon must always extend at least $2 \\lambda$ past the active region.\n\nAnother design rule is that active regions should surround contacts by at least $1 \\lambda$. If, in reality, an overlap exists between the edge of the active-region mask and the contact mask, no disastrous shorts occur. The circuit still works correctly as long as sufficient overlap exists between the contact and the active masks so that a good connection is made between the aluminum interconnect and the junction. Since the maximum relative misalignment is $1.5 \\lambda$, having the source (or drain) region surround the contact by $1 \\lambda$ and a minimum contact width of $2 \\lambda$ guarantees an overlap of at least $1.5 \\lambda$.\n\nThe few design rules just described are sufficient to allow one to estimate the minimum dimensions of a junction area and perimeter before a transistor has been laid out. For example, assume that in Figure 2.14 a contact is to be made to a junction; then the active region must extend past the polysilicon region by at least $5 \\lambda$. Thus, the minimum area of a small junction with a contact to it is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nA_{s}=A_{d}=5 \\lambda \\mathrm{~W} \\tag{2.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere W is the transistor width. Similarly, in Figure 2.14, the perimeter of a junction with a contact is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nP_{s}=P_{d}=10 \\lambda+W \\tag{2.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThese estimates may be used when estimating the parasitic capacitances in the transistor models. They may also be used in SPICE to simulate circuits so the parasitic capacitances are determined more accurately. However, note that they are only estimates; the true layout will differ somewhat from these rough estimates.\n\nKey Point: Finite tolerances during integrated circuit manufacturing impose constraints on the minimum sizes and spacing of transistor and interconnect features. These constraints may be expressed as multiples of $\\lambda$, equal to one-half the minimum gate length. They influence parasitic capacitances, and ultimately the circuit bandwidth which an analog designer may expect.\n\nSometimes, when it is important to minimize the capacitance of a junction, a single junction can be shared between two transistors. For example, consider the series connection of two transistors shown in Figure 2.16(a). The active, poly, and contact masks might be laid out as shown in Figure 2.16(b). Notice that a single junction is shared between transistors $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$. The area, and especially the perimeter of this junction, are much smaller than those given by equations (2.4) and (2.5). Also, in a SPICE simulation, the area and perimeter should be divided by 2 when they are specified in each transistor description, since the junction is shared. Alternatively, all of the area and perimeter could be specified in one transistor description, and the area and perimeter of the other junction could be specified as zero.\n\nSince the junction sidewall capacitance is directly proportional to the junction perimeter, and since this capacitance can be a major part of the total junction capacitance (because of the heavily doped field-implants), minimizing the perimeter is important. Note that it is impossible to share junctions between n-channel and p-channel devices as they must be located in separate substrate regions doped p- and n type respectively.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 2.1\n\nAssuming $\\lambda=0.2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$, find the area and perimeters of junctions $J_{1}, J_{2}$, and $J_{3}$ for the circuit in Figure 2.16.\n\n#### Solution\n\nSince the width and length are shown as $10 \\lambda$ and $2 \\lambda$, respectively, and $\\lambda=0.2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$, the physical sizes are $\\mathrm{W}=2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ and $\\mathrm{L}=0.4 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nThus, for junction $J_{1}$, using the formulas of (2.4) and (2.5), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{A}_{\\mathrm{J}_{1}}=5 \\lambda \\mathrm{~W}=5(0.2) 2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2}=2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2} \\tag{2.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nP_{\\mathrm{J} 1}=10 \\lambda+W=[10(0.2)+2] \\mu \\mathrm{m}=4 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\tag{2.7}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince this junction is connected to ground, its parasitic capacitance is unimportant and little has been done to minimize its area. Contrast this case with junction $J_{2}$, where we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{A}_{\\mathrm{J} 2}=2 \\lambda \\mathrm{~W}+12 \\lambda^{2}=1.28 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2} \\tag{2.8}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe perimeter is unchanged, resulting in $P_{\\mathrm{J} 2}=4 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$. Thus, we have decreased the junction area by using the fact that the transistor is much wider than the single contact used. However, sometimes wide transistors require additional contacts to minimize the contact impedance. For example, the two contacts used for junction $J_{1}$ result in roughly half the contact impedance of junction $J_{2}$.\n\nNext, consider the shared junction. Here we have a junction area given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{A}_{\\mathrm{J} 3}=2 \\lambda \\mathrm{~W}=0.8 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2} \\tag{2.9}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince this is a shared junction, in a SPICE simulation we would use\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nA_{s}=A_{d}=\\lambda W=0.4 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2} \\tag{2.10}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nfor each of the two transistors, which is much less than $2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2}$. The reduction in the perimeter is even more substantial. Here we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nP_{\\mathrm{J} 3}=4 \\lambda=0.8 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\tag{2.11}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nfor the shared junction; so sharing this perimeter value over the two transistors would result in\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nP_{S}=P_{d}=2 \\lambda=0.4 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\tag{2.12}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nfor the appropriate junction of each transistor when simulating it in SPICE. This result is much less than the $4-\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ perimeter for node $J_{1}$.\n\nBecause minimizing the junction capacitance is so important, one of the first steps an experienced designer takes before laying out important high-speed cells is first to identify the most critical nodes and then to investigate possible layouts that minimize the junction capacitance of these nodes.\n\nAn additional design rule has been implicitly introduced in the previous example. Notice that for junction $\\mathrm{J}_{2}$ in Figure 2.16, part of the active region boundary is only $2 \\lambda$ away from the gate. This minimum junction area is the typical design rule for this case.\n\nSeveral design rules are required in addition to those just mentioned. Some of these are described next, with reference to the layout of a digital inverter, shown in Figure 2.17. Notice that the n well surrounds the p-channel active region, and therefore the $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$ junctions of the p-channel transistors, by at least $3 \\lambda$. Notice also that the minimum spacing between the n well and the junctions of n-channel transistors, in the substrate, is $5 \\lambda$. This large spacing is required because of the large lateral diffusion of the n well and the fact that if the n-channel junction became short-circuited to the n well, which is connected to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DD}}$, the circuit would not work. Conversely, a $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$-substrate tie can be much closer to a well because it is always connected to ground and is separated from the well by a reverse-biased junction. A typical dimension here might be $2 \\lambda$. Since a p-channel junction must be inside the well by at least $3 \\lambda$ and an n-channel junction must be outside the well by $5 \\lambda$, the closest an n-channel transistor can be placed to a p-channel transistor is $8 \\lambda$.\n\nNotice in Figure 2.17 that metal is used to connect the junctions of the p-channel and n-channel transistors. Normally, the metal must overlap any underlying contacts by at least $\\lambda$. A typical minimum width for first-level metal might be $2 \\lambda$, the same as the minimum width for polysilicon. However, it can be wider as in Figure 2.17, where it is $4 \\lambda$ wide.\n\nNotice also in Figure 2.17 that a single contact opening, known as a butting contact, is used to contact both the p-channel transistor source and an $\\mathrm{n}^{+}$-well tie, because both will be connected to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DD}}$. Although the outlines of the $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{n}^{+}$ masks are not shown in Figure 2.17, under the contact, one half will be doped $p^{+}$ (the p-channel junction) and one half will be doped $\\mathrm{n}^{+}$ (the well tie). Also, for the n-channel transistor, a butting contact was used to connect the n-channel source to a $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$-substrate tie, and both will be connected to ground. In a typical set of design rules, a maximum distance between transistors and well (or substrate) ties is specified, and a maximum distance between substrate ties is also specified. For example, the rules might specify that no transistor can be more than $100 \\lambda$ from a substrate tie. These rules are necessary to prevent latch-up, a phenomenon described at the end of this chapter.\n\nAs a final example, we describe the layout of a large transistor. Normally, a wide transistor is composed of smaller transistors connected in parallel. This approach results in shorter individual polysilicon gate strips and, hence, a lower series gate resistance. It also reduces the junction capacitances, as we shall see in Example 2.2. A simplified layout of this approach is shown in Figure 2.18(a), where four transistors that have a common gate are connected in parallel. Figure 2.18(b) shows the circuit corresponding to the layout in Figure 2.18(a), where the transistors have been drawn in the same relative positions. Figure 2.18(c) shows the same circuit redrawn differently, where it is clear that the circuit consists of four transistors connected in parallel. Notice that the second and fourth junction regions are connected by metal to node 1, whereas the first, third, and fifth junction regions are connected by metal to realize node 2. Because it has a larger total junction area and especially a larger perimeter, node 2 will have a much greater junction capacitance than node 1. Thus, when the equivalent transistor is connected to a circuit, node 1 should be connected to the more critical node. Also notice the large number of contacts used to minimize the contact impedance. The use of many contacts in wide junction regions greatly minimizes voltage drops that would otherwise occur due to the relatively high resistivity of silicon junctions compared to the resistivity of the metal that overlays the junctions and connects them.\n\nDesign rules also specify the minimum pitch between polysilicon interconnects, metal 1 interconnects, and metal 2 interconnects. These might be $2 \\lambda, 2 \\lambda$, and $3 \\lambda$, respectively. Metal 2 requires a larger minimum pitch because it resides further from the silicon surface where the topography is less even. The minimum widths of poly, metal 1, and metal 2 might also be $2 \\lambda, 2 \\lambda$, and $3 \\lambda$, respectively.\n\nThis concludes our brief introduction to layout and design rules. In a modern process, many more design rules are used than those just described. However, the reasons for using and the methods of applying these rules is similar to that which has been described. Finally, note that when one does modern integrated circuit layout, the design rules are usually available to the layout CAD program and are automatically checked as layout progresses.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 2.2\n\nConsider the transistor shown in Figure 2.18, where the total width of the four parallel transistors is $80 \\lambda$, its length is $2 \\lambda$, and $\\lambda=0.2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$. Assuming node 2 is the source, node 1 is the drain, and the device is in the active region, find the source-bulk and drain-bulk capacitances given the parameters $C_{j}=0.24 \\mathrm{fF} / \\mu \\mathrm{m}^{2}$ and $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{j} \\text {-sw }}=0.2 \\mathrm{fF} / \\mu \\mathrm{m}$. Also find the equivalent capacitances if the transistor were realized as a single device with source and drain contacts still evenly placed.\n\n#### Solution\n\nStarting with node 1, the drain, we find that the areas of the junctions are equal to\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{A}_{\\mathrm{J} 2}=\\mathrm{A}_{\\mathrm{J} 4}=6 \\lambda \\times 20 \\lambda=120 \\lambda^{2}=4.8 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2}\n$$\n\nIgnoring the gate side, the perimeters are given by\n\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{J} 2}=P_{\\mathrm{J} 4}=6 \\lambda+6 \\lambda=12 \\lambda=2.4 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}\n$$\n\nAs a result, $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{db}}$ can be estimated to be\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{"

This automation increases over time as more cells are available, but critical cells still require direct control, especially in tight layouts or high-speed circuits. For instance, the layout of a memory cell, where space and capacitive loading are crucial, is rarely automated.\n\nThe two most critical masks are the active (OD) region and the gate polysilicon. Their intersection defines the channel region of MOS transistors. For example, a simplified view of a MOS transistor (Fig. 2.14(a)) and its corresponding layout (Fig. 2.14(b)) show the active mask and the polysilicon mask. The length of the polysilicon intersecting the active region is the transistor width (W), and the width of the polysilicon line is the transistor length (L).\n\nDesign rules for transistor layout often use a parameter $\\lambda$, which is half the minimum permitted gate length.

For instance, the $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$and $\\mathrm{n}^{+}$masks for the source and drain regions are commonly produced without manual input. Furthermore, the program may enable designers to work within the final target dimensions. The layout software then adjusts the mask sizes automatically to accommodate any lateral diffusion or etching loss, creating masks with larger or smaller dimensions as needed. For example, a designer might specify a polysilicon line with a $0.1-\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ length for a transistor. The software may then generate a mask with a $0.12-\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ line width, ensuring that the mask size accounts for junction overlap due to lateral diffusion and polysilicon loss from etching.\n\nIn contemporary layout software, the layout of certain circuit cells may already be pre-existent and stored within a library. During the overall layout process, these cells are adjusted parametrically to the required size, and the corresponding geometries for each layer are automatically generated. Typically, as the cells are connected, they are automatically placed and routed by the software. The designer may then modify this automatically generated layout interactively. Consequently, as more cells become available, the layout process becomes increasingly automated. However, the designer retains direct control over the layout of critical cells, particularly when the layout needs to be compact or when high-speed circuits are being created. For instance, it is uncommon to allow a computer to generate the layout of a memory cell where space and the capacitive loading of the connecting buses are pivotal. Thus, a digital microcircuit designer must possess knowledge of the design rules governing the layout process for the specific technology used.\n\nThe two critical masks are those for the active (OD) region and the gate polysilicon. The intersection of these masks defines the channel region of MOS transistors. For instance, examine Fig. 2.14(a), which presents a simplified illustration of a MOS transistor, and Fig. 2.14(b), which depicts the corresponding layout of the active mask and the polysilicon mask. In Fig. $2.14(b)$, the polysilicon mask is oriented vertically. The length of the polysilicon that intersects the active-region mask represents the transistor width, W, and the width of the polysilicon line denotes the transistor length, L, as shown in Fig. 2.14.\n\nThe design rules for transistor layout are often stated in terms of a quantity, $\\lambda$, which is half of the minimum permitted gate length. This generalization facilitates the expression of many design rules without reference to the actual minimum channel length (i.e., $2 \\lambda$). Figure 2.14(b) demonstrates the smallest transistor achievable in a particular process, given that each junction must be contacted. Additionally, it illustrates numerous minimum dimensions expressed in terms of $\\lambda$.\n\nWhen expressing design rules in terms of $\\lambda$, it is assumed that each mask has an alignment error of less than $0.75 \\lambda$. This assumption ensures that the misalignment between any two masks does not exceed $1.5 \\lambda$. If an overlap between any two regions in a microcircuit would result in a harmful short circuit, maintaining a separation of $2 \\lambda$ between these regions in the layout prevents this scenario. For example, consider the poly mask and the contact mask in Fig. 2.14(b).

The layout illustrates the dimensions and spacing of various regions, including the active region, field oxide region, and effective gate region, using specific measurements in terms of λ. The field oxide region ensures isolation, while the polysilicon mask defines the gate area. The active-region mask encompasses the source and drain areas, and the contact mask indicates where connections are made.\n\nFig. 2.14 (a) A simplified view of a partially finished transistor and (b) the corresponding layout of the active, polysilicon, and contact masks.\nmetal used to contact the source junction also shorts to the gate poly, causing the transistor to remain turned off, as depicted in Fig. 2.15. Should the source be grounded, this error also shorts the gate to ground. To prevent this type of short, the contact openings must be maintained at least $2 \\lambda$ away from the polysilicon gates.\n\nA further illustration of a catastrophic failure due to misalignment is a gate that does not completely span the active region (also shown in Fig. 2.15). Since junctions are implanted throughout the active region except under the gate, this misalignment results in a short circuit between the source and drain, leading to the design rule that the polysilicon must always extend beyond the active region by at least $2 \\lambda$.\n\nAn additional design rule stipulates that active regions should be surrounded by contacts by at least $1 \\lambda$. If, in reality, an overlap exists between the edge of the active-region mask and the contact mask, no catastrophic shorts occur. The circuit will still function correctly as long as there is sufficient overlap between the contact and the active masks to ensure a good connection between the aluminum interconnect and the junction. Given that the maximum relative misalignment is $1.5 \\lambda$, having the source (or drain) region surround the contact by $1 \\lambda$ and a minimum contact width of $2 \\lambda$ guarantees an overlap of at least $1.5 \\lambda$.\n\nThe few design rules outlined are adequate to estimate the minimum dimensions of a junction area and perimeter before transistors are laid out. For instance, if a contact is to be made to a junction, then the active region must extend past the polysilicon region by at least $5 \\lambda$. Consequently, the minimum area of a small junction with a contact is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nA_{s}=A_{d}=5 \\lambda \\mathrm{~W} \\tag{2.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere W is the transistor width. Similarly, the perimeter of a junction with a contact is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nP_{s}=P_{d}=10 \\lambda+W \\tag{2.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThese estimates can be utilized when calculating parasitic capacitances in transistor models. They may also be applied in SPICE simulations to determine parasitic capacitances more accurately. However, note that these are merely estimates; the actual layout will vary slightly from these preliminary calculations.\n\nKey Point: During integrated circuit manufacturing, finite tolerances impose constraints on the minimum sizes and spacing of transistor and interconnect features. These constraints can be expressed as multiples of $\\lambda$, which is equal to one-half the minimum gate length. They influence parasitic capacitances, which ultimately affect the circuit bandwidth that an analog designer may anticipate.\n\nOccasionally, when it is crucial to minimize the capacitance of a junction, a single junction may be shared between two transistors. For instance, consider the series connection of two transistors depicted in Fig. 2.16(a). The active, poly, and contact masks might be laid out as illustrated in Fig. 2.16(b). Note that a single junction is shared between transistors $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$. The area, and particularly the perimeter of this junction, are significantly smaller than those given by equations (2.4) and (2.5). Additionally, in a SPICE simulation, when specifying the area and perimeter for each transistor, they should be halved since the junction is shared. Alternatively, the area and perimeter could be specified in one transistor description, and the perimeter of the other junction could be set to zero.\n\nSince the junction sidewall capacitance is directly proportional to the junction perimeter, and this capacitance can be a significant component of the total junction capacitance (owing to the\n3. The perimeter does not include the edge between the junction and the active channel that separates the junction from the gate because there is no field-implant along this edge, and thus the sidewall capacitance is smaller along this edge.\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:\n[\nname: Q1, type: NMOS, ports: {S: GND, D: J3, G: g1}\nname: Q2, type: NMOS, ports: {S: J3, D: J2, G: g2}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit diagram illustrates the series connection of two NMOS transistors, Q1 and Q2.

It is impossible to share junctions between n-channel and p-channel devices, as they must be positioned in separate substrate regions, one doped with p-type and the other with n-type, respectively.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 2.1\n\nAssuming $\\lambda=0.2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$, determine the area and perimeters of junctions $J_{1}, J_{2}$, and $J_{3}$ for the circuit in Fig. 2.16.\n\n#### Solution\n\nSince the width and length are given as $10 \\lambda$ and $2 \\lambda$, respectively, and $\\lambda=0.2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$, the physical dimensions are $W=2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ and $L=0.4 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nFor junction $J_{1}$, using the formulas from (2.4) and (2.5), we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nA_{J_{1}}=5 \\lambda \\mathrm{~W}=5(0.2) 2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2}=2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2} \\tag{2.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nP_{J_{1}}=10 \\lambda+W=[10(0.2)+2] \\mu \\mathrm{~m}=4 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\tag{2.7}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis junction is connected to ground, so its parasitic capacitance is insignificant, and efforts to minimize its area are minimal. In contrast, consider junction $J_{2}$, where we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nA_{J_{2}}=2 \\lambda \\mathrm{~W}+12 \\lambda^{2}=1.28 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2} \\tag{2.8}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe perimeter remains unchanged, resulting in $P_{J_{2}}=4 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$. Thus, we have reduced the junction area by using the fact that the transistor is much wider than the single contact used. However, sometimes wide transistors require\nadditional contacts to minimize the contact impedance. For example, the two contacts used for junction $J_{1}$ yield roughly half the contact impedance of junction $J_{2}$.\n\nNext, consider the shared junction. Here we have a junction area given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nA_{J_{3}}=2 \\lambda \\mathrm{~W}=0.8 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2} \\tag{2.9}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince this is a shared junction, in a SPICE simulation, we would use\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nA_{s}=A_{d}=\\lambda W=0.4 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2} \\tag{2.10}\n$$\n\nfor each of the two transistors, which is much less than $2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2}$. The reduction in the perimeter is even more pronounced. Here we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nP_{J_{3}}=4 \\lambda=0.8 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\tag{2.11}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nfor the shared junction; dividing this perimeter value by 2 when specified for each transistor in the SPICE simulation would result in\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nP_{S}=P_{d}=2 \\lambda=0.4 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\tag{2.12}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nfor the corresponding junction of each transistor when simulating it in SPICE. This result is significantly less than the $4-\\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ perimeter for node $J_{1}$.\n\nGiven that minimizing junction capacitance is so crucial, an experienced designer typically identifies the most critical nodes before laying out high-speed cells and explores possible layouts that minimize the junction capacitance of these nodes.\n\nAn additional design rule has been implicitly introduced in the previous example. Notice that for junction $\\mathrm{J}_{2}$ in Fig. 2.16, the active-region boundary is only $2 \\lambda$ away from the gate. This minimum junction area is the typical design rule for this scenario.\n\nSeveral additional design rules are necessary beyond those already mentioned. Some of these will be described next with reference to the layout of a digital inverter shown in Fig. 2.17. Note that the n-well encircles the p-channel active region, and therefore the $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$junctions of the p-channel transistors, by at least $3 \\lambda$. Also, note that the minimum spacing between the n-well and the junctions of n-channel transistors in the substrate is $5 \\lambda$. This large spacing is necessary because of the extensive lateral diffusion of the $n$-well and the fact that if the n-channel junction were shorted to the n-well, which is connected to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DD}}$, the circuit would not function. Conversely, a $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$substrate tie can be much closer to the well since it is always connected to ground and separated from the well by a reverse-biased junction. A common dimension might be $2 \\lambda$. Since a p-channel junction must be inside the well by at least $3 \\lambda$ and an n-channel junction must be outside the well by $5 \\lambda$, the closest an n-channel transistor can be placed to a p-channel transistor is $8 \\lambda$.\n\nNotice in Fig. 2.17 that metal is used to connect the junctions of the p-channel and n-channel transistors. Typically, the metal must overlap any underlying contacts by at least $\\lambda$. A standard minimum width for first-level metal might be $2 \\lambda$, the same as the minimum width for polysilicon. However, it can be wider, as shown in Fig. 2.17, where it is $4 \\lambda$ wide.\n\nNotice also in Fig. 2"

    "text": "During the process of designing the layout, the need for manually creating the geometry of all mask layers is often unnecessary. Many masks are generated automatically by the layout software. For instance, the $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{n}^{+}$ masks employed for the source and drain areas frequently have this automation. Furthermore, designers are often granted the flexibility to work within their intended final dimensions. The software then automatically adjusts the mask dimensions to accommodate any lateral diffusion or etching-related losses, leading to masks with either increased or reduced dimensions. For example, a designer may draw a polysilicon line with a goal of creating a transistor that has a $0.1-\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ length. The software may then create a mask with a $0.12-\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ line width, which accounts for the junction overlap caused by lateral diffusion and polysilicon loss due to etching.\n\nIn contemporary layout software, the layout for certain circuit cells may already be pre-made and stored within a library. During the overall layout phase, these cells are modified to fit the required dimensions parametrically, and the corresponding geometries for each layer are automatically produced. Typically, as cells are connected, the software can place them and route them automatically. The designer can then make interactive adjustments to this automated layout. Consequently, as more cells are added, the layout process becomes increasingly automated. However, the designer must maintain direct oversight of the layout of critical cells, particularly when the layout is complex or the resulting circuits need to operate at high speeds. For instance, it would be uncommon to allow a computer to automatically generate the layout of a memory cell where the space and capacitive loading of the connecting buses are crucial. Therefore, a digital microcircuit designer must have a comprehensive understanding of the design rules that govern the layout necessary for the specific manufacturing process.\n\nThe two critical masks are those for the active (OD) region and the gate polysilicon. The overlap of these masks forms the channel region of MOS transistors. For instance, see Fig. 2.14(a), which presents a simplified view of a MOS transistor, and Fig. 2.14(b), which depicts the corresponding layout of the active mask and the polysilicon, or poly, mask. In Fig. 2.14(b), the poly mask is oriented vertically. The length of the poly intersecting the active-region mask represents the transistor width, W, and the width of the poly line denotes the transistor length, L, as depicted in Fig. 2.14.\n\nDesign rules for transistor layout are frequently conveyed using a value, $\\lambda$, where $\\lambda$ is half the minimum allowed gate length. This generalization enables the expression of many design rules simply, irrespective of the actual minimum channel length (i.e., $2 \\lambda$). Figure 2.14(b) illustrates the smallest possible transistor that can be achieved in a specific process when each junction must be contacted. It also displays various minimum dimensions in terms of $\\lambda$.\n\nExpressing design rules in terms of $\\lambda$ assumes that each mask has a worst-case alignment error of less than $0.75 \\lambda$. This assumption ensures that the misalignment between any two masks is less than $1.5 \\lambda$. If overlap between any regions of a microcircuit would lead to a short circuit, maintaining a spacing of $2 \\lambda$ between the corresponding regions in the layout ensures this will not occur. For example, consider the poly mask and the contact mask in Fig. 2.14(b). If these regions overlap in the microcircuit, then the transistor would be short-circuited.\n\nThe image (a) contains two parts, labeled (a) and (b), illustrating the components and layout of a transistor and its masks.\n\n**(a) Simplified View of a Partially Finished Transistor:**\n- **Components and Structure:**\n- The diagram showcases a cross-sectional view of a transistor that is nearly completed.

For example, refer to Fig. 2.14(a), which presents a simplified view of a MOS transistor, and Fig. 2.14(b), which illustrates the corresponding layout of the active mask and the polysilicon, or poly, mask.

The layout presents the dimensions and spacing of various regions, including the active region, field-oxide region, and effective gate region, using specific measurements in terms of λ. The field-oxide region ensures isolation, while the polysilicon mask defines the gate area.

If the source is connected to ground, this error also causes a short circuit between the gate and ground. To prevent this kind of short, the contact openings must be kept at least $2 \\lambda$ away from the polysilicon gates.\n\nA further instance of a catastrophic failure due to misalignment is a gate that does not completely overlap the active region (also shown in Fig. 2.15). Since junctions are implanted throughout the active region except under the gate, this misalignment leads to a short circuit between the source and the drain, hence the design rule that polysilicon must always extend beyond the active region by at least $2 \\lambda$.\n\nAnother design rule dictates that active regions should encircle contacts by at least $1 \\lambda$. If, in reality, an overlap exists between the edge of the active-region mask and the contact mask, no catastrophic short circuits will occur. The circuit will still operate correctly as long as there is sufficient overlap between the contact and active masks to ensure a reliable connection between the aluminum interconnect and the junction. Given the maximum relative misalignment of $1.5 \\lambda$, having the source (or drain) region encircle the contact by $1 \\lambda$ and a minimum contact width of $2 \\lambda$ ensures an overlap of at least $1.5 \\lambda$.\n\nThe aforementioned design rules are adequate to estimate the minimum dimensions of a junction area and perimeter before the transistor is laid out. For example, assume that in Fig. 2.14 a contact is to\nimage_name:Fig. 2.15\ndescription:\n[\n\n]\nextrainfo:The diagram illustrates potential misalignments in a MOSFET layout, showcasing short circuits due to source-to-gate and source-to-drain connections, as well as an instance of noncatastrophic misalignment.\n\nFig. 2.15 Misalignments in the layout of a MOSFET that result in catastrophic short circuits and an example of noncatastrophic misalignment.\nbe created at a junction; then the active region must extend beyond the polysilicon region by at least $5 \\lambda$. Hence, the minimum area of a small junction with a contact to it is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nA_{s}=A_{d}=5 \\lambda \\mathrm{~W} \\tag{2.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere W is the transistor width.

They can also be used in SPICE simulations to determine parasitic capacitances more precisely. Nonetheless, note that they are only approximations; the actual layout may vary from these initial estimates.\n\nKey Point: Manufacturing tolerances in integrated circuits impose constraints on the minimum dimensions and spacings of transistor and interconnect features. These constraints are often expressed as multiples of $\\lambda$, equal to half of the minimum gate length. They affect parasitic capacitances, and ultimately the circuit bandwidth that an analog designer can anticipate.\n\nOccasionally, when it is essential to minimize the capacitance of a junction, a single junction can be shared between two transistors. For example, consider the series connection of two transistors shown in Fig. 2.16(a). The active, poly, and contact masks may be laid out as depicted in Fig. 2.16(b). Notice that a single junction is shared between transistors $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$. The area, and particularly the perimeter of this junction, are much smaller than those given by equations (2.4) and (2.5). Moreover, in a SPICE simulation, the area and perimeter should be divided by 2 when they are specified in each transistor description, as the junction is shared. Alternatively, all of the area and perimeter could be specified in one transistor description, and the area and perimeter of the other junction could be specified as zero.\n\nSince the junction sidewall capacitance is directly proportional to the junction perimeter, and since this capacitance can be a significant portion of the total junction capacitance (due to the\n3. Note that the perimeter does not include the edge between the junction and the active channel separating the junction and the gate, as there is no field-implant along this edge, and the sidewall capacitance is therefore smaller along that edge.\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:\n[\nname: Q1, type: NMOS, ports: {S: GND, D: J3, G: g1}\nname: Q2, type: NMOS, ports: {S: J3, D: J2, G: g2}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit diagram presents a series connection of two NMOS transistors, Q1 and Q2.

Thus, we have reduced the junction area by leveraging the fact that the transistor is much wider than the single contact used. However, sometimes wide transistors require additional contacts to minimize the contact impedance. For example, the two contacts used for junction $J_{1}$ yield roughly half the contact impedance of junction $J_{2}$.\n\nNext, consider the shared junction. Here we have a junction area given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{A}_{\\mathrm{J} 3}=2 \\lambda \\mathrm{~W}=0.8 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2} \\tag{2.9}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince this is a shared junction, in a SPICE simulation we would use\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nA_{s}=A_{d}=\\lambda W=0.4 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2} \\tag{2.10}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nfor each of the two transistors, which is much less than $2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2}$. The reduction in the perimeter is even more substantial. Here we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nP_{\\mathrm{J} 3}=4 \\lambda=0.8 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\tag{2.11}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nfor the shared junction; so sharing this perimeter value over the two transistors would result in\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nP_{S}=P_{d}=2 \\lambda=0.4 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\tag{2.12}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nfor the appropriate junction of each transistor when simulating it in SPICE. This result is much less than the $4-\\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ perimeter for node $J_{1}$.\n\nBecause minimizing the junction capacitance is so crucial, one of the initial steps an experienced designer takes before laying out vital high-speed cells is to identify the most critical nodes and then explore possible layouts that minimize the junction capacitance of those nodes.\n\nAn additional design rule has been implicitly introduced in the previous example. Notice that for junction $\\mathrm{J}_{2}$ in Fig. 2.16, part of the active region boundary is only $2 \\lambda$ away from the gate. This minimum junction area is the typical design rule for this scenario.\n\nSeveral additional design rules are needed in conjunction with those previously mentioned. Some of these will be described next, with reference to the layout of a digital inverter depicted in Fig. 2.17. Notice that the n-well surrounds the p-channel active region, and consequently, the $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$junctions of the p-channel transistors, by at least $3 \\lambda$. Moreover, the minimum spacing between the n-well and the junctions of n-channel transistors in the substrate is $5 \\lambda$. This large spacing is necessary because of the significant lateral diffusion of the $n$-well and the fact that if the $n$-channel junction became short-circuited to the $n$-"

    "text": "During the creation of a layout design, it is generally unnecessary for the designer to manually generate the geometry of all mask layers, as some masks are generated automatically by the layout software. For instance, masks for the $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{n}^{+}$ regions serving as source and drain are generally created without manual input. Moreover, the software often enables designers to work within the desired final dimensions. The software then automatically adjusts the mask sizes to account for any lateral diffusion or etching losses, resulting in masks with varying dimensions. For example, if a designer draws a polysilicon line with a desired transistor length of $0.1-\\mu \\mathrm{m}$, the program may generate a mask with a $0.12-\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ line width to accommodate for diffusion and etching-related losses.\n\nIn contemporary layout software, the placement of certain circuit cells may already be predefined and stored within a library. These cells can then be scaled to the required dimensions during the overall layout process, and their corresponding geometries for every layer are automatically generated. commonly, as cells are connected, the program may automatically position them and route the connections. The designer can then modify this automated layout interactively. Over time, as more cells become available, the layout process becomes increasingly automated. However, the designer must still take direct control over the layout of critical cells, particularly when the layout must be compact or the resulting circuits need to be highly efficient. For instance, a designer would typically not allow a computer to automatically generate the layout of a memory cell, as the space and capacitive loading of the connecting buses are crucial. Therefore, a digital microcircuit designer must be well-versed in the design rules that govern the layout requirements for a given fabrication process.\n\nThe two primary masks are those for the active (OD) region and the gate polysilicon. The area where these two masks intersect constitutes the channel region of MOS transistors. For instance, refer to Figure 2.14(a), which presents a simplified view of a MOS transistor, and Figure 2.14(b), which illustrates the corresponding layout of the active and polysilicon masks. In Figure 2.14(b), the polysilicon mask runs vertically. The length of the polysilicon intersecting the active-region mask is the transistor width, W, and the width of the polysilicon line represents the transistor length, L, as depicted in Figure 2.14.\n\nThe design rules for transistor layout are often conveyed in terms of a quantity, $\\lambda$, which is half the minimum allowable gate length. This convention allows for many of the design rules to be stated simply, irrespective of the actual minimum channel length (i.e., $2 \\lambda$). Figure 2.14(b) demonstrates the smallest transistor that can be created within a specific process, considering that each junction requires a contact. Additionally, it displays many of the minimum dimensions in terms of $\\lambda$.\n\nExpressing design rules in terms of $\\lambda$ assumes that each mask has a maximum alignment deviation of less than $0.75 \\lambda$. This ensures that the relative misalignment between any two masks is less than $1.5 \\lambda$. If an overlap between any two regions of a microcircuit could lead to a short circuit, maintaining a separation of at least $2 \\lambda$ between corresponding regions in the layout guarantees that such a short circuit will never occur. For instance, consider the poly mask and the contact mask in Figure 2.14(b). If these regions overlap in the microcircuit, then the image_name:(a)description:The image includes two parts, labeled (a) and (b), depicting a transistor's components and the layout of its masks.\n\n**(a) Simplified View of a Partially Completed Transistor:**\n- **Components and Structure:**\n- The diagram presents a cross-sectional view of a partially completed transistor, featuring an active region at the bottom as the transistor's base.\n- Above the active region, there is a polysilicon structure, depicted as a shaded area, which is likely the transistor's gate.\n- Surrounding the active region, field oxide regions provide isolation between different transistors on the chip.\n- **Connections and Interactions:**\n- The active region is connected to other parts of the circuit through contacts, shown as openings in the field oxide.\n- The polysilicon gate sits over the active region, controlling current flow.\n- **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- The width (W) and length (L) of the active region are marked, indicating their importance for the transistor's functionality.\n\n**(b) Corresponding Layout of the Active, Polysilicon, and Contact Masks:**\n- **Components and Structure:**\n- This part provides a top-down view of the layout masks used during the transistor's fabrication.\n- The polysilicon mask, active-region mask, and contact mask are clearly identified.\n- The field-oxide region is distinguished by a different shading.\n- **Connections and Interactions:**\n- The effective gate region is delineated between the polysilicon and active-region masks.\n- The contact mask is positioned to ensure correct alignment with the active region, avoiding overlaps that could cause short circuits.\n- **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- Dimensions are annotated in terms of lambda (λ), a unit used to define design rules in microfabrication. The field-oxide region is marked as 5λ by 4λ, and the contact mask is positioned 2λ away from critical areas to avoid shorts.\n- The layout demonstrates clear separation between different regions, ensuring adherence to design rules for reliable transistor operation.\nimage_name:(b)description:\n[\n\n]\nextrainfo:The diagram (b) illustrates the layout of a microcircuit featuring active, polysilicon, and contact masks. It emphasizes maintaining a minimum separation of 2λ between contact openings and other regions to prevent damaging short circuits. The layout shows dimensions and spacing of various regions, including the active region, field-oxide region, and effective gate region, with specific measurements in terms of λ. The field-oxide region ensures isolation, while the polysilicon mask defines the gate area. The active-region mask covers the source and drain regions, and the contact mask indicates connection points.\n\nFig. 2.14 (a) A simplified view of a partially completed transistor and (b) the corresponding layout of the active, polysilicon, and contact masks.\nshort circuit between the poly mask and the contact mask would occur, as shown in Figure 2.15. To prevent this, the contact openings must be positioned at least $2 \\lambda$ away from the polysilicon gates.\n\nAnother example of a severe failure due to misalignment is a gate that does not completely cover the active region, as also depicted in Figure 2.15. Since the junctions are implanted throughout the active region except beneath the gate, this misalignment causes a short circuit between the source and the drain, leading to the design rule that polysilicon must always extend at least $2 \\lambda$ beyond the active region.\n\nAnother design rule stipulates that active regions should encircle contacts by at least $1 \\lambda$. If there is an overlap between the edge of the active-region mask and the contact mask, there is no catastrophic short circuit. The circuit still operates correctly as long as there is sufficient overlap between the contact and active masks to establish a good connection between the aluminum interconnect and the junction. Since the maximum relative misalignment is $1.5 \\lambda$, having the source (or drain) region encircle the contact by $1 \\lambda$ and a minimum contact width of $2 \\lambda$ ensures an overlap of at least $1.5 \\lambda$.\n\nThe aforementioned design rules are sufficient to estimate the minimum dimensions of a junction area and perimeter before transistors are laid out. For instance, if a contact needs to be made to a junction in Figure 2.14, then the active region must extend beyond the polysilicon region by at least $5 \\lambda$. Therefore, the minimum area of a small junction with a contact to it is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nA_{s}=A_{d}=5 \\lambda \\mathrm{~W} \\tag{2.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere W is the transistor width. Similarly, the perimeter of a junction with a contact is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nP_{s}=P_{d}=10 \\lambda+W \\tag{2.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThese estimations can be utilized when estimating the parasitic capacitances in transistor models. They can also be used in SPICE simulations to determine parasitic capacitances more accurately. However, note that they are only rough estimates, and the actual layout may differ slightly from these initial calculations.\n\nKey Point: Manufacturing tolerances in integrated circuits impose limitations on the minimum sizes and spacing of transistor and interconnect features, which can be expressed as multiples of $\\lambda$, equal to one-half the minimum gate length. These constraints affect parasitic capacitances and, ultimately, the circuit bandwidth that an analog designer can expect.\n\nOccasionally, when minimizing junction capacitance is critical, a single junction may be shared between two transistors. For instance, consider the series connection of two transistors shown in Figure 2.16(a). The active, poly, and contact masks may be arranged as depicted in Figure 2.16(b). Note that a single junction is shared between transistors $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$. The area and perimeter of this junction are significantly smaller than those given by equations (2.4) and (2.5). Additionally, in a SPICE simulation, the area and perimeter should be halved when specified for each transistor, since the junction is shared. Alternatively, all the area and perimeter could be specified in one transistor description, and the area and perimeter of the other junction could be set to zero.\n\nSince the junction sidewall capacitance is directly proportional to the junction perimeter and this capacitance can be a significant portion of the total junction capacitance (due to the heavily doped field-implants), minimizing the perimeter is crucial. Note that it is not possible to share junctions between n-channel and p-channel devices as they must be located in separate substrate regions doped with p- and n-type, respectively.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 2.1\n\nAssuming $\\lambda=0.2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$, determine the area and perimeters of junctions $J_{1}, J_{2}$, and $J_{3}$ for the circuit in Figure 2.16.\n\n#### Solution\n\nGiven that the width and length are depicted as $10 \\lambda$ and $2 \\lambda$, respectively, and $\\lambda=0.2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$, the actual dimensions are $\\mathrm{W}=2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ and $\\mathrm{L}=0.4 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nTherefore, for junction $J_{1}$, using the formulas of (2.4) and (2.5), we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{A}_{\\mathrm{J}_{1}}=5 \\lambda \\mathrm{~W}=5(0.2) 2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2}=2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2} \\tag{2.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nP_{\\mathrm{J} 1}=10 \\lambda+W=[10(0.2)+2] \\mu \\mathrm{m}=4 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\tag{2.7}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince this junction is connected to ground, its parasitic capacitance is negligible, and minimal effort has been made to minimize its area. Conversely, for junction $J_{2}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{A}_{\\mathrm{J} 2}=2 \\lambda \\mathrm{~W}+12 \\lambda^{2}=1.28 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2} \\tag{2.8}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe perimeter remains the same, resulting in $P_{\\mathrm{J} 2}=4 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$. Thus, by using the fact that the transistor is much wider than the single contact, we have decreased the junction area. However, sometimes wide transistors require additional contacts to minimize contact impedance. For example, the two contacts used for junction $J_{1}$ result in approximately half the contact impedance of junction $J_{2}$.\n\nNext, consider the shared junction. Here, the junction area is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{A}_{\\mathrm{J} 3}=2 \\lambda \\mathrm{~W}=0.8 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2} \\tag{2.9}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince this is a shared junction, in a SPICE simulation, we would use\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nA_{s}=A_{d}=\\lambda W=0.4 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2} \\tag{2.10}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nfor each of the two transistors, which is much smaller than $2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2}$. The reduction in the perimeter is even more substantial. Here, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nP_{\\mathrm{J} 3}=4 \\lambda=0.8 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\tag{2.11}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nfor the shared junction; thus, dividing this perimeter value by two when simulating each transistor in SPICE would result in\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nP_{S}=P_{d}=2 \\lambda=0.4 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\tag{2.12}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nfor the appropriate junction of each transistor when simulating it in SPICE. This result is significantly less than the $4 \\mu \\mathrm{m}$ perimeter for node $J_{1}$.\n\nGiven that minimizing junction capacitance is so important, an experienced designer will first identify the most critical nodes before laying out high-speed cells and investigate potential layouts that minimize the junction capacitance of these nodes.\n\nAn additional design rule has been implicitly introduced in the previous example. Noticing that for junction $\\mathrm{J}_{2}$ in Figure 2.16, part of the active region boundary is only $2 \\lambda$ away from the gate, this minimum junction area is a typical design rule for this scenario.\n\nSeveral additional design rules are required beyond those mentioned. Some of these are described below, with reference to the layout of a digital inverter, illustrated in Figure 2.17. Notice that the n-well surrounds the p-channel active region, and therefore the $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$junctions of the p-channel transistors, by at least $3 \\lambda$. Additionally, the minimum spacing between the n-well and the junctions of n-channel transistors in the substrate is $5 \\lambda$. This large spacing is necessary due to the significant lateral diffusion of the $n$-well and the fact that if the n-channel junction became short-circuited to the n-well, which is connected to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DD}}$, the circuit would not function. Conversely, a $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$substrate tie can be much closer to a well because it is always connected to ground and is separated from the well by a reverse-biased junction. A typical dimension here might be $2 \\lambda$. Since a p-channel junction must be inside the well by at least $3 \\lambda$ and an n-channel junction must be outside the well by $5 \\lambda$, the closest an n-channel transistor can be placed to a p-channel transistor is $8 \\lambda$.\n\nNoticing in Figure 2.17 that metal is used to connect the junctions of the p-channel and n-channel transistors. Typically, the metal must overlap any underlying contacts by at least $\\lambda$. A typical minimum width for first-level metal might be $2 \\lambda$, the same as the minimum width for polysilicon. However, it can be wider, as in Figure 2.17, where it is $4 \\lambda$ wide.\n\nAdditionally, in Figure 2.17, a single contact opening, known as a butting contact, is used to connect both the p-channel transistor source and an $\\mathrm{n}^{+}$well tie, as both will be connected to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DD}}$. Although the outlines of the $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$and $\\mathrm{n}^{+}$masks are not shown in Figure 2.17, under the contact, one half will be doped $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$(the p-channel junction) and one half will be doped $\\mathrm{n}^{+}$(the well tie). Also, for the n-channel transistor, a butting contact is used to connect the n-channel source to a $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$substrate tie, and both will be connected to ground. In a typical set of design rules, a maximum distance between transistors and well (or substrate) ties is specified, and a maximum distance between substrate ties is also specified. For example, the rules might specify that no transistor can be more than $100 \\lambda$ from a substrate tie. These rules are necessary to prevent latch-up, a phenomenon described later in this chapter.\nimage_name:(a)description:\n[\nname: Q1, type: NMOS, ports: {S: Gnd, D: Vout, G: Vin}\nname: Q2, type: PMOS, ports: {S: VDD, D: Vout, G: Vin}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit diagram depicts a CMOS digital inverter with Q1 as the NMOS and Q2 as the PMOS transistor.

Moreover, the program may permit the designer to operate within the final dimensions they desire.

This adjusted mask size accounts for junction overlap due to lateral diffusion and polysilicon loss due to etching.\n\nIn contemporary layout software, the layout for certain circuit cells might already be pre-created and stored in a library.

This increased mask sizing accounts for junction overlap due to lateral diffusion and polysilicon loss due to etching.\n\nIn contemporary layout programs, the layouts for certain circuit cells may already be pre-designed and stored in a library. During the overall layout process, these cells are then adapted to the required size, and the corresponding geometries for each layer are automatically generated.

The intersection of these two masks forms the channel region of MOS transistors. For instance, consider Fig. 2.14(a), which shows a simplified view of a MOS transistor, and Fig. 2.14(b), which shows the corresponding layout of the active mask and the polysilicon, or poly, mask. In Fig. $2.14(b)$, the poly mask runs vertically. The length of the poly that intersects the active-region mask is the transistor width, W, and the width of the poly line is the transistor length, L, as shown in Fig. 2.14.\n\nThe design rules for transistor layouts are often expressed in terms of a quantity, $\\lambda$, where $\\lambda$ is $1 / 2$ the minimum permitted gate length. This generalization allows many of the design rules to be expressed simply, independent of the true value for the minimum channel length (i.e., $2 \\lambda$). Figure 2.14(b) shows the smallest possible transistor that can be realized in a given process when a contact must be made to each junction. It also shows many of the minimum dimensions in terms of $\\lambda$.\n\nWhen expressing design rules in terms of $\\lambda$, it is assumed that each mask has a worst-case alignment of under $0.75 \\lambda$. This ensures that the relative misalignment between any two masks is under $1.5 \\lambda$. If an overlap between any two regions of a microcircuit could cause a destructive short circuit, then a separation between the corresponding regions in the layout of $2 \\lambda$ guarantees that this will never happen. For example, consider the poly mask and the contact mask in Fig. 2.14(b). If these two regions overlap in the microcircuit, then the metal used to contact the source junction is also short-circuited to the gate poly, causing the transistor to be always turned off, as shown in Fig. 2.15. If the source happens to be connected to ground, this error also short-circuits the gate-to-ground. To prevent this type of short, the contact openings must be kept at least $2 \\lambda$ away from the polysilicon gates.\n\nAnother example of a catastrophic failure due to misalignment is a gate that does not fully cross the active region (also shown in Fig. 2.15). Since the junctions are implanted everywhere in the active region except under the gate, this misalignment causes a short circuit between the source and the drain-thus the design rule that polysilicon must always extend at least $2 \\lambda$ past the active region.\n\nAnother design rule is that active regions should surround contacts by at least $1 \\lambda$. If, in reality, an overlap exists between the edge of the active-region mask and the contact mask, no disastrous shorts occur. The circuit still works correctly as long as sufficient overlap exists between the contact and the active masks so that a good connection is made between the aluminum interconnect and the junction. Since the maximum relative misalignment is $1.5 \\lambda$, having the source (or drain) region surround the contact by $1 \\lambda$ and a minimum contact width of $2 \\lambda$ guarantees an overlap of at least $1.5 \\lambda$.\n\nThe few design rules just described are sufficient to allow one to estimate the minimum dimensions of a junction area and perimeter before a transistor has been laid out. For example, assume that in Fig. 2.14 a contact is to be made to a junction; then the active region must extend past the polysilicon region by at least $5 \\lambda$. Thus, the minimum area of a small junction with a contact to it is:\n\n$$\nA_{s}=A_{d}=5 \\lambda \\mathrm{~W} \\tag{2.4}\n$$\n\nwhere W is the transistor width. Similarly, in Fig. 2.14, the perimeter of a junction with a contact is given by:\n\n$$\nP_{s}=P_{d}=10 \\lambda+W \\tag{2.5}\n$$\n\nThese estimates may be used when estimating the parasitic capacitances in the transistor models. They may also be used in SPICE to simulate circuits so that the parasitic capacitances are determined more accurately. However, note that they are only estimates; the true layout will differ somewhat from these rough estimates.\n\nKey Point: Finite tolerances during integrated circuit manufacturing impose constraints on the minimum sizes and spacing of transistor and interconnect features. These constraints may be expressed as multiples of $\\lambda$, equal to one-half the minimum gate length. They influence parasitic capacitances, and ultimately the circuit bandwidth which an analog designer may expect.\n\nSometimes, when it is important to minimize the capacitance of a junction, a single junction can be shared between two transistors. For example, consider the series connection of two transistors shown in Fig. 2.16(a). The active, poly, and contact masks might be laid out as shown in Fig. 2.16(b). Notice that a single junction is shared between transistors $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$. The area, and especially the perimeter of this junction, are much smaller than those given by equations (2.4) and (2.5). Also, in a SPICE simulation, the area and perimeter should be divided by 2 when they are specified in each transistor description, since the junction is shared. Alternatively, all of the area and perimeter could be specified in one transistor description, and the area and perimeter of the other junction could be specified as zero.\n\nSince the junction sidewall capacitance is directly proportional to the junction perimeter, and since this capacitance can be a major part of the total junction capacitance (because of the heavily doped field-implants), minimizing the perimeter is important. Note that it is impossible to share junctions between n-channel and p-channel devices as they must be located in separate substrate regions doped p- and n type respectively.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 2.1\n\nAssuming $\\lambda=0.2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$, find the area and perimeters of junctions $J_{1}, J_{2}$, and $J_{3}$ for the circuit in Fig. 2.16.\n\n#### Solution\n\nSince the width and length are shown as $10 \\lambda$ and $2 \\lambda$, respectively, and $\\lambda=0.2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$, the physical sizes are $\\mathrm{W}=2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ and $\\mathrm{L}=0.4 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nThus, for junction $J_{1}$, using the formulas of (2.4) and (2.5), we have:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{A}_{\\mathrm{J}_{1}}=5 \\lambda \\mathrm{~W}=5(0.2) 2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2}=2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2} \\tag{2.6}\n$$\n\nand:\n\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{J} 1}=10 \\lambda+W=[10(0.2)+2] \\mu \\mathrm{m}=4 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\tag{2.7}\n$$\n\nSince this junction is connected to ground, its parasitic capacitance is unimportant and little has been done to minimize its area. Contrast this case with junction $J_{2}$, where we have:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{A}_{\\mathrm{J} 2}=2 \\lambda \\mathrm{~W}+12 \\lambda^{2}=1.28 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2} \\tag{2.8}\n$$\n\nThe perimeter is unchanged, resulting in $P_{\\mathrm{J} 2}=4 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$. Thus, we have decreased the junction area by using the fact that the transistor is much wider than the single contact used. However, sometimes wide transistors require additional contacts to minimize the contact impedance. For example, the two contacts used for junction $J_{1}$ result in roughly half the contact impedance of junction $J_{2}$.\n\nNext, consider the shared junction. Here we have a junction area given by:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{A}_{\\mathrm{J} 3}=2 \\lambda \\mathrm{~W}=0.8 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2} \\tag{2.9}\n$$\n\nSince this is a shared junction, in a SPICE simulation we would use:\n\n$$\nA_{s}=A_{d}=\\lambda W=0.4 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2} \\tag{2.10}\n$$\n\nfor each of the two transistors, which is much less than $2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2}$. The reduction in the perimeter is even more substantial. Here we have:\n\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{J} 3}=4 \\lambda=0.8 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\tag{2.11}\n$$\n\nfor the shared junction; so sharing this perimeter value over the two transistors would result in:\n\n$$\nP_{S}=P_{d}=2 \\lambda=0.4 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\tag{2.12}\n$$\n\nfor the appropriate junction of each transistor when simulating it in SPICE. This result is much less than the $4-\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ perimeter for node $J_{1}$.\n\nBecause minimizing the junction capacitance is so important, one of the first steps an experienced designer takes before laying out important high-speed cells is first to identify the most critical nodes and then to investigate possible layouts that minimize the junction capacitance of these nodes.\n\nAn additional design rule has been implicitly introduced in the previous example. Notice that for junction $\\mathrm{J}_{2}$ in Fig. 2.16, part of the active region boundary is only $2 \\lambda$ away from the gate. This minimum junction area is the typical design rule for this case.\n\nSeveral design rules are required in addition to those just mentioned. Some of these are described next, with reference to the layout of a digital inverter, shown in Fig. 2.17. Notice that the n well surrounds the p-channel active region, and therefore the $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$ junctions of the p-channel transistors, by at least $3 \\lambda$. Notice also that the minimum spacing between the n well and the junctions of n-channel transistors, in the substrate, is $5 \\lambda$. This large spacing is required because of the large lateral diffusion of the $n$ well and the fact that if the $n$-channel junction became short-circuited to the n well, which is connected to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DD}}$, the circuit would not work. Conversely, a $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$-substrate tie can be much closer to a well because it is always connected to ground and is separated from the well by a reverse-biased junction. A typical dimension here might be $2 \\lambda$. Since a $p$-channel junction must be inside the well by at least $3 \\lambda$ and an $n$-channel junction must be outside the well by $5 \\lambda$, the closest an $n$-channel transistor can be placed to a $p$-channel transistor is $8 \\lambda$.\n\nNotice in Fig. 2.17 that metal is used to connect the junctions of the p-channel and n-channel transistors. Normally, the metal must overlap any underlying contacts by at least $\\lambda$. A typical minimum width for first-level metal might be $2 \\lambda$, the same as the minimum width for polysilicon. However, it can be wider as in Fig. 2."

    "text": "In the design phase, the layout program often automates the creation of certain masks, such as those for the $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{n}^{+}$ regions used in the source and drain. This automation extends to adjusting mask dimensions to compensate for diffusion or etching effects, resulting in masks that are slightly larger or smaller than initially specified by the designer. For instance, a designer might sketch a polysilicon line with the intention of creating a $0.1-\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ transistor length, but the program could adjust the mask to produce a $0.12-\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ line width to account for diffusion and etching losses.\n\nModern layout software includes libraries of pre-designed circuit cells that can be resized and adapted automatically during the layout process. These cells are not only parametrically scaled but also connected and placed by the program, allowing the designer to make interactive adjustments to the auto-generated layout. This increasing automation is especially beneficial as more cells become available. However, for critical cells requiring compact layouts or high-speed performance, the designer retains direct control. For example, the layout of a memory cell, where space and capacitive loading are crucial, is rarely left to automation.\n\nThe active region and gate polysilicon masks are the most significant, as their overlap defines the MOS transistor's channel. Figures 2.14(a) and 2.14(b) depict a simplified MOS transistor and its corresponding layout masks, respectively. In Figure 2.14(b), the vertical poly mask's intersection with the active region determines the transistor's width (W) and length (L).\n\nDesign rules for transistor layout commonly employ the parameter $\\lambda$, which is half the minimum allowed gate length. This abstraction simplifies the expression of design rules, decoupling them from the actual minimum channel length (i.e., $2 \\lambda$). Figure 2.14(b) illustrates the smallest possible transistor, considering the need for contacts at each junction, and presents several minimum dimensions in terms of $\\lambda$.\n\nUsing $\\lambda$ assumes each mask has a worst-case alignment error of less than $0.75 \\lambda$, ensuring that any two masks will not be misaligned by more than $1.5 \\lambda$. A separation of $2 \\lambda$ in the layout prevents short circuits in the microcircuit if any overlap would be destructive. For example, maintaining a $2 \\lambda$ separation between the poly mask and contact mask in Figure 2.14(b) avoids short-circuiting the gate to the source.\n\nCatastrophic failures due to misalignment include cases where the gate does not fully overlap the active region, leading to a short between the source and drain. To prevent this, the polysilicon must extend at least $2 \\lambda$ beyond the active region. Additionally, active regions should envelop contacts by at least $1 \\lambda$ to ensure a good connection without causing a short.\n\nEstimating the minimum dimensions of a junction area and perimeter before transistor layout is possible using these design rules. For example, if a contact is to be made to a junction, the active region must extend at least $5 \\lambda$ beyond the polysilicon region. This information is useful for estimating parasitic capacitances in transistor models and simulating circuits in SPICE.\n\nKey Point: Manufacturing tolerances necessitate constraints on the minimum sizes and spacing of transistor and interconnect features, expressed as multiples of $\\lambda$. These constraints impact parasitic capacitances and, consequently, the circuit bandwidth.\n\nIn certain scenarios, like minimizing junction capacitance, a single junction can be shared between two transistors. For instance, in a series connection of two transistors, the layout may feature a shared junction, significantly reducing the area and perimeter compared to individual junctions.\n\nDesign rules also dictate the minimum pitch and width for polysilicon and metal interconnects. These rules ensure proper electrical isolation and connectivity within the microcircuit.\n\nThese examples and rules provide a foundational understanding of layout and design principles. In modern processes, numerous additional design rules exist, but their application and reasoning align with the concepts described. Design rules are typically integrated into layout CAD programs, enabling automatic checks during the design process."

    "text": "Latch-up is a detrimental phenomenon in CMOS integrated circuits that can arise when there are significant substrate or well currents, or equivalently, substantial substrate or well voltage drops, often due to capacitive coupling. These triggering voltage drops frequently occur when power is initially applied to a CMOS integrated circuit.\n\nA circuit that has latched up is akin to a silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) being turned on between the power supply and ground. This SCR effectively creates a short-circuit across the power supplies in the microcircuit, and unless the supply current is limited, severe damage is likely to occur, such as a fused open bonding wire or interconnect line.\n\nTo comprehend latch-up, examine the cross section of the CMOS inverter depicted in Fig. 2.20, which includes the parasitic bipolar transistors $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$. Transistor $Q_{1}$ is a lateral npn, with its base formed by the $\\mathrm{p}^{-}$ substrate, while $Q_{2}$ is a vertical pnp, with its base formed by the $n$-well region. The parasitic bipolar circuit, along with some parasitic resistances due to the lightly doped substrate and well regions, has been redrawn in Fig. 2.21. This circuit forms two cross-coupled common-emitter amplifiers in a positive feedback loop, essentially creating an SCR, sometimes called a crowbar switch.\n\nUnder normal conditions, the parasitic bipolar transistors are off, and the voltages are as depicted in Fig. 2.21(a). However, if latch-up is triggered, these transistors turn on when the loop gain exceeds unity, resulting in voltages similar to those shown in Fig. $2.21(b)$. This activated SCR effectively shorts the power-supply voltage, causing $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DD}}$ to drop to around 0.9 V. Without a current limit on the power supply, excessive current can flow, potentially destroying parts of the microcircuit.\n\nTo avert latch-up, the loop gain of the cross-coupled bipolar inverters is maintained below unity by ensuring low-impedance paths from the power supplies to the substrate and well, leading to low $R_{n}$ and $R_{p}$. In n-well technology, design rules typically specify a maximum distance between any point in the n-channel region and the nearest $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$ junction, which connects the substrate to ground.\n\nimage_name: Fig. 2.20 Cross section of a CMOS inverter with superimposed schematic of the parasitic transistors responsible for the latch-up mechanism\ndescription: The image illustrates a cross-sectional view of a CMOS inverter with superimposed schematic representations of the parasitic transistors that cause latch-up.

Examples of these effects are depicted in Fig. 2.22.\n\nFor instance, Fig. 2.22(a) illustrates how the effective area of a well typically exceeds its mask size due to lateral diffusion, which occurs not only during ion implantation but also during subsequent high-temperature processes like annealing. Another effect, known as overetching, happens during the etching of layers such as polysilicon or metal. Figure 2.22(b) shows an example of overetching that takes place beneath the\n\nKey Point: Systematic variations are those consistently observed, even in mass-produced circuits. These can generally be mitigated through proper layout techniques, though this may involve trade-offs in layout size or performance. Process variations arise because manufacturing conditions (like temperature and concentration levels) cannot be precisely controlled, leading to device parameters that differ between samples. Random variations are statistical in nature and present in every individual device, causing mismatches between identically specified transistors fabricated under the same nominal conditions.\n\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:This image comprises three diagrams labeled (a), (b), and (c), each depicting various two-dimensional effects in microcircuit fabrication that result in deviations between realized components and their intended layout sizes.\n\n1. **Diagram (a):** This diagram shows the impact of lateral diffusion beneath an SiO2 mask. It presents a cross-section of a semiconductor substrate with a well region. The SiO2 protection layer is indicated on top, with arrows showing the lateral diffusion occurring beneath the SiO2 mask.

The SiO2 protection layer is visible, with a polysilicon gate beneath it. The overetching process results in the reduction of the polysilicon gate size compared to the mask layout. Arrows indicate the affected regions, highlighting how the gate becomes narrower than intended.\n\n3. **Diagram (c):** This part shows a cross-section of an n-channel transistor viewed along the channel from the drain to the source. The diagram highlights the narrowing of the transistor channel width due to the presence of p+ field implants. The polysilicon gate is shown over the channel, with arrows indicating the narrowing effect on the channel width. This narrowing critically affects the transistor's electrical characteristics.\n\nOverall, these diagrams illustrate common fabrication issues in microelectronics, such as lateral diffusion, overetching, and channel narrowing, which contribute to variations between designed and actual sizes of microcircuit components.\n\nimage_name:(b)\ndescription:The image labeled \"(b)\" is a diagram illustrating the overetching effect on a microcircuit component, specifically focusing on the polysilicon gate structure.

This diagram is part of a series explaining how different two-dimensional effects can cause discrepancies between the realized sizes of microcircuit components and their intended layout sizes.\n\n1. **Identification of Components and Structure:**\n- The diagram shows a polysilicon gate, a crucial component in the transistor structure, positioned over the channel region connecting the drain and source.\n- The transistor channel is marked, indicating the current flow path when the transistor is active.\n- The diagram also shows p+ field implants on either side of the channel, used to control the transistor's electrical characteristics.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- The polysilicon gate interacts with the channel, controlling current flow between the source and drain when a voltage is applied.\n- The narrowing of the channel width is highlighted, a result of process variations affecting the transistor's electrical performance.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- The polysilicon gate is clearly labeled, showing its position relative to the channel.\n- \"Transistor channel\" is labeled to indicate the main conductive path.\n- \"Channel width narrowing\" is annotated to highlight the reduction in channel width due to fabrication effects.\n- The presence of p+ field implants is noted, enhancing the transistor's performance by modifying the electric field distribution.\n\nThis diagram effectively illustrates the impact of fabrication processes on the physical dimensions of a transistor, emphasizing deviations from the intended design due to various manufacturing effects.\n\nFig. 2.22 Various two-dimensional effects causing sizes of realized microcircuit components to differ from sizes of layout masks.\n$\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ protective layer at the polysilicon edges and causes the polysilicon layer to be smaller than the corresponding mask layout. A third effect is shown in Fig. 2.22(c), where an n-channel transistor is viewed along the channel from the drain to the source. The transistor width is defined by the active region's width, not the polysilicon line width, and is determined by the isolation oxide separation between transistors (i.e., the field-oxide in a LOCOS process). The $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$ field implant under the field-oxide increases the effective substrate doping at the transistor sides, raising the threshold voltage near the edges and decreasing the channel-charge density. This results in an effective transistor width smaller than the layout mask width.\n\nThe surrounding features of a device can also affect its electrical performance. For example, neighboring conductors introduce parasitic capacitances in a circuit. Additionally, subtle proximity effects occur. For instance, during ion implantation for well formation, some incident atoms scatter near the photoresist edge, as shown in Fig. 2.23. This leads to elevated dopant concentrations at the n-well surface near the edge, gradually decreasing over a distance of $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ or more [Drennan, 2006]. Consequently, transistor threshold voltages vary significantly based on their location and orientation relative to\n\nIon implantation beam\nimage_name:Fig. 2.23\ndescription:The diagram, labeled as Fig. 2.23, illustrates the well edge proximity effect caused by ion implantation. It includes a photoresist layer (labeled PR1), an n-well, and a p-type substrate (labeled p-). Below the photoresist is a silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer.\n\nVertical arrows represent the ion implantation beam directed towards the surface. These ions penetrate the photoresist and enter the n-well. Near the photoresist edge, some ions scatter, causing a higher dopant concentration at the n-well surface near its edge. This scattering effect is shown by arrows deflecting off the photoresist edge and entering the n-well at an angle.\n\nThe diagram highlights the region of elevated dopant concentration, indicated by a circled area labeled 'Higher dopant concentration near well edge.' This effect results from ion scattering during implantation, creating a gradient in dopant concentration that decreases with distance from the well edge.

The trench formation and filling process induces compressive stress on the silicon lattice, as shown in Fig. 2.24. This compressive stress reduces electron mobility and increases hole mobility, and can also influence dopant diffusion rates, affecting threshold voltage. Since these stress effects are localized near the active region edges, they can cause mismatches between transistors with different layouts. For example, transistors sharing the same active region must be oriented equidistantly from the edge and have the same orientation to the edge (e.g., both having their source closer to the edge). A conservative approach includes adding dummy transistor structures near the edge of each active region to ensure no active analog transistors are close to an STI trench. In advanced processes, two dummies may be required on each edge [Drennan, 2006].\n\nKey Point: The absolute sizes and electrical parameters of integrated circuit components are often difficult to determine accurately. For optimal accuracy, larger objects are constructed from multiple unit-sized components connected together, and boundary conditions around all objects should be matched, even if it means adding extra unused components.\n\nThese examples illustrate typical systematic effects, but many other second-order effects influence realized components. These include boundary condition effects, the size of openings in protective layouts for etching, and surface unevenness of the microcircuit [Maloberti, 1994]. For these reasons, the absolute sizes and electrical parameters of integrated circuit components are seldom accurately predictable. For the best accuracy, larger objects should be assembled from several unit-sized components, and boundary conditions around all objects should be matched, even if it involves adding extra unused components. Inaccuracies also affect size ratios when the ratio is not unity, though to a lesser extent."

A third effect is shown in Fig. 2.22(c), where an n-channel transistor is viewed along the channel from the drain to the source. The transistor width is defined by the active region's width, not the polysilicon line width, and is determined by the separation of the isolation oxide between transistors (i.e., the field-oxide in a LOCOS process). The $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$ field implant under the field-oxide increases the effective substrate doping at the transistor sides, raising the threshold voltage near the edges and decreasing the channel-charge density. Consequently, the effective transistor width is less than the width drawn on the layout mask.\n\nThe features surrounding a device can also affect its electrical performance. For example, neighboring conductors can introduce parasitic capacitances in a circuit. Additionally, more subtle proximity effects exist. For instance, during ion implantation for well formation, some incident atoms scatter near the photoresist edge, as shown in Fig. 2.23. This results in elevated dopant concentration at the n-well surface near the edge, gradually decreasing over a distance of $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ or more [Drennan, 2006].

A third effect is shown in Fig. 2.22(c), where an n-channel transistor is depicted as viewed along the channel from the drain to the source. The transistor width is defined by the active region width, not the polysilicon line width, and this width is determined by the separation of the isolation oxide between transistors (i.e., the field-oxide in a LOCOS process). The $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$ field implant under the field-oxide increases the effective substrate doping at the transistor sides, raising the threshold voltage near the edges and decreasing the channel-charge density. Consequently, the effective transistor width is less than the width drawn on the layout mask.\n\nThe surrounding features of a device can also affect its electrical performance. For instance, neighboring conductors can introduce parasitic capacitances in a circuit. Additionally, more subtle proximity effects exist. For example, during ion implantation for well formation, some incident atoms scatter near the photoresist edge, as shown in Fig. 2.23. This results in elevated dopant concentration at the n-well surface near the edge, gradually decreasing over a distance of $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ or more [Drennan, 2006]. Thus, transistor threshold voltages vary significantly based on their location and orientation relative to the well edge.\n\nIon implantation beam\nimage_name:Fig. 2.23\ndescription:Fig. 2.23 illustrates the well edge proximity effect caused by ion implantation.

The formation and filling of trenches induce compressive stress on the silicon lattice, as shown in Fig. 2.24. This stress reduces electron mobility and increases hole mobility, and can also affect dopant diffusion rates, thereby impacting threshold voltage. Since stress effects are localized near the active OD region edges, they can cause mismatches between transistors with different layouts. For instance, transistors sharing the same active region must be oriented equidistantly from the edge and have the same orientation (e.g., both having their source closer to the edge). A cautious approach includes placing dummy transistor structures near the edge of every active region to prevent active analog transistors from being close to an STI trench.

It shows a cross-section of a semiconductor substrate with a well region, an SiO2 protection layer on top, and arrows indicating lateral diffusion under the SiO2 mask. This diffusion extends the well beyond the mask boundaries, affecting the component's size and performance.\n\n2. **Diagram (b):** This section shows the overetching effect on a polysilicon gate. The SiO2 protection layer is visible, with a polysilicon gate underneath. Overetching reduces the gate size compared to the mask layout, as indicated by arrows showing the affected regions.\n\n3. **Diagram (c):** This part presents a cross-section of an n-channel transistor viewed along the channel from drain to source. It highlights the narrowing of the transistor channel width due to p+ field implants. The polysilicon gate is shown over the channel, with arrows indicating the narrowing effect, which influences the transistor's electrical characteristics.\n\nThese diagrams collectively illustrate common fabrication issues like lateral diffusion, overetching, and channel narrowing, contributing to variations between designed and actual sizes of microcircuit components.\n\nimage_name:(b)\ndescription:The diagram labeled \"(b)\" illustrates the overetching effect on a microcircuit component, focusing on the polysilicon gate structure. It is a cross-sectional view highlighting several key elements:\n\n1. **Components and Structure:**\n- **SiO₂ Protection Layer:** Located at the top, this layer provides protection during etching.\n- **Polysilicon Gate:** Positioned beneath the SiO₂ layer, this is a crucial component in transistor fabrication.\n- **Overetching:** The diagram shows how material is etched beyond intended dimensions, reducing the polysilicon gate size.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- Overetching affects the size and shape of the polysilicon gate, impacting the transistor's electrical characteristics due to the critical nature of gate dimensions.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- The diagram includes arrows indicating the SiO₂ protection and polysilicon gate.\n- Annotations highlight the overetching effect, emphasizing its impact on design dimensions.\n\nThis diagram demonstrates how manufacturing variations can alter the physical dimensions of microcircuit components, specifically the polysilicon gate size, leading to performance variations.\n\nimage_name:(c)\ndescription:Fig. 2.22(c) shows a cross-sectional view of an n-channel transistor, focusing on how process variations affect its physical dimensions. This diagram is part of a series explaining how two-dimensional effects cause discrepancies between realized and intended sizes of microcircuit components.\n\n1. **Identification of Components and Structure:**\n- The polysilicon gate, a critical component, is positioned over the channel connecting the drain and source.\n- The transistor channel is marked, indicating the current flow path.\n- p+ field implants on either side of the channel control the transistor's electrical characteristics.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- The polysilicon gate interacts with the channel to control current flow when a voltage is applied.\n- The diagram highlights the narrowing of the channel width due to process variations, affecting electrical performance.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- The polysilicon gate and transistor channel are clearly labeled.\n- \"Channel width narrowing\" is annotated to show the reduction in width due to fabrication effects.\n- The presence of p+ field implants is noted for their role in enhancing performance.\n\nThis diagram effectively illustrates the impact of fabrication processes on a transistor's physical dimensions, highlighting deviations from the intended design due to manufacturing effects.\n\nFig. 2.22 Various two-dimensional effects causing sizes of realized microcircuit components to differ from sizes of layout masks.\n$\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ protective layer at the polysilicon edges and causes the polysilicon layer to be smaller than the corresponding mask layout. A third effect shown in Fig. 2.22(c) involves an n-channel transistor viewed along the channel from drain to source. The transistor width is defined by the active region's width, determined by the isolation oxide separation between transistors (e.g., field-oxide in a LOCOS process). The $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$ field implant under the field-oxide increases substrate doping at the transistor sides, raising the threshold voltage near the edges and decreasing channel-charge density. Consequently, the effective transistor width is less than the layout mask width.\n\nThe device's surrounding features can also affect its electrical performance. For instance, neighboring conductors cause parasitic capacitances. Subtle proximity effects include ion implantation scattering near the photoresist edge during well formation, as shown in Fig. 2.23. This results in elevated dopant concentration at the n-well surface near the edge, gradually decreasing over a distance of $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ or more [Drennan, 2006]. Thus, transistor threshold voltages vary based on their location and orientation relative to the well edge. A conservative analog designer might layout transistors at a minimum distance from any well edge, perhaps $3 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$, to avoid this effect—a significant distance in technologies with feature sizes below 100 nm.\n\nimage_name:Fig. 2.23\ndescription:Fig. 2.23 illustrates the well edge proximity effect due to ion implantation scattering. It includes a photoresist layer (PR1), an n-well, and a p-type substrate (p-). Below the photoresist is an SiO2 layer.\n\nVertical arrows represent the ion implantation beam. Ions penetrate the photoresist and enter the n-well, with some scattering near the edge, leading to higher dopant concentration at the n-well surface near the edge. This is shown by arrows deflecting off the photoresist edge and entering the n-well at an angle.\n\nThe diagram highlights the region of elevated dopant concentration near the well edge, affecting transistor threshold voltages based on their proximity to the edge, a critical factor in analog circuit design.\n\nFig. 2.23 The well edge proximity effect caused by scattering during ion implantation.\n\nShallow-trench isolation (STI) also impacts the electrical properties of surrounding silicon. The trench formation and filling induce compressive stress on the silicon lattice, as shown in Fig. 2.24. This stress reduces electron mobility and increases hole mobility, influencing dopant diffusion rates and threshold voltage. Since stress affects devices near the active region edges, it can cause mismatches between non-identically laid out transistors. For instance, transistors sharing the same active region must be equidistant from the edge and similarly oriented. A conservative approach includes dummy transistor structures near the edge of each active region to ensure no active analog transistors are close to an STI trench. In advanced processes, two dummies may be required on each edge [Drennan, 2006].\n\nimage_name:Fig. 2.24\ndescription:Fig. 2.24 illustrates the effects of shallow-trench isolation (STI) on surrounding silicon and transistor parameters. It is a cross-sectional view of a semiconductor substrate with several components:\n\n1. **Identification of Components and Structure:**\n- **Polysilicon Gate:** Multiple polysilicon gates are positioned above the silicon substrate.\n- **SiO2 (Silicon Dioxide):** STI regions filled with SiO2 are depicted as hatched sections extending into the silicon.\n- **n+ Regions:** Beneath the polysilicon gates, n+ doped regions indicate the source and drain locations.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- STI regions create compressive stress on the surrounding silicon, indicated by arrows labeled \"STI Stress\" pointing towards the n+ regions, affecting electron and hole mobility.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- Labels identify the polysilicon gate, SiO2, and n+ regions.\n- \"STI Stress\" arrows indicate the direction and effect of the stress on the silicon lattice.\n\nThis image highlights how STI impacts the mechanical and electrical characteristics of the silicon substrate, crucial for understanding transistor performance in analog circuit design.\n\n$\\mathrm{p}^{-}$\n\nFig. 2.24 Shallow-trench isolation (STI) places stress on the surrounding silicon affecting nearby transistor parameters.\n\nKey Point: The absolute sizes and electrical parameters of integrated circuit components are often difficult to determine accurately. For optimal accuracy, larger objects are constructed from multiple unit-sized components connected together, and boundary conditions around all objects should be matched, even if it means adding extra unused components.\n\nThese examples highlight typical systematic effects, but numerous second-order effects also influence realized components. These include boundary conditions, the size of protective layout openings for etching, and surface unevenness of the microcircuit [Maloberti, 1994]. Consequently, the absolute sizes and electrical parameters of integrated circuit components are seldom precisely determinable. For the best accuracy, larger objects are assembled from several unit-sized components, and boundary conditions must be matched, even if it requires adding extra unused components. Inaccuracies also affect size ratios, though to a lesser extent when the ratio is not unity."

    "text": "Even when there are no process variations, the precision with which devices can be manufactured is limited. For instance, in the channel region of contemporary minimum-size transistors, there may be as few as 100 dopants. It's impossible to guarantee that two transistors will have the exact same number and location of dopants, even if they have the same layout and are produced under the same conditions. As the number of dopants or their relative location varies randomly, so do transistor parameters such as threshold voltage. Channel dopants are just one source of uncertainty—there are several factors that contribute to random variations in device parameters.\n\nA fundamental analysis of the statistical variation of device parameters on a wafer [Pelgrom, 1989] predicts a Gaussian distribution with variance:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\sigma^{2}(\\Delta P)=\\frac{A_{P}^{2}}{W L}+S_{P}^{2} D^{2} \\tag{2.13}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Delta P$ is the difference in some device parameter $P$ between two devices spaced a distance $D$ apart, $W$ and $L$ are the dimensions of the device, and $A_{p}$ and $S_{p}$ are proportionality constants usually obtained from experimental measurements. Equation (2.13) captures only random variations in device parameters, not the systematic or process variations already described. The expression is general and can be applied to transistors, capacitors, resistors, etc. although it manifests itself slightly differently in different model parameters. For example, sometimes the variation is in absolute terms, and sometimes in relative terms.\n\nThe most important random variations in a MOSFET may be modelled by variations in $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{t}}$ (threshold voltage) and $\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}=\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{ox}}(\\mathrm{W} / \\mathrm{L})$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sigma^{2}\\left(\\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{t} 0}\\right) & =\\frac{\\mathrm{A}_{\\mathrm{vt} 0}^{2}}{\\mathrm{WL}}+\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{Vt} 0}^{2} \\mathrm{D}^{2}  \\tag{2.14}\\\\\n\\frac{\\sigma^{2}\\left(\\mathrm{~K}^{\\prime}\\right)}{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime 2}} & =\\frac{\\mathrm{A}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}^{2}}{\\mathrm{WL}}+\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}^{2} \\mathrm{D}^{2} \\tag{2.15}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nAlthough there is some debate in this regard, it is generally conservatively assumed that statistical variations in $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{t}}$ and $\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}$ are uncorrelated. These expressions clearly illustrate the need to closely space devices whose mismatch is of concern to us. Prime examples are differentially paired transistors and current mirroring transistors. Assuming this is done, the area dependent term will dominate and is therefore our focus.\n\n#### Mismatch in Transistors with the Same $V_{G S}$\n\nTransistors biased with the same gate-source voltage will have currents that vary as follows [Kinget, 2005]:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left(\\frac{\\sigma\\left(\\Delta \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}\\right)}{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}}\\right)^{2}=\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m}}}{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}}\\right)^{2} \\sigma^{2}\\left(\\Delta \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{t}}\\right)+\\frac{\\sigma^{2}\\left(\\Delta \\mathrm{~K}^{\\prime}\\right)}{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime 2}} \\tag{2.16}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nKey Point: The parameters of devices that are closely spaced with identical layout exhibit a random variance inversely proportional to device area. In practice, the most important random variations in most analog circuits are $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{t}}$ mismatch.\n\nThis does not presume a square law and is therefore valid over all operating regions. Since both $\\Delta V_{T}$ and $\\Delta K^{\\prime}$ are inversely proportional to the square root of device area, the overall relative current mismatch is also inversely proportional to the square root of the device area. Substituting (2.14) and (2.15) into (2.16) and assuming closely-spaced devices so we may neglect the terms with $\\mathrm{D} \\approx 0$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left(\\frac{\\sigma\\left(\\Delta I_{D}\\right)}{I_{D}}\\right)^{2}=\\frac{1}{W L}\\left[A_{V t o}^{2}\\left(\\frac{g_{m}}{I_{D}}\\right)^{2}+A_{K^{\\prime}}^{2}\\right] \\tag{2.17}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHence if we want to improve the current matching by a factor of 2, we must quadruple the device area. This can be achieved, for example, by doubling both W and L.\n\n[^0]:    1. In fact, there will be slightly fewer mobile carriers than the number of impurity atoms since some of the free electrons from the dopants have recombined with holes. However, since the number of holes of intrinsic silicon is much less than typical doping concentrations, this inaccuracy is small.\n[^1]:    6. The drain and source regions are sometimes called diffusion regions or junctions for historical reasons. This use of the word junction\n[^2]:    7. The current is actually conducted by negative carriers (electrons) flowing from the source to the drain. Negative carriers flowing\n[^3]:    8. $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{G}}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CH}}(\\mathrm{x})$ is the gate-to-channel voltage drop at distance x from the source end, with $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{G}}$ being the same everywhere in the gate,\n[^4]:    9. Because of the body effect, the threshold voltage at the drain end of the transistor is increased, resulting in the true value of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS} \\text {-sat }}$ being slightly lower than $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$.\n10. The active region may also be called the saturation region, but this can lead to confusion because in the case of bipolar transistors, the saturation region occurs for small $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CE}}$, whereas for MOS transistors it occurs for large $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$. Moreover, we shall see that the drain current does not truly saturate, but continues to increase slightly with increasing drain-source voltage.\n[^5]:    11. In fact, JFETs intentionally modulate the conducting channel via a junction capacitance, hence their name: Junction Field-Effect Transistors.\n12. For an $n$-channel transistor. For a $p$-channel transistor, $\\gamma$ is proportional to the square root of $N_{D}$.\n13. It is possible to realize depletion p-channel transistors, but these are of little value and seldom worth the extra processing involved. Depletion n -channel transistors are also seldom encountered in CMOS microcircuits, although they might be worth the extra processing involved in some applications, especially if they were in a well.\n[^6]:    14. Whereas it is proportional to $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}$ for a BJT.\n[^7]:    1. Wells are doped regions that will contain one of the two types of transistors realized in a CMOS process. For example, wells that are n type contain p -channel transistors.\n[^8]:    2. If annealing were done after deposition of a metal layer, the metal would melt.\n\nFig. 2.25 depicts a simple current mirror circuit where $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{GS}, 1}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{GS}, 2}$. The currents will therefore vary with a standard deviation given by (2.17). Under a square law, $g_{m} / I_{D}=1 /\\left(2 \\mathrm{~V}_{\\text {eff }}\\right)$, so the first terms in (2.16) and (2.17) decrease with increasing $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$. In subthreshold, the first term approaches a constant maximum value of $g_{m} / I_{D}=q / n k T$. A plot of current mismatch representative of closely spaced $2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} / 0.2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ devices with the same $V_{G S}$ in a $0.18-\\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ CMOS process is presented in Fig. 2.26. Clearly, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{t}}{ }^{-}$ mismatch is the dominant source of error except at impractically large values of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{GS}}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{t}}$. This remains true even for large-area devices since both contributions are inversely proportional to device area, WL.\nimage_name:Fig. 2.25\ndescription:\n[\nname: Q1, type: NMOS, ports: {S: GND, D: VI, G: VI}\nname: Q2, type: NMOS, ports: {S: GND, D: LOAD2, G: VI}\nname: Iin, type: CurrentSource, ports: {Np: LOAD1, Nn: VI}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit is a simple current mirror with two NMOS transistors Q1 and Q2.

Assuming this is done, the area-dependent term will prevail, becoming our primary focus.\n\n#### Mismatch in Transistors with Identical $V_{G S}$\n\nTransistors biased with the same gate-source voltage will exhibit current variations as follows [Kinget, 2005]:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left(\\frac{\\sigma\\left(\\Delta \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}\\right)}{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}}\\right)^{2}=\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m}}}{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}}\\right)^{2} \\sigma^{2}\\left(\\Delta \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{t}}\\right)+\\frac{\\sigma^{2}\\left(\\Delta \\mathrm{~K}^{\\prime}\\right)}{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime 2}} \\tag{2.16}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nKey Point: Parameters of devices with identical layouts that are closely positioned exhibit a random variance inversely proportional to the device area. In practice, the most significant random fluctuations in most analog circuits are $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{t}}$ mismatch.\n\nThis does not assume a square law and is therefore valid across all operating regions. Since both $\\Delta V_{T}$ and $\\Delta K^{\\prime}$ are inversely proportional to the square root of the device area, the overall relative current mismatch is also inversely proportional to the square root of the device area. By substituting (2.14) and (2.15) into (2.16) and assuming closely-spaced devices so that terms with $\\mathrm{D} \\approx 0$ can be neglected,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left(\\frac{\\sigma\\left(\\Delta I_{D}\\right)}{I_{D}}\\right)^{2}=\\frac{1}{W L}\\left[A_{V t o}^{2}\\left(\\frac{g_{m}}{I_{D}}\\right)^{2}+A_{K^{\\prime}}^{2}\\right] \\tag{2.17}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, if we aim to enhance current matching by a factor of 2, we must quadruple the device area. This can be accomplished, for instance, by doubling both W and L.\n\n[^0]:    1. In fact, there will be slightly fewer mobile carriers than the number of impurity atoms since some of the free electrons from the dopants have recombined with holes. However, since the number of holes of intrinsic silicon is much less than typical doping concentrations, this inaccuracy is small.\n[^1]:    6. The drain and source regions are sometimes called diffusion regions or junctions for historical reasons. This use of the word junction\n[^2]:    7. The current is actually conducted by negative carriers (electrons) flowing from the source to the drain. Negative carriers flowing\n[^3]:    8. $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{G}}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CH}}(\\mathrm{x})$ is the gate-to-channel voltage drop at distance x from the source end, with $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{G}}$ being the same everywhere in the gate,\n[^4]:    9. Because of the body effect, the threshold voltage at the drain end of the transistor is increased, resulting in the true value of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS} \\text {-sat }}$ being slightly lower than $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$.\n10. The active region may also be called the saturation region, but this can lead to confusion because in the case of bipolar transistors, the saturation region occurs for small $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CE}}$, whereas for MOS transistors it occurs for large $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}$. Moreover, we shall see that the drain current does not truly saturate, but continues to increase slightly with increasing drain-source voltage.\n[^5]:    11. In fact, JFETs intentionally modulate the conducting channel via a junction capacitance, hence their name: Junction Field-Effect Transistors.\n12. For an $n$-channel transistor. For a $p$-channel transistor, $\\gamma$ is proportional to the square root of $N_{D}$.\n13. It is possible to realize depletion p-channel transistors, but these are of little value and seldom worth the extra processing involved. Depletion n -channel transistors are also seldom encountered in CMOS microcircuits, although they might be worth the extra processing involved in some applications, especially if they were in a well.\n[^6]:    14. Whereas it is proportional to $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}$ for a BJT.\n[^7]:    1. Wells are doped regions that will contain one of the two types of transistors realized in a CMOS process. For example, wells that are n type contain p -channel transistors.\n[^8]:    2. If annealing were done after deposition of a metal layer, the metal would melt.\n\nFigure 2.25 illustrates a simple current mirror circuit where $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{GS}, 1}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{GS}, 2}$. Consequently, the currents will vary with a standard deviation given by (2.17). Under a square law, $g_{m} / I_{D}=1 /\\left(2 \\mathrm{~V}_{\\text {eff }}\\right)$, so the first terms in (2.16) and (2.17) decrease with increasing $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$. In subthreshold, the first term approaches a constant maximum value of $g_{m} / I_{D}=q / n k T$. A plot of current mismatch representative of closely spaced $2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} / 0.2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ devices with the same $V_{G S}$ in a $0.18-\\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ CMOS process is presented in Fig. 2.26. Evidently, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{t}}{ }^{-}$ mismatch is the predominant source of error except at impractically large values of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{GS}}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{t}}$. This remains true even for large-area devices since both contributions are inversely proportional to device area, WL.\n\nFigure 2.25 A simple current mirror with mismatch.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 2.4\n\nSuppose a current mirror is to be biased with $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}=0.4 \\mathrm{~V}$, how large must the devices be to ensure the current mismatch has a standard deviation better than $1 \\%$ ? Assume that $A_{\\mathrm{vt} 0}=4 \\mathrm{mV} \\cdot \\mu \\mathrm{m}$ and $\\mathrm{A}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}=0.01 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\n#### Solution\n\nFrom Fig. 2.26, the $2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} / 0.2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ device has a standard deviation of $3.2 \\%$ at $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}=0.4 \\mathrm{~V}$. This will decrease with $\\sqrt{\\mathrm{WL}}$. Hence the device must be made $3.2^{2}=10.2$ times larger in area. For example, each device could be sized $6.5 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} / 0.65 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nFigure 2.26 considers two transistors of fixed size with the same value of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{GS}}$ and a drain current $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}$ that varies with $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$, in which case the best matching is obtained by selecting a large value of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$ where the impact of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{t}}$\nvariations is reduced. However, if instead the drain current $I_{D}$ is fixed and $V_{\\text {eff }}$ varies with device aspect ratio $(W / L)$, then the best matching is obtained at low values of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$ since that implies the largest devices.\n\n#### Mismatch in Differential Pairs\n\nFigure 2.27 A simple NMOS differential pair.\n\nConsider the differential pair in Fig. 2.27 where transistors $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ are subject to random variations. When the differential pair input is zero, $\\mathrm{V}^{+}=\\mathrm{V}^{-}$and $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{GS}, 1}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{GS}, 2}$, the currents will vary with a standard deviation given by (2.17). Hence the input offset voltage is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\sigma^{2}\\left(\\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{Os}}\\right)=\\frac{\\sigma^{2}\\left(\\Delta \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}\\right)}{\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m}}^{2}}=\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{WL}}\\left[\\mathrm{~A}_{\\mathrm{Vt} 0}^{2}+\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}}{\\mathrm{~g}_{\\mathrm{m}}}\\right)^{2} \\mathrm{~A}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}^{2}\\right] \\tag{2.18}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe first term will practically always dominate, particularly at the input of an opamp where the differential pair devices are sized to have high transconductance per unit of current, $g_{m} / I_{D}$.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 2.5\n\nIf a differential pair is to be biased with $\\mathrm{I}_{\\text {bias }}=200 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$, how large must the devices be sized to ensure the input offset is less than $1 \\mathrm{mV} 99.8 \\%$ of the time? Assume that $\\mathrm{A}_{\\mathrm{Vt}^{0}}=4 \\mathrm{mV} \\cdot \\mu \\mathrm{m}$ and $\\mathrm{A}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}=0.01 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\n#### Solution\n\nThe specs require the input offset to have a standard deviation better than $1 \\mathrm{mV} / 3=0.333 \\mathrm{mV}$. Each device has a nominal drain current of $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}=100 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$. Assuming that the first term is dominant, equation (2.18) gives\n\n$$\n(0.333 \\mathrm{mV})^{2} \\cong \\frac{(4 \\mathrm{mV} \\cdot \\mu \\mathrm{~m})^{2}}{\\mathrm{WL}} \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{WL}=144 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2}\n$$\n\nFor example, if the gate length is $L=0.5 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$, the device widths must be $\\mathrm{W}=288 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\n#### Mismatch in Transistors with Identical Currents\n\nFigure 2.28 Transistors biased with identical currents.\n\nShown in Fig. 2.28, transistors biased with the same currents will have gate-source voltage variations as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sigma^{2}\\left(\\Delta \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{GS}}\\right) & =\\sigma^{2}\\left(\\Delta \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{T}}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{\\sigma\\left(\\Delta \\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}\\right)}{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}}{\\mathrm{~g}_{\\mathrm{m}}}\\right)^{2} \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{WL}}\\left[\\mathrm{~A}_{\\mathrm{Vtt}^{2}}\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{~g}_{\\mathrm{m}}}{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}}\\right)^{2}+\\mathrm{A}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}^{2}\\right] \\tag{2.19}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere it is assumed in the second line that the devices are closely spaced. Again, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{t}}$-variations are likely to dominate in practice. This may be of interest in knowing how much headroom is available at a particular point in a circuit."

Hence the input offset voltage is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\sigma^{2}\\left(\\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{Os}}\\right)=\\frac{\\sigma^{2}\\left(\\Delta \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}\\right)}{\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m}}^{2}}=\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{WL}}\\left[\\mathrm{~A}_{\\mathrm{Vt} 0}^{2}+\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}}{\\mathrm{~g}_{\\mathrm{m}}}\\right)^{2} \\mathrm{~A}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}^{2}\\right] \\tag{2.18}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe first term will practically always dominate, particularly at the input of an opamp where the differential pair devices are sized to have high transconductance per unit of current, $g_{m} / I_{D}$.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 2.5\n\nIf a differential pair is to be biased with $\\mathrm{I}_{\\text {bias }}=200 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$, how large must the devices be sized to ensure the input offset is less than $1 \\mathrm{mV} 99.8 \\%$ of the time? Assume that $\\mathrm{A}_{\\mathrm{Vt}^{0}}=4 \\mathrm{mV} \\cdot \\mu \\mathrm{m}$ and $\\mathrm{A}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}=0.01 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\n#### Solution\n\nThe specs require the input offset to have a standard deviation better than $1 \\mathrm{mV} / 3=0.333 \\mathrm{mV}$. Each device has a nominal drain current of $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}=100 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$. Assuming that the first term is dominant, equation (2.18) gives\n\n$$\n(0.333 \\mathrm{mV})^{2} \\cong \\frac{(4 \\mathrm{mV} \\cdot \\mu \\mathrm{~m})^{2}}{\\mathrm{WL}} \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{WL}=144 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2}\n$$\n\nFor example, if the gate length is $L=0.5 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$"
