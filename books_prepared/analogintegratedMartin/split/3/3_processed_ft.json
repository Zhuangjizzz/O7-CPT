The gain is directly proportional to the transconductance $g_{m1}$, which is a measure of how effectively the input voltage controls the output current. The term $(r_{ds1} \\| r_{ds2})$ represents the effective load resistance, which is enhanced by the current-mirror active load. The negative sign indicates a phase inversion between the input and output signals. This equation underscores the importance of both the transconductance and the load resistance in determining the amplifier's overall performance."

However, the input resistance can be larger when the amplifier is connected to a large small-signal load resistance. This is because the load resistance appears in parallel with the intrinsic input resistance, effectively increasing the overall input resistance of the common-gate amplifier."

This configuration results in a high output resistance, which can provide potentially high gain and reduced short-channel effects. However, the available output voltage swing is reduced because some voltage drop must be maintained across the cascode device to keep it in active mode."

However, this comes at the cost of reduced voltage swing at the output because a portion of the voltage must be dropped across the cascode device to keep it in active mode. Additionally, the complexity and power consumption of the circuit may increase with the addition of the cascode device."
