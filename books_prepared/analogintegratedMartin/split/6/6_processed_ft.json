It is achieved in a two-stage opamp by adding a series resistor \\( R_{\\mathrm{C}} \\) in the compensation network. The presence of \\( R_{\\mathrm{C}} \\) creates a zero in the transfer function, which can be positioned to cancel out a pole or to provide additional phase lead.

Using SPICE simulations, the frequency at which a -125° phase shift occurs is found, and the gain at this frequency is noted. Then, a new \\( C_{\\mathrm{C}} \\) is chosen to achieve a 55° phase margin by setting the unity-gain frequency of the loop gain. Next, \\( R_{\\mathrm{C}} \\) is chosen to add approximately 30° to the phase margin, resulting in a total of about 85°. If the phase margin is not adequate, \\( C_{\\mathrm{C}} \\) is increased while keeping \\( R_{\\mathrm{C}} \\) constant.

However, it has a major limitation in that the signal swing is significantly reduced due to $Q_{2}$ and $Q_{5}$ being biased with larger drain-source voltages than the minimum required. This reduction in signal swing is especially problematic for modern technologies with low power supply voltages (e.g., 3.3 V or lower). In contrast, Bult's proposal involves using complete opamps for each current mirror, which can increase the number of opamps but allows for better control and potentially higher performance, albeit with higher complexity and power dissipation."

All other internal nodes have relatively low impedance, maximizing the speed of the opamp. Additionally, the high output impedance makes them suitable for driving mostly-capacitive loads encountered in CMOS integrated circuits."

            "value": "Fully differential amplifiers offer two significant advantages: 1. Reduced Harmonic Distortion: If each single-ended signal is distorted symmetrically around the common-mode voltage, the differential signal will contain only odd-order distortion terms, which are typically smaller and less detrimental to signal quality. This is demonstrated in Fig. 6.27, where even-order distortion terms cancel out. 2. Higher Signal-to-Noise Ratio: Despite having twice the random noise power compared to similar single-ended circuits, the increased signal swing in fully differential circuits results in a higher maximum signal-to-noise ratio. Specifically, the maximum signal power increases by $2^{2}=4$ times, leading to a $3-\\mathrm{dB}$ improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio."

Without CMFB, even a tiny error in the tail current, such as a $0.0001\\%$ increase, can cause all nodes in the circuit to drift towards ground, potentially leaving some transistors in triode and degrading the circuit's gain. CMFB circuitry observes the output voltages and adjusts currents to keep all transistors properly biased, ideally keeping the common-mode voltages stable and close to halfway between the power-supply voltages, even in the presence of large differential signals."

This extra power consumption arises from two main factors: 1. Common-Mode Feedback (CMFB): The CMFB circuitry itself consumes power to maintain the common-mode output voltage. 2. Additional Output Signals: Fully differential current mirror opamps and two-stage opamps need to produce two output signals instead of one, which can lead to increased power consumption. Despite these additional power requirements, the performance benefits of fully differential opamps often justify the extra power usage."
