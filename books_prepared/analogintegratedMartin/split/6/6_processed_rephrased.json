This setup is standard for sampling and filtering functions in analog integrated circuits.\n\nFig. 6.1 Common uses of opamps in analog integrated circuits: (a) amplification and filtering; (b) biasing and regulation; (c) switched-capacitor circuits.\n\n[^3]A typical two-stage CMOS opamp's block diagram is presented in Fig. 6.2. The term \"twostage\" denotes the number of gain stages within the opamp. Fig. 6.2 actually illustrates three stages - two gain stages and a unity-gain output stage. The output buffer is typically included only when resistive loads need to be driven. For purely capacitive loads, it is usually omitted. The initial gain stage is a differential-input single-ended output stage, often resembling that depicted in Fig. 3.19. The second gain stage is generally a common-source gain stage with an active load, similar to earlier examples.\n\nKey Point: The conventional two-stage opamp consists of a differential input gain stage, a common-source second gain stage, and an optional unity-gain output buffer stage.\nas shown in Fig. 3.4. Capacitor $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}}$ is incorporated to ensure stability when the opamp operates with feedback. Since $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}}$ is situated between the input and output of the high-gain second stage, it is often termed a Miller capacitance due to its effectively larger capacitive load on the first stage than its physical value. The third stage, when included, is typically a source-follower, akin to that shown in Fig. 3.6.\n\nAn instance of a practical CMOS implementation of the two-stage opamp is depicted in Fig. 6.3. In this scenario, it is presumed that a capacitive load is being driven, hence the source-follower output buffer is excluded. This example is utilized to highlight numerous essential design principles in realizing the two-stage amplifier.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the first stage features a p-channel differential input pair with an n-channel current-mirror active load. This constitutes a complementary differential gain stage to that previously illustrated in Fig. 3.19. The trade-offs between employing p-channel input transistors in this stage versus the alternative\nimage_name:Fig. 6.2\ndescription:The system block diagram, designated as Fig. 6.2, portrays a two-stage operational amplifier (opamp). It comprises three primary elements: a differential input stage, a second gain stage, and an optional output buffer.\n\n1. **Differential Input Stage**:\n- This stage is depicted by an amplifier block marked with gain \\(-A_1\\). It accepts the input voltage \\(V_{in}\\) and provides the initial amplification. The differential input stage is vital for amplifying the difference between two input signals while rejecting common-mode signals.\n\n2. **Second Gain Stage**:\n- The output from the differential input stage feeds into the second gain stage, represented by another amplifier block marked with gain \\(-A_2\\). This stage further amplifies the signal, with its output labeled as \\(Out (-A_2)\\).\n\n3. **Compensation Capacitor (\\(C_{cmp}\\))**:\n- A compensation capacitor \\(C_{cmp}\\) is connected between the output of the first gain stage and the output of the second gain stage. This capacitor is employed to stabilize the amplifier and manage its frequency response, ensuring stability and preventing oscillations.\n\n4. **Output Buffer (Optional)**:\n- The final element is an optional output buffer, represented by a unity gain amplifier (labeled as \"1\"). This stage is used to drive the load without impacting the preceding stages, providing isolation and ensuring the load does not affect the amplifier's performance.\n\n5. **Signal Flow**:\n- The signal path begins at the input \\(V_{in}\\), passes through the differential input stage, and is amplified by \\(-A_1\\). The amplified signal then moves to the second gain stage, where it is further amplified by \\(-A_2\\). Optionally, the signal can pass through the output buffer before reaching the output \\(V_{out}\\).\n\n6. **Overall Function**:\n- The primary role of this two-stage opamp is to amplify the input signal \\(V_{in}\\) through two stages of amplification, potentially driving a load if the output buffer is included. The compensation capacitor ensures stability throughout the amplification process, making the opamp suitable for high-performance applications.\n\nFig. 6.2 A block diagram of a two-stage opamp.\nstage of Fig. 3.19 will be discussed later in this chapter. Additionally, the numbers adjacent to the transistors represent reasonable transistor sizes for a $0.18-\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ process. Typical lengths for the transistors might range between 1.5 and 2 times the minimum transistor length of a specific technology, whereas digital logic typically employs the minimum transistor length."

    "text": "#### First-Order Model\n\nOur current objective is to examine the frequency response of a two-stage operational amplifier (opamp) at frequencies where the compensation capacitor, $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}}$, has started to reduce the gain's magnitude, yet still remain well below the opamp's unity-gain frequency. This is relevant for midband frequencies in numerous applications. This allows us to make a couple of simplifying assumptions. First, we will disregard all capacitors except the compensation capacitor, $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}}$, which usually dominates at all frequencies except around the unity-gain frequency of the opamp. ${ }^{2}$ Second, we also assume that resistor $\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{C}}$ is absent. This resistor is used for lead compensation and only has an effect around the unity-gain frequency of the opamp, as we will discuss when we cover compensation in Section 6.2. The simplified circuit used for analysis is shown in Fig. 6.4. It is worth noting that this simplified circuit is often used during system-level simulations when speed is more important than accuracy, although aspects such as slew-rate limiting (see next subsection) should also be included in the simulation.\n\nThe second stage primarily introduces a capacitive load on the first stage due to the compensation capacitor, $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}}$. Using Miller's theorem (Section 4.2.3), one can demonstrate that the equivalent load capacitance, $\\mathrm{C}_{\\text {eq }}$, at node $\\mathrm{v}_{1}$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{e q}=C_{C}\\left(1+A_{v 2}\\right) \\approx C_{C} A_{v 2} \\tag{6.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe gain in the first stage can now be found using the small-signal model of Figure 4.37, resulting in\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nA_{v 1}=\\frac{v_{1}}{v_{i n}}=-g_{m 1} Z_{o u t 1} \\tag{6.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nimage_name:Fig. 6.4\ndescription:\n[\nname: Q1, type: PMOS, ports: {S: X1, D: X2, G: Vin-}\nname: Q2, type: PMOS, ports: {S: X1, D: d2d4, G: Vin+}\nname: Q3, type: NMOS, ports: {S: GND, D: X2, G: X2}\nname: Q4, type: NMOS, ports: {S: GND, D: d2d4, G: X2}\nname: Q5, type: PMOS, ports: {S: VDD, D: X1, G: Vbias}\nname: Cc, type: Capacitor, value: Cc, ports: {Np: V1, Nn: V2}\nname: -A_v2, type: OpAmp, value: -A_v2, ports: {InP: V1, InN: GND, Out: V2(Vout)}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit is a simplified model of an op-amp with a differential input stage and a compensation capacitor Cc. The transistors Q1 and Q2 form a differential pair, while Q3 and Q4 act as current sinks. Q5 provides a bias current. The op-amp A_v2 is used for gain in the second stage. The circuit aims to achieve a specific midband frequency response.\n\nFig. 6.4 A simplified model for the opamp used to find the midband frequency response.\n2. Recall that the unity-gain frequency of an opamp is that frequency where the magnitude of the open-loop opamp gain has decreased to 1.\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nZ_{\\mathrm{out} 1}=r_{\\mathrm{ds} 2}\\left\\|r_{\\mathrm{ds} 4}\\right\\| \\frac{1}{s C_{\\mathrm{eq}}} \\tag{6.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor midband frequencies, the impedance of $C_{e q}$ dominates, and we can write\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{Z}_{\\mathrm{out} 1} \\cong \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{~s} \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{eq}}} \\cong \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{~s} \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}} \\mathrm{~A}_{\\mathrm{v} 2}} \\tag{6.7}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor the overall gain, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nA_{v}(s) \\equiv \\frac{v_{\\text {out }}}{v_{\\text {in }}}=A_{v 2} A_{v 1} \\cong A_{v 2} \\frac{g_{\\mathrm{m} 1}}{s C_{C} A_{v 2}}=\\frac{g_{\\mathrm{m} 1}}{s C_{c}} \\tag{6.8}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nusing (6.5) and (6.7). This simple equation can be used to find the approximate ${ }^{3}$ unity-gain frequency. Specifically, to find the unity-gain frequency, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{ta}}$, we set $\\left|\\mathrm{A}_{\\mathrm{v}}\\left(\\mathrm{j} \\omega_{\\mathrm{ta}}\\right)\\right|=1$, and solve for $\\omega_{\\mathrm{ta}}$. Performing such a procedure with (6.8), we obtain the following relationship:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\omega_{\\mathrm{ta}}=\\frac{\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m} 1}}{\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{c}}} \\tag{6.9}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nNote here that the unity-gain frequency is directly proportional to $\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m} 1}$ and inversely proportional to $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}}$. Substituting (1.78) into (6.9) provides another expression for the unity-gain frequency.\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\omega_{\\mathrm{ta}}=\\frac{2 \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D} 1}}{\\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{eff} 1} \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}}}=\\frac{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D} 5}}{\\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{eff} 1} \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}}} \\tag{6.10}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nKey Point: The two-stage opamp's frequency response is dominated by a pole at the input to the second stage arising from the introduced Miller capacitor, $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}}$. A dominant-pole approximation yields a unity-gain frequency of $\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m} 1} / \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}}$.\n\nEquation (6.10) indicates that, for a fixed unity-gain frequency, the bias current and hence power consumption is minimized with small values of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff } 1}$. Ordinarily, a downside of selecting a small value for $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff } 1}$ would be increased distortion, but this is mitigated in the case of opamps used with feedback since only very small differential signals appear at the differential pair inputs. Equation (6.10) presumes a square-law for $Q_{1}, Q_{2}$; the current is minimized when these devices are operated in subthreshold where, from (1.122), we have $\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m} 1 \\text { (sub-th) }}=\\mathrm{ql}_{\\mathrm{D}_{1}} / \\mathrm{nkT}$ which, when substituted into (6.9) yields $\\omega_{\\mathrm{ta}}=\\mathrm{ql}_{\\mathrm{D} 1} / \\mathrm{nkTC}_{\\mathrm{C}}$.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 6.2\n\nUsing the same parameters as in Example 6.1 , and assuming $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}}=1 \\mathrm{pF}$, what is the unity-gain frequency in Hz ?\n\n#### Solution\n\nUsing $\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m} 1}=1.30 \\mathrm{~mA} / \\mathrm{V}$ and (6.9), we find that\n\n$$\n\\omega_{\\mathrm{ta}}=\\frac{1.3 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~A} / \\mathrm{V}}{1 \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{~F}}=1.3 \\cdot 10^{9} \\mathrm{rad} / \\mathrm{sec}\n$$\n\nThus, we find that $\\mathrm{f}_{\\mathrm{ta}}=\\omega_{\\mathrm{ta}} /(2 \\pi)=207 \\mathrm{MHz}$.\n\n#### Second-Order Model\n\nA simplified small-signal model for the two-stage opamp is shown in Fig. 6.5, where the output buffer has again been ignored. Also, it is assumed that any parasitic poles in the first stage are at frequencies much higher than the opamp unity-gain frequency $\\omega_{\\mathrm{ta}}$ and that the first stage can therefore be modelled by a simple voltagecontrolled current source. In the small-signal model, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{gather*}\n\\mathrm{R}_{1}=\\mathrm{r}_{\\mathrm{ds} 4} \\| \\mathrm{r}_{\\mathrm{ds} 2}  \\tag{6.11}\\\\\n\\mathrm{C}_{1}=\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{db} 2}+\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{db} 4}+\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{gs} 7}  \\tag{6.12}\\\\\n\\mathrm{R}_{2}=\\mathrm{r}_{\\mathrm{ds} 6} \\| \\mathrm{r}_{\\mathrm{ds} 7}  \\tag{6.13}\\\\\n\\mathrm{C}_{2}=\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{db} 7}+\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{db} 6}+\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{L} 2} \\tag{6.14}\n\\end{gather*}\n$$\n\nNote that if no output buffer is present, then $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{L} 2}$ is the output load capacitance.

    "text": "#### First-Order Model\n\nWe turn our attention to the frequency response of a two-stage operational amplifier at frequencies where the compensation capacitor, $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}}$, starts to cause the gain magnitude to diminish, yet these frequencies are still far below the unity-gain frequency of the operational amplifier. This is relevant for midband frequencies in numerous applications. This allows us to make some simplifying assumptions. First, we will disregard all capacitors except for the compensation capacitor, $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}}$, which typically dominates at all frequencies except around the unity-gain frequency of the operational amplifier. Second, we also assume the absence of resistor $\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{C}}$. This resistor is used for lead compensation and only has an effect around the unity-gain frequency of the operational amplifier, as we will discuss when we cover compensation in Section 6.2. The simplified circuit used for analysis is shown in Fig. 6.4. It is worth noting that this simplified circuit is often utilized in system-level simulations where speed is prioritized over accuracy, although aspects such as slew-rate limiting (see the next subsection) should also be incorporated into the simulation.\n\nThe second stage primarily introduces a capacitive load on the first stage due to the compensation capacitor, $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}}$.

The transistors Q1 and Q2 constitute a differential pair, while Q3 and Q4 function as current sinks. Q5 supplies a bias current, and the op-amp $\\mathrm{A}_{\\mathrm{v}2}$ is employed for gain in the second stage. The circuit is designed to achieve a specific midband frequency response.\n\nRecall that the unity-gain frequency of an opamp is the frequency at which the open-loop opamp gain's magnitude has dropped to 1.\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nZ_{\\mathrm{out} 1}=r_{\\mathrm{ds} 2}\\left\\|r_{\\mathrm{ds} 4}\\right\\| \\frac{1}{s C_{\\mathrm{eq}}} \\tag{6.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAt midband frequencies, the impedance of $C_{e q}$ is predominant, and we can write\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{Z}_{\\mathrm{out} 1} \\cong \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{~s} \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{eq}}} \\cong \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{~s} \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}} \\mathrm{~A}_{\\mathrm{v} 2}} \\tag{6.7}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor the overall gain, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nA_{v}(s) \\equiv \\frac{v_{\\text {out }}}{v_{\\text {in }}}=A_{v 2} A_{v 1} \\cong A_{v 2} \\frac{g_{\\mathrm{m} 1}}{s C_{C} A_{v 2}}=\\frac{g_{\\mathrm{m} 1}}{s C_{c}} \\tag{6.8}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nusing (6.5) and (6.7). This straightforward equation can be utilized to approximate the unity-gain frequency.

Typically, a disadvantage of choosing a small $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff } 1}$ value would be increased distortion, but this is counteracted in the case of opamps used with feedback, since only very small differential signals appear at the differential pair inputs. Equation (6.10) assumes a square-law for $Q_{1}, Q_{2}$; the current is minimized when these devices are operated in subthreshold, where, from (1.122), we have $\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m} 1 \\text { (sub-th) }}=\\mathrm{ql}_{\\mathrm{D}_{1}} / \\mathrm{nkT}$, which, when substituted into (6.9), yields $\\omega_{\\mathrm{ta}}=\\mathrm{ql}_{\\mathrm{D} 1} / \\mathrm{nkTC}_{\\mathrm{C}}$.\n\n#### Second-Order Model\n\nA simplified small-signal model for the two-stage opamp is shown in Fig. 6.5, where the output buffer has once again been disregarded. Additionally, it is assumed that any parasitic poles in the first stage are at frequencies much higher than the opamp unity-gain frequency $\\omega_{\\mathrm{ta}}$ and that the first stage can therefore be modeled by a simple voltage-controlled current source.

If an output buffer is present, then $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{L} 2}$ denotes the load capacitance introduced by the output buffer.\n\nTo demonstrate the necessity of $R_{C}$, we initially assume $R_{C}=0$ and conduct nodal analysis at the nodes marked by $v_{1}$ and $\\mathrm{v}_{\\text {out }}$. The following transfer function is obtained:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nA_{v}(s)=\\frac{v_{\\text {out }}}{v_{\\text {in }}}=\\frac{g_{m 1} g_{m 7} R_{1} R_{2}\\left(1-\\frac{s C_{c}}{g_{m 7}}\\right)}{1+s a+s^{2} b} \\tag{6.15}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{a}=\\left(\\mathrm{C}_{2}+\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}}\\right) \\mathrm{R}_{2}+\\left(\\mathrm{C}_{1}+\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}}\\right) \\mathrm{R}_{1}+\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m} 7} \\mathrm{R}_{1} \\mathrm{R}_{2} \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}} \\tag{6.16}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{b}=\\mathrm{R}_{1} \\mathrm{R}_{2}\\left(\\mathrm{C}_{1} \\mathrm{C}_{2}+\\mathrm{C}_{1} \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}}+\\mathrm{C}_{2} \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}}\\right) \\tag{6.17}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIt is feasible to derive approximate equations for the two poles based on the assumption that the poles are real and well-separated. This assumption allows us to express the denominator, $\\mathrm{D}(\\mathrm{s})$, as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nD(s)=\\left(1+\\frac{s}{\\omega_{\\mathrm{p} 1}}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{s}{\\omega_{\\mathrm{p} 2}}\\right) \\cong 1+\\frac{s}{\\omega_{\\mathrm{p} 1}}+\\frac{\\mathrm{s}^{2}}{\\omega_{\\mathrm{p} 1} \\omega_{\\mathrm{p} 2}} \\tag{6.18}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFig. 6.5 displays a small-signal model of the two-stage opamp used for compensation analysis.\n\nEquating the coefficients of (6.15) to those of (6.18) and solving for $\\omega_{\\mathrm{p} 1}$ and $\\omega_{\\mathrm{p} 2}$ results in the following relationships. The dominant pole, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{p} 1}$, is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\omega_{\\mathrm{p} 1} & \\cong \\frac{1}{R_{1}\\left[C_{1}+C_{c}\\left(1+g_{m 7} R_{2}\\right)\\right]+R_{2}\\left(C_{2}+C_{C}\\right)} \\\\\n& \\cong \\frac{1}{R_{1} C_{c}\\left(1+g_{m 7} R_{2}\\right)}  \\tag{6.19}\\\\\n& \\cong \\frac{1}{g_{m 7} R_{1} R_{2} C_{c}}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhereas the nondominant pole, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{p} 2}$, is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\omega_{\\mathrm{p} 2} & \\cong \\frac{g_{\\mathrm{m} 7} C_{\\mathrm{C}}}{\\mathrm{C}_{1} C_{2}+C_{2} C_{C}+C_{1} C_{C}}  \\tag{6.20}\\\\\n& \\cong \\frac{g_{\\mathrm{m} 7}}{\\mathrm{C}_{1}+C_{2}}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nNote that, from (6.15), another zero, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{z}}$, is situated in the right half plane and is expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\omega_{\\mathrm{z}}=\\frac{-\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m} 7}}{\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{c}}} \\tag{6.21}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis zero should not be unexpected since there are two signal paths with opposing signs in the small-signal circuit of Fig. 6.5—one through the voltage-controlled current source, $g_{m} v_{1}$, and the other through the compensating capacitor, $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}}$.\n\nKey Point: The second pole of the two-stage opamp arises at the output node and may be elevated by increasing the second-stage transconductance, $\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m} 7}$.\n\nFrom the preceding relationships for $\\omega_{\\mathrm{p} 1}$ and $\\omega_{\\mathrm{p} 2}$, we can observe that as $\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m} 7}$ increases, the gap between the first and second poles widens. This separation tends to enhance the circuit's stability; hence, the use of a Miller capacitor for compensation is often referred to as pole-splitting compensation. Additionally, increasing $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}}$ shifts the dominant pole, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{p} 1}$, to a lower frequency without affecting the second pole, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{p} 2}$. This effect also contributes to the opamp's stability.\n\nHowever, a challenge arises due to the right-half-plane zero, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{z}}$. Because the zero resides in the right half plane, it introduces negative phase shift, or phase lag, in the transfer function of the opamp. This complicates stability. Increasing $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}}$ does not alleviate the issue because this decreases the frequencies of both the first pole and the zero without increasing their separation. Indeed, due to this right-half-plane zero, it is often impossible to select $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}}$ such that the step response exhibits no overshoot (assuming $R_{C}=0$ ).Fortunately, all is not lost, since introducing $R_{C}$ permits adequate compensation, as we will discuss in the next subsection."

    "text": "The limit on how quickly the output of an operational amplifier (opamp) can change is constrained by its finite bias currents. When the input to an opamp circuit shifts too rapidly, the opamp fails to maintain a virtual ground between its inputs, resulting in a temporary large differential input. Consequently, the opamp's output voltage changes at its maximum possible rate, known as the slew rate (SR). Under slew-rate limiting, the opamp's response becomes nonlinear. This phenomenon is depicted in Fig. 6.6, where a significant step input\n\nKey Point: The slew rate is the peak rate at which an opamp's output changes in the presence of a large differential input signal.\nleads to the output increasing at the slew rate until it can revert to linear operation without surpassing the opamp's slew rate. Such transient behavior is typical in switched capacitor circuits, where the slew rate significantly influences the circuit's settling time.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 6.4\n\nConsider a closed-loop feedback amplifier with a first-order linear settling time constant of $\\tau=0.2 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$ and a slew rate of $1 \\mathrm{~V} / \\mu \\mathrm{s}$.

For a step height $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {step }}$, linear settling follows an exponential pattern.\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{0}=V_{\\text {step }}\\left(1-e^{-t / \\tau}\\right) \\tag{6.22}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe highest rate of change occurs immediately after the step.\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left.\\frac{d v_{o}}{d t}\\right|_{\\max }=\\left.\\frac{d v_{o}}{d t}\\right|_{t=0}=\\frac{V_{\\text {step }}}{\\tau} \\tag{6.23}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAs long as this maximum slope is below the slew rate, slew-rate limiting is avoided. Thus, the maximum step size that can be handled without slew-rate limiting is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {step }, \\max }<\\mathrm{SR} \\cdot \\tau \\tag{6.24}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn this scenario, linear settling occurs as long as the output step amplitude is under 0.2 V. For a $10-\\mathrm{mV}$ step, the slope predicted by (6.23) is merely $0.05 \\mathrm{~V} / \\mathrm{s}$, well below the specified maximum slew rate. Hence, $99 \\%$ settling is observed after $-\\ln (0.1 / 10) \\tau=4.6 \\tau=0.92 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$.\n\nWith a 1-V step, the amplifier output initially rises at the slew rate until it nears its final value, allowing linear settling to commence. This occurs when the output is within $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {step, } \\max }$ of its final value. Thus, the amplifier is slew-rate limited for $(1 \\mathrm{~V}-0.2 \\mathrm{~V}) / 1 \\mathrm{~V} / \\mu \\mathrm{s}=0.8 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$. From this point, linear settling takes over, and $-\\ln (0.1 / 200)=7.6$ additional time constants are needed for settling with 0.1 mV accuracy, as shown in Fig. 6.7. Therefore, the total settling time is $0.8 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}+7.6 \\tau=2.32 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$. If the amplifier's slew rate were sufficiently high to avoid slew-rate limiting, the settling time would be just $-\\ln (0.1 / 1000) \\tau=1.84 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$.\n\nWhen the opamp in Fig. 6.3 is constrained by its slew rate due to a large input signal, all of the bias current of $Q_{5}$ flows into either $Q_{1}$ or $Q_{2}$, depending on whether $v_{i n}$ is negative or positive. If $v_{i n}$ is a large positive voltage, the bias current, $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}$, flows entirely through $\\mathrm{Q}_{1}$ and into the current-mirror pair, $\\mathrm{Q}_{3}, \\mathrm{Q}_{4}$. Consequently, the current exiting the compensation capacitor, $C_{C}$ (i.e., $I_{D 4}$) equals $I_{D 5}$ since $Q_{2}$ is off. When $v_{i n}$ is a large negative voltage, the current-mirror pair $Q_{3}$ and $Q_{4}$ is deactivated because $Q_{1}$ is off, and now the bias current, $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D} 5}$, flows directly into $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}}$. In either case, the maximum current entering or leaving $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}}$ is simply the total bias current, $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D} .}{ }^{7}$\nimage_name:Fig. 6.7\ndescription:This graph is a time-domain waveform illustrating the impact of slew rate limiting on the settling behavior of a system, specifically with a 1-V step output.

Thus, the maximum step size that can be tolerated without slew-rate limiting is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {step }, \\max }<\\mathrm{SR} \\cdot \\tau \\tag{6.24}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn this scenario, linear settling is observed as long as the output step amplitude is less than 0.2 V. For a $10-\\mathrm{mV}$ step, the slope predicted by (6.23) is merely $0.05 \\mathrm{~V} / \\mathrm{s}$, significantly below the specified maximum slew rate. Hence, $99 \\%$ settling is observed after $-\\ln (0.1 / 10) \\tau=4.6 \\tau=0.92 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$.\n\nWith a 1-V step, the amplifier output initially rises at the slew rate until it nears its final value, allowing linear settling to commence. This occurs when the output is within $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {step, } \\max }$ of its final value. Thus, the amplifier will be slew-rate limited for $(1 \\mathrm{~V}-0.2 \\mathrm{~V}) / 1 \\mathrm{~V} / \\mu \\mathrm{s}=0.8 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$. From this point, linear settling is observed, and $-\\ln (0.1 / 200)=7.6$ additional time constants are needed for settling with 0.1 mV accuracy, as shown in Fig. 6.7. Therefore, the total settling time is $0.8 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}+7.6 \\tau=2.32 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$. If the amplifier's slew rate were sufficiently high to avoid slew-rate limiting, the settling time would be only $-\\ln (0.1 / 1000) \\tau=1.84 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$.\n\nWhen the opamp in Fig. 6.3 is constrained by its slew rate due to a large input signal, all of the bias current of $Q_{5}$ flows into either $Q_{1}$ or $Q_{2}$, depending on whether $v_{i n}$ is negative or positive. When $v_{i n}$ is a large positive voltage, the bias current, $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}$, flows entirely through $\\mathrm{Q}_{1}$ and into the current-mirror pair, $\\mathrm{Q}_{3}, \\mathrm{Q}_{4}$. Thus, the current exiting the compensation capacitor, $C_{C}$ (i.e., $I_{D 4}$) is simply equal to $I_{D 5}$ since $Q_{2}$ is off. When $v_{i n}$ is a large negative voltage, the current-mirror pair $Q_{3}$ and $Q_{4}$ is deactivated because $Q_{1}$ is off, and now the bias current, $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D} 5}$, flows directly into $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}}$.

    "text": "The output voltage change rate of an opamp is constrained by its internal bias currents. When an opamp circuit's input varies too rapidly, the opamp cannot sustain a virtual ground between its inputs, momentarily experiencing a substantial differential input. Consequently, the opamp's output voltage shifts at its peak rate, termed the slew rate, SR. Under slew-rate limiting, the opamp's behavior becomes nonlinear. This phenomenon is depicted in Fig. 6.6, where a significant step input\n\nKey Point: The slew rate represents the peak output voltage change rate of an opamp in the presence of a large differential input signal.\nleads to the output increasing at its slew rate until it can revert to linear operation without surpassing the opamp's slew rate. Such transient responses are typical in switched capacitor circuits, where the slew rate significantly influences the circuit's settling time.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 6.4\n\nFor a closed-loop feedback amplifier with a first-order linear settling time constant $\\tau=0.2 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$ and a slew rate of $1 \\mathrm{~V} / \\mu \\mathrm{s}$, determine the time required for the output to stabilize when producing a $10-\\mathrm{mV}$ step output with 0.1 mV precision. Also, consider a 1-V step output.\nimage_name:Fig. 6.6\ndescription:Fig. 6.6 presents a graph illustrating the step response of an operational amplifier, emphasizing the impact of slew-rate limiting. The graph is a time-domain waveform, depicting how the output voltage responds to a step input over time.\n\n**Axes Labels and Units:**\n- The x-axis denotes time, typically in microseconds (µs) for such scenarios, though not explicitly labeled.\n- The y-axis measures the step response, indicating the output voltage, usually in volts (V).\n\n**Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- A dashed line represents the ideal step response expected from a linear system, showing a smooth, exponential rise towards a final value.\n- A solid line depicts the actual system response to a large step input, initially limited by the slew rate, resulting in a linear increase. Once the slew-rate limit ceases to dominate, the response transitions to exponential settling.\n- For a small step input, the response follows a purely exponential (linear) settling, as shown by the lower solid curve.\n\n**Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The initial linear segment of the actual response curve is defined by the slew rate, the maximum output voltage change rate.\n- The transition point from slew-rate limited to exponential settling is marked on the graph.\n- The graph highlights the disparity between ideal and actual responses, underscoring how the slew rate affects large step inputs but not small ones.\n\n**Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- Annotations describe the behavior of both ideal and actual responses, with markers indicating the transition from slew-rate limitation to exponential settling.\n- The graph effectively demonstrates the impact of slew-rate limitations on opamp settling behavior, providing insights into their effect on circuit performance.\n\nFig. 6.6 An illustration of the effect of slew-rate limiting in opamps.\n\n#### Solution\n\nSlew-rate limiting occurs when the slope required by linear settling surpasses the maximum allowed by the slew rate. For a step height $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {step }}$, linear settling follows an exponential pattern.\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{0}=V_{\\text {step }}\\left(1-e^{-t / \\tau}\\right) \\tag{6.22}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe highest rate of change occurs at the step's onset.\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left.\\frac{d v_{o}}{d t}\\right|_{\\max }=\\left.\\frac{d v_{o}}{d t}\\right|_{t=0}=\\frac{V_{\\text {step }}}{\\tau} \\tag{6.23}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAs long as this maximum slope is below the slew rate, slew-rate limiting is averted. Thus, the maximum step size tolerable without slew-rate limiting is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {step }, \\max }<\\mathrm{SR} \\cdot \\tau \\tag{6.24}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn this scenario, linear settling is observed if the output step amplitude is below 0.2 V. For a $10-\\mathrm{mV}$ step, the slope predicted by (6.23) is merely $0.05 \\mathrm{~V} / \\mathrm{s}$, well below the specified maximum slew rate. Thus, $99 \\%$ settling occurs after $-\\ln (0.1 / 10) \\tau=4.6 \\tau=0.92 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$.\n\nWith a 1-V step, the amplifier output initially rises at the slew rate until it nears its final value, allowing linear settling to commence. This occurs when the output is within $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {step, } \\max }$ of its final value. Hence, the amplifier experiences slew-rate limiting for $(1 \\mathrm{~V}-0.2 \\mathrm{~V}) / 1 \\mathrm{~V} / \\mu \\mathrm{s}=0.8 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$. From this point, linear settling prevails, requiring $-\\ln (0.1 / 200)=7.6$ additional time constants for 0.1 mV accuracy, as shown in Fig. 6.7. Thus, the total settling time is $0.8 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}+7.6 \\tau=2.32 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$. If the amplifier's slew rate were sufficiently high to avoid slew-rate limiting, the settling time would be only $-\\ln (0.1 / 1000) \\tau=1.84 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$.\n\nWhen the opamp in Fig. 6.3 is constrained by its slew rate due to a large input signal, all of $Q_{5}$'s bias current flows into either $Q_{1}$ or $Q_{2}$, depending on whether $v_{i n}$ is negative or positive. For a large positive $v_{i n}$, the bias current, $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}$, flows entirely through $\\mathrm{Q}_{1}$ and into the current-mirror pair, $\\mathrm{Q}_{3}, \\mathrm{Q}_{4}$. Thus, the current exiting the compensation capacitor, $C_{C}$ (i.e., $I_{D 4}$) equals $I_{D 5}$ since $Q_{2}$ is off. For a large negative $v_{i n}$, the current-mirror pair $Q_{3}$ and $Q_{4}$ is deactivated because $Q_{1}$ is off, and the bias current, $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D} 5}$, flows directly into $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}}$.

    "text": "The fastest rate at which an opamp's output can alter is constrained by its finite bias currents. When the input to an opamp circuit shifts too rapidly, the opamp fails to maintain a virtual ground between its inputs, momentarily experiencing a substantial differential input. Consequently, the opamp's output voltage changes at its peak rate, termed the slew rate, SR. Under slew-rate limiting, the opamp's response becomes nonlinear. This phenomenon is depicted in Fig. 6.6, where a significant step input\n\nKey Point: The slew rate is the peak rate at which an opamp's output changes in the presence of a large differential input signal.\nleads to the output increasing at its slew rate until it can revert to linear operation without surpassing the opamp's slew rate. Such transient responses are typical in switched capacitor circuits, where the slew rate is a critical factor in determining the circuit's settling time.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 6.4\n\nConsider a closed-loop feedback amplifier with a first-order linear settling time constant of $\\tau=0.2 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$ and a slew rate of $1 \\mathrm{~V} / \\mu \\mathrm{s}$. What is the time required for the output to settle when generating a $10-\\mathrm{mV}$ step output with 0.1 mV accuracy? What about a 1-V step output?\nimage_name:Fig. 6.6\ndescription:The graph in Fig. 6.6 illustrates the step response of an operational amplifier, focusing on the effects of slew-rate limiting. The graph is a time-domain waveform, depicting how the output voltage of a system responds to a step input over time.\n\n**Axes Labels and Units:**\n- The x-axis represents time, though no specific units are labeled, it is typically in microseconds (µs) for such applications.\n- The y-axis represents the step response, which measures the output voltage, typically in volts (V).\n\n**Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- The dashed line represents the ideal step response expected from a linear system, showing a smooth, exponential increase towards a final value.\n- The solid line shows the actual system response to a large step input. Initially, the response is limited by the slew rate, resulting in a linear increase. Once the slew-rate limit is no longer dominant, the response transitions to exponential settling.\n- For a small step input, the response follows a purely exponential (linear) settling, as indicated by the lower solid curve.\n\n**Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The initial linear segment of the actual response curve is characterized by the slew rate, which is the maximum rate of change of the output voltage.\n- The transition point where the response shifts from slew-rate limited to exponential settling is marked on the graph.\n- The graph highlights the difference between the ideal and actual responses, emphasizing how the slew rate affects large step inputs but not small ones.\n\n**Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- Annotations on the graph describe the behavior of both the ideal and actual responses, with markers indicating the transition from slew-rate limitation to exponential settling.\n- The graph effectively demonstrates the impact of slew-rate limitations on the settling behavior of opamps, providing insight into how these limitations can affect circuit performance.\n\nFig. 6.6 An illustration of the effect of slew-rate limiting in opamps.\n\n#### Solution\n\nThe amplifier will experience slew-rate limiting whenever the slope required by linear settling exceeds the maximum imposed by slew-rate limiting. For a step height $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {step }}$, linear settling is exponential.\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{0}=V_{\\text {step }}\\left(1-e^{-t / \\tau}\\right) \\tag{6.22}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe highest rate of change occurs immediately after the step.\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left.\\frac{d v_{o}}{d t}\\right|_{\\max }=\\left.\\frac{d v_{o}}{d t}\\right|_{t=0}=\\frac{V_{\\text {step }}}{\\tau} \\tag{6.23}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAs long as this maximum slope is below the slew rate, slew-rate limiting is avoided. Thus, the maximum step size that can be tolerated without slew-rate limiting is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {step }, \\max }<\\mathrm{SR} \\cdot \\tau \\tag{6.24}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn this scenario, linear settling is observed as long as the output step amplitude is less than 0.2 V. For a $10-\\mathrm{mV}$ step, the slope predicted by (6.23) is only $0.05 \\mathrm{~V} / \\mathrm{s}$, well below the specified maximum slew rate. Hence, $99 \\%$ settling is observed after $-\\ln (0.1 / 10) \\tau=4.6 \\tau=0.92 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$.\n\nWith a 1-V step, the amplifier output will initially increase at the slew rate until it is close enough to its final value for linear settling to commence. This occurs when the output is within $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {step, } \\max }$ of its final value. Thus, the amplifier will be slew-rate limited for $(1 \\mathrm{~V}-0.2 \\mathrm{~V}) / 1 \\mathrm{~V} / \\mu \\mathrm{s}=0.8 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$. From this point, linear settling is observed, and $-\\ln (0.1 / 200)=7.6$ additional time constants are needed for settling with 0.1 mV accuracy, as shown in Fig. 6.7. Therefore, the total settling time is $0.8 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}+7.6 \\tau=2.32 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$. If the amplifier slew rate were sufficiently high to avoid slew-rate limiting, the settling time would be only $-\\ln (0.1 / 1000) \\tau=1.84 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$.\n\nWhen the opamp in Fig. 6.3 is limited by its slew rate due to a large input signal, all of the bias current of $Q_{5}$ flows into either $Q_{1}$ or $Q_{2}$, depending on whether $v_{i n}$ is negative or positive. When $v_{i n}$ is a large positive voltage, the bias current, $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}$, flows entirely through $\\mathrm{Q}_{1}$ and also into the current-mirror pair, $\\mathrm{Q}_{3}, \\mathrm{Q}_{4}$. Thus, the current exiting the compensation capacitor, $C_{C}$, (i.e., $I_{D 4}$) is simply equal to $I_{D 5}$ since $Q_{2}$ is off. When $v_{i n}$ is a large negative voltage, the current-mirror pair $Q_{3}$ and $Q_{4}$ is deactivated because $Q_{1}$ is off, and now the bias current, $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D} 5}$, flows directly into $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}}$. In either case, the maximum current entering or leaving $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}}$ is simply the total bias current, $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D} .}{ }^{7}$\nimage_name:Fig. 6.7\ndescription:The graph shows a time-domain waveform illustrating the effect of slew rate limiting on the settling behavior of a system, specifically with a 1-V step output.

    "text": "When crafting a two-stage CMOS opamp, a lack of caution can result in an inherent (or systematic) input-offset voltage, a problem prevalent in many early production integrated circuit designs. To ensure the absence of such inherent input-offset voltage, examine the opamp depicted in Fig. 6.3. With a zero differential input voltage (i.e., $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {in }}^{+}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {in }}^{-}$), the first stage's output voltage, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{G} 57}$, should match the level required to equalize $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D} 7}$ with its bias current, $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D} 6}$.

    "text": "The two primary tools utilized by analog circuit designers for opamp compensation are dominant-pole compensation and lead compensation.\n\nKey Point: Generally, dominant-pole compensation involves reducing the frequency of a single pole within a feedback loop while keeping the other poles relatively stable.\n\nDominant-pole compensation is achieved by shaping a feedback system's open-loop response to closely resemble a first-order response up to the loop's unity gain frequency. As outlined in Section 5.3.1, first-order feedback systems are inherently stable, possessing at least a $90^{\\circ}$ phase margin. However, opamp circuits typically feature multiple poles and zeros. Boosting the frequencies of these poles is often impractical due to the requisite increase in power consumption or other unfavorable trade-offs. Therefore, the most straightforward method to emulate a first-order system is to deliberately lower the frequency of one dominant pole, ensuring it is significantly lower than the other poles and zeros. This concept is depicted in Fig. 6.8, which charts the open-loop response, $L(\\omega)$. Note that $L(\\omega)$ represents the product of the amplifier response and the feedback network response, $A(\\omega) \\beta$. During dominant-pole compensation, the pole frequency $\\omega_{\\mathrm{p} 1}$ is reduced to a much lower value, leading to a decrease in the unity-gain frequency of $\\mathrm{L}, \\omega_{\\mathrm{t}}$, and a corresponding increase in phase margin.\n\nAdditional phase margin can be achieved through lead compensation, which introduces a left half-plane zero, $\\omega_{z}$, at a frequency slightly above $\\omega_{t}$. When executed correctly, this has a minimal impact on the unity-gain frequency but adds an extra approximately $+20^{\\circ}$ phase shift around the unity-gain frequency. This enables a higher unity-gain frequency for a given phase margin than what would be possible with dominant-pole compensation alone.\n\nIn Fig. 6.8, both dominant-pole and lead compensation are shown to have minimal effect on the dc loop gain and other pole and zero frequencies.

For example, in a unity gain configuration, \\( \\beta=1 \\) and \\( L(s) \\cong A_{v}(s) \\). For an accurate determination of phase margin, simulation may be used to properly account for the impact of loading.\n\nThe capacitor, \\( \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}} \\), controls the dominant first pole, (i.e., \\( \\omega_{\\mathrm{pl}} \\)), and thereby the loop's unity-gain frequency, \\( \\omega_{\\mathrm{t}} \\).\n\n\\[\n\\omega_{\\mathrm{t}}=\\mathrm{L}_{0} \\omega_{\\mathrm{p} 1}=\\beta \\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m} 1} / \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{c}} \\tag{6.42}\n\\]\n\nHence, by properly selecting the value of \\( \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}} \\), dominant-pole compensation can be achieved. Lead compensation is achieved using \\( \\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{C}} \\). If the small-signal model of Fig. 6.5 is reanalyzed with a nonzero \\( \\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{C}} \\), then a third-order denominator results. The first two poles are still approximately at the frequencies given by (6.19) and (6.20). The third pole is at a high frequency and has almost no effect. However, the zero is now determined by the relationship\n\n\\[\n\\omega_{\\mathrm{z}}=\\frac{-1}{\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}}\\left(1 / \\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m} 7}-\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{C}}\\right)} \\tag{6.43}\n\\]\n\nThis result allows the designer a number of possibilities. One could take\n\n\\[\n\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{C}}=1 / \\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m} 7} \\tag{6.44}\n\\]\n\nto eliminate the right-half-plane zero altogether. Alternatively, one could choose \\( R_{C} \\) to be larger and thus move the right-half-plane zero into the left half plane to cancel the nondominant pole, \\( \\omega_{\\mathrm{p} 2} \\). Setting (6.43) equal to (6.20) and solving for \\( R_{C} \\) results in the following equation for \\( R_{C} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{C}}=\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{~g}_{\\mathrm{m} 7}}\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathrm{C}_{1}+\\mathrm{C}_{2}}{\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{c}}}\\right) \\tag{6.45}\n\\]\n\nUnfortunately, \\( \\mathrm{C}_{2} \\) is often not known a priori, especially when no output stage is present. The third possibility (recommended by the authors) is to choose \\( R_{C} \\) even larger to move the now left-halfplane zero to a frequency slightly greater than the unity-gain frequency that would result if the lead resistor were not present [Roberge, 1975]. For example, if the new zero frequency is taken 70% higher than the unity-gain frequency, it will introduce a phase lead of \\( \\tan ^{-1}(1 / 1.7)=30^{\\circ} \\). For this case, one should satisfy the following equation:\n\n\\[\n\\omega_{\\mathrm{z}}=1.7 \\omega_{\\mathrm{t}} \\tag{6.46}\n\\]\n\nAssuming \\( R_{C} \\gg>\\left(1 / g_{m 7}\\right) \\), then \\( \\omega_{z} \\cong 1 /\\left(R_{C} C_{c}\\right) \\). Recalling from (6.42) that \\( \\omega_{t}=\\beta g_{m 1} / C_{c} \\), then one should choose \\( R_{C} \\) according to\n\n\\[\n\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{C}} \\cong \\frac{1}{1.7 \\beta \\mathrm{~g}_{\\mathrm{m} 1}} \\tag{6.47}\n\\]\n\n[^6]Finally, the lead compensation resistor \\( \\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{C}} \\) may be replaced by a transistor operating in the triode region, as illustrated in Fig. 6.10. Transistor \\( Q_{9} \\) has \\( V_{D S 9}=0 \\) since no dc bias current flows through it, and therefore \\( Q_{9} \\) is deep in the triode region. Thus, this transistor operates as a resistor, \\( \\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{C}} \\), with a value given by\n\n\\[\nR_{C}=r_{d s 9}=\\frac{1}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} C_{o x}\\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)_{9} V_{\\text {eff9}}} \\tag{6.48}\n\\]\n\nIt should be noted here that \\( r_{\\text {ds }} \\) indicates the drain-source resistance of \\( Q_{9} \\) when it is in the triode region as opposed to the finite-output impedance of \\( Q_{9} \\) when it is in the active mode. The same notation, \\( r_{\\mathrm{ds}} \\), is used to indicate the drain-source resistance in both cases—whether the transistor is in the active or the triode region. One simply has to check which region a transistor is operating in to ensure that the correct equation is used to determine \\( r_{d s} \\).\n\nThis approach leads to the following design procedure for compensation of a two-stage CMOS opamp:\n\nKey Point: Compensation of the two-stage opamp proceeds by selecting Miller capacitor \\( \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}} \\) to provide 55 degrees phase margin, then introducing a lead compensation series resistor to add another 30 degrees of phase margin.\n\n1. Start by choosing, somewhat arbitrarily, \\( C_{C}^{\\prime} \\cong\\left(\\beta g_{m 1} / g_{m 7}\\right) C_{L} \\). This initially places the loop's unity gain frequency (6.42) approximately at the frequency of the second pole (6.20), where it has been assumed that the load capacitance \\( \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{L}} \\) is dominant.\n2. Using SPICE, find the frequency at which a \\( -125^{\\circ} \\) phase shift exists. Let the gain at this frequency be denoted \\( A^{\\prime} \\). Also, let the frequency be denoted \\( \\omega_{\\mathrm{t}} \\). This is the frequency that we would like to become the unity-gain frequency of the loop gain.\n3. Choose a new \\( \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}} \\) so that \\( \\omega_{\\mathrm{t}} \\) becomes the unity-gain frequency of the loop gain, thus resulting in a \\( 55^{\\circ} \\) phase margin. (Obtaining this phase margin is the reason we chose \\( -125^{\\circ} \\) in step 2.) This can be achieved by taking \\( \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}} \\) according to the equation\n\n\\[\nC_{C}=C_{C}^{\\prime} A^{\\prime} \\tag{6.49}\n\\]\n\nIt might be necessary to iterate on \\( \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}} \\) a couple of times using SPICE.\n4. Choose \\( \\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{C}} \\) according to\n\n\\[\n\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{C}}=\\frac{1}{1.7 \\omega_{\\mathrm{t}} \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{c}}} \\tag{6.50}\n\\]\n\nThis choice will increase the phase margin approximately \\( 30^{\\circ} \\) resulting in a total phase margin of approximately \\( 85^{\\circ} \\). It allows a margin of \\( 5^{\\circ} \\) to account for processing variations without the poles of the closed-loop response becoming real. This choice is also almost optimum lead compensation for almost any opamp.\nimage_name:Fig. 6.10\ndescription:\n[{'name': 'Q6', 'type': 'PMOS', 'ports': {'S': 'Vdd', 'D': 'Vout', 'G': 'Vbp'}}, {'name': 'Q7', 'type': 'NMOS', 'ports': {'S': 'GND', 'D': 'Vout', 'G': 'Vin'}}, {'name': 'Rc', 'type': 'Resistor', 'ports': {'N1': 'Vin', 'N2': 'rc'}}, {'name': 'CC', 'type': 'Capacitor', 'value': 'CC', 'ports': {'N1': 'X', 'N2': 'Vout'}}]\n[{'name': 'Q6', 'type': 'PMOS', 'ports': {'S': 'Vdd', 'D': 'Vout', 'G': 'Vbp'}}, {'name': 'Q7', 'type': 'NMOS', 'ports': {'S': 'GND', 'D': 'Vout', 'G': 'Vin'}}, {'name': 'Q9', 'type': 'NMOS', 'ports': {'S': 'Vin', 'D': 'X', 'G': 'Vg9'}}, {'name': 'CC', 'type': 'Capacitor', 'value': 'CC', 'ports': {'N1': 'X', 'N2': 'Vout'}}]\nextrainfo:The circuit shows a common-source second stage of a CMOS two-stage amplifier with lead compensation using a triode transistor Q9 as the compensation resistor RC.

It might be necessary to iterate on \\( R_{C} \\) a couple of times to optimize the phase margin because the unity-gain frequency may be shifted somewhat by the lead compensation, and because ( 6.50 ) assumes \\( R_{C}>>\\left(1 / g_{m 7}\\right) \\). However, one should check that the gain continues to steadily decrease at frequencies above the new unity-gain frequency; otherwise, the transient response can be poor.

The phase margin is improved with dominant-pole and lead compensation, suggesting enhanced stability.\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n   - **Cut-off Frequencies:**\n     - \\( \\omega_{p1}, \\omega_{p2}, \\omega_{p3} \\) are the pole frequencies where the slope alters.\n     - \\( \\omega_t \\) is the frequency at which the transition occurs.\n     - \\( \\omega_z \\) is the zero frequency introduced by lead compensation.\n   - **Phase Margin:**\n     - The phase margin increases with the application of compensation strategies, as indicated by the annotations.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n   - The plot includes annotations for various compensation strategies, showing their effects on both magnitude and phase.\n   - Reference lines are drawn at key frequencies and phase angles (90° and 180°) to highlight changes in behavior.\n   - The phase margin improvement after applying dominant-pole and lead compensation is specifically noted.\n   - Fig. 6.8 depicts a Bode plot of the open-loop gain, demonstrating dominant-pole and lead compensation.\n\n   - Fig. 6.9 illustrates an undriven opamp circuit featuring a general feedback network.\n\nIn the analysis of \\( L(s) \\), various decomposition methods into \\( A(s) \\) and \\( \\beta \\) exist, but a simple approximation \\( \\beta = Z_1 / (Z_1 + Z_2) \\) is adopted here, with the assumption that \\( \\beta \\) remains constant up to the loop's unity gain frequency. For instance, in a unity gain configuration, \\( \\beta = 1 \\) and \\( L(s) \\approx A_v(s) \\). For precise determination of the phase margin, simulation can be employed to accurately account for the impact of loading.\n\nThe capacitor \\( C_C \\) governs the dominant first pole, i.e., \\( \\omega_{p1} \\), and thus the loop's unity-gain frequency, \\( \\omega_t \\).\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\omega_t = L_0 \\omega_{p1} = \\beta g_{m1} / C_C \\tag{6.42}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, by carefully selecting the value of \\( C_C \\), dominant-pole compensation can be realized. Lead compensation is achieved by using \\( R_C \\). If the small-signal model in Fig. 6.5 is reanalyzed with a non-zero \\( R_C \\), a third-order denominator is obtained. The first two poles remain approximately at the frequencies given by (6.19) and (6.20). The third pole is at a high frequency and has a negligible effect. However, the zero is now determined by the relationship\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\omega_z = \\frac{-1}{C_C (1 / g_{m7} - R_C)} \\tag{6.43}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis result presents the designer with several options. One could set\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_C = 1 / g_{m7} \\tag{6.44}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nto completely eliminate the right-half-plane zero. Alternatively, one could select a larger \\( R_C \\) to shift the right-half-plane zero into the left half-plane, thereby canceling the non-dominant pole, \\( \\omega_{p2} \\). Setting (6.43) equal to (6.20) and solving for \\( R_C \\) yields the following equation for \\( R_C \\):\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_C = \\frac{1}{g_{m7}} \\left(1 + \\frac{C_1 + C_2}{C_C}\\right) \\tag{6.45}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nUnfortunately, \\( C_2 \\) is often not known beforehand, especially when no output stage is present. The third option, recommended by the authors, is to choose an even larger \\( R_C \\) to move the now left-half-plane zero to a frequency slightly greater than the unity-gain frequency that would be present if the lead resistor were absent [Roberge, 1975]. For instance, if the new zero frequency is set 70% higher than the unity-gain frequency, it will introduce a phase lead of \\( \\tan^{-1}(1 / 1.7) = 30^{\\circ} \\). For this case, the following equation should be satisfied:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\omega_z = 1.7 \\omega_t \\tag{6.46}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAssuming \\( R_C \\gg (1 / g_{m7}) \\), then \\( \\omega_z \\approx 1 / (R_C C_C) \\).

Transistor \\( Q_9 \\) has \\( V_{DS9} = 0 \\) since no DC bias current flows through it, and hence \\( Q_9 \\) is in the deep triode region. Thus, this transistor acts as a resistor, \\( R_C \\), with a value determined by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_C = r_{ds9} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_n C_{ox} (W/L)_{9} V_{eff9}} \\tag{6.48}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIt is important to note that \\( r_{ds} \\) signifies the drain-source resistance of \\( Q_9 \\) when it is in the triode region, as opposed to the finite-output impedance of \\( Q_9 \\) when it is in the active mode. The same notation, \\( r_{ds} \\), is used to indicate the drain-source resistance in both cases—whether the transistor is in the active or triode region. One must simply verify the region in which the transistor is operating to ensure that the correct equation is used to determine \\( r_{ds} \\).\n\nThis approach leads to the following design procedure for compensating a two-stage CMOS opamp:\n\n**Key Point:** The compensation of the two-stage opamp involves selecting the Miller capacitor \\( C_C \\) to provide a 55-degree phase margin, followed by the introduction of a lead compensation series resistor to add an additional 30 degrees of phase margin.\n\n1. Begin by choosing, somewhat arbitrarily, \\( C_C' \\approx (\\beta g_{m1} / g_{m7}) C_L \\). This initially places the loop's unity gain frequency (6.42) roughly at the frequency of the second pole (6.20), assuming the load capacitance \\( C_L \\) is dominant.\n2. Utilize SPICE to find the frequency at which a \\( -125^{\\circ} \\) phase shift exists. Let the gain at this frequency be denoted as \\( A' \\). Also, let this frequency be denoted as \\( \\omega_t \\). This is the frequency we aim to establish as the unity-gain frequency of the loop gain.\n3. Choose a new \\( C_C \\) such that \\( \\omega_t \\) becomes the unity-gain frequency of the loop gain, thereby achieving a \\( 55^{\\circ} \\) phase margin. (This phase margin is the reason for selecting \\( -125^{\\circ} \\) in step 2.) This can be accomplished by setting \\( C_C \\) according to the equation\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_C = C_C' A' \\tag{6.49}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIt may be necessary to iterate on \\( C_C \\) a few times using SPICE.\n4. Choose \\( R_C \\) according to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_C = \\frac{1}{1.7 \\omega_t C_C} \\tag{6.50}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis choice will increase the phase margin by approximately \\( 30^{\\circ} \\), resulting in a total phase margin of about \\( 85^{\\circ} \\). It allows for a \\( 5^{\\circ} \\) margin to account for processing variations without the poles of the closed-loop response becoming real. This choice is also nearly optimal lead compensation for nearly any opamp.\n   - Fig. 6.10 displays the common-source second stage of a CMOS two-stage amplifier, illustrating the lead compensation resistor \\( R_C \\) replaced by the triode transistor \\( Q_9 \\).\n\n   - Fig. 6.10 shows the common-source second stage of a CMOS two-stage amplifier, depicting the lead compensation resistor \\( R_C \\) substituted by the triode transistor \\( Q_9 \\).\n\nWhen a resistor is placed in series with the compensation capacitor, it may be necessary to iterate on \\( R_C \\) a few times to optimize the phase margin because the unity-gain frequency may be slightly shifted by the lead compensation, and because (6.50) assumes \\( R_C \\gg (1 / g_{m7}) \\). However, one should verify that the gain continues to decrease steadily at frequencies above the new unity-gain frequency; otherwise, the transient response may be poor. This situation can arise when unexpected zeros at frequencies only slightly greater than \\( \\omega_t \\) are present.\n5. If, after step 4, the phase margin is insufficient, then increase \\( C_C \\) while keeping \\( R_C \\) constant. This will shift both \\( \\omega_t \\) and the lead zero to lower frequencies while maintaining their ratio approximately constant, thereby minimizing the effects of higher-frequency poles and zeros, which, ideally, do not also shift to lower frequencies. In most cases, the higher-frequency poles and zeros (except for the lead zero) will not move to significantly lower frequencies when \\( C_C \\) is increased.\n6. The final step is to replace \\( R_C \\) with a transistor. The dimensions of the transistor can be chosen using equation (6.48), which is repeated here for convenience:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_C = r_{ds9} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_n C_{ox} (W/L)_{9} V_{eff9}} \\tag{6.51}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFinally, SPICE can be employed again to fine-tune the device dimensions to optimize the phase margin achieved in steps 4 and 5.\nThe procedure outlined above is not only applicable to the two-stage opamp but has been found to be nearly optimal for compensating most types of opamps.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 6.7\n\nAn opamp has an open-loop transfer function expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nA(s) = \\frac{A_0 (1 + s / \\omega_z)}{(1 + s / \\omega_{p1}) (1 + s / \\omega_2)} \\tag{6.52}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHere, \\( A_0 \\) is the DC gain of the opamp, and \\( \\omega_z, \\omega_{p1} \\), and \\( \\omega_2 \\) are the frequencies of a zero, the dominant pole, and the equivalent second pole, respectively. Assume that \\( \\omega_2 = 2 \\pi \\times 50 \\text{MHz} \\) and \\( A_0 = 10^4 \\). The opamp is to be used in a unity-gain configuration, where \\( \\beta = 1 \\) and \\( L(s) = A(s) \\).\na. Assuming \\( \\omega_z \\rightarrow \\infty \\), determine \\( \\omega_{p1} \\) and the unity-gain frequency, \\( \\omega_{t}' \\), so that the opamp possesses a unity-gain phase margin of \\( 55^{\\circ} \\).\nb. Assuming \\( \\omega_z = 1.7 \\omega_{t}' \\) (where \\( \\omega_{t}' \\) is as determined in part (a)), what is the new unity-gain frequency, \\( \\omega_t \\)?

Additionally, calculate the new phase margin.\n\n#### Solution\n\nInitially, observe that at frequencies much greater than the dominant-pole frequency (i.e., \\( \\omega \\gg \\omega_{p} \\)), such as the unity-gain frequency, (6.52) can be approximated by:\n\n\\[\nL(s) = A(s) \\cong \\frac{A_0 \\left( 1 + \\frac{s}{\\omega_z} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{s}{\\omega_{p1}} \\right) \\left( 1 + \\frac{s}{\\omega_2} \\right)} \\tag{6.53}\n\\]\n\n(a) For \\( \\omega_z \\rightarrow \\infty \\), we employ (6.53) to determine the phase angle at \\( \\omega_{t}' \\):\n\n\\[\n\\angle A(j \\omega_{t}') = -90^\\circ - \\tan^{-1} \\left( \\frac{\\omega_{t}'}{\\omega_2} \\right) \\tag{6.54}\n\\]\n\nFor a phase margin of \\( PM = 55^\\circ \\), we require:\n\n\\[\n\\angle A(j \\omega_{t}') = -180^\\circ + PM = -125^\\circ \\tag{6.55}\n\\]\n\nSetting (6.54) equal to (6.55) and solving for \\( \\frac{\\omega_{t}'}{\\omega_2} \\) yields:\n\n\\[\n\\tan^{-1} \\left( \\frac{\\omega_{t}'}{\\omega_2} \\right) = 35^\\circ \\tag{6.56}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Rightarrow \\omega_{t}' = 2.2 \\times 10^8 \\text{rad/s} = 2\\pi \\times 35 \\text{MHz}\n\\]\n\nSubsequently, setting \\( |A(j \\omega_{t}')| = 1 \\) and again using (6.53) results in:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A_0}{\\left( \\frac{\\omega_{t}'}{\\omega_{p1}} \\right) \\sqrt{1 + \\left( \\frac{\\omega_{t}'}{\\omega_2} \\right)^2}} = 1 \\tag{6.57}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Rightarrow \\omega_{p1} = \\frac{\\omega_{t}' \\sqrt{1 + \\left( \\frac{\\omega_{t}'}{\\omega_2} \\right)^2}}{A_0} = 2\\pi \\times 4.28 \\text{kHz}\n\\]\n\n(b) Initially, we set:\n\n\\[\n\\omega_z = 1.7 \\omega_{t}' = 2\\pi \\times 59.5 \\text{MHz} \\tag{6.58}\n\\]\n\nTo determine the new unity-gain frequency, setting \\( |A(j \\omega_t)| = 1 \\) in (6.53) now gives:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A_0 \\sqrt{1 + \\left( \\frac{\\omega_t}{\\omega_z} \\right)^2}}{\\left( \\frac{\\omega_t}{\\omega_{p1}} \\right) \\sqrt{1 + \\left( \\frac{\\omega_t}{\\omega_2} \\right)^2}} = 1 \\tag{6.59}\n\\]\n\nThis equation can be solved for the new unity-gain frequency. Squaring both sides results in a quadratic equation in \\( \\omega_t \\), which can be solved exactly. Alternatively, the value for \\( \\omega_{t}' \\) determined in part (a) can be used as an initial guess, and (6.59) can be solved iteratively. After four iterations, one finds that \\( \\omega_t = 2\\pi \\times 39.8 \\text{MHz} \\). This unity-gain frequency is a 14 percent increase over that found in part (a). The new phase shift can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\n\\angle A(j \\omega_t) = -90^\\circ + \\tan^{-1} \\left( \\frac{\\omega_t}{\\omega_z} \\right) - \\tan^{-1} \\left( \\frac{\\omega_t}{\\omega_2} \\right) = -95^\\circ \\tag{6.60}\n\\]\n\nNote that this phase value yields a phase margin of 85 degrees, representing a 30-degree improvement. In practice, the enhancement may not be as substantial due to additional high-frequency poles and zeros (which have been disregarded here). Nonetheless, the improvement"

    "text": "The stability and phase margin of a feedback amplifier's circuit are influenced by its loop gain, represented by \\( L(s) \\). Until now, our exploration has been centered around the amplifier's individual response, denoted as \\( A_v(s) \\). It is crucial to consider the feedback network when designing compensation strategies. As discussed in Section 5.4, whether the operational amplifier (opamp) is in an inverting or noninverting configuration, the circuit without external driving forces resembles the setup shown in Fig. 6.9. By presuming that the opamp features a high input impedance and an output impedance lower than that of the load or the feedback network, the loop gain can be approximated as:\n\n$$\nL(s) \\approx A_v(s) \\frac{Z_1}{Z_1 + Z_2} \\tag{6.41}\n$$\n\n**Key Point:** The feedback network must be accounted for in compensation.\n\nThe Bode plot shown in Fig. 6.8 serves to depict the frequency response of a system, with a particular emphasis on the open-loop gain and phase characteristics. This plot is split into two principal sections: the magnitude plot (above) and the phase plot (below).\n\n1. **Graph Type and Function:**\n   - The plot is a Bode plot that depicts both the magnitude and phase response of the open-loop gain.\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n   - The horizontal axis indicates frequency, denoted by \\( \\omega \\), and is commonly logarithmic.\n   - The magnitude plot's vertical axis is \\(|L(\\omega)|\\), reflecting gain, while the phase plot's vertical axis is \\(\\angle L(\\omega)\\), showing the phase angle in degrees.\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n   - **Magnitude Plot:**\n     - Initially, the magnitude holds steady at \\( A_0 \\beta \\) until it encounters the first pole \\( \\omega_{p1} \\), post which it starts to decline linearly on a logarithmic scale.\n     - The plot demonstrates three scenarios: no compensation, dominant-pole compensation, and dominant-pole plus lead compensation. Without compensation, the magnitude steeply decreases beyond \\( \\omega_t \\). With dominant-pole compensation, the decline is less steep, and with lead compensation, the curve flattens further, enhancing stability.\n   - **Phase Plot:**\n     - The phase commences at 0° and begins to decrease with increasing frequency. Compensation strategies like dominant-pole and lead improve the phase margin, signaling greater stability.\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n   - **Cut-off Frequencies:**\n     - \\( \\omega_{p1}, \\omega_{p2}, \\omega_{p3} \\) are the pole frequencies where the slope alters.\n     - \\( \\omega_t \\) marks the frequency of transition.\n     - \\( \\omega_z \\) is the zero frequency introduced by lead compensation.\n   - **Phase Margin:**\n     - Compensation strategies increase the phase margin, as annotated.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n   - The plot includes annotations detailing various compensation strategies and their effect on magnitude and phase.\n   - Reference lines at critical frequencies and phase angles (90° and 180°) highlight behavioral shifts.\n   - The enhancement in phase margin due to dominant-pole and lead compensation is specifically noted.\n\nFig. 6.8 presents a Bode plot of the open-loop gain, showcasing dominant-pole and lead compensation.\n\nFig. 6.9 depicts an undriven opamp circuit equipped with a general feedback network.\n\nWhile \\( L(s) \\) can be factored into \\( A(s) \\) and \\( \\beta \\) in several ways, a simple approximation \\( \\beta = Z_1 / (Z_1 + Z_2) \\) is often used, assuming \\( \\beta \\) remains constant up to the loop's unity gain frequency. For instance, in a unity gain setup, \\( \\beta = 1 \\) and \\( L(s) \\cong A_v(s) \\). Simulation might be employed to accurately capture the loading impact for precise phase margin determination.\n\nThe capacitor \\( C_C \\) governs the dominant first pole, i.e., \\( \\omega_{p1} \\), and thereby the loop's unity-gain frequency, \\( \\omega_t \\).\n\n$$\n\\omega_t = L_0 \\omega_{p1} = \\frac{\\beta g_{m1}}{C_C} \\tag{6.42}\n$$\n\nThus, by carefully selecting \\( C_C \\), dominant-pole compensation can be realized. Lead compensation is achieved through \\( R_C \\). Reanalyzing the small-signal model of Fig. 6.5 with a non-zero \\( R_C \\) results in a third-order denominator. The first two poles remain at frequencies dictated by (6.19) and (6.20). The third pole lies at a high frequency, having minimal impact. However, the zero is now dictated by the relation:\n\n$$\n\\omega_z = \\frac{-1}{C_C (1/g_{m7} - R_C)} \\tag{6.43}\n$$\n\nThis outcome offers several design choices. One could set:\n\n$$\nR_C = 1/g_{m7} \\tag{6.44}\n$$\n\nto eliminate the right-half-plane zero entirely. Alternatively, choosing a larger \\( R_C \\) shifts the right-half-plane zero into the left half-plane, cancelling the non-dominant pole \\( \\omega_{p2} \\). Setting (6.43) equal to (6.20) and solving for \\( R_C \\) yields:\n\n$$\nR_C = \\frac{1}{g_{m7}} \\left(1 + \\frac{C_1 + C_2}{C_C}\\right) \\tag{6.45}\n$$\n\nUnfortunately, \\( C_2 \\) is often not pre-known, especially in the absence of an output stage. The third option (recommended by the authors) is to select an even larger \\( R_C \\), moving the now left-half-plane zero to a frequency slightly above the unity-gain frequency that would be present without the lead resistor [Roberge, 1975]. For example, if the new zero frequency is set 70% higher than the unity-gain frequency, it introduces a phase lead of \\( \\tan^{-1}(1/1.7) = 30^\\circ \\). For this scenario, the following equation should be satisfied:\n\n$$\n\\omega_z = 1.7 \\omega_t \\tag{6.46}\n$$\n\nAssuming \\( R_C \\gg 1/g_{m7} \\), then \\( \\omega_z \\cong 1/(R_C C_C) \\). Recalling from (6.42) that \\( \\omega_t = \\beta g_{m1}/C_C \\), \\( R_C \\) should be chosen according to:\n\n$$\nR_C \\cong \\frac{1}{1.7 \\beta g_{m1}} \\tag{6.47}\n$$\n\n[^6]Finally, the lead compensation resistor \\( R_C \\) can be substituted with a transistor operating in the triode region, as depicted in Fig. 6.10. Transistor \\( Q_9 \\) has \\( V_{DS9} = 0 \\) since no dc bias current flows through it, placing \\( Q_9 \\) deeply in the triode region. Hence, this transistor acts as a resistor \\( R_C \\), with a value given by:\n\n$$\nR_C = r_{ds9} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_n C_{ox} (W/L)_{9} V_{\\text{eff9}}} \\tag{6.48}\n$$\n\nIt is noted here that \\( r_{ds} \\) signifies the drain-source resistance of \\( Q_9 \\) in the triode region, as opposed to the finite-output impedance of \\( Q_9 \\) in the active mode. The same notation, \\( r_{ds} \\), is used to denote the drain-source resistance in both scenarios—whether the transistor is in the active or the triode region. One must simply verify the region in which the transistor is operating to ensure the correct equation is used to determine \\( r_{ds} \\).\n\nThis approach yields the following compensation design procedure for a two-stage CMOS opamp:\n\n**Key Point:** The compensation of a two-stage opamp involves selecting the Miller capacitor \\( C_C \\) to provide a 55-degree phase margin, followed by introducing a lead compensation series resistor to add another 30 degrees of phase margin.\n\n1. Begin by arbitrarily choosing \\( C_C' \\cong (\\beta g_{m1}/g_{m7}) C_L \\). This initially locates the loop's unity gain frequency (6.42) approximately at the frequency of the second pole (6.20), assuming the load capacitance \\( C_L \\) is dominant.\n2. Utilize SPICE to find the frequency where a \\( -125^\\circ \\) phase shift occurs. Denote the gain at this frequency as \\( A' \\) and the frequency as \\( \\omega_t \\). This is the frequency desired as the unity-gain frequency of the loop gain.\n3. Select a new \\( C_C \\) such that \\( \\omega_t \\) becomes the unity-gain frequency of the loop gain, thus achieving a \\( 55^\\circ \\) phase margin. (Choosing this phase margin is why we selected \\( -125^\\circ \\) in step 2.) This can be accomplished by setting \\( C_C \\) according to the equation:\n\n$$\nC_C = C_C' A' \\tag{6.49}\n$$\n\nIterating on \\( C_C \\) a few times using SPICE might be necessary.\n4. Choose \\( R_C \\) according to:\n\n$$\nR_C = \\frac{1}{1.7 \\omega_t C_C} \\tag{6.50}\n$$\n\nThis choice will increase the phase margin approximately \\( 30^\\circ \\), resulting in a total phase margin of about \\( 85^\\circ \\). It allows a margin of \\( 5^\\circ \\) to account for processing variations without causing the poles of the closed-loop response to become real. This choice is also nearly optimal lead compensation for almost any opamp.\n5. If, after step 4, the phase margin remains inadequate, then increase \\( C_C \\) while keeping \\( R_C \\) constant. This moves both \\( \\omega_t \\) and the lead zero to lower frequencies while maintaining their ratio approximately constant, thus minimizing the effects of higher-frequency poles and zeros, which hopefully do not also shift to lower frequencies. In most cases, the higher-frequency poles and zeros (except for the lead zero) will not move to significantly lower frequencies when \\( C_C \\) is increased.\n6. The final step is to replace \\( R_C \\) with a transistor. The size of the transistor can be chosen using equation (6.48), repeated here for convenience:\n\n$$\nR_C = r_{ds9} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_n C_{ox} (W/L)_{9} V_{\\text{eff9}}} \\tag{6.51}\n$$\n\nFinally, SPICE can once again be used to fine-tune the device dimensions to optimize the phase margin obtained in steps 4 and 5.\nThe procedure outlined not only applies to the two-stage opamp but has been found to be nearly optimal for compensating most types of opamps.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 6.7\n\nAn opamp possesses an open-loop transfer function expressed as:\n\n$$\nA(s) = \\frac{A_0 (1 + s/\\omega_z)}{(1 + s/\\omega_{p1})(1 + s/\\omega_2)} \\tag{6.52}\n$$\n\nHere, \\( A_0 \\) is the dc gain of the opamp, and \\( \\omega_z, \\omega_{p1} \\), and \\( \\omega_2 \\) are the frequencies of a zero, the dominant pole, and the equivalent second pole, respectively. Assume \\( \\omega_2 = 2\\pi \\times 50 \\text{MHz} \\) and \\( A_0 = 10^4 \\). The opamp is to be utilized in a unity-gain configuration, so \\( \\beta = 1 \\) and \\( L(s) = A(s) \\).\na. Assuming \\( \\omega_z \\rightarrow \\infty \\), find \\( \\omega_{p1} \\) and the unity-gain frequency, \\( \\omega_t' \\), so that the opamp has a unity-gain phase margin of \\( 55^\\circ \\).\nb. Assuming \\( \\omega_z = 1.7 \\omega_t' \\) (where \\( \\omega_t' \\) is as found in part (a)), determine the new unity-gain frequency, \\( \\omega_t \\). Also, find the new phase margin.\n\n#### Solution\n\nFirst, note that at frequencies much greater than the dominant-pole frequency (i.e., \\( \\omega \\gg \\omega_{p} \\)), such as the unity-gain frequency, (6.52) can be approximated by:\n\n$$\nL(s) = A(s) \\cong \\frac{A_0 (1 + s/\\omega_z)}{(s/\\omega_{p1})(1 + s/\\omega_2)} \\tag{6.53}\n$$\n\n(a) For \\( \\omega_z \\rightarrow \\infty \\), we use (6.53) to find the phase angle at \\( \\omega_t' \\):\n\n$$\n\\angle A(j \\omega_t') = -90^\\circ - \\tan^{-1}(\\omega_t'/\\omega_2) \\tag{6.54}\n$$\n\nFor a phase margin of \\( PM = 55^\\circ \\), we require:\n\n$$\n\\angle A(j \\omega_t') = -180^\\circ + PM = -125^\\circ \\tag{6.55}\n$$\n\nSetting (6.54) equal to (6.55) and solving for \\( \\omega_t'/\\omega_2 \\) yields:\n\n$$\n\\tan^{-1}(\\omega_t'/\\omega_2) = 35^\\circ \\tag{6.56}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\Rightarrow \\omega_t' = 2.2 \\times 10^8 \\text{rad/s} = 2\\pi \\times 35 \\text{MHz}\n$$\n\nNext, setting \\( |A(j \\omega_t')| = 1 \\) and again using (6.53) results in:\n\n$$\n\\frac{A_0}{(\\omega_t'/\\omega_{p1}) \\sqrt{1 + (\\omega_t'/\\omega_2)^2}} = 1 \\tag{6.57}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\Rightarrow \\omega_{p1} = \\frac{\\omega_t' \\sqrt{1 + (\\omega_t'/\\omega_2)^2}}{A_0} = 2\\pi \\times 4.28 \\text{kHz}\n$$\n\n(b) First, set:\n\n$$\n\\omega_z = 1.7 \\omega_t' = 2\\pi \\times 59.5 \\text{MHz} \\tag{6.58}\n$$\n\nTo find the new unity-gain frequency, setting \\( |A(j \\omega_t)| = 1 \\) in (6.53) now gives:\n\n$$\n\\frac{A_0 \\sqrt{1 + (\\omega_t/\\omega_z)^2}}{(\\omega_t/\\omega_{p1}) \\sqrt{1 + (\\omega_t/\\omega_2)^2}} = 1 \\tag{6.59}\n$$\n\nThis equation can be solved for the new unity-gain frequency. Squaring both sides results in a quadratic equation in \\( \\omega_t \\), which can be solved precisely. Alternatively, the value for \\( \\omega_t' \\) found in part (a) can be used as an initial guess, and (6.59) can be solved iteratively. After four iterations, one finds that \\( \\omega_t = 2\\pi \\times 39.8 \\text{MHz} \\). This unity-gain frequency is a 14 percent increase over that found in part (a). The new phase shift can be found using:\n\n$$\n\\angle A(j \\omega_t) = -90^\\circ + \\tan^{-1}(\\omega_t/\\omega_z) - \\tan^{-1}(\\omega_t/\\omega_2) = -95^\\circ \\tag{6.60}\n$$\n\nNote that this phase value provides a phase margin of \\( 85^\\circ \\), marking a \\( 30^\\circ \\) improvement. In practice, the enhancement might not be as significant due to additional high-frequency poles and zeros (which have been neglected here). Nonetheless, the improvement from using lead compensation is considerable."

Thus far, our analysis has concentrated on the behavior of the amplifier itself, $\\mathrm{A}_{\\mathrm{v}}(\\mathrm{s})$. The compensation process requires the consideration of the feedback network. Section 5.4 demonstrated that for both inverting and noninverting opamp configurations, the undriven circuit is depicted in Fig. 6.9. It is assumed that the opamp has a high input impedance and an output impedance less than that of the load or feedback network. The loop gain can then be approximately estimated as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{L}(\\mathrm{~s}) \\approx \\mathrm{A}_{\\mathrm{v}}(\\mathrm{~s}) \\frac{\\mathrm{Z}_{1}}{\\mathrm{Z}_{1}+\\mathrm{Z}_{2}} \\tag{6.41}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nimage_name:Fig. 6.8\ndescription:The image in Fig. 6.8 is a Bode plot that depicts the frequency response of a system, with a particular emphasis on the open-loop gain and phase characteristics. The plot is divided into two main segments: the magnitude section (top) and the phase section (bottom).\n\n1. **Graph Type and Purpose:**\n- This image represents a Bode plot, which displays the magnitude and phase response of the open-loop gain.\n\n2. **Axis Descriptions and Units:**\n- The horizontal axis represents frequency, denoted as \\( \\omega \\), and is usually logarithmic.\n- The vertical axis of the magnitude plot is \\(|L(\\omega)|\\), representing the gain, while the vertical axis of the phase plot is \\(\\angle L(\\omega)\\), indicating the phase angle in degrees.\n\n3. **Behavior and Trends:**\n- **Magnitude Plot:**\n- The magnitude starts at a constant level of \\( A_0 \\beta \\) and remains so until it reaches the first pole \\( \\omega_{p1} \\), at which point it starts to decline linearly on a logarithmic scale.\n- The graph presents three scenarios: no compensation, dominant-pole compensation, and dominant-pole plus lead compensation.

For analysis purposes, it is assumed that $\\beta$ remains constant up to the loop's unity gain frequency. For example, in a unity gain setup, $\\beta=1$, and $L(s) \\cong A_{v}(s)$. To accurately determine the phase margin, simulations can be employed to account for the loading effects.\n\nThe capacitor, $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}}$, manages the dominant first pole, and thus the loop's unity-gain frequency, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{t}}$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\omega_{\\mathrm{t}}=\\mathrm{L}_{0} \\omega_{\\mathrm{p} 1}=\\beta \\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m} 1} / \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{c}} \\tag{6.42}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSelecting the right value of $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}}$ can lead to dominant-pole compensation, thereby adjusting the loop's unity-gain frequency, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{t}}$.\n\nLead compensation is achieved by using $\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{C}}$. If the small-signal model from Fig. 6.5 is reanalyzed with a nonzero $\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{C}}$, the denominator results in a third-order characteristic. The first two poles are still located approximately at the frequencies of (6.19) and (6.20). The third pole is at a high frequency, having negligible effect. The zero, however, is determined by the relationship\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\omega_{\\mathrm{z}}=\\frac{-1}{\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}}\\left(1 / \\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m} 7}-\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{C}}\\right)} \\tag{6.43}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis allows the designer various options. One could set\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{C}}=1 / \\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m} 7} \\tag{6.44}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nto completely eliminate the right-half-plane zero. Alternatively, one could choose $R_{C}$ to be larger, moving the right-half-plane zero into the left half plane to cancel the nondominant pole, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{p} 2}$. Equating (6.43) to (6.20) and solving for $R_{C}$ yields the following equation:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{C}}=\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{~g}_{\\mathrm{m} 7}}\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathrm{C}_{1}+\\mathrm{C}_{2}}{\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{c}}}\\right) \\tag{6.45}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nUnfortunately, $\\mathrm{C}_{2}$ is often not known in advance, particularly when there is no output stage.\n\nThe third possibility (recommended by the authors) is to choose $R_{C}$ even larger to move the now left-half-plane zero to a frequency slightly higher than the unity-gain frequency if the lead resistor were not present [Roberge, 1975]. For instance, if the new zero frequency is set at $70 \\%$ higher than the unity-gain frequency, it will introduce a phase lead of $\\tan ^{-1}(1 / 1.7)=30^{\\circ}$. In this case, one should ensure the following equation:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\omega_{\\mathrm{z}}=1.7 \\omega_{\\mathrm{t}} \\tag{6.46}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAssuming $R_{C} \\gg>\\left(1 / g_{m 7}\\right)$, then $\\omega_{z} \\cong 1 /\\left(R_{C} C_{c}\\right)$. Referring back to (6.42), where $\\omega_{t}=\\beta g_{m 1} / C_{c}$, one should select $R_{C}$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{C}} \\cong \\frac{1}{1.7 \\beta \\mathrm{~g}_{\\mathrm{m} 1}} \\tag{6.47}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n[^6]The lead compensation resistor $\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{C}}$ can be replaced with a transistor operating in the triode region, as shown in Fig. 6.10. Transistor $Q_{9}$ has $V_{D S 9}=0$ because no DC bias current passes through it, making $Q_{9}$ operate deep in the triode region. Consequently, this transistor behaves as a resistor, $\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{C}}$, with a value given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{C}=r_{d s 9}=\\frac{1}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} C_{o x}\\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)_{9} V_{\\text {eff9 }}} \\tag{6.48}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIt should be noted that $r_{\\text {ds }}$ signifies the drain-source resistance of $Q_{9}$ when it is in the triode region, as opposed to the finite-output impedance of $Q_{9}$ when it is in the active mode. The notation $r_{\\mathrm{ds}}$ is used consistently to represent the drain-source resistance in both the active and triode regions. One must verify which region a transistor is operating in to ensure the correct equation is used to determine $r_{d s}$.\n\nThis approach leads to the following design procedure for compensating a two-stage CMOS opamp:\n\nKey Point: The compensation of a two-stage opamp is carried out by selecting a Miller capacitor $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}}$ to achieve a phase margin of 55 degrees, followed by introducing a lead compensation series resistor to add an additional 30 degrees of phase margin.\n\n1. Start by arbitrarily choosing $C_{C}^{\\prime} \\cong\\left(\\beta g_{m 1} / g_{m 7}\\right) C_{L}$. This initially positions the loop's unity gain frequency (6.42) approximately at the frequency of the second pole (6.20), under the assumption that the load capacitance $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ is dominant.\n2. Employ SPICE to identify the frequency at which a $-125^{\\circ}$ phase shift exists. Let the gain at this frequency be referred to as $A^{\\prime}$. Also, denote this frequency as $\\omega_{\\mathrm{t}}$. This frequency is the one we aim to make the unity-gain frequency of the loop gain.\n3. Choose a new $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}}$ so that $\\omega_{\\mathrm{t}}$ becomes the unity-gain frequency of the loop gain, resulting in a $55^{\\circ}$ phase margin. (Selecting $-125^{\\circ}$ in step 2 was necessary to obtain this phase margin.) This can be achieved by using the equation\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{C}=C_{C}^{\\prime} A^{\\prime} \\tag{6.49}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIt may be necessary to iterate on $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{C}}$ a couple of times using SPICE.\n4.

    "text": "The stability and phase margin of a feedback amplifier are contingent on the loop gain, denoted as \\( L(s) \\), which encompasses the amplifier's response \\( A_v(s) \\) along with the feedback network. Our examination hitherto has centered solely on the amplifier's intrinsic response, neglecting the influence of the feedback mechanism. It's imperative to consider the feedback network during compensation to ensure proper stability.\n\nAs outlined in Section 5.4, irrespective of whether we're dealing with inverting or non-inverting op-amp configurations, the unstimulated circuit configuration corresponds to that depicted in Figure 6.9. The loop gain can be approximated under the assumption that the op-amp exhibits a relatively high input impedance and an output impedance that is less than that of either the load or the feedback network. This approximation is captured in Equation (6.41).\n\nThe Bode plot, as shown in Figure 6.8, serves as a graphical representation of a system's frequency response, emphasizing the open-loop gain and phase attributes. The plot is bifurcated into two sections: the magnitude plot (above) and the phase plot (below).\n\nIn the magnitude plot, the gain remains steady at \\( A_0 \\beta \\) until the first pole \\( \\omega_{p1} \\) is encountered. Post this pole, the magnitude starts to decrease linearly on a logarithmic scale. The graph delineates three distinct scenarios: uncompensated, dominant-pole compensated, and dominant-pole plus lead compensated. Without compensation, the magnitude plummets drastically beyond \\( \\omega_t \\). Compensation strategies, especially lead compensation, ameliorate this decline and enhance stability, as evidenced by the phase plot, which commences at 0° and declines with increasing frequency, with compensation visibly improving the phase margin.\n\nKey compensation features include the cut-off frequencies \\( \\omega_{p1}, \\omega_{p2}, \\omega_{p3} \\), the transition frequency \\( \\omega_t \\), and the zero frequency \\( \\omega_z \\) introduced by lead compensation. Annotations within the plot elucidate the effects of various compensation strategies on both magnitude and phase.\n\nThe loop gain \\( L(s) \\) can be factored into \\( A(s) \\) and \\( \\beta \\) in several ways, but a simple approximation \\( \\beta = Z_1 / (Z_1 + Z_2) \\) is often adopted for analysis, assuming constancy of \\( \\beta \\) up to the unity gain frequency. The capacitor \\( C_C \\) governs the dominant first pole and, consequently, the loop's unity-gain frequency \\( \\omega_t \\).\n\nLead compensation is effected through \\( R_C \\), which modifies the loop gain to include a third-order denominator. The zero frequency \\( \\omega_z \\) is then influenced by \\( R_C \\) and \\( C_C \\). The designer can exploit this relationship to eliminate the right-half-plane zero, shift it to cancel a nondominant pole, or position it slightly above the unity-gain frequency to introduce a phase lead.\n\nFor a two-stage CMOS op-amp, compensation typically involves selecting the Miller capacitor \\( C_C \\) to achieve a 55-degree phase margin, followed by the addition of a lead compensation series resistor to augment the phase margin by an additional 30 degrees. The process involves iteratively adjusting \\( C_C \\) and \\( R_C \\) using simulations like SPICE to optimize the phase margin and ensure a steady decrease in gain above the unity-gain frequency.\n\nFinally, the lead compensation resistor \\( R_C \\) can be supplanted by a transistor operating in the triode region, which functions as a resistor \\( R_C \\) with a value determined by the transistor's parameters. This substitution maintains the phase margin while potentially improving the compensation characteristics.\n\nThe described compensation method is applicable not only to two-stage op-amps but also to a plethora of op-amp types, making it a nearly universal strategy for optimizing stability in operational amplifier circuits."

Consequently, we have ensured that the drain-source resistance of a transistor in the triode region is inversely matched to the transconductance of another transistor. This relationship is highly beneficial for various applications. Indeed, in Chapter 7, we will demonstrate how straightforward it is to match all transconductances of transistors in a microcircuit to the conductance of a single off-chip resistor. This method enables the creation of on-chip \"resistors\" using triode-region transistors that are precisely ratioed relative to a single off-chip resistor, a valuable technique in modern circuit design."

These two effective gate-source voltages can be equated by taking\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D} 7}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} \\mathrm{C}_{\\text {ox }}(\\mathrm{W} / \\mathrm{L})_{7}}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D} 13}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{ox}}(\\mathrm{~W} / \\mathrm{L})_{13}}} \\tag{6.67}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSquaring and simplifying, we find that the following condition must be met:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D} 7}}{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D} 13}}=\\frac{(\\mathrm{W} / \\mathrm{L})_{7}}{(\\mathrm{~W} / \\mathrm{L})_{13}} \\tag{6.68}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n[^7]to $0.4-\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ CMOS processes).\n\nHowever, the ratio $I_{D 7} / I_{D 13}$ is determined by the current mirror pair $Q_{6}, Q_{11}$, resulting in\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D} 7}}{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D} 13}}=\\frac{(\\mathrm{W} / \\mathrm{L})_{6}}{(\\mathrm{~W} / \\mathrm{L})_{11}} \\tag{6.69}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, to achieve $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff13 }}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff7 }}$, from (6.68) and (6.69), the following relationship must be satisfied:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{(\\mathrm{W} / \\mathrm{L})_{6}}{(\\mathrm{~W} / \\mathrm{L})_{7}}=\\frac{(\\mathrm{W} / \\mathrm{L})_{11}}{(\\mathrm{~W} / \\mathrm{L})_{13}} \\tag{6.70}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAssuming this condition is fulfilled, we have $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff } 13}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff } 7}$, thereby ensuring $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{a}}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{b}}$. Since the gates of $Q_{12}$ and $Q_{9}$ are connected and their source voltages are identical, we also have $V_{\\text {eff12 }}=V_{\\text {eff9 }}$. Using these gate-source relationships and noting that $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D} 12}=\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D} 13}$, we can write\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{V_{\\text {eff17 }}}{V_{\\text {eff16 }}}=\\frac{V_{\\text {eff13 }}}{V_{\\text {eff12 }}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{2 I_{D 13}}{\\mu_{n} C_{0 x}(W / L)_{13}}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2 I_{D 12}}{\\mu_{n} C_{0 x}(W / L)_{12}}}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{(W / L)_{12}}{(W / L)_{13}}} \\tag{6.71}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFinally, substituting (6.71) into (6.66), the product $\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{C}} \\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m} 7}$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{c}} \\mathrm{~g}_{\\mathrm{m} 7}=\\frac{(\\mathrm{W} / \\mathrm{L})_{7}}{(\\mathrm{~W} / \\mathrm{L})_{9}} \\sqrt{\\frac{(\\mathrm{~W} / \\mathrm{L})_{12}}{(\\mathrm{~W} / \\mathrm{L})_{13}}} \\tag{6.72}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhich depends solely on geometry and not on processing or temperature variations.\nConsequently, we have ensured that the drain-source resistance of a transistor in the triode region is inversely matched to the transconductance of another transistor. This relationship can be highly beneficial for various other applications. Indeed, in Chapter 7, we will demonstrate that it is straightforward to match all transconductances of transistors in a microcircuit to the conductance of a single off-chip resistor. This method enables the creation of on-chip \"resistors\" using triode-region transistors that are accurately ratioed relative to a single off-chip resistor, a valuable technique in modern circuit design."

Consequently, designers frequently resort to using cascode current mirrors. However, conventional cascode current mirrors restrict signal swings, which may be unacceptable in some applications.幸运ly, there are circuits that do not limit signal swings as severely as those discussed in Chapter 3. One such circuit, depicted in Fig. 6.12, is known as the \"wide-swing cascode current mirror\" [Sooch, 1985; Babanezhad, 1987].\n\nThis circuit is designed to bias the drain-source voltages of transistors Q2 and Q3 close to the minimum possible without entering the triode region, allowing for larger signal swings compared to conventional cascode current mirrors.\n\nThe core concept of this current mirror is to set the drain-source voltages of transistors $Q_{2}$ and $Q_{3}$ near the minimum threshold without transitioning into the triode region. If the dimensions in Fig. 6.12 are used and the classical square-law equations for long-channel devices are assumed valid, $Q_{2}$ and $Q_{3}$ will be biased at the brink of the triode region.

Without $Q_{4}$, the output current would be slightly less than the input current due to the finite output impedances of $Q_{2}$ and $Q_{3}$.

To reduce power dissipation, the bias branch with $Q_{5}$ and $I_{\\text {bias }}$ might be scaled to lower currents while maintaining the same current densities and effective gate-source voltages. Lastly, $Q_{2}$ and $Q_{3}$ might be designed with slightly longer gate lengths than the minimum to minimize short-channel effects like drain-to-substrate leakage in $Q_{1}$, while $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{4}$ are given longer gate lengths due to higher voltages across $Q_{1}$. A typical length might be twice the minimum channel length, enhancing frequency response by minimizing gate-source capacitances that contribute to high-frequency poles."

    "text": "As emerging technologies with shorter channel lengths are employed, achieving adequate opamp gains becomes increasingly challenging due to the degradation of transistor output impedance caused by short-channel effects. Consequently, designers frequently resort to using cascode current mirrors. However, the use of conventional cascode current mirrors restricts the available signal swings, which may be unacceptable in specific applications. Fortunately, there are circuits that do not impose such severe limitations on signal swings compared to those discussed in Chapter 3. One such circuit, depicted in Fig. 6.12, is commonly referred to as the \"wide-swing cascode current mirror\" [Sooch, 1985; Babanezhad, 1987].\n\nimage_name:Fig. 6.12\ndescription:This circuit is a wide-swing cascode current mirror designed to bias the drain-source voltages of transistors Q2 and Q3 close to the minimum possible without entering the triode region. It allows for larger signal swings compared to conventional cascode current mirrors.\n\nFig. 6.12 The wide-swing cascode current mirror.\n\nThe fundamental concept of this current mirror is to set the drain-source voltages of transistors $Q_{2}$ and $Q_{3}$ to be as close as possible to the minimum without entering the triode region. Specifically, if the dimensions shown in Fig. 6.12 are utilized, and assuming the classical square-law equations for long channel-length devices hold true, transistors $Q_{2}$ and $Q_{3}$ will be biased right at the edge of the triode region. Before examining how these bias voltages are established, note that the transistor pair $\\mathrm{Q}_{3}, \\mathrm{Q}_{4}$ functions similarly to a single diode-connected transistor in generating the gate-source voltage for $Q_{3}$. These two transistors operate much like $Q_{3}$ would if its gate were connected to its drain. The inclusion of $Q_{4}$ is to reduce the drain-source voltage of $Q_{3}$, matching it to that of $Q_{2}$. This matching ensures that the output current, $I_{\\text {out }}$, more accurately mirrors the input current, $I_{\\text {in }}$. Without $Q_{4}$, the output current would be slightly less than the input current due to the finite output impedances of $Q_{2}$ and $Q_{3}$. Beyond this, $Q_{4}$ has minimal impact on the circuit's operation.\n\nTo determine the bias voltages for this circuit, let $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$ represent the effective gate-source voltage of $Q_{2}$ and $Q_{3}$, assuming all drain currents are equal. Thus, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {eff }}=V_{\\text {eff } 2}=V_{\\text {eff } 3}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2 I_{\\mathrm{D} 2}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} C_{\\mathrm{ox}}(\\mathrm{~W} / \\mathrm{L})}} \\tag{6.73}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFurthermore, since $Q_{5}$ has the same drain current but is $(n+1)^{2}$ times smaller, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {eff } 5}=(n+1) V_{\\text {eff }} \\tag{6.74}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSimilar logic yields the effective gate-source voltages for $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{4}$ as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {eff } 1}=V_{\\text {eff } 4}=n V_{\\text {eff }} \\tag{6.75}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nConsequently,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{G} 5}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{G} 4}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{G} 1}=(\\mathrm{n}+1) \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{eff}}+\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}} \\tag{6.76}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAdditionally,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{D S 2}=V_{D S 3}=V_{G 5}-V_{G S 1}=V_{G 5}-\\left(n V_{\\text {eff }}+V_{t \\mathrm{t}}\\right)=V_{\\text {eff }} \\tag{6.77}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis drain-source voltage positions both $Q_{2}$ and $Q_{3}$ at the edge of the triode region. Thus, the minimum acceptable output voltage is now\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {out }}>V_{\\text {eff } 1}+V_{\\text {eff } 2}=(n+1) V_{\\text {eff }} \\tag{6.78}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nA common selection for n might be unity, in which case the current mirror functions correctly as long as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {out }}>2 V_{\\text {eff }} \\tag{6.79}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWith a typical $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$ value between 0.2 V and 0.25 V, the wide-swing current mirror can ensure all transistors remain in the active (i.e., saturation) region even when the voltage drop across the mirror is as low as 0.4 V to 0.5 V.\n\nHowever, an additional requirement must be met to ensure all transistors stay in the active region. Specifically, we need\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{D S 4}>V_{\\text {eff } 4}=n V_{\\text {eff }} \\tag{6.80}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nto guarantee that $Q_{4}$ is in the active region. To find $V_{D S 4}$, note that the gate of $Q_{3}$ is connected to the drain of $\\mathrm{Q}_{4}$, resulting in\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{D S 4}=V_{G 3}-V_{D S 3}=\\left(V_{\\text {eff }}+V_{t n}\\right)-V_{\\text {eff }}=V_{t n} \\tag{6.81}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nKey Point: Cascoding is a crucial technique for achieving high gain with transistors having low drain-source resistance, but improper biasing of the cascode transistor can significantly reduce output swing.\n\nThus, ensuring $V_{t n}$ is greater than $n V_{\\text {eff }}$ is sufficient for $Q_{4}$ to remain in the active region—a manageable requirement.\n\nIt is important to note that this circuit analysis assumes the bias current, $I_{\\text {bias }}$, equals the input current, $I_{i n}$. Since $I_{\\text {in }}$ can vary, there is flexibility in choosing $I_{\\text {bias }}$. One approach is to set $I_{\\text {bias }}$ to the highest expected $I_{i n}$ value. This ensures no device exits the active region, though the drain-source voltage of $Q_{2}$ and $Q_{3}$ may be higher than necessary except at maximum $I_{i n}$. Consequently, some voltage swing is lost. A more common choice in wide-swing opamps is to set $\\mathrm{I}_{\\text {bias }}$ to the nominal $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{in}}$. This allows some devices to enter the triode region and reduces output impedance for higher $\\mathrm{I}_{\\text {in }}$ values (e.g., during slew-rate limiting), but such effects during transients are often tolerable.\n\nBefore concluding, some design considerations are worth noting. Typically, an experienced designer would choose $(\\mathrm{W} / \\mathrm{L})_{5}$ smaller than in Fig. 6.12 to bias $Q_{2}$ and $Q_{3}$ with slightly higher drain-source voltages than the minimum (perhaps 0.1 V higher). This accounts for the non-abrupt transition between the triode and active regions in practical transistors and mitigates the body effect of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{4}$, which increases their threshold voltages, pushing $Q_{2}$ and $Q_{3}$ towards the triode region. Additionally, to reduce power dissipation, the bias branch with $Q_{5}$ and $I_{\\text {bias }}$ might be scaled to lower currents while maintaining the same current densities and effective gate-source voltages. A common modification is to select the lengths of $Q_{2}$ and $Q_{3}$ slightly above the minimum allowable gate length (due to their small drain-source voltages), while $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{4}$ have longer gate lengths since the output transistor (i.e., $Q_{1}$) often experiences larger voltages. A typical length might be twice the minimum channel length, helping to eliminate harmful short-channel effects like drain-to-substrate leakage currents in $Q_{1}$. Minimizing the lengths of $Q_{2}$ and $Q_{3}$ maximizes the frequency response, as their gate-source capacitances are the primary contributors to high-frequency poles."

Bult suggested using complete opamps for each current mirror, potentially quadrupling the opamps in a fully differential opamp, though these can be scaled for lower power dissipation. Säckinger's implementation, shown in Fig. 6.15, uses a common-source amplifier with $Q_{3}$ and current source $I_{B 1}$ as the feedback amplifier. Assuming $I_{B 1}$'s output impedance is $r_{d s 3}$, the loop gain is $\\left(g_{m 3} r_{d s 3}\\right) / 2$, and the ideal output impedance is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nr_{\\text {out }} \\cong \\frac{g_{m 1} g_{m 3} r_{d s 1} r_{d s 2} r_{d s 3}}{2} \\tag{6.93}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFig. 6.15 shows the Säckinger implementation of the enhanced output-impedance current mirror, using NMOS transistors and current sources for accurate input and output current matching.

Consequently, $I_{\\text {out }}$ closely matches $I_{i n}$.\n\nSäckinger's approach is simpler than Bult's but reduces signal swing significantly. This reduction stems from $Q_{2}$ and $Q_{5}$ being biased with higher drain-source voltages than necessary. Specifically,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS} 2}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS} 5}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{eff} 3}+\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}} \\tag{6.94}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\ninstead of the minimum $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {efit }}$. This limitation is particularly detrimental for modern technologies with power supply voltages of 3.3 V or lower.
