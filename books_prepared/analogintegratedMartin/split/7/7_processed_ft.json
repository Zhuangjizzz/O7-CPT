This is due to the fact that the gate voltage $V_{1}$ of the PMOS transistor is well below $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$, meaning that the dropout voltage is only limited by $V_{\\text {eff, } 1}$. This is advantageous because it allows the regulator to operate with a smaller input-to-output voltage difference, which is especially important when the input voltage is close to the desired output voltage."

            "value": "A significant challenge that arises from using a PMOS device in an LDO voltage regulator is the reduced power supply rejection. With respect to small signals at $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$, the PMOS transistor $Q_{1}$ behaves like a common-gate amplifier with considerable gain. This can lead to amplification of supply noise at the output of the regulator. While the feedback loop can help cancel out some of this noise at low frequencies and high frequencies, there is often a mid-band frequency range where it is difficult to achieve good supply rejection. This can be a concern in applications where supply noise is significant and can affect the performance of the circuit."

Dominant poles are poles that have the most significant impact on the frequency response of the system. In the case of an LDO voltage regulator, there are two dominant poles to consider: the pole at the amplifier output (gate of $Q_{1}$) and the output pole. The positions of these poles in the frequency domain determine the stability and performance of the regulator. Compensating the loop by making one of the poles dominant can help to achieve the desired frequency response, but it also presents a trade-off between power consumption and supply rejection."

If the output pole is made dominant, it results in a low output impedance at medium frequencies, which improves supply rejection. However, this requires the opamp to have a low output impedance, which typically requires higher power consumption. On the other hand, if the pass-transistor gate node pole is made dominant, supply rejection may be worse, but power consumption in the opamp can be lower. This trade-off must be carefully considered during the design process to ensure that the regulator meets the required specifications for stability, power consumption, and supply rejection."
