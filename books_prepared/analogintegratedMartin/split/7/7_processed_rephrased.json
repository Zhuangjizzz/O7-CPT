    "text": "Generally, the aim of a bias circuit is to keep the DC operating points of transistors in an analog circuit within a specified range. Unlike a reference circuit, this implies that the DC outputs of a bias circuit can adjust to variations in process and temperature. Various methods can be employed for biasing. One approach is to bias circuits to allow constant voltage swings; another is to maintain constant currents; yet another is to strive for consistent gain. These points are\n\nKey Point: A bias circuit produces the DC voltages needed to keep transistors near a desired operating point; as transistor parameters change, whether from chip to chip or due to temperature fluctuations, the bias voltages must also adjust.\ndemonstrated in the following example.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 7.1\n\nConsider the simple NMOS differential pair in Fig. 7.2, nominally biased with $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff, } 1}=200 \\mathrm{mV}$ and $V_{t n}=450 \\mathrm{mV}$. With a $10 \\%$ decrease in both $\\mu_{n} C_{o x}$ and $R$, and a $10 \\%$ increase in $V_{t n}$, how must $V_{b}$ change to ensure: a) a constant drain current in the matched differential pair devices $Q_{2,3}$; b) a constant voltage drop across the resistors R; c) a constant gain.\n\n#### Solution\n\nAssume all MOSFETs are in active mode and follow a simple square-law voltage-current relationship. Before the $10 \\%$ changes, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{b}}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}+\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff, } 1}=650 \\mathrm{mV}$.\na) The drain currents of $Q_{2,3}$ are half of the drain current in $Q_{1}$,\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D} 1}=\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{ox}}\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{~W}}{\\mathrm{~L}}\\right)\\left(\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{b}}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}\\right)^{2}\n$$\n\nThus, to maintain a constant drain current, the gate voltage $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{b}}$ must increase by 45 mV along with $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$. Additionally, the effective gate-source voltage $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff, } 1}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{b}}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$ must change inversely proportional to changes in $\\sqrt{\\mu_{n} C_{o x}}$. However, $R$ has only a secondary effect on drain current, so minimal or no change in $V_{b}$ is needed in response to small changes in $R$. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{b}}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}+\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{eff}, 1}=1.1(450 \\mathrm{mV})+(200 \\mathrm{mV}) /(\\sqrt{0.9})=706 \\mathrm{mV}\n$$\n\nimage_name:Fig. 7.2 NMOS differential pair biased by a simple current source\ndescription:\n[\nname: Q1, type: NMOS, ports: {S: GND, D: s2s3d1, G: Vb}\nname: Q2, type: NMOS, ports: {S: s2s3d1, D: Voutn, G: Vin}\nname: Q3, type: NMOS, ports: {S: s2s3d1, D: Voutp, G: Vip}\nname: R1, type: Resistor, value: R, ports: {N1: Voutn, N2: VDD}\nname: R2, type: Resistor, value: R, ports: {N1: Voutp, N2: VDD}\n]\nextrainfo:This circuit is an NMOS differential pair biased by a simple current source. The differential pair consists of Q2 and Q3, with Q1 acting as the current source. The resistors R1 and R2 are used as load resistors for the differential pair.\n\nFig. 7.2 NMOS differential pair biased by a simple current source.\nb) The voltage drop across $R$ is given by $I_{D 1} R / 2$. In addition to the dependencies described in part (a), maintaining a constant voltage drop will require the drain current, and hence $\\left(V_{b}-V_{t n}\\right)$, to change inversely proportional to changes in R. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{b}}=1.1(450 \\mathrm{mV})+(200 \\mathrm{mV}) /(0.9 \\sqrt{0.9})=729 \\mathrm{mV}\n$$\n\nc) The small-signal gain of the differential pair is $g_{m 2} R$, where it can be shown that\n\n$$\ng_{m 2} \\propto \\mu_{n} C_{o x}\\left(V_{b}-V_{t n}\\right)\n$$\n\nThus, as in parts (a) and (b), maintaining a constant gain requires $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{b}}$ to change directly proportional to any changes in $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$. Additionally, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff, } 1}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{b}}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}$ must change inversely proportional to changes in $\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{ox}}$ and R. Therefore,\n\n$$\nV_{b}=1.1(450 \\mathrm{mV})+(200 \\mathrm{mV}) /(0.9 \\cdot 0.9)=742 \\mathrm{mV}\n$$\n\nExample 7.1 highlights the challenge of designing an effective bias circuit, which must monitor multiple device parameters and automatically adjust various analog voltages to achieve the desired outcome.\n\nSince bias circuits support other analog circuits by providing their DC voltages, their area and power consumption represent overhead costs that a designer aims to minimize. Consequently, one bias circuit is typically shared among several subcircuits. A crucial practical consideration is how to distribute the bias circuit outputs without exposing them to noise and inaccuracies due to component mismatches across the chip.\n\nMost, if not all, of a bias circuit's outputs are the gate (or base) voltages used to bias current sources. When distributing these bias voltages, devices required to operate as a current mirror should be placed within the same subcircuit and in close physical proximity to ensure good matching between them.\n\nFor instance, consider the common scenario shown in Fig. 7.3: a reference current, $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{b}}$, is available at one location on an integrated circuit and must be replicated at the drain of NMOS device $Q_{2}$ located far away on the chip. Two methods for generating the gate voltage of $Q_{2}$ are depicted. In Fig. 7.3(a), a simple NMOS current mirror is used, with the mirror devices separated by a long wire. In this setup, the long wire carries no current, hence it is termed \"voltage-mode\" bias distribution. Inevitable differences between the threshold voltages of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$, and even the ground potentials at their source and body terminals, lead to significant uncertainty in the resulting current $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{c}}$.\n\nIn Fig. 7.3(b), a PMOS current mirror $Q_{3 / 4}$ is introduced to generate an intermediate current $I_{d}$ that is transmitted across the chip. Unlike Fig. 7.3(a), here the long wire carries a non-zero current, making this a \"current-mode\" approach to bias distribution. It is preferred because both pairs of current mirror devices are co-located, ensuring their currents are well-matched. Naturally, the simple current mirrors in Fig. 7.3 can be replaced with high output impedance variants to improve accuracy, but the fundamental advantage of current-mode bias distribution remains. Current-mode distribution may consume more power and area due to the additional devices and bias current required. However, these minor drawbacks are mitigated by the fact that $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{3}$ in Fig. $7.3(b)$ can be made quite small and the current $I_{d}$ reduced, minimizing the added power and area. ${ }^{1}$\n\nAlso note that Fig. 7.3(b) includes decoupling capacitors at the gates of all transistors. These are essential for filtering noise at those nodes and can be implemented as MOS capacitors.

Consequently, one bias circuit is typically shared among several subcircuits. A crucial practical consideration is how to distribute the bias circuit outputs without exposing them to noise and inaccuracies due to component mismatches across the chip.\n\nMost, if not all, of a bias circuit's outputs are the gate (or base) voltages used to bias current sources. When distributing these bias voltages, any devices required to function as a current mirror should be placed within the same subcircuit and in close physical proximity to each other to ensure good matching between those devices.\n\nFor instance, consider the typical scenario shown in Fig. 7.3: a reference current, $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{b}}$, is available at one location on an integrated circuit and must be replicated at the drain of NMOS device $Q_{2}$ located far away on the chip. Two methods for generating the gate voltage of $Q_{2}$ are depicted. In Fig. 7.3(a), a simple NMOS current mirror is used, and the mirror devices are separated by a long wire. In this setup, the long wire carries no current, hence it is termed \"voltage-mode\" bias distribution. Inevitable differences between the threshold voltages of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$, and even the ground potentials at their source and body terminals, result in significant uncertainty in the resulting current $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{c}}$.\n\nIn Fig. 7.3(b), a PMOS current mirror $Q_{3 / 4}$ is introduced to generate an intermediate current $I_{d}$ that is transmitted across the chip. Unlike Fig. 7.3(a), here the long wire carries a non-zero current, making this a \"current-mode\" approach to bias distribution. It is preferred because both pairs of current mirror devices are co-located, allowing their currents to be well-matched. Naturally, the simple current mirrors in Fig. 7.3 can be replaced with high output impedance variants to enhance accuracy, but the fundamental advantage of current-mode bias distribution remains. Current-mode distribution may consume more power and area than voltage-mode distribution due to the additional devices and bias current required. However, these minor drawbacks are mitigated by the fact that $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{3}$ in Fig. 7.3(b) can be made quite small and the current $I_{d}$ reduced, minimizing the added power and area. ${ }^{1}$\n\nAlso note that Fig. 7.3(b) includes decoupling capacitors at the gates of all transistors.

    "text": "Generally, the goal of a bias circuit is to keep the DC operating points of transistors in an analog circuit within a specified range.

Consequently, one bias circuit is typically shared among several subcircuits. A crucial practical consideration is how to distribute the bias circuit outputs without exposing them to noise and inaccuracies due to component mismatches across the chip.\n\nMost (or all) of a bias circuit's outputs are the gate (or base) voltages used to bias current sources. When distributing these bias voltages, devices required to operate as a current mirror should be placed within the same subcircuit and in close physical proximity to each other to ensure good matching.\n\nFor instance, consider the common scenario shown in Fig. 7.3: a reference current, $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{b}}$, is available at one location on an integrated circuit and must be replicated at the drain of NMOS device $Q_{2}$ located far away across the chip. Two methods for generating the gate voltage of $Q_{2}$ are depicted. In Fig. 7.3(a), a simple NMOS current mirror is used, with the mirror devices separated by a long wire. In this setup, the long wire carries zero current, hence it is termed \"voltage-mode\" bias distribution. Inevitable differences between the threshold voltages of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$, and even the ground potentials at their source and body terminals, result in considerable uncertainty in the resulting current $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{c}}$.\n\nIn Fig. 7.3(b), a PMOS current mirror $Q_{3 / 4}$ is introduced to generate an intermediate current $I_{d}$ that is transmitted across the chip. Unlike Fig. 7.3(a), here the long wire carries a non-zero current, making this a \"current-mode\" approach to bias distribution. This method is preferred as both pairs of current mirror devices are co-located, ensuring their currents are well-matched. Naturally, the simple current mirrors in Fig. 7.3 can be replaced by high output impedance variants to enhance accuracy, but the fundamental advantage of current-mode bias distribution remains. Current-mode distribution may consume more power and area due to the additional devices and bias current required. However, these minor drawbacks are mitigated by the fact that $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{3}$ in Fig. 7.3(b) can be made quite small and the current $I_{d}$ reduced, minimizing the added power and area. ${ }^{1}$\n\nAlso note that Fig. 7.3(b) includes decoupling capacitors at the gates of all transistors.

However, $R$ has only minor effects on drain current, so minimal or no change in $V_{b}$ is needed for small changes in $R$. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{b}}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{tn}}+\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{eff}, 1}=1.1(450 \\mathrm{mV})+(200 \\mathrm{mV}) /(\\sqrt{0.9})=706 \\mathrm{mV}\n$$\n\nimage_name:Fig. 7.2 NMOS differential pair biased by a simple current source\ndescription:\n[\nname: Q1, type: NMOS, ports: {S: GND, D: s2s3d1, G: Vb}\nname: Q2, type: NMOS, ports: {S: s2s3d1, D: Voutn, G: Vin}\nname: Q3, type: NMOS, ports: {S: s2s3d1, D: Voutp, G: Vip}\nname: R1, type: Resistor, value: R, ports: {N1: Voutn, N2: VDD}\nname: R2, type: Resistor, value: R, ports: {N1: Voutp, N2: VDD}\n]\nextrainfo:This circuit is an NMOS differential pair biased by a simple current source. The differential pair consists of Q2 and Q3, with Q1 acting as the current source. The resistors R1 and R2 are used as load resistors for the differential pair.\n\nFig. 7.2 NMOS differential pair biased by a simple current source.\nb) The voltage drop across $R$ is given by $I_{D 1} R / 2$. Besides the dependencies described in part (a), maintaining a constant voltage drop requires the drain current, and hence $\\left(V_{b}-V_{t n}\\right)$, to change inversely proportional to changes in R.

Therefore,\n\n$$\nV_{b}=1.1(450 \\mathrm{mV})+(200 \\mathrm{mV}) /(0.9 \\cdot 0.9)=742 \\mathrm{mV}\n$$\n\nExample 7.1 highlights the complexity of designing an effective bias circuit, which must monitor multiple device parameters and automatically adjust various analog voltages to achieve the desired outcome.\n\nSince bias circuits merely support other analog circuits by providing their DC voltages, their area and power consumption represent overhead costs that designers aim to minimize. Consequently, one bias circuit is often shared among several subcircuits. A critical practical consideration is how to distribute the bias circuit outputs without exposing them to noise and inaccuracies due to component mismatches across the chip.\n\nMost, if not all, of a bias circuit's outputs are the gate (or base) voltages used to bias current sources. When distributing these bias voltages, devices required to operate as a current mirror should be placed within the same subcircuit and in close physical proximity to ensure good matching.\n\nFor instance, consider the typical scenario shown in Fig. 7.3: a reference current, $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{b}}$, is available at one location on an integrated circuit and must be replicated at the drain of NMOS device $Q_{2}$ located far away on the chip. Two methods for generating the gate voltage of $Q_{2}$ are illustrated. In Fig. 7.3(a), a simple NMOS current mirror is used, with the mirror devices separated by a long wire. This approach, where the long wire carries no current, is termed \"voltage-mode\" bias distribution. Inevitable differences between the threshold voltages of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$, and even the ground potentials at their source and body terminals, lead to significant uncertainty in the resulting current $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{c}}$.\n\nIn Fig. 7.3(b), a PMOS current mirror $Q_{3 / 4}$ is introduced to generate an intermediate current $I_{d}$ that is transmitted across the chip. Unlike Fig. 7.3(a), here the long wire carries a non-zero current, making this a \"current-mode\" approach to bias distribution. It is preferred because both pairs of current mirror devices are co-located, ensuring their currents are well-matched. While the simple current mirrors in Fig. 7.3 can be replaced by high output impedance variants for better accuracy, the fundamental advantage of current-mode bias distribution remains. Current-mode distribution may consume more power and area due to additional devices and bias current required. However, these drawbacks are mitigated by the fact that $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{3}$ in Fig. 7.3(b) can be made small, and the current $I_{d}$ reduced, minimizing the added power and area. ${ }^{1}$\n\nAdditionally, Fig. 7.3(b) includes decoupling capacitors at the gates of all transistors. These are crucial for filtering noise at those nodes and can be implemented as MOS capacitors. The decoupling capacitor is connected to\n\n[^0]image_name:(a)\ndescription:\n[\nname: Q1, type: NMOS, ports: {S: GND, D: Vg2, G: Vg2}\nname: Q2, type: NMOS, ports: {S: GND, D: LOAD2, G: Vg2}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit diagram (a) shows two NMOS transistors Q1 and Q2.

Unfortunately, this term exhibits significant chip-to-chip variations and minor temperature variations.\n\nThe circuit in Fig. 7.6 forms a positive feedback loop, raising stability concerns. Transistor $Q_{11}$ acts as a common-source amplifier for any small signals at its gate, with diode-connected $\\mathrm{Q}_{13}$ serving as a load. The resulting signal then appears at the gate of $Q_{15}$, another common-source stage. As long as $R_{B}$ is sufficiently large, this second stage will have a gain much less than unity, ensuring loop stability. However, at high frequencies, any parasitic capacitance across $R_{B}$ will reduce its impedance, potentially destabilizing the circuit [Nicolson, 2004]. If $R_{B}$ is an off-chip precision resistor, the parasitic capacitances, including those from the chip pad and board, will be significant. Therefore, it is often necessary to implement at least part of $R_{B}$ on-chip. Unfortunately, on-chip resistances are relatively poorly controlled.\n\nThe preceding analysis neglects many second-order effects, such as transistor output impedance and the body effect.

Both effects can be mitigated using the modified circuit shown in Fig. 7.7. Here, the pair $Q_{14,15}$ is implemented with PMOS devices, which in most CMOS processes allows connection to an independent body terminal. Connecting the source and body of $\\mathrm{Q}_{15}$ eliminates the body effect. Additionally, an amplifier is used to maintain equal voltages at the transistor drain terminals, reducing the impact of finite transistor output impedance. Another advantage of the amplifier is that it lowers the impedance at the drain of $\\mathrm{Q}_{15}$, reducing the gain around the positive feedback loop $Q_{12-15}$ and enhancing stability. The negative feedback loop comprising the amplifier and common-source transistors $Q_{12,13}$ can be stabilized by appropriately sizing the compensation capacitor $C_{C}$.\n\nUnfortunately, both Fig. 7.6 and Fig. 7.7 have a second stable state where all currents are zero. To prevent this condition, a start-up circuit must be added that only affects operation if all currents are zero at startup.\n\nA fundamental limitation of constant-transconductance biasing is that at high temperatures, the currents and effective gate-source voltages must increase significantly to compensate for decreasing carrier mobility and maintain stable transconductances. This limits signal swings, which is particularly problematic under low supply voltages. Since carrier mobility is proportional to $\\mathrm{T}^{-3/2}$, this corresponds to a 27-percent reduction from room temperature (300 K) to $100^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ (373 K). Consequently, the effective gate-source voltages must increase by 27 percent to keep the transistor transconductance unchanged, as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ng_{m i} = \\mu_{i} C_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)_{i} V_{\\text{eff-i}} \\tag{7.12}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAs long as the effective gate-source voltages are not initially designed to be too large, this limitation is generally acceptable in most applications.

Transistor $Q_{11}$ acts as a common-source amplifier for small signals at its gate, with diode-connected $\\mathrm{Q}_{13}$ as its load. The resulting signal then appears at the gate of $Q_{15}$, another common-source stage. As long as $R_{B}$ is sufficiently large, this second stage will have a gain much less than unity, ensured by $R_{B}$ acting as a degeneration resistor. However, at high frequencies, any parasitic capacitance across $R_{B}$ can reduce its impedance, potentially destabilizing the circuit [Nicolson, 2004]. If $R_{B}$ is an off-chip precision resistor, parasitic capacitances, including those from the chip pad and board, will be substantial. Thus, it is often necessary to implement at least part of $R_{B}$ on-chip. Unfortunately, on-chip resistances are relatively poorly controlled.\n\nThe preceding analysis overlooks many second-order effects, such as transistor output impedance and the body effect. The body effect will slightly alter the equation, but the relationship will still primarily depend on geometry. The major limitation arises from the transistor output impedance. Both effects can be mitigated using the modified circuit shown in Fig. 7.7. Here, the pair $Q_{14,15}$ is implemented with PMOS devices, which in most CMOS processes allows connection to an independent body terminal. Connecting the source and body of $\\mathrm{Q}_{15}$ eliminates the body effect. Additionally, an amplifier is used to maintain equal voltages at the transistor drain terminals, thereby reducing the impact of finite transistor output impedance. Another advantage of the amplifier is that it lowers the impedance at the drain of $\\mathrm{Q}_{15}$, reducing the gain around the positive feedback loop $Q_{12-15}$ and enhancing stability. The negative feedback loop comprising the amplifier and common-source transistors $Q_{12,13}$ can be stabilized by appropriately sizing the compensation capacitor $C_{C}$.\n\nUnfortunately, both Fig. 7.6 and Fig. 7.7 have a second stable state where all currents are zero. To prevent this condition, a start-up circuit must be added that only affects operation if all currents are zero at start-up.\n\nA fundamental limitation of constant-transconductance biasing is that at high temperatures, currents and effective gate-source voltages must increase substantially to compensate for decreasing carrier mobility and maintain stable transconductances.

Transistor $Q_{11}$ acts as a common-source amplifier for any small signals at its gate, with diode-connected $\\mathrm{Q}_{13}$ as a load. The resulting signal then appears at the gate of $Q_{15}$, another common-source stage. As long as $R_{B}$ is sufficiently large, this second stage will have a gain much less than unity, ensuring loop stability. However, at high frequencies, any parasitic capacitance across $R_{B}$ will reduce its impedance, potentially destabilizing the circuit [Nicolson, 2004]. If $R_{B}$ is an off-chip precision resistor, parasitic capacitances, including those from the chip pad and board, will be substantial. Therefore, it is often necessary to implement at least part of $R_{B}$ on-chip. Unfortunately, on-chip resistances are relatively poorly controlled.\n\nThe preceding analysis overlooks many second-order effects, such as transistor output impedance and the body effect.

To prevent this condition, a start-up circuit must be added that only influences operation if all currents are zero at startup.\n\nA fundamental limitation of constant-transconductance biasing is that at high temperatures, the currents and effective gate-source voltages must increase significantly to compensate for decreasing carrier mobility and maintain stable transconductances. This limits signal swings, which is especially problematic under low supply voltages.

    "text": "As previously stated, a bandgap voltage reference relies on subtracting the voltage of a forward-biased diode (or base-emitter junction) with a negative temperature coefficient from a voltage that is proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT). The accompanying figure, labeled Fig. 7.9, illustrates a simplified version of this circuit. It incorporates a PTAT generator and an operational amplifier to produce a reference voltage of around 1.26 V. An NPN transistor is utilized to generate a voltage exhibiting a negative temperature coefficient, which is then combined with the PTAT voltage to ensure temperature stability.\n\nFig. 7.9 depicts a simplified circuit diagram of a bandgap voltage reference. The PTAT voltage is achieved by amplifying the voltage difference between two forward-biased base-emitter (or diode) junctions. A symbolic representation of a bandgap voltage reference system is provided in Fig. 7.9.\n\nThe I-V relationship for a forward-biased base-emitter junction of a bipolar transistor ${ }^{3}$ is given by:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}=\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{S}} \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{qV} \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{BE}} / \\mathrm{kT}} \\tag{7.13}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHere, $I_{S}$ represents the transistor's scale current, which is strongly dependent on temperature, although not explicitly shown. By expressing the base-emitter voltage as a function of collector current and temperature, it can be demonstrated [Brugler, 1967; Tsividis, 1980] that:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{B E}=V_{G 0}\\left(1-\\frac{T}{T_{0}}\\right)+V_{B E 0} \\frac{T}{T_{0}}+\\frac{m k T}{q} \\ln \\left(\\frac{T_{0}}{T}\\right)+\\frac{k T}{q} \\ln \\left(\\frac{J_{C}}{J_{C 0}}\\right) \\tag{7.14}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{G} 0}$ is the bandgap voltage of silicon at 0 K (approximately 1.206 V), k is Boltzmann's constant, and m is a temperature constant approximately equal to 2.3. Additionally, $\\mathrm{J}_{\\mathrm{c}}$ and T denote the collector current density and temperature, respectively, with the subscript 0 indicating values at a reference temperature, $T_{0}$. Specifically, $J_{C 0}$ is the collector current density at $T_{0}$, while $J_{C}$ is the density at the actual temperature, T. $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE} 0}$ is the junction voltage at $T_{0}$, and $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE}}$ is the voltage at T. The relationship between junction current and current density is given by:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}=\\mathrm{A}_{\\mathrm{E}} \\mathrm{~J}_{\\mathrm{C}} \\tag{7.15}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $A_{E}$ is the effective area of the base-emitter junction. For a constant $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}$, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE}}$ exhibits approximately a $-2 \\mathrm{mV} /{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{K}$ temperature dependence around room temperature. This negative temperature dependence is counteracted by the PTAT dependence of the amplified difference between two base-emitter junctions biased at different but fixed current densities. Using (7.14), it can be shown that if two base-emitter junctions are biased at currents $J_{2}$ and $J_{1}$, the voltage difference between them is:\n\nKey Point: An integrated voltage reference is formed by adding the forward bias voltage of a pn junction to the voltage difference between two pn junctions biased at different current densities. These voltages are scaled to ensure their positive and negative temperature coefficients precisely cancel each other out.\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE}}=\\mathrm{V}_{2}-\\mathrm{V}_{1}=\\frac{\\mathrm{kT}}{\\mathrm{q}} \\ln \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{~J}_{2}}{\\mathrm{~J}_{1}}\\right) \\tag{7.16}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, the voltage difference is directly proportional to absolute temperature. This proportionality is highly accurate and remains valid even when the collector currents are temperature-dependent, provided their ratio remains constant.\n\n[^2]\n#### EXAMPLE 7.3\n\nConsider two transistors biased at a current-density ratio of $10: 1$ at $\\mathrm{T}=300 \\mathrm{~K}$. Determine the difference in their base-emitter voltages and its temperature dependence.\n\n#### Solution\n\nApplying (7.16), we get:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE}}=\\frac{\\mathrm{kT}}{\\mathrm{q}} \\ln \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{~J}_{2}}{\\mathrm{~J}_{1}}\\right)=\\frac{1.38 \\times 10^{-23}(300)}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19}} \\ln (10)=59.5 \\mathrm{mV} \\tag{7.17}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince this voltage is proportional to absolute temperature, a 1 K increase in temperature results in:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE}}=59.5 \\mathrm{mV} \\frac{301}{300}=59.7 \\mathrm{mV} \\tag{7.18}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, the voltage dependence is $59.5 \\mathrm{mV} / 300 \\mathrm{~K}$ or $0.198 \\mathrm{mV} / \\mathrm{K}$. Given that a single $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE}}$ has a temperature dependence of $-2 \\mathrm{mV} / \\mathrm{K}$, to cancel this dependence, $\\Delta \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE}}$ should be amplified by about a factor of 10, as explained further.\n\nIt will be shown that in a bandgap voltage reference, while the output voltage is temperature-independent, the junction currents are proportional to absolute temperature (assuming the resistors are temperature-independent). To simplify the derivations, we initially assume the junction currents are proportional to absolute temperature. This proportionality will be verified later when describing circuit realizations. We thus initially assume:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{J_{i}}{J_{i 0}}=\\frac{T}{T_{0}} \\tag{7.19}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $J_{i}$ is the collector current density of the $i^{\\text {th }}$ transistor, and $J_{i 0}$ is the same at the reference temperature.\n\nNext, assume the difference between two base-emitter voltages is multiplied by a factor K and added to the base-emitter voltage of the junction with the higher current density. Using (7.16) and (7.19) along with (7.14), we obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {ref }} & =\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE} 2}+\\mathrm{K} \\Delta \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{BE}} \\\\\n& =\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{G} 0}+\\frac{\\mathrm{T}}{\\mathrm{~T}_{0}}\\left(\\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{BE}-2-2}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{G} 0}\\right)+(\\mathrm{m}-1) \\frac{\\mathrm{kT}}{\\mathrm{q}} \\ln \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{~T}_{0}}{\\mathrm{~T}}\\right)+\\mathrm{K} \\frac{\\mathrm{kT}}{\\mathrm{q}} \\ln \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{~J}_{2}}{\\mathrm{~J}_{1}}\\right) \\tag{7.20}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nEquation (7.20) is the fundamental equation relating the output voltage of a bandgap voltage reference to temperature. Here, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE0-2}}$ is the base-emitter junction voltage of the second transistor at $T_{0}$. To achieve zero temperature dependence at a specific temperature, we differentiate (7.20) with respect to temperature and set the derivative to zero at the desired reference temperature. From (7.20), we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathrm{V}_{\\text {ref }}}{\\partial \\mathrm{T}}=\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{~T}_{0}}\\left(\\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{BE} 0-2}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{G} 0}\\right)+\\mathrm{K} \\frac{\\mathrm{k}}{\\mathrm{q}} \\ln \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{~J}_{2}}{\\mathrm{~J}_{1}}\\right)+(\\mathrm{m}-1) \\frac{\\mathrm{k}}{\\mathrm{q}}\\left[\\ln \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{~T}_{0}}{\\mathrm{~T}}\\right)-1\\right] \\tag{7.21}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSetting (7.21) to zero at $\\mathrm{T}=\\mathrm{T}_{0}$, we find that for zero temperature dependence at the reference temperature, we need:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{B E 0-2}+K \\frac{k T_{0}}{q} \\ln \\left(\\frac{J_{2}}{J_{1}}\\right)=V_{G 0}+(m-1) \\frac{k T_{0}}{q} \\tag{7.22}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe left side of (7.22) corresponds to the output voltage $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {ref }}$ at $\\mathrm{T}=\\mathrm{T}_{0}$ from (7.20). Thus, for zero temperature dependence at $\\mathrm{T}=\\mathrm{T}_{0}$, we require:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {ref- } 0}=V_{G 0}+(m-1) \\frac{\\mathrm{kT}_{0}}{q} \\tag{7.23}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor the specific case of $\\mathrm{T}_{0}=300{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{K}$ and $\\mathrm{m}=2.3$, (7.23) implies:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {ref-0 }}=1.24 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{7.24}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis value is independent of the chosen current densities. Therefore, if a higher current density is selected, K must be appropriately reduced to achieve the correct reference output voltage. In precision integrated voltage references, this correct output voltage is achieved through trimming during wafer testing. From (7.22), the required value for K is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nK=\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{G} 0}+(m-1) \\frac{k T_{0}}{q}-V_{B E 0-2}}{\\frac{k T_{0}}{q} \\ln \\left(\\frac{J_{2}}{J_{1}}\\right)}=\\frac{1.24-V_{B E 0-2}}{0.0258 \\ln \\left(\\frac{J_{2}}{J_{1}}\\right)} \\tag{7.25}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nat $300{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{K}$.\nThe rationale behind the term \"bandgap voltage\" should now be clear. Specifically, for zero temperature dependence, the output of a bandgap voltage reference equals the bandgap voltage plus a minor correction term to account for second-order effects.\n\nThe reference voltage for temperatures other than the reference is determined by backsubstituting (7.22) and (7.23) into (7.20). After some manipulation, the result is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {ref }}=V_{G 0}+(m-1) \\frac{k T}{q}\\left[1+\\ln \\left(\\frac{T_{0}}{T}\\right)\\right] \\tag{7.26}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\partial V_{\\text {ref }}}{\\partial T}=(m-1) \\frac{k}{q} \\ln \\left(\\frac{T_{0}}{T}\\right) \\tag{7.27}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThese equations can be used to estimate the temperature dependence at temperatures different from the reference temperature. In the subsequent section, a practical bipolar realization of a bandgap reference will be discussed.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 7.4\n\nEstimate the temperature dependence at $0^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ for a bandgap voltage reference designed to have zero temperature dependence at $20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.

    "text": "As previously noted, a bandgap voltage reference is derived by subtracting the voltage of a forward-biased diode (or base-emitter junction) with a negative temperature coefficient from a voltage that is proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT). The circuit depicted in Fig. 7.9 is a simplified version of a bandgap voltage reference. It incorporates a PTAT generator and an operational amplifier to produce a reference voltage of roughly 1.26 V. An NPN transistor is utilized to generate a voltage with a negative temperature coefficient, which is then combined with the PTAT voltage to ensure temperature stability.\n\nFig. 7.9 illustrates a simplified circuit of a bandgap voltage reference. The PTAT voltage is achieved by amplifying the voltage difference between two forward-biased base-emitter (or diode) junctions. A symbolic representation of a bandgap voltage reference system is shown in Fig. 7.9.\n\nThe I-V relationship for a forward-biased base-emitter junction of a bipolar transistor ${ }^{3}$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}=\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{S}} \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{qV} \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{BE}} / \\mathrm{kT}} \\tag{7.13}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $I_{S}$ is the transistor scale current, which strongly depends on temperature. By expressing the base-emitter voltage as a function of collector current and temperature, it can be demonstrated [Brugler, 1967; Tsividis, 1980] that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{B E}=V_{G 0}\\left(1-\\frac{T}{T_{0}}\\right)+V_{B E 0} \\frac{T}{T_{0}}+\\frac{m k T}{q} \\ln \\left(\\frac{T_{0}}{T}\\right)+\\frac{k T}{q} \\ln \\left(\\frac{J_{C}}{J_{C 0}}\\right) \\tag{7.14}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{G} 0}$ is the silicon bandgap voltage extrapolated to 0 K (approximately 1.206 V), k is Boltzmann's constant, and m is a temperature constant approximately equal to 2.3. $\\mathrm{J}_{\\mathrm{c}}$ and T represent the collector current density and temperature, respectively, with the subscript 0 indicating values at a reference temperature, $T_{0}$. Specifically, $J_{C 0}$ is the collector current density at $T_{0}$, while $J_{C}$ is the density at the actual temperature, T. $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE} 0}$ is the junction voltage at $T_{0}$, and $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE}}$ is the voltage at T.

For a constant $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}$, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE}}$ exhibits approximately a $-2 \\mathrm{mV} /{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{K}$ temperature dependence around room temperature. This negative temperature dependence is counterbalanced by the PTAT dependence of the amplified difference between two base-emitter junctions biased at different but fixed current densities. Using (7.14), it can be shown that if two base-emitter junctions are biased at currents $J_{2}$ and $J_{1}$, the voltage difference between their junctions is\n\nKey Point: An integrated voltage reference is formed by adding the forward bias voltage of a pn junction to the voltage difference between two pn junctions biased at different current densities. These voltages are scaled beforehand to ensure their positive and negative temperature coefficients precisely cancel each other.\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE}}=\\mathrm{V}_{2}-\\mathrm{V}_{1}=\\frac{\\mathrm{kT}}{\\mathrm{q}} \\ln \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{~J}_{2}}{\\mathrm{~J}_{1}}\\right) \\tag{7.16}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, the voltage difference between the junctions is proportional to absolute temperature, a relationship that remains accurate even when the collector currents are temperature-dependent, provided their ratio remains constant.\n\n[^2]\n#### EXAMPLE 7.3\n\nConsider two transistors biased at a current-density ratio of $10:1$ at $\\mathrm{T}=300 \\mathrm{~K}$. Determine the difference in their base-emitter voltages and its temperature dependence.\n\n#### Solution\n\nUsing (7.16), we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE}}=\\frac{\\mathrm{kT}}{\\mathrm{q}} \\ln \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{~J}_{2}}{\\mathrm{~J}_{1}}\\right)=\\frac{1.38 \\times 10^{-23}(300)}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19}} \\ln (10)=59.5 \\mathrm{mV} \\tag{7.17}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince this voltage is proportional to absolute temperature, a 1 K increase in temperature results in\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE}}=59.5 \\mathrm{mV} \\frac{301}{300}=59.7 \\mathrm{mV} \\tag{7.18}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, the voltage dependence is $59.5 \\mathrm{mV} / 300 \\mathrm{~K}$ or $0.198 \\mathrm{mV} / \\mathrm{K}$. Given that a single $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE}}$ has a temperature dependence of $-2 \\mathrm{mV} / \\mathrm{K}$, to cancel this dependence, $\\Delta \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE}}$ should be amplified by approximately a factor of 10, as explained subsequently.\n\nIt will be shown that in realizing a bandgap voltage reference, while the output voltage is temperature-independent, the junction currents are proportional to absolute temperature (assuming the resistors are temperature-independent). To simplify derivations, we initially assume the junction currents are proportional to absolute temperature, verifying this later when describing circuit realizations. We thus initially assume\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{J_{i}}{J_{i 0}}=\\frac{T}{T_{0}} \\tag{7.19}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $J_{i}$ is the collector current density of the $i^{\\text {th }}$ transistor, and $J_{i 0}$ is the same at the reference temperature.\n\nNow, suppose the difference between two base-emitter voltages is multiplied by a factor K and added to the base-emitter voltage of the junction with the higher current density. Using (7.16) and (7.19) along with (7.14), we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {ref }} & =\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE} 2}+\\mathrm{K} \\Delta \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{BE}} \\\\\n& =\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{G} 0}+\\frac{\\mathrm{T}}{\\mathrm{~T}_{0}}\\left(\\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{BE}-2-2}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{G} 0}\\right)+(\\mathrm{m}-1) \\frac{\\mathrm{kT}}{\\mathrm{q}} \\ln \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{~T}_{0}}{\\mathrm{~T}}\\right)+\\mathrm{K} \\frac{\\mathrm{kT}}{\\mathrm{q}} \\ln \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{~J}_{2}}{\\mathrm{~J}_{1}}\\right) \\tag{7.20}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nEquation (7.20) is the fundamental equation describing the relationship between the output voltage of a bandgap voltage reference and temperature. Here, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE0-2}}$ is the base-emitter junction voltage of the second transistor at $T_{0}$. To achieve zero temperature dependence at a specific temperature, we differentiate (7.20) with respect to temperature and set the derivative to zero at the desired reference temperature. From (7.20), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathrm{V}_{\\text {ref }}}{\\partial \\mathrm{T}}=\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{~T}_{0}}\\left(\\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{BE} 0-2}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{G} 0}\\right)+\\mathrm{K} \\frac{\\mathrm{k}}{\\mathrm{q}} \\ln \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{~J}_{2}}{\\mathrm{~J}_{1}}\\right)+(\\mathrm{m}-1) \\frac{\\mathrm{k}}{\\mathrm{q}}\\left[\\ln \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{~T}_{0}}{\\mathrm{~T}}\\right)-1\\right] \\tag{7.21}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSetting (7.21) to zero at $\\mathrm{T}=\\mathrm{T}_{0}$, for zero temperature dependence at the reference temperature, we require\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{B E 0-2}+K \\frac{k T_{0}}{q} \\ln \\left(\\frac{J_{2}}{J_{1}}\\right)=V_{G 0}+(m-1) \\frac{k T_{0}}{q} \\tag{7.22}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe left side of (7.22) represents the output voltage $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {ref }}$ at $\\mathrm{T}=\\mathrm{T}_{0}$ from (7.20). Thus, for zero temperature dependence at $\\mathrm{T}=\\mathrm{T}_{0}$, we need\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {ref- } 0}=V_{G 0}+(m-1) \\frac{\\mathrm{kT}_{0}}{q} \\tag{7.23}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor the specific case of $\\mathrm{T}_{0}=300{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{K}$ and $\\mathrm{m}=2.3$, (7.23) implies\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {ref-0 }}=1.24 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{7.24}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nfor zero temperature dependence. Note that this value is independent of the chosen current densities. Hence, if a higher current density is selected, K must be appropriately reduced to achieve the correct reference output voltage. In precision integrated voltage references, this correct output voltage is attained through trimming during wafer testing. From (7.22), the required value for K is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nK=\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{G} 0}+(m-1) \\frac{k T_{0}}{q}-V_{B E 0-2}}{\\frac{k T_{0}}{q} \\ln \\left(\\frac{J_{2}}{J_{1}}\\right)}=\\frac{1.24-V_{B E 0-2}}{0.0258 \\ln \\left(\\frac{J_{2}}{J_{1}}\\right)} \\tag{7.25}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nat $300{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{K}$.\nThe rationale behind the name \"bandgap voltage\" should now be clear. Specifically, for zero temperature dependence, the output of a bandgap voltage reference equals the bandgap voltage plus a minor correction term to account for second-order effects.\n\nThe reference voltage for temperatures other than the reference temperature is determined by backsubstituting (7.22) and (7.23) into (7.20). After some manipulation, the result is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {ref }}=V_{G 0}+(m-1) \\frac{k T}{q}\\left[1+\\ln \\left(\\frac{T_{0}}{T}\\right)\\right] \\tag{7.26}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\partial V_{\\text {ref }}}{\\partial T}=(m-1) \\frac{k}{q} \\ln \\left(\\frac{T_{0}}{T}\\right) \\tag{7.27}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThese equations can be used to estimate the temperature dependence at temperatures different from the reference temperature. In the subsequent section, a practical bipolar realization of a bandgap reference will be described.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 7.4\n\nEstimate the temperature dependence at $0^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ for a bandgap voltage reference designed to have zero temperature dependence at $20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.

Substituting these into (7.27), we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{\\partial \\mathrm{~T}}=(2.3-1) \\frac{1.38 \\times 10^{-23}}{1.6 \\times 10^{-19}} \\ln \\left(\\frac{293}{273}\\right)=8 \\mu \\mathrm{~V} / \\mathrm{K} \\tag{7.28}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor a reference voltage of 1.24 V, a dependency of $8 \\mu \\mathrm{~V} / \\mathrm{K}$ translates to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{8 \\mu \\mathrm{~V} /{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{K}}{1.24 \\mathrm{~V}}=6.5 \\times 10^{-6} \\text { parts } /{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{K}=6.5 \\mathrm{ppm} / \\mathrm{K} \\tag{7.29}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere ppm denotes parts per million. It should be noted that practical effects typically result in voltage references with temperature dependencies 4 to 10 times larger than this small amount.

The ideal first-order temperature dependence of this bandgap voltage circuit is $0 \\mathrm{ppm} / \\mathrm{K}$ at the reference temperature of $20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$."

The amplifier within the feedback loop ensures that the collector voltages of transistors $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ remain in equilibrium. Given that $R_3$ equals $R_4$, it is assured that both transistors experience identical collector currents and collector-emitter voltages. The emitter area of $Q_1$ is扩大 to eight times that of $Q_2$. Consequently, $Q_2$ exhibits a current density eightfold that of $Q_1$, leading to the following relationship:\n\n$$\n\\frac{J_2}{J_1} = 8 \\tag{7.30}\n$$\n\nFor the circuit, we have:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text{ref}} = V_{BE2} + V_{R1} \\tag{7.31}\n$$\n\nAdditionally:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{R1} &= I_{R1} R_1 \\\\\n&= 2 I_{R2} R_1 \\tag{7.32}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nFig. 7.10 presents a simplified schematic of a bipolar bandgap voltage reference. The emitter area of $Q_1$ is eight times that of $Q_2$, resulting in a current density ratio of 8:1. The circuit employs an operational amplifier to maintain a stable reference voltage (Vref). Resistors $R_3$ and $R_4$ are equal and aid in balancing the current through the transistors. The circuit is grounded at the lower end of $R_1$.\n\nHowever:\n\n$$\nI_{R2} = \\frac{V_{R2}}{R_2} = \\frac{V_{BE2} - V_{BE1}}{R_2} = \\frac{\\Delta V_{BE}}{R_2} \\tag{7.33}\n$$\n\nSubstituting (7.32) and (7.33) into (7.31) yields:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text{ref}} = V_{BE2} + \\frac{2 R_1}{R_2} \\Delta V_{BE} \\tag{7.34}\n$$\n\nThis equation represents the desired form to achieve a bandgap reference. It is evident that:\n\n$$\nK = \\frac{2 R_1}{R_2} \\tag{7.35}\n$$\n\nWith the assumption that $V_{BE2-0} = 0.65 \\text{ V}$, from (7.25):\n\n$$\n\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1.24 - 0.65}{0.0258 \\times \\ln(8)} = 5.5 \\tag{7.36}\n$$\n\nIn integrated circuits, $R_1$ or $R_2$ would be trimmed while monitoring $V_{\\text{ref}}$ to align it with the desired reference voltage. Furthermore, the optimal voltage value might be determined empirically during the prototyping phase of the design cycle.\n\nIt is also observed from (7.16) and (7.33) that:\n\n$$\nI_{E1} = I_{E2} = I_{R2} = \\frac{\\Delta V_{BE}}{R_2} = \\frac{\\frac{k T}{q} \\ln\\left(\\frac{J_2}{J_1}\\right)}{R_2} \\tag{7.37}\n$$\n\nThis indicates that all currents are proportional to absolute temperature (assuming resistor $R_2$ is temperature-independent). Thus, as previously assumed, all currents are indeed PTAT. It is noteworthy that PTAT currents are frequently employed to bias many bipolar circuits, as they result in transistor transconductances being independent of temperature. This constant transconductance is beneficial as it ensures that circuit speed is relatively unaffected by temperature changes. However, it has the drawback that circuit power dissipation significantly increases at high temperatures, making heat dissipation more challenging.\n\nFor applications requiring reference voltages exceeding 1.24 V, a modified bandgap reference as shown in Fig. 7.11 can be utilized. It can be demonstrated that the output voltage is now expressed as:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text{ref-0}} = \\left(1 + \\frac{R_4}{R_5}\\right)\\left[V_{G0} + (m - 1) \\frac{k T_0}{q}\\right] \\approx \\left(1 + \\frac{R_4}{R_5}\\right) 1.24 \\text{ V} \\tag{7.38}\n$$\n\nResistor $R_3$ has been introduced to counteract the effects of the finite base currents flowing through $R_4$, and its value should be selected according to the formula provided in the figure. Readers seeking further details on this implementation are directed to [Brokaw, 1974].\n\n#### CMOS Bandgap References\n\nThe prevalent technique for realizing CMOS voltage references also utilizes a bandgap voltage reference, despite the absence of discrete bipolar transistors. These CMOS circuits depend on what are commonly referred to as well transistors. These devices are vertical bipolar transistors that employ wells as their bases and the substrate as their collectors. In an n-well process, a common modern approach, these vertical bipolar transistors are pnp types with their collectors connected to ground, as illustrated in Fig. 7.12(a). In a p-well process, they would be npn transistors with their collectors connected to the positive power supply, as shown in Fig. 7.12(b). These transistors possess reasonable current gains, but their primary limitation is the series base resistance, which can be substantial due to the extensive lateral dimensions between the base contact and the effective emitter region. To minimize errors caused by this base resistance, the maximum collector currents through the transistors are typically limited to less than 0.1 mA. It is feasible to employ these transistors to implement bandgap voltage references using configurations similar to those depicted in Fig. 7.13(a) for n-well processes [Kujik, 1973] or Fig. 7.13(b) for p-well processes [Ye, 1982].\n\nRegarding the n-well implementation of Fig. 7.13(a), we have:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text{ref}} = V_{EB1} + V_{R1} \\tag{7.39}\n$$\n\nAdditionally, assuming the opamp has high gain and its input terminals are at the same voltage, then:\n\n$$\nV_{R2} = V_{EB1} - V_{EB2} = \\Delta V_{EB} \\tag{7.40}\n$$\n\nSince the current through $R_3$ is equal to the current through $R_2$, we have:\n\n$$\nV_{R3} = \\frac{R_3}{R_2} V_{R2} = \\frac{R_3}{R_2} \\Delta V_{EB} \\tag{7.41}\n$$\n\nusing (7.40). The opamp feedback also ensures that the voltage across $R_1$ is equal to the voltage across $R_3$. Using this fact and substituting (7.41) into (7.39) leads to:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text{ref}} = V_{EB1} + \\frac{R_3}{R_2} \\Delta V_{EB} \\tag{7.42}\n$$\n\nwhich is in the required form to realize a bandgap reference. In integrated implementations of this reference, the bipolar transistors are often made the same size, and the different current-densities are achieved by making $R_3$ greater than $R_1$, which leads to $I_1$ being larger than $I_2$. In this scenario, we would have:\n\n$$\n\\frac{J_1}{J_2} = \\frac{R_3}{R_1} \\tag{7.43}\n$$\n\nsince $R_1$ and $R_3$ have the same voltage across them. Also, recalling from (7.16) that:\n\n$$\n\\Delta V_{EB} = V_{EB1} - V_{EB2} = \\frac{kT}{q} \\ln\\left(\\frac{J_1}{J_2}\\right) \\tag{7.44}\n$$\n\nand using (7.43) in (7.42) gives:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text{ref}} = V_{EB1} + \\frac{R_3}{R_2} \\frac{k T}{q} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R_3}{R_1}\\right) \\tag{7.45}\n$$\n\nIt is immediately apparent that:\n\n$$\nK = \\frac{R_3}{R_2} \\tag{7.46}\n$$\n\n#### EXAMPLE 7.5\n\nDetermine the resistances of a bandgap voltage reference based on Fig. 7.13(a), where $I_1 = 80 \\mu \\text{ A}$, $I_2 = 8 \\mu \\text{ A}$, and $V_{EB1-0} = 0.65 \\text{ V}$ at $T = 300 \\text{ K}$.\n\n#### Solution\n\nRecalling from (7.24) that:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text{ref-0}} = 1.24 \\text{ V} \\tag{7.47}\n$$\n\ntherefore, from (7.39), we require:\n\n$$\nV_{R1} = V_{\\text{ref-0}} - V_{EB1-0} = 0.59 \\text{ V} \\tag{7.48}\n$$\n\nAlso, since $V_{R3} = V_{R1}$, we have:\n\n$$\nR_3 = \\frac{V_{R3}}{I_2} = \\frac{0.59 \\text{ V}}{8 \\mu \\text{ A}} = 73.8 \\text{ k}\\Omega \\tag{7.49}\n$$\n\nand:\n\n$$\nR_1 = R_3 \\frac{I_2}{I_1} = 7.38 \\text{ k}\\Omega \\tag{7.50}\n$$\n\nNow, recalling from (7.26) that:\n\n$$\nK = \\frac{1.24 - 0.65 \\text{ V}}{0.0258 \\times \\ln(10)} = 9.93 \\tag{7.51}\n$$\n\ntherefore:\n\n$$\nR_2 = \\frac{R_3}{K} = 7.43 \\text{ k}\\Omega \\tag{7.52}\n$$\n\nIt is of interest to note here that using (7.44) and noting that $J_1/J_2 = I_1/I_2$ (since the sizes of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are assumed to be the same), we find that:\n\n$$\n\\Delta V_{EB} = \\frac{kT_0}{q} \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_1}{I_2}\\right) = 59 \\text{ mV} \\tag{7.53}\n$$\n\ngives the temperature dependence value of $0.198 \\text{ mV/K}$, as found in Example 7.3, which necessitates approximately a gain of 10 to cancel temperature dependency (actually 9.93 in this case).\n\nThe design equations for a voltage reference suitable for p-well processes and shown in Fig. 7.13(b) are essentially the same as those just presented for the n-well reference.\n\nIn CMOS implementations of the references described above, the high-value resistors are often realized by well resistors. Unfortunately, these resistors have a temperature dependence approximately given by [Michejda, 1984]:\n\n$$\nR(T) = R_0 \\frac{T^\\eta}{T_0^\\eta} \\tag{7.54}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\eta = 2.2$. The errors caused by this temperature dependence can be mitigated by offsetting $V_{\\text{ref-0}}$ slightly positive from the value given by (7.23) to:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text{ref-0}} = V_{G0} + (m + \\eta - 1) \\frac{k T_0}{q} \\tag{7.55}\n$$\n\nAssuming the effects of the temperature coefficient of the resistors have been minimized, the next significant source of error is often due to the input-offset voltage of the opamp [Michejda, 1984]. This results in an error term in the equation for $\\Delta V_{EB}$ that is roughly equal to K times the input-offset voltage of the opamp. For instance, a 1 mV offset error that is temperature-independent causes a temperature coefficient (TC) error approximately given by [Song, 1983]:\n\n$$\nTC_{\\text{error}} \\approx 26 \\text{ ppm}/^\\circ \\text{C} \\tag{7.56}\n$$\n\nOne method to eliminate this source of error is to use switched-capacitor (SC) amplifiers that incorporate input-offset compensation circuits [Song, 1983]. One possible SC-based voltage reference is shown in Fig. 7.14, which utilizes an amplifier described in [Martin, 1987]. The amplifier depicted results in a circuit with its output valid at all times and is less sensitive to finite opamp gain. A detailed explanation of how the amplifier in Fig. 7.14 operates is deferred until Chapter 14, where switched-capacitor circuits are discussed.\n\nAssuming errors due to the input-offset voltage of the opamp have been minimized, there is still an inherent temperature dependence of the bandgap voltage reference, as observed in (7.27). Additionally, a further temperature dependence occurs because $V_{G0}$ varies slightly with temperature (which has been neglected in the previous analysis). Together, these two error sources limit the best achievable temperature coefficient to about $25 \\text{ ppm}/^\\circ \\text{K}$. Reducing these second-order effects is beyond the scope of this book, but the interested reader is referred to [Palmer, 1981; Meijer, 1982; Song, 1983] for examples of how errors due to second-order effects have been minimized.\n\nAn alternative realization of a CMOS bandgap reference was reported in [Degrauwe, 1985], where lateral npn well transistors were used. Additionally, in [Tzanateas, 1979] a voltage reference was reported that was based on a realized PTAT voltage from the difference of the source-gate voltages of two MOS transistors biased in weak inversion. Readers interested in these circuits can refer to the respective literature for detailed information."

    "text": "A foundational design for bipolar bandgap references was introduced by Brokaw in 1974. The core circuit, depicted in Fig. 7.10, employs an amplifier to ensure that the collector voltages of transistors $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ are in equilibrium. Given that $R_{3}$ equals $R_{4}$, it is ensured that both transistors share identical collector currents and collector-emitter voltages. A notable aspect of the design is that the emitter area of $Q_{1}$ is扩大了$Q_{2}$的八倍，导致$Q_{2}$的电流密度是$Q_{1}$的八倍，这可以表达为：\n\n$$\n\\frac{J_{2}}{J_{1}}=8 \\tag{7.30}\n$$\n\nThe reference voltage $V_{\\text{ref}}$ for this circuit is given by:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text{ref}}=V_{BE2}+V_{R1} \\tag{7.31}\n$$\n\nAnd the voltage across $R_{1}$ can be expressed as:\n\n$$\nV_{R1}=I_{R1}R_{1}=2I_{R2}R_{1} \\tag{7.32}\n$$\n\nwhere Fig. 7.10 represents a simplified schematic of the bipolar bandgap voltage reference, with $Q_{1}$'s emitter area being eight times that of $Q_{2}$, leading to a current density ratio of 8:1. An operational amplifier is used to maintain a stable reference voltage ($V_{\\text{ref}}$), and resistors $R_{3}$ and $R_{4}$, being equal, help balance the current through the transistors. The circuit is grounded at the bottom of $R_{1}$.\n\nThe current through $R_{2}$ is given by:\n\n$$\nI_{R2}=\\frac{V_{R2}}{R_{2}}=\\frac{V_{BE2}-V_{BE1}}{R_{2}}=\\frac{\\Delta V_{BE}}{R_{2}} \\tag{7.33}\n$$\n\nBy substituting equations (7.32) and (7.33) into (7.31), we get:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text{ref}}=V_{BE2}+\\frac{2R_{1}}{R_{2}}\\Delta V_{BE} \\tag{7.34}\n$$\n\nwhich is the desired form for a bandgap reference. The constant $K$ is then identified as:\n\n$$\nK=\\frac{2R_{1}}{R_{2}} \\tag{7.35}\n$$\n\nAssuming $V_{BE2-0}=0.65$ V, the ratio $\\frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}}$ can be calculated from equation (7.25) as:\n\n$$\n\\frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}}=\\frac{1}{2}\\times\\frac{1.24-0.65}{0.0258\\times\\ln(8)}=5.5 \\tag{7.36}\n$$\n\nIn integrated circuits, either $R_{1}$ or $R_{2}$ would be trimmed while observing $V_{\\text{ref}}$ to ensure it matches the desired reference voltage. Additionally, the optimal voltage value might be determined empirically during the prototyping phase.\n\nFrom equations (7.16) and (7.33), it follows that:\n\n$$\nI_{E1}=I_{E2}=I_{R2}=\\frac{\\Delta V_{BE}}{R_{2}}=\\frac{\\frac{kT}{q}\\ln\\left(\\frac{J_{2}}{J_{1}}\\right)}{R_{2}} \\tag{7.37}\n$$\n\nindicating that all currents are proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT), assuming $R_{2}$ is temperature-independent. PTAT currents are commonly used to bias bipolar circuits, resulting in transistor transconductances that are temperature-independent. This feature ensures that circuit speed is relatively unaffected by temperature changes, but it also means that power dissipation increases significantly at high temperatures, complicating heat dissipation.\n\nFor applications requiring reference voltages higher than 1.24 V, a modified bandgap reference like the one in Fig. 7.11 can be utilized. It can be shown that the output voltage is:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text{ref-0}}=\\left(1+\\frac{R_{4}}{R_{5}}\\right)\\left[V_{G0}+(m-1)\\frac{kT_{0}}{q}\\right]\\cong\\left(1+\\frac{R_{4}}{R_{5}}\\right)1.24 \\text{ V} \\tag{7.38}\n$$\n\nResistor $R_{3}$ is included to offset the effects of the finite base currents through $R_{4}$ and should be selected according to the formula provided in the figure. Further details on this realization can be found in [Brokaw, 1974].\n\n#### CMOS Bandgap References\n\nThe prevalent approach for creating CMOS voltage references also utilizes a bandgap voltage reference, even though discrete bipolar transistors are not available. These CMOS circuits depend on so-called well transistors, which are vertical bipolar transistors using wells as their bases and the substrate as their collectors. In an n-well process, these vertical bipolar transistors are pnp types with their collectors connected to ground, as illustrated in Fig. 7.12(a). In a p-well process, they would be npn transistors with their collectors connected to the positive power supply, as shown in Fig. 7.12(b). These transistors possess moderate current gains, but their primary limitation is the series base resistance, which can be significant due to the extensive lateral dimensions between the base contact and the effective emitter region. To reduce errors caused by this base resistance, the maximum collector currents through the transistors are usually limited to less than 0.1 mA. It is feasible to use these transistors to implement bandgap voltage references using configurations similar to those depicted in Fig. 7.13(a) for n-well processes [Kujik, 1973] or Fig. 7.13(b) for p-well processes [Ye, 1982].\n\nRegarding the n-well implementation of Fig. 7.13(a), we have:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text{ref}}=V_{EB1}+V_{R1} \\tag{7.39}\n$$\n\nAnd assuming the opamp has high gain and its input terminals are at the same voltage, then:\n\n$$\nV_{R2}=V_{EB1}-V_{EB2}=\\Delta V_{EB} \\tag{7.40}\n$$\n\nSince the current through $R_{3}$ is the same as the current through $R_{2}$, we have:\n\n$$\nV_{R3}=\\frac{R_{3}}{R_{2}}V_{R2}=\\frac{R_{3}}{R_{2}}\\Delta V_{EB} \\tag{7.41}\n$$\n\nusing (7.40). The opamp feedback ensures the voltage across $R_{1}$ equals the voltage across $R_{3}$. Using this fact and substituting (7.41) into (7.39) results in:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text{ref}}=V_{EB1}+\\frac{R_{3}}{R_{2}}\\Delta V_{EB} \\tag{7.42}\n$$\n\nwhich is in the required form to realize a bandgap reference. In integrated realizations of this reference, the bipolar transistors are often made the same size, and the different current-densities are achieved by making $R_{3}$ greater than $R_{1}$, causing $I_{1}$ to be larger than $I_{2}$. In this scenario, we would have:\n\n$$\n\\frac{J_{1}}{J_{2}}=\\frac{R_{3}}{R_{1}} \\tag{7.43}\n$$\n\nsince $R_{1}$ and $R_{3}$ have the same voltage across them. Also, recalling from (7.16) that:\n\n$$\n\\Delta V_{EB}=V_{EB1}-V_{EB2}=\\frac{kT}{q}\\ln\\left(\\frac{J_{1}}{J_{2}}\\right) \\tag{7.44}\n$$\n\nand using (7.43) in (7.42) gives:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text{ref}}=V_{EB1}+\\frac{R_{3}}{R_{2}}\\frac{kT}{q}\\ln\\left(\\frac{R_{3}}{R_{1}}\\right) \\tag{7.45}\n$$\n\nIt is immediately recognizable that:\n\n$$\nK=\\frac{R_{3}}{R_{2}} \\tag{7.46}\n$$\n\n#### EXAMPLE 7.5\n\nDetermine the resistances of a bandgap voltage reference based on Fig. 7.13(a), where $I_{1}=80 \\mu \\text{A}$, $I_{2}=8 \\mu \\text{A}$, and $V_{EB1-0}=0.65 \\text{ V}$ at $T=300 \\text{ K}$.\n\n#### Solution\n\nRecalling from (7.24) that:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text{ref-0}}=1.24 \\text{ V} \\tag{7.47}\n$$\n\ntherefore, from (7.39), we require:\n\n$$\nV_{R1}=V_{\\text{ref-0}}-V_{EB1-0}=0.59 \\text{ V} \\tag{7.48}\n$$\n\nAlso, since $V_{R3}=V_{R1}$, we have:\n\n$$\nR_{3}=\\frac{V_{R3}}{I_{2}}=\\frac{0.59 \\text{ V}}{8 \\mu \\text{A}}=73.8 \\text{k}\\Omega \\tag{7.49}\n$$\n\nand:\n\n$$\nR_{1}=R_{3}\\frac{I_{2}}{I_{1}}=7.38 \\text{k}\\Omega \\tag{7.50}\n$$\n\nNow, recalling from (7.26) that:\n\n$$\nK=\\frac{1.24-0.65 \\text{ V}}{0.0258 \\times \\ln(10)}=9.93 \\tag{7.51}\n$$\n\ntherefore:\n\n$$\nR_{2}=\\frac{R_{3}}{K}=7.43 \\text{k}\\Omega \\tag{7.52}\n$$\n\nIt is of interest to note here that using (7.44) and noting that $J_{1}/J_{2}=I_{1}/I_{2}$ (since the sizes of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ are assumed to be the same), we find that:\n\n$$\n\\Delta V_{EB}=\\frac{kT_{0}}{q}\\ln\\left(\\frac{I_{1}}{I_{2}}\\right)=59 \\text{ mV} \\tag{7.53}\n$$\n\ngives the temperature dependence value of $0.198 \\text{ mV}/\\text{K}$, as found in Example 7.3, which requires approximately a gain of 10 to cancel temperature dependency (actually 9.93 in this case).\n\nThe design equations for a voltage reference suitable for p-well processes and shown in Fig. 7.13(b) are essentially identical to those just given for the n-well reference.\n\nIn CMOS realizations of the references described, the large value resistors are often implemented by well resistors. Unfortunately, these resistors have a temperature dependence approximately given by [Michejda, 1984]:\n\n$$\nR(T)=R_{0}\\frac{T^{\\eta}}{T_{0}^{\\eta}} \\tag{7.54}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\eta=2.2$. The errors caused by this temperature dependence can be eliminated by offsetting $V_{\\text{ref-0}}$ slightly positive from the value given by (7.23) to:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text{ref-0}}=V_{G0}+(m+\\eta-1)\\frac{kT_{0}}{q} \\tag{7.55}\n$$\n\nAssuming the effects of the temperature coefficient of the resistors have been minimized, the next major source of error is often due to the input-offset voltage of the opamp [Michejda, 1984]. This results in an error term in the equation for $\\Delta V_{EB}$ that is roughly equal to K times the input-offset voltage of the opamp. For instance, a 1 mV offset error that is temperature-independent causes a temperature coefficient (TC) error approximately given by [Song, 1983]:\n\n$$\nTC_{\\text{error}}\\cong 26 \\text{ ppm}/{}^{\\circ}\\text{C} \\tag{7.56}\n$$\n\nOne means of eliminating this source of error is to use switched-capacitor (SC) amplifiers that have input-offset compensation circuits [Song, 1983]. One possible SC-based voltage reference is shown in Fig. 7.14, where it makes use of an amplifier described in [Martin, 1987]. The amplifier shown results in a circuit having its output valid at all times and is less sensitive to finite opamp gain. A detailed explanation of how the amplifier shown in Fig. 7.14 operates is deferred until Chapter 14, where switched-capacitor circuits are discussed.\n\nAssuming errors due to the input-offset voltage of the opamp have been minimized, there is still an inherent temperature dependence of the bandgap voltage reference, as seen in (7.27). Additionally addition, a further temperature dependence occurs because $V_{G0}$ varies slightly with temperature (which has been ignored in the above analysis). Together, these two error sources limit the best achievable temperature coefficient to about $25 \\text{ ppm}/\nI foundational\nAn alternative\nApologies for the incomplete response.

These CMOS circuits rely on so-called well transistors. These are vertical bipolar transistors that utilize wells as their bases and the substrate as their collectors. In an n-well process, which is a common contemporary approach, these vertical bipolar transistors are pnp types with their collectors connected to ground, as illustrated in Fig. 7.12(a).

It is feasible to employ these transistors to realize bandgap voltage references using configurations analogous to those depicted in Fig. 7.13(a) for n-well processes [Kujik, 1973] or Fig. 7.13(b) for p-well processes [Ye, 1982].\n\n[Descriptions of Figs. 7.11, 7.12(a), 7.12(b), (a)Bandgap voltage reference circuit, and (b) are provided.]\n\nWith respect to the n-well implementation of Fig. 7.13(a), we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {ref }}=V_{E B 1}+V_{R 1} \\tag{7.39}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAnd assuming the opamp has high gain and its input terminals are at the same voltage, then:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{R 2}=V_{E B 1}-V_{E B 2}=\\Delta V_{E B} \\tag{7.40}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince the current through $R_{3}$ matches the current through $R_{2}$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{R} 3}=\\frac{\\mathrm{R}_{3}}{\\mathrm{R}_{2}} \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{R} 2}=\\frac{\\mathrm{R}_{3}}{\\mathrm{R}_{2}} \\Delta \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{EB}} \\tag{7.41}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nusing (7.40). The opamp feedback ensures that the voltage across $R_{1}$ equals the voltage across $R_{3}$. Leveraging this fact and substituting (7.41) into (7.39) yields:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {ref }}=V_{E B 1}+\\frac{R_{3}}{R_{2}} \\Delta V_{E B} \\tag{7.42}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhich is the required form for a bandgap reference.

This introduces an error term in the equation for $\\Delta \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE}}$ that is approximately K times the opamp's input-offset voltage. For instance, a 1 mV offset error that is temperature-independent leads to a temperature coefficient (TC) error of roughly [Song, 1983]:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{TC}_{\\text {error }} \\cong 26 \\mathrm{ppm} /{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} \\tag{7.56}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nOne method to eliminate this error source is to use switched-capacitor (SC) amplifiers equipped with input-offset compensation circuits [Song, 1983]. An example of an SC-based voltage reference is shown in Fig. 7.14, which utilizes an amplifier described in [Martin, 1987]. This amplifier configuration ensures that the circuit's output is valid at all times and is less susceptible to finite opamp gain. A comprehensive explanation of the amplifier's operation in Fig. 7.14 is deferred to Chapter 14, where switched-capacitor circuits are examined.\n\nAssuming that errors due to the opamp's input-offset voltage have been minimized, there remains an intrinsic temperature dependence in the bandgap voltage reference, as observed in (7.27).

In a p-well process, they would be npn transistors with their collectors connected to the positive power supply, as shown in Fig. 7.12(b). These transistors possess adequate current gains, yet their primary limitation lies in the series base resistance, which can be substantial due to the extensive lateral dimensions between the base contact and the effective emitter region. To mitigate errors stemming from this base resistance, the maximum collector currents through the transistors are typically restricted to be less than 0.1 mA. It is feasible to employ these transistors to realize bandgap voltage references using configurations akin to those shown in Fig. 7.13(a) for n-well processes [Kujik, 1973] or Fig. 7.13(b) for p-well processes [Ye, 1982].\n\nRegarding the n-well implementation of Fig. 7.13(a), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {ref }}=V_{E B 1}+V_{R 1} \\tag{7.39}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFurthermore, assuming the opamp possesses substantial gain and its input terminals are at the same voltage, then\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{R 2}=V_{E B 1}-V_{E B 2}=\\Delta V_{E B} \\tag{7.40}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince the current through $R_{3}$ is equivalent to the current through $R_{2}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{R} 3}=\\frac{\\mathrm{R}_{3}}{\\mathrm{R}_{2}} \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{R} 2}=\\frac{\\mathrm{R}_{3}}{\\mathrm{R}_{2}} \\Delta \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{EB}} \\tag{7.41}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nusing (7.40). The opamp feedback also ensures the voltage across $R_{1}$ is equal to the voltage across $R_{3}$.

These CMOS circuits rely on so-called well transistors. These devices are vertical bipolar transistors that employ wells as their bases and the substrate as their collectors. In an n-well process, these vertical bipolar transistors are pnp types with their collectors connected to ground, as shown in Figure 7.12(a). In a p-well process, they would be npn transistors with their collectors connected to the positive power supply, as illustrated in Figure 7.12(b).

To minimize errors due to this base resistance, the maximum collector currents through the transistors are typically constrained to be less than 0.1 mA. It is possible to use these transistors to implement bandgap voltage references using configurations similar to those depicted in Figure 7.13(a) for n-well processes [Kujik, 1973] or Figure 7.13(b) for p-well processes [Ye, 1982].\n\nWith respect to the n-well implementation of Figure 7.13(a), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {ref }}=V_{E B 1}+V_{R 1} \\tag{7.39}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAlso, assuming the opamp has high gain and its input terminals are at the same voltage, then\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{R 2}=V_{E B 1}-V_{E B 2}=\\Delta V_{E B} \\tag{7.40}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nNow, since the current through $R_{3}$ is the same as the current through $R_{2}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{R} 3}=\\frac{\\mathrm{R}_{3}}{\\mathrm{R}_{2}} \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{R} 2}=\\frac{\\mathrm{R}_{3}}{\\mathrm{R}_{2}} \\Delta \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{EB}} \\tag{7.41}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nusing (7.40).

The operational amplifier is employed to sustain a stable reference voltage (Vref). Resistors R3 and R4, being equal, facilitate balanced current flow through the transistors. The circuit is grounded at the lower end of R1.\n\nThe current $I_{\\mathrm{R} 2}$ is defined as:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{R} 2}=\\frac{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{R} 2}}{\\mathrm{R}_{2}}=\\frac{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE} 2}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE} 1}}{\\mathrm{R}_{2}}=\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE}}}{\\mathrm{R}_{2}} \\tag{7.33}\n$$\n\nBy substituting equations (7.32) and (7.33) into (7.31), we derive:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{ref}}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE} 2}+\\frac{2 \\mathrm{R}_{1}}{\\mathrm{R}_{2}} \\Delta \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{BE}} \\tag{7.34}\n$$\n\nThis equation represents the desired form for implementing a bandgap reference.

It is noteworthy that PTAT currents are frequently utilized to bias numerous bipolar circuits because they ensure transistor transconductances remain independent of temperature. While this results in circuit speeds being relatively unaffected by temperature fluctuations, it unfortunately leads to increased power dissipation at elevated temperatures, complicating heat dissipation.\n\nFor applications requiring reference voltages exceeding 1.24 V, a modified bandgap reference, as illustrated in Fig. 7.11, can be employed. It can be demonstrated that the output voltage is now:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text {ref-0 }}=\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathrm{R}_{4}}{\\mathrm{R}_{5}}\\right)\\left[\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{G} 0}+(\\mathrm{m}-1) \\frac{\\mathrm{k} T_{0}}{\\mathrm{q}}\\right] \\cong\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathrm{R}_{4}}{\\mathrm{R}_{5}}\\right) 1.24 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{7.38}\n$$\n\nResistor $R_{3}$ is added to counteract the impact of finite base currents through $R_{4}$, and its value should be determined using the formula depicted in the figure. Readers seeking further details are directed to [Brokaw, 1974].\n\n#### CMOS Bandgap References\n\nThe most prevalent technique for creating CMOS voltage references also harnesses the bandgap voltage reference concept, despite the unavailability of independent bipolar transistors. These CMOS circuits exploit devices commonly referred to as well transistors, which are vertical bipolar transistors utilizing wells as their bases and the substrate as their collectors. In an n-well process, a prevalent modern approach, these vertical bipolar transistors are pnp types with their collectors connected to ground, as depicted in Fig. 7.12(a). Conversely, in a p-well process, they would be npn transistors with their collectors connected to the positive power supply, as shown in Fig. 7.12(b). These transistors possess reasonable current gains; however, their primary limitation lies in the series base resistance, which can be substantial due to the extensive lateral dimensions between the base contact and the effective emitter region. To mitigate errors stemming from this base resistance, the maximum collector currents through the transistors are typically confined to less than 0.1 mA. Nevertheless, these transistors can be employed to realize bandgap voltage references using configurations akin to those presented in Fig. 7.13(a) for n-well processes [Kujik, 1973] or Fig. 7.13(b) for p-well processes [Ye, 1982].\n\nRegarding the n-well implementation in Fig. 7.13(a), we have:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text {ref }}=V_{E B 1}+V_{R 1} \\tag{7.39}\n$$\n\nFurthermore, assuming the opamp possesses a high gain and its input terminals are at the same voltage, we derive:\n\n$$\nV_{R 2}=V_{E B 1}-V_{E B 2}=\\Delta V_{E B} \\tag{7.40}\n$$\n\nSince the current through $R_{3}$ is equivalent to the current through $R_{2}$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{R} 3}=\\frac{\\mathrm{R}_{3}}{\\mathrm{R}_{2}} \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{R} 2}=\\frac{\\mathrm{R}_{3}}{\\mathrm{R}_{2}} \\Delta \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{EB}} \\tag{7.41}\n$$\n\nUtilizing (7.40) and the fact that the opamp feedback ensures the voltage across $R_{1}$ equals the voltage across $R_{3}$, we substitute (7.41) into (7.39) to obtain:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text {ref }}=V_{E B 1}+\\frac{R_{3}}{R_{2}} \\Delta V_{E B} \\tag{7.42}\n$$\n\nThis equation is in the required form for a bandgap reference. In integrated realizations of this reference, the bipolar transistors are often identical in size, and the differing current densities are achieved by making $\\mathrm{R}_{3}$ greater than $R_{1}$, causing $I_{1}$ to exceed $I_{2}$. In this scenario, we have:\n\n$$\n\\frac{J_{1}}{J_{2}}=\\frac{R_{3}}{R_{1}} \\tag{7.43}\n$$\n\nRecalling from (7.16) that:\n\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{EB}}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{EB} 1}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{EB} 2}=\\frac{\\mathrm{kT}}{\\mathrm{q}} \\ln \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{~J}_{1}}{\\mathrm{~J}_{2}}\\right) \\tag{7.44}\n$$\n\nand using (7.43) in (7.42) yields:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text {ref }}=V_{E B 1}+\\frac{R_{3}}{R_{2}} \\frac{k T}{q} \\ln \\left(\\frac{R_{3}}{R_{1}}\\right) \\tag{7.45}\n$$\n\nIt is evident that:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{K}=\\frac{\\mathrm{R}_{3}}{\\mathrm{R}_{2}} \\tag{7.46}\n$$\n\nThe design equations for a voltage reference tailored for p-well processes, as illustrated in Fig. 7.13(b), are essentially the same as those presented for the n-well reference.\n\nIn CMOS implementations of the aforementioned references, the high-value resistors are often constructed using well resistors. However, these resistors exhibit a temperature dependence approximately described by [Michejda, 1984]:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{R}(\\mathrm{~T})=\\mathrm{R}_{0} \\frac{\\mathrm{~T}^{\\eta}}{\\mathrm{T}_{0}^{\\eta}} \\tag{7.54}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\eta=2.2$. The discrepancies caused by this temperature dependence can be nullified by adjusting $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {ref-0 }}$ slightly above the value given by (7.23) to:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text {ref-0 }}=V_{G 0}+(m+\\eta-1) \\frac{k T_{0}}{q} \\tag{7.55}\n$$\n\nPresuming the temperature coefficient of the resistors has been minimized, the next significant source of error often arises from the input-offset voltage of the opamp [Michejda, 1984]. This introduces an error term in the equation for $\\Delta \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE}}$ that is approximately proportional to K times the input-offset voltage of the opamp. For instance, a 1 mV offset error that is temperature-independent results in a temperature coefficient (TC) error approximately given by [Song, 1983]:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{TC}_{\\text {error }} \\cong 26 \\mathrm{ppm} /{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} \\tag{7.56}\n$$\n\nOne method to eliminate this error source is to employ switched-capacitor (SC) amplifiers equipped with input-offset compensation circuits [Song, 1983]. An example of such an SC-based voltage reference is shown in Fig. 7.14, utilizing an amplifier detailed in [Martin, 1987]. The depicted amplifier ensures that the circuit's output remains valid at all times and is less susceptible to the opamp's finite gain. A comprehensive explanation of the amplifier's operation in Fig. 7.14 is deferred to Chapter 14, where switched-capacitor circuits are discussed.\n\nAssuming errors due to the opamp's input-offset voltage have been minimized, an inherent temperature dependence persists in the bandgap voltage reference, as observed in (7.27). Additionally, a further temperature dependence arises because $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{G} 0}$ exhibits a slight variation with temperature (which has been overlooked in the previous analysis). Collectively, these two error sources confine the best achievable temperature coefficient to approximately $25 \\mathrm{ppm} /{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{K}$. Minimizing these second-order effects is beyond the scope of this text, but readers interested in exploring this topic can refer to [Palmer, 1981; Meijer, 1982; Song, 1983] for examples of how errors due to second-order effects have been mitigated.\n\nAn alternative CMOS bandgap reference implementation was reported in [Degrauwe, 1985], utilizing lateral npn well transistors. Moreover, in [Tzanateas, 1979], a voltage reference based on a realized PTAT voltage from the difference in source-gate voltages of two MOS transistors biased in weak inversion was reported.

Consequently, as previously assumed, all currents are indeed PTAT. It is worth mentioning that PTAT currents are frequently used to bias many bipolar circuits, as they result in transistor transconductances being independent of temperature. This consistent transconductance has the beneficial attribute of rendering circuit speed relatively independent of temperature. However, it has the drawback that circuit power dissipation significantly increases at high temperatures, making heat dissipation more challenging.\n\nFor applications where a reference voltage higher than 1.24 V is required, a modified bandgap reference as depicted in Fig. 7.11 can be employed.

Unfortunately, these resistors exhibit a temperature dependence approximately described by [Michejda, 1984]:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{R}(\\mathrm{~T})=\\mathrm{R}_{0} \\frac{\\mathrm{~T}^{\\eta}}{\\mathrm{T}_{0}^{\\eta}} \\tag{7.54}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\eta=2.2$. The errors caused by this temperature dependence can be offset by slightly adjusting $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {ref-0 }}$ positive from the value given by (7.23) to:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {ref-0 }}=V_{G 0}+(m+\\eta-1) \\frac{k T_{0}}{q} \\tag{7.55}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAssuming that the effects of the temperature coefficient of the resistors have been minimized, the next significant source of error is often due to the input-offset voltage of the opamp [Michejda, 1984]. This introduces an error term in the equation for $\\Delta \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE}}$ that is approximately equal to K times the input-offset voltage of the opamp. For instance, a 1 mV offset error that is temperature-independent causes a temperature coefficient (TC) error approximately given by [Song, 1983]:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{TC}_{\\text {error }} \\cong 26 \\mathrm{ppm} /{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} \\tag{7.56}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nOne method to eliminate this source of error is to use switched-capacitor (SC) amplifiers that incorporate input-offset compensation circuits [Song, 1983]. One such SC-based voltage reference is depicted in Fig. 7.14, which employs an amplifier described in [Martin, 1987]. The amplifier shown results in a circuit with an output that is valid at all times and is less sensitive to finite opamp gain. A detailed explanation of the operation of the amplifier shown in Fig. 7.14 is deferred until Chapter 14, where switched-capacitor circuits are discussed.\n\nAssuming that errors due to the input-offset voltage of the opamp have been minimized, there remains an inherent temperature dependence of the bandgap voltage reference, as observed in (7.27). Furthermore, an additional temperature dependence arises because $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{G} 0}$ varies slightly with temperature (which has been neglected in the previous analysis). Together, these two error sources constrain the best achievable temperature coefficient to about $25 \\mathrm{ppm} /{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{K}$. Minimizing these second-order effects is beyond the scope of this book, but interested readers are referred to [Palmer, 1981; Meijer, 1982; Song, 1983] for examples of how errors due to second-order effects have been minimized.\n\nAn alternative realization of a CMOS bandgap reference was reported in [Degrauwe, 1985], where lateral npn well transistors were utilized. Additionally, in [Tzanateas, 1979], a voltage reference based on a realized PTAT voltage from the difference of the source-gate voltages of two MOS transistors biased in weak inversion was reported.

These CMOS circuits depend on so-called well transistors. These devices are vertical bipolar transistors that utilize wells as their bases and the substrate as their collectors. In an n-well process, a common contemporary process, these vertical bipolar transistors are pnp types with their collectors connected to ground, as illustrated in Fig. 7.12(a).

These transistors possess adequate current gains, but their primary limitation is the series base resistance, which can be substantial due to the extensive lateral dimensions between the base contact and the effective emitter region. To minimize errors stemming from this base resistance, the maximum collector currents through the transistors are typically restricted to less than 0.1 mA. It is feasible to employ these transistors to implement bandgap voltage references using configurations similar to those depicted in Fig. 7.13(a) for n-well processes [Kujik, 1973] or Fig. 7.13(b) for p-well processes [Ye, 1982].\n\nRegarding the n-well implementation of Fig. 7.13(a), we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {ref }}=V_{E B 1}+V_{R 1} \\tag{7.39}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nMoreover, assuming the opamp has a high gain and its input terminals are at the same voltage, then:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{R 2}=V_{E B 1}-V_{E B 2}=\\Delta V_{E B} \\tag{7.40}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince the current through $R_{3}$ is equivalent to the current through $R_{2}$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{R} 3}=\\frac{\\mathrm{R}_{3}}{\\mathrm{R}_{2}} \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{R} 2}=\\frac{\\mathrm{R}_{3}}{\\mathrm{R}_{2}} \\Delta \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{EB}} \\tag{7.41}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe opamp feedback also ensures that the voltage across $R_{1}$ equals the voltage across $R_{3}$. Leveraging this fact and substituting (7.41) into (7.39) results in:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {ref }}=V_{E B 1}+\\frac{R_{3}}{R_{2}} \\Delta V_{E B} \\tag{7.42}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhich is the required form to realize a bandgap reference.

    "text": "---\n\n#### Bipolar Bandgap Voltage References\n\nA voltage reference, initially proposed by Brokaw in 1974, has become the foundation for numerous bipolar bandgap voltage references. An elementary circuit diagram is presented in Figure 7.10. The amplifier within the feedback loop ensures that the collector voltages of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ remain equivalent. Given that $R_{3}=R_{4}$, this condition ensures that both transistors possess the identical collector currents and collector-emitter voltages. Moreover, note that the emitter area of $Q_{1}$ is made eight times greater than the emitter area of $Q_{2}$. Consequently, $Q_{2}$ exhibits eight times the current density of $Q_{1}$, yielding\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{J_{2}}{J_{1}}=8 \\tag{7.30}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor the circuit, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {ref }}=V_{B E 2}+V_{R 1} \\tag{7.31}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFurthermore\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{\\mathrm{R} 1} & =\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{R} 1} \\mathrm{R}_{1} \\\\\n& =2 \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{R}_{2}} \\mathrm{R}_{1} \\tag{7.32}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nFig. 7.10 illustrates a simplified circuit diagram of a bipolar bandgap voltage reference. The emitter area of Q1 is eight times larger than that of Q2, leading to a current density ratio of 8:1. The circuit incorporates an operational amplifier to uphold a consistent reference voltage (Vref). Resistors R3 and R4 are equal in value and contribute to the balancing of current through the transistors. The circuit is grounded at the bottom of R1.\n\nHowever\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{R} 2}=\\frac{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{R} 2}}{\\mathrm{R}_{2}}=\\frac{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE} 2}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE} 1}}{\\mathrm{R}_{2}}=\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE}}}{\\mathrm{R}_{2}} \\tag{7.33}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSubstituting (7.32) and (7.33) into (7.31) yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{ref}}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE} 2}+\\frac{2 \\mathrm{R}_{1}}{\\mathrm{R}_{2}} \\Delta \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{BE}} \\tag{7.34}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis equation conforms to the desired format for realizing a bandgap reference. It is evident that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{K}=\\frac{2 \\mathrm{R}_{1}}{\\mathrm{R}_{2}} \\tag{7.35}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAssuming $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE2}-0}=0.65 \\mathrm{~V}$, from (7.25)\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{R}_{1}}{\\mathrm{R}_{2}}=\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1.24-0.65}{0.0258 \\times \\ln (8)}=5.5 \\tag{7.36}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn an integrated design, $R_{1}$ or $R_{2}$ might be adjusted while monitoring $V_{\\text {ref }}$ to ensure it matches the intended reference voltage. Additionally, the optimal voltage for the circuit might be determined empirically during the initial stages of the design process.\n\nFurthermore, from (7.16) and (7.33), we derive\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{E 1}=I_{E 2}=I_{R 2}=\\frac{\\Delta V_{B E}}{R_{2}}=\\frac{\\frac{k T}{q} \\ln \\left(\\frac{J_{2}}{J_{1}}\\right)}{R_{2}} \\tag{7.37}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhich indicates that all currents are directly proportional to the absolute temperature (assuming resistor $\\mathrm{R}_{2}$ is insensitive to temperature changes). Therefore, as previously assumed, all currents are indeed positive temperature coefficient (PTAT). It is important to note that PTAT currents are frequently employed to bias numerous bipolar circuits, as they result in transistor transconductances that are independent of temperature. This constant transconductance offers the benefit of circuit speed remaining relatively independent of temperature; however, it also has the drawback of circuit power dissipation increasing significantly at high temperatures, making heat dissipation more challenging.\n\nIn applications where it is preferred to have reference voltages exceeding 1.24 V, a modified bandgap reference as depicted in Figure 7.11 can be employed. It is not complicated to demonstrate that the output voltage is now\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {ref-0 }}=\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathrm{R}_{4}}{\\mathrm{R}_{5}}\\right)\\left[\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{G} 0}+(\\mathrm{m}-1) \\frac{\\mathrm{k} T_{0}}{\\mathrm{q}}\\right] \\cong\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathrm{R}_{4}}{\\mathrm{R}_{5}}\\right) 1.24 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{7.38}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nResistor $R_{3}$ has been added to counteract the impact of finite base currents passing through $R_{4}$ and should be selected based on the formula depicted in the figure. For further details regarding this implementation, the reader is referred to [Brokaw, 1974].\n\n---\n\n#### CMOS Bandgap References\n\nThe predominant technique for achieving CMOS voltage references also utilizes a bandgap voltage reference, even though discrete bipolar transistors are not typically accessible. These CMOS circuits depend on using what are conventionally termed well transistors. These are vertical bipolar transistors that utilize wells as their bases and the substrate as their collectors. In an n well process, these vertical bipolar transistors are pnp types with their collectors connected to ground, as shown in Figure 7.12(a). In a p-well process, they would be npn transistors with their collectors connected to the positive power supply, as depicted in Figure 7.12(b). These transistors exhibit reasonable current gains; however, their primary limitation is the series base resistance, which can be high due to the considerable lateral dimensions between the base contact and the effective emitter region. To reduce errors resulting from this base resistance, the maximum collector currents through the transistors are typically limited to less than 0.1 mA. These transistors can be employed to implement bandgap voltage references using configurations akin to those shown in Figure 7.13(a) for n-well processes [Kujik, 1973] or Figure 7.13(b) for p-well processes [Ye, 1982].\n\nWith respect to the n-well implementation of Figure 7.13(a), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {ref }}=V_{E B 1}+V_{R 1} \\tag{7.39}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nMoreover, assuming the opamp has high gain and its input terminals are at the same voltage, then\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{R 2}=V_{E B 1}-V_{E B 2}=\\Delta V_{E B} \\tag{7.40}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nNow, since the current through $R_{3}$ is identical to the current through $R_{2}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{R} 3}=\\frac{\\mathrm{R}_{3}}{\\mathrm{R}_{2}} \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{R} 2}=\\frac{\\mathrm{R}_{3}}{\\mathrm{R}_{2}} \\Delta \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{EB}} \\tag{7.41}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nusing (7.40). The opamp feedback also ensures that the voltage across $R_{1}$ is equal to the voltage across $R_{3}$. By utilizing this fact and substituting (7.41) into (7.39), we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {ref }}=V_{E B 1}+\\frac{R_{3}}{R_{2}} \\Delta V_{E B} \\tag{7.42}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n---\n\n#### EXAMPLE 7.5\n\nDetermine the resistances of a bandgap voltage reference based on Figure $7.13(a)$, where $I_{1}=80 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}, I_{2}=8 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$, and $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{EB} 1-0}=0.65 \\mathrm{~V}$ at $\\mathrm{T}=300 \\mathrm{~K}$.\n\n---\n\n#### Solution\n\nReferring to (7.24), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {ref-0 }}=1.24 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{7.47}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nTherefore, from (7.39), it is necessary\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{R} 1}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {ref- }-0}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{EB} 1-0}=0.59 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{7.48}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAlso, since $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{R} 3}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{R} 1}$, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{R}_{3}=\\frac{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{R} 3}}{\\mathrm{I}_{2}}=\\frac{0.59 \\mathrm{~V}}{8 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}}=73.8 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega \\tag{7.49}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{R}_{1}=\\mathrm{R}_{3} \\frac{\\mathrm{I}_{2}}{\\mathrm{I}_{1}}=7.38 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega \\tag{7.50}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nNow, recalling from (7.26) that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{K}=\\frac{1.24-0.65 \\mathrm{~V}}{0.0258 \\times \\ln (10)}=9.93 \\tag{7.51}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\ntherefore\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{R}_{2}=\\frac{\\mathrm{R}_{3}}{\\mathrm{~K}}=7.43 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega \\tag{7.52}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIt is of significance to note that using (7.44) and considering that $J_{1} / J_{2}=I_{1} / I_{2}$ (since the sizes of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ are assumed to be the same), we find that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{EB}}=\\frac{\\mathrm{kT}_{0}}{\\mathrm{q}} \\ln \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{I}_{1}}{\\mathrm{I}_{2}}\\right)=59 \\mathrm{mV} \\tag{7.53}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhich provides the temperature dependency value of $0.198 \\mathrm{mV} / \\mathrm{K}$, as observed in Example 7.3, necessitating approximately a gain of 10 to nullify temperature dependence (actually 9.93 in this case).\n\nThe design equations for a voltage reference that is suitable for p -well processes and depicted in Figure 7.13(b) are essentially the same as those previously provided for the n -well reference.\n\nIn CMOS implementations of the aforementioned references, large-value resistors are often realized through well resistors. Unfortunately, these resistors exhibit a temperature dependence approximately given by [Michejda, 1984]\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{R}(\\mathrm{~T})=\\mathrm{R}_{0} \\frac{\\mathrm{~T}^{\\eta}}{\\mathrm{T}_{0}^{\\eta}} \\tag{7.54}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\eta=2.2$. The errors caused by this temperature dependence can be eradicated by offsetting $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {ref-0 }}$ slightly positive from the value given by (7.23) to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {ref-0 }}=V_{G 0}+(m+\\eta-1) \\frac{k T_{0}}{q} \\tag{7.55}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAssuming the temperature coefficient effects of the resistors have been minimized, the subsequent primary source of error is frequently attributed to the input-offset voltage of the opamp [Michejda, 1984]. This introduces an error term in the equation for $\\Delta \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE}}$ that is roughly equal to K times the input-offset voltage of the opamp. For instance, a 1 mV offset error that is temperature independent results in a temperature coefficient (TC), error approximately given by [Song, 1983]\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{TC}_{\\text {error }} \\cong 26 \\mathrm{ppm} /{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} \\tag{7.56}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nOne method to eliminate this source of error is to use switched-capacitor (SC) amplifiers that incorporate input-offset compensation circuits [Song, 1983]. One possible SC-based voltage reference is presented in Figure 7.14, which utilizes an amplifier described in [Martin, 1987]. The amplifier depicted ensures that the circuit has a valid output at all times and is less sensitive to finite opamp gain. A detailed explanation of the operation of the amplifier in Figure 7.14 is deferred until Chapter 14, where switched-capacitor circuits are discussed.\n\nAssuming errors due to the input-offset voltage of the opamp have been minimized, there remains an inherent temperature dependence of the bandgap voltage reference, as observed in (7.27). In addition, further temperature dependence arises due to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{G} 0}$ slightly varying with temperature (which has been ignored in the preceding analysis).

In an n-well process, a common modern approach, these vertical bipolar transistors are pnp types with their collectors connected to ground, as depicted in Fig. 7.12(a). In a p-well process, they would be npn transistors with their collectors connected to the positive power supply, as shown in Fig. 7.12(b). These transistors possess reasonable current gains but are primarily limited by the series base resistance, which can be substantial due to the extensive lateral dimensions between the base contact and the effective emitter region. To mitigate errors stemming from this base resistance, the maximum collector currents through the transistors are typically limited to less than 0.1 mA.

In integrated realizations of this reference, the bipolar transistors are often made the same size, and the differing current densities are achieved by making $R_3$ greater than $R_1$, causing $I_1$ to be larger than $I_2$. In such a scenario, we would have\n\n$$\n\\frac{J_1}{J_2} = \\frac{R_3}{R_1} \\tag{7.43}\n$$\n\nsince $R_1$ and $R_3$ have the same voltage across them. Also, recalling from equation (7.16) that\n\n$$\n\\Delta V_{EB} = V_{EB1} - V_{EB2} = \\frac{kT}{q}\\ln\\left(\\frac{J_1}{J_2}\\right) \\tag{7.44}\n$$\n\nand using equation (7.43) in (7.42) gives\n\n$$\nV_{\\text{ref}} = V_{EB1} + \\frac{R_3}{R_2}\\frac{kT}{q}\\ln\\left(\\frac{R_3}{R_1}\\right) \\tag{7.45}\n$$\n\nIt's immediately apparent that\n\n$$\nK = \\frac{R_3}{R_2} \\tag{7.46}\n$$\n\n#### EXAMPLE 7.5\n\nDetermine the resistances of a bandgap voltage reference based on Fig. 7.13(a), where $I_1 = 80 \\mu\\text{A}$, $I_2 = 8 \\mu\\text{A}$, and $V_{EB1-0} = 0.65 \\text{ V}$ at $T = 300 \\text{ K}$.\n\n#### Solution\n\nRecalling from equation (7.24) that\n\n$$\nV_{\\text{ref-0}} = 1.24 \\text{ V} \\tag{7.47}\n$$\n\nwe require from equation (7.39) that\n\n$$\nV_{R1} = V_{\\text{ref-0}} - V_{EB1-0} = 0.59 \\text{ V} \\tag{7.48}\n$$\n\nAlso, since $V_{R3} = V_{R1}$, we have\n\n$$\nR_3 = \\frac{V_{R3}}{I_2} = \\frac{0.59 \\text{ V}}{8 \\mu\\text{A}} = 73.8 \\text{k}\\Omega \\tag{7.49}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nR_1 = R_3 \\frac{I_2}{I_1} = 7.38 \\text{k}\\Omega \\tag{7.50}\n$$\n\nNow, recalling from equation (7.26) that\n\n$$\nK = \\frac{1.24 - 0.65 \\text{ V}}{0.0258 \\times \\ln(10)} = 9.93 \\tag{7.51}\n$$\n\nwe find\n\n$$\nR_2 = \\frac{R_3}{K} = 7.43 \\text{k}\\Omega \\tag{7.52}\n$$\n\nIt's noteworthy that using equation (7.44) and noting that $J_1/J_2 = I_1/I_2$ (since the sizes of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are assumed to be the same), we find that\n\n$$\n\\Delta V_{EB} = \\frac{kT_0}{q}\\ln\\left(\\frac{I_1}{I_2}\\right) = 59 \\text{mV} \\tag{7.53}\n$$\n\nThis gives a temperature dependence of $0.198 \\text{mV}/\\text{K}$, as found in Example 7.3, which necessitates a gain of approximately 10 to cancel out temperature dependency (actually 9.93 in this case).\n\nThe design equations for a voltage reference suitable for p-well processes and shown in Fig. 7.13(b) are essentially the same as those provided for the n-well reference.\n\nIn CMOS realizations of the references described, the high-value resistors are often implemented using well resistors. Unfortunately, these resistors exhibit a temperature dependence approximately described by [Michejda, 1984]\n\n$$\nR(T) = R_0 \\frac{T^\\eta}{T_0^\\eta} \\tag{7.54}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\eta = 2.2$. The errors resulting from this temperature dependence can be offset by adjusting $V_{\\text{ref-0}}$ slightly positive from the value given by equation (7.23) to\n\n$$\nV_{\\text{ref-0}} = V_{G0} + (m+\\eta-1)\\frac{kT_0}{q} \\tag{7.55}\n$$\n\nAssuming that the temperature coefficient of the resistors has been minimized, the next significant source of error often stems from the input-offset voltage of the opamp [Michejda, 1984]. This introduces an error term in the equation for $\\Delta V_{EB}$ that is roughly equal to K times the input-offset voltage of the opamp. For instance, a 1 mV offset error that is temperature-independent causes a temperature coefficient (TC) error approximately given by [Song, 1983]\n\n$$\nTC_{\\text{error}} \\cong 26 \\text{ppm}/^\\circ\\text{C} \\tag{7.56}\n$$\n\nOne method to eliminate this source of error is to use switched-capacitor (SC) amplifiers equipped with input-offset compensation circuits [Song, 1983]. An example of an SC-based voltage reference is shown in Fig. 7.14, which utilizes an amplifier described in [Martin, 1987]. This amplifier results in a circuit with an output that is valid at all times and is less sensitive to finite opamp gain. A detailed explanation of the amplifier's operation in Fig. 7.14 is deferred until Chapter 14, where switched-capacitor circuits are discussed.\n\nAssuming errors due to the input-offset voltage of the opamp have been minimized, there remains an intrinsic temperature dependence of the bandgap voltage reference, as observed in equation (7.27). Additionally, a further temperature dependence occurs because $V_{G0}$ varies slightly with temperature (which has been neglected in the previous analysis). Collectively, these two error sources constrain the best achievable temperature coefficient to about $25 \\text{ppm}/^\\circ\\text{K}$. Minimizing these second-order effects is beyond the scope of this book, but readers interested in this topic are referred to [Palmer, 1981; Meijer, 1982; Song, 1983] for examples of how errors due to second-order effects have been minimized.\n\nAn alternative CMOS bandgap reference implementation was reported in [Degrauwe, 1985], where lateral npn well transistors were employed. Additionally, in [Tzanateas, 1979], a voltage reference based on a realized PTAT voltage from the difference in the source-gate voltages of two MOS transistors biased in weak inversion was reported. Readers seeking more information on these circuits can refer to the cited references."

Although the resistance observed at $Q_{1}$ increases compared to Fig. 7.17 from $1 / g_{m, 1}$ to $r_{d s, 1}$, the loop gain also rises by approximately a factor of $g_{m, 1} r_{d s, 1}$, resulting in a similar closed-loop output resistance for the regulator.\n\nKey Point: While an NMOS pass-transistor offers superior supply rejection, the absence of native NMOS devices necessitates a PMOS pass-transistor, which allows for a lower dropout voltage and thereby enhances efficiency.\n\nA notable drawback of PMOS devices is their diminished power supply rejection. In the context of small signals at $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DD}}$, $\\mathrm{Q}_{1}$ behaves like a common-gate amplifier with substantial gain. At low frequencies, the feedback loop compensates for variations in $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {reg }}$, and at high frequencies, these variations are filtered by $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{L}}$. However, there typically exists a mid-band frequency range where achieving good supply rejection with a LDO is challenging.\n\nThe feedback analysis of a LDO parallels that of a two-stage opamp, where the opamp in Fig. 7.19 is assumed to have a single stage, and the common-source pass transistor $Q_{1}$ provides the second gain stage. Ignoring $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{gd}}$, there are clearly two poles in the open-loop response corresponding to the two nodes in the system.\nimage_name:Fig. 7.19 A low dropout (LDO) voltage regulator\ndescription:This circuit represents a low dropout (LDO) voltage regulator.

In the second case, the opamp pole $\\omega_{\\mathrm{pa}}$ occurs first at frequencies where the load capacitor cannot yet filter supply-induced noise, so the supply rejection worsens until the load pole takes effect. Unfortunately, for stability, the poles $\\omega_{\\mathrm{pa}}$ and $\\omega_{\\mathrm{pL}}$ must be widely spaced, leading to significant deterioration. This typically happens at frequencies in the range of 100 's of MHz, where digital circuitry-induced supply noise can be very high, posing a major challenge."

    "text": "When the regulated output must be within $200-400 \\mathrm{mV}$ below $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DD}}$, and particularly when native (near-zero-$V_{t}$) NMOS devices are unavailable, it is essential to use a PMOS device for $Q_{1}$, as depicted in Fig. 7.19. In this scenario, the gate voltage $\\mathrm{V}_{1}$ is significantly below $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DD}}$, so the dropout voltage is primarily limited by $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{eff, } 1}$. This configuration is commonly known as a low dropout (LDO) voltage regulator and is favored when power efficiency is crucial. Note that the polarity of the opamp's input terminals has been reversed due to the negative small-signal gain from $V_{1}$ to $V_{\\text{reg}}$. Although the resistance seen looking into $Q_{1}$ increases compared to Fig. 7.17 from $1 / g_{m, 1}$ to $r_{d s, 1}$, the loop gain also rises by approximately a factor of $g_{m, 1} r_{d s, 1}$, resulting in a roughly similar closed-loop output resistance for the regulator.\n\nKey Point: While an NMOS pass-transistor offers superior supply rejection, the absence of native NMOS devices necessitates the use of a PMOS pass-transistor, which allows for a lower dropout voltage and thus better efficiency.\n\nA notable drawback of PMOS devices is their inferior power supply rejection. In the context of small signals at $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DD}}$, $\\mathrm{Q}_{1}$ behaves like a common-gate amplifier with substantial gain. At low frequencies, the feedback loop compensates for variations in $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{reg}}$, and at high frequencies, these variations are filtered by $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{L}}$. However, there typically exists a mid-band frequency range where achieving good supply rejection with a LDO is challenging.\n\nThe feedback analysis of a LDO resembles that of a two-stage opamp, where the opamp in Fig. 7.19 is assumed to have a single stage, and the common-source pass transistor $Q_{1}$ provides the second gain stage. Ignoring $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{gd}}$, there are clearly two poles in the open-loop response corresponding to the two nodes in the system.\n\nFig. 7.19 illustrates a low dropout (LDO) voltage regulator circuit.

In both cases, the dc rejection (line regulation) is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\operatorname{PSRR}^{-1}(s)=\\left(\\frac{R_{L}}{r_{d s 1}+R_{L}}\\right) \\frac{1}{G_{m a} R_{o a} g_{m 1} R_{L}} \\tag{7.76}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n**Graph (a): Open Loop Supply Rejection**\n- **Type of Graph and Function:** Bode plot of the magnitude of open-loop supply rejection, $|H_{CG}(\\omega)|$.\n- **Axes Labels and Units:** Horizontal axis: frequency $\\omega$ (radians per second, logarithmic scale); Vertical axis: magnitude $|H_{CG}(\\omega)|$.\n- **Overall Behavior and Trends:** Constant magnitude at low frequencies, decreasing magnitude at $\\omega_{pL}$.\n- **Key Features and Technical Details:** Flat response at low frequencies, first-order roll-off at $\\omega_{pL}$.\n- **Annotations and Specific Data Points:** Transition point marked at $\\omega_{pL}$.\n\n**Graph (b): Closed-Loop Shaping Frequency Response**\n- **Type of Graph and Function:** Bode plot of $\\frac{1}{1 + L(\\omega)}$.\n- **Axes Labels and Units:** Horizontal axis: frequency $\\omega$ (logarithmic scale); Vertical axis: magnitude $\\frac{1}{1 + L(\\omega)}$.\n- **Overall Behavior and Trends:** Flat response at low frequencies, upward slope at $\\omega_{p1}$, leveling off at $\\omega_t$.\n- **Key Features and Technical Details:** Low-pass characteristic, transitional frequency range between $\\omega_{p1}$ and $\\omega_t$.\n- **Annotations and Specific Data Points:** Marked frequencies $\\omega_{p1}$ and $\\omega_t$.\n\n**Graph (c): Inverse Power Supply Rejection Ratio (PSRR) with Dominant Load Pole**\n- **Type of Graph and Function:** Bode plot of $|\\operatorname{PSRR}^{-1}(\\omega)|$.\n- **Axes Labels and Units:** Horizontal axis: frequency $\\omega$; Vertical axis: magnitude $|\\operatorname{PSRR}^{-1}(\\omega)|$.\n- **Overall Behavior and Trends:** Flat response at low frequencies, decreasing magnitude at $\\omega_t$.\n- **Key Features and Technical Details:** Stable PSRR at low frequencies, roll-off at $\\omega_t$.\n- **Annotations and Specific Data Points:** Condition $\\omega_{p1} = \\omega_{pL} < \\omega_{pa}$, transition frequency $\\omega_t$.\n\n**Graph (d): Inverse Power Supply Rejection Ratio (PSRR) with Dominant Opamp Output Pole**\n- **Type of Graph and Function:** Bode plot of $|\\operatorname{PSRR}^{-1}(\\omega)|$.\n- **Axes Labels and Units:** Horizontal axis: frequency $\\omega$ (logarithmic scale); Vertical axis: magnitude $|\\operatorname{PSRR}^{-1}(\\omega)|$ (dB).\n- **Overall Behavior and Trends:** Constant magnitude at low frequencies, increasing magnitude up to $\\omega_t$, then decreasing.\n- **Key Features and Technical Details:** Dominant opamp output pole, peak at $\\omega_t$.\n- **Annotations and Specific Data Points:** Frequencies $\\omega_{pa}$, $\\omega_t$, and $\\omega_{pL}$ marked.\n\n**Fig. 7.22 The power supply rejection of a LDO regulator: (a) open loop supply rejection; (b) closed-loop shaping frequency response; (c) $|\\operatorname{PSRR}(\\omega)|=\\left|\\mathrm{H}_{\\mathrm{CG}}(\\omega)\\right| /|1+\\mathrm{L}(\\omega)|$ with $\\omega_{\\mathrm{pL}}<\\omega_{\\mathrm{pa}}$; (d) $|\\operatorname{PSRR}(\\omega)|=\\left|\\mathrm{H}_{\\mathrm{CG}}(\\omega)\\right| /|1+\\mathrm{L}(\\omega)|$ with $\\omega_{\\mathrm{pa}}<\\omega_{\\mathrm{pL}}$.\n\nAs the loop gain increases beyond its dominant pole frequency $\\omega_{\\mathrm{pl}}$, supply rejection degrades. In the first scenario, this occurs at the same frequency as the output pole starts filtering supply noise, maintaining high supply rejection. In the second scenario, the opamp pole $\\omega_{\\mathrm{pa}}$ occurs first, where the load capacitor cannot yet filter supply-induced noise, worsening supply rejection until the load pole activates. Unfortunately, for stability, the poles $\\omega_{\\mathrm{pa}}$ and $\\omega_{\\mathrm{pL}}$ must be widely spaced, leading to significant deterioration. This typically happens at frequencies in the 100's of MHz range, where digital circuitry-induced supply noise is high, posing a major challenge."
