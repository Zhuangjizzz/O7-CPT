Specifically, modern CMOS technologies use very thin gate dielectrics that break down under voltages exceeding 1-2 Volts, whereas bipolar devices can be engineered to combine high-speed operation with relatively high breakdown voltages. This makes bipolar devices naturally suited for high-voltage radio-frequency circuits. Additionally, bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) can tolerate larger voltage signal swings than short gate-length MOS transistors, enabling them to achieve a higher dynamic range.
