    "text": "To grasp the functionality of bipolar transistors, we will examine an npn transistor configuration with its emitter grounded, as illustrated in Fig. 8.4. Should the base voltage, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{B}}$, drop below approximately 0.5 V, the transistor will cease to conduct, and no current will flow. It will be demonstrated that once the base-emitter pn junction is forward biased, current begins to stream from the base to the emitter.

    "text": "To grasp the functioning of bipolar transistors, let's examine an npn transistor configuration with the emitter grounded, as depicted in Fig. 8.4. If the base voltage, $V_{B}$, drops below around 0.5 V, the transistor switches off, and no current flows. We'll observe that as the base-emitter pn junction becomes forward biased, current begins to flow from the base to the emitter. However, due to the narrow base width, a substantially larger proportional current traverses from the collector to the emitter. Hence, the npn transistor acts as a current amplifier at low frequencies. In simpler terms, unless the transistor is in cutoff mode and the collector-base junction is reverse biased, a minimal base current governs a much greater collector-emitter current.\n\nA concise explanation of an npn transistor's operation follows. When the base-emitter junction is forward biased, it commences to conduct, akin to any forward-biased junction. The current comprises majority carriers from the base (holes) and majority carriers from the emitter (electrons) diffusing across the junction. Given that the emitter is more heavily doped than the base, many more electrons are injected from the emitter than holes from the base. Assuming the collector voltage is sufficient to reverse bias the collector-base junction, no holes from the base will reach the collector. Yet, the electrons that migrate from the emitter to the base, now minority carriers, diffuse away from the base-emitter junction due to the minority-carrier concentration gradient in the base region. Any minority electrons that approach the collector-base junction are swiftly swept across by the large positive voltage on the collector, which attracts the negatively charged electrons. In a well-designed bipolar transistor, such as the one in Fig. 8.1, the vertical base width, W, is small, and nearly all electrons diffusing from the emitter to the base reach the collector-base junction and are swept across, contributing to the collector current. Consequently, the collector current nearly matches the electron current flowing from the emitter to the base. The much smaller base current closely equals the current due to holes flowing from the base to the emitter. The total emitter current is the sum of the electron collector current and the hole base current, but since the hole current is much smaller than the electron current, the emitter current is approximately equal to the collector current.\n\nGiven that the collector current is approximately equal to the electron current flowing from the emitter to the base, and the amount of this electron current is dictated by the base-emitter voltage, it can be demonstrated (refer to the Appendix at the end of this chapter) that the collector current is exponentially related to the base-emitter voltage by the relationship\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}} \\cong \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{CS}} \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE}} / \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{T}}} \\tag{8.1}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{CS}}$ is the scale current. This scale current is proportional to the area of the base-emitter junction. The base current, determined by the hole current flowing from the base to the emitter, is also exponentially related to the base-emitter voltage, resulting in the ratio of the collector current to the base current being a constant that, to a first-order approximation, is independent of voltage and current. This ratio, typically denoted $\\beta$, is defined as\n\n$$\n\\beta \\equiv \\frac{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}}{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{B}}} \\tag{8.2}\n$$\n\nwhere $I_{C}$ and $I_{B}$ are the collector and base currents. Typical values of $\\beta$ range between 50 and 200. Lower values occur in lateral bipolar transistors, which are not optimized for high current gain, and higher values occur in heterojunction bipolar transistors.\n\nKey Point: In active mode, with base-emitter junction forward biased and base-collector junction reverse biased, collector current increases exponentially with base-emitter voltage, and the base current is a factor $\\beta$ smaller. The variation in collector current with collector voltage is first-order modeled by the Early voltage.\n\nNote that (8.1) suggests that the collector current is independent of the collector voltage. This independence neglects second-order effects such as the reduction in effective base width, W, due to the widening of the collector-base depletion region when the collector bias voltage is increased. To illustrate this point, a typical plot of the collector current, $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}$, as a function of collector-to-emitter voltage, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CE}}$, for different values of $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is shown in Fig. 8.5 for a practical transistor. The fact that the curves are not flat for $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CE}}>\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CE} \\text {-sat }}$ indicates the dependence of $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}$ on $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CE}}$. Indeed, to a good approximation, the dependence is linear with a slope that intercepts the $V_{C E}$ axis at $V_{C E}=-V_{A}$ for all values of $I_{B}$. The intercept voltage value, $V_{A}$, is called the Early voltage for bipolar transistors, with a typical value being from 50 V to 100 V. This dependency results in a finite output impedance (as in a MOS transistor) and can be modeled by modifying equation (8.1) [Sze, 1981] to be\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}} \\cong \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{CS}} \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE}} \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{T}}}\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CE}}}{\\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{A}}}\\right) \\tag{8.3}\n$$\n\n#### Large-Signal Modelling\n\nA conducting BJT that has a $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {CE }}$ greater than $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CE} \\text {-sat }}$ (approximately 0.3 V) is said to be operating in the active region. Such a collector-emitter voltage is necessary to ensure that no holes from the base reach the collector. A large-signal model of a BJT operating in the active region is shown in Fig. 8.6.\n\nSince $I_{B}=I_{C} / \\beta$, we have\n\n$$\nI_{B}=\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{CS}}}{\\beta} e^{v_{B E} / v_{T}}=I_{B S} e^{v_{B E} / V_{T}} \\tag{8.4}\n$$\n\nwhich is akin to a diode equation, but with a multiplying constant of $I_{C S} / \\beta=I_{B S}$. Since $I_{E}=I_{B}+I_{C}$, we have\n\n$$\nI_{E}=I_{C S}\\left(\\frac{\\beta+1}{\\beta}\\right) e^{V_{B E} / V_{T}}=I_{E S} e^{V_{B E} / V_{T}} \\tag{8.5}\n$$\n\nor equivalently\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}=\\alpha \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{E}} \\tag{8.6}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha$ is defined as\n\n$$\n\\alpha=\\frac{\\beta}{\\beta+1} \\tag{8.7}\n$$\n\nand for large values of $\\beta$, can be approximated as\n\n$$\n\\alpha \\cong 1-\\frac{1}{\\beta} \\cong 1 \\tag{8.8}\n$$\n\nIf the effect of $V_{C E}$ on $I_{C}$ is included in the model, the current-controlled source, $\\beta I_{B}$, should be replaced by a current source given by\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}=\\beta \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{B}}\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CE}}}{\\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{A}}}\\right) \\tag{8.9}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{A}}$ is the Early-voltage constant. This additional modeling of the finite output impedance is normally not performed in large-signal analysis without the use of a computer due to its complexity.\n\nAs the collector-emitter voltage approaches $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {CE-sat }}$ (around around 0.2 to 0.3 V), the base-collector junction becomes forward biased, and holes from the base will begin to diffuse to the collector. A common model for this case, when the transistor is saturated or in the saturation region, is shown in Fig. 8.7. It should be noted that the value of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CE} \\text {-sat }}$ decreases for smaller values of collector current.\n\nKey Point: As the base-collector junction approaches forward-bias, at collector-emitter voltages of about 0.2 to 0.3 V, a finite base-collector current flows, and the transistor is saturated.\n\n#### Base-Charge Storage in the Active Region\n\nWhen a transistor is in the active region, many minority carriers are stored in the base region (electrons are stored in an npn transistor). Recall that this minority charge is responsible for $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}$, so this charge must be removed (through the base contact) before a transistor can turn off. As in a forward-biased diode, this charge can be modeled as a diffusion capacitance, $C_{d}$, between the base and emitter given by (refer to the Appendix at the end of this chapter)\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{d}}=\\tau_{\\mathrm{b}} \\frac{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}}{\\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{T}}} \\tag{8.10}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\tau_{\\mathrm{b}}$ is the base-transit-time constant. Thus, the diffusion capacitance is proportional to $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}$. The total base-emitter capacitance, $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{be}}$, will include the base-emitter depletion capacitance, $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{j}}$, in parallel with $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{d}}$. Normally, however, $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{j}}$ is much less than $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{d}}$, unless the transistor current is small, and can often be ignored.\n\n#### Base-Charge Storage of a Saturated Transistor\n\nWhen a transistor becomes saturated, the minority-charge storage in the base and, even more so, in the lightly doped region of the collector, increases drastically. The major component of this charge storage is due to holes diffusing from the base, through the collector junction, and continuing on through the lightly doped $\\mathrm{n}^{-}$epitaxial region of the collector to the $\\mathrm{n}^{+}$collector region. The $\\mathrm{n}^{-}$epitaxial region is so named because it is epitaxially grown on a p region. Most of the charge storage occurs in this region. Also, additional charge storage occurs because electrons that diffused from the collector are stored in the base, but this charge is normally smaller. The magnitude of the additional charge stored by a transistor that is saturated is given by\n\n$$\nQ_{s}=\\tau_{s}\\left(I_{B}-\\frac{I_{C}}{\\beta}\\right) \\tag{8.11}\n$$\n\nwhere the base overdrive current, defined as $I_{B}-I_{C} / \\beta$, is approximately equal to the hole current from the base to the collector. Normally, in saturation, $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{B}}>>\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}} / \\beta$, and (8.11) can be approximated by\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{Q}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\cong \\tau_{\\mathrm{s}} \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{B}} \\tag{8.12}\n$$\n\nThe constant $\\tau_{\\mathrm{s}}$ is approximately equal to the epitaxial-region transit time, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{E}}$ (ignoring the storage of electrons in the base that diffused from the collector). Since the epitaxial region is much wider than the base, the constant $\\tau_{\\mathrm{s}}$ is normally much larger than the base transit time, the constant $\\tau_{\\mathrm{b}}$, often by up to two orders of magnitude. The specific value of $\\tau_{\\mathrm{s}}$ is usually found empirically for a given technology.\n\nWhen a saturated transistor is being turned off, first the base current will reverse. However, before the collector current will change, the saturation charge, $\\mathrm{Q}_{\\mathrm{s}}$, must be removed. After $\\mathrm{Q}_{\\mathrm{s}}$ is removed, the base minority charge, $Q_{b}$, will be removed. During this time, the collector current will decrease until the transistor shuts off. Typically, the time to remove $Q_{S}$ greatly dominates the overall charge removal.\n\nIf the time required to remove the base saturation charge, $\\mathrm{t}_{\\mathrm{s}}$, is much shorter than the epitaxial-region transit time, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{E}}$, then one can derive a simple expression for the time required to remove the saturation charge. If the reverse base current (when the saturation charge is being removed), denoted by $I_{B R}$, remains constant while $Q_{S}$ is being removed, then we have [Hodges, 1988]\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{t}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\cong \\frac{\\mathrm{Q}_{\\mathrm{s}}}{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{BR}}} \\cong \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{s}}\\left(\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{B}}-\\frac{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}}{\\beta}\\right)}{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{BR}}} \\cong \\tau_{\\mathrm{s}} \\frac{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{B}}}{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{BR}}} \\tag{8.13}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\tau_{\\mathrm{s}} \\cong \\tau_{\\mathrm{E}}$.\n"

Consequently, the collector current closely matches the electron current flowing from the emitter to the base. The much smaller base current closely matches the current attributable to the holes flowing from the base to the emitter. The total emitter current is the sum of the electron collector current and the hole base current, but since the hole current is much smaller than the electron current, the emitter current is approximately equal to the collector current.\n\nGiven that the collector current is approximately equal to the electron current flowing from the emitter to the base, and the magnitude of this electron current is dictated by the base-emitter voltage, it can be demonstrated (refer to the Appendix at the end of this chapter) that the collector current is exponentially related to the base-emitter voltage by the equation\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}} \\cong \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{CS}} \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE}} / \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{T}}} \\tag{8.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{CS}}$ denotes the scale current. This scale current is proportional to the area of the base-emitter junction. The base current, determined by the hole current flowing from the base to the emitter, is also exponentially related to the base-emitter voltage. This results in the ratio of the collector current to the base current being a constant that, to a first-order approximation, is independent of voltage and current. This ratio, commonly denoted as $\\beta$, is defined as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\beta \\equiv \\frac{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}}{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{B}}} \\tag{8.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $I_{C}$ and $I_{B}$ represent the collector and base currents, respectively. Typical $\\beta$ values range between 50 and 200. Lower values are found in lateral bipolar transistors, which are not optimized for high current gain, whereas higher values are observed in heterojunction bipolar transistors.\n\nKey Point: In the active mode, with the base-emitter junction forward biased and the base-collector junction reverse biased, the collector current increases exponentially with the base-emitter voltage, and the base current is a factor $\\beta$ smaller. The variation in collector current with collector voltage is first-order modeled by the Early voltage.\n\nIt is important to note that equation (8.1) suggests that the collector current is independent of the collector voltage. This independence overlooks second-order effects, such as the reduction in effective base width, W, due to the widening of the collector-base depletion region when the collector bias voltage is increased. To illustrate this point, a typical plot of the collector current, $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}$, as a function of the collector-to-emitter voltage, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CE}}$, for different values of $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is presented in Fig. 8.5 for a practical transistor. The fact that the curves are not flat for $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CE}}>\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CE} \\text {-sat }}$ indicates the dependence of $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}$ on $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CE}}$. Indeed, to a good approximation, the dependence is linear with a slope that intercepts the $V_{C E}$ axis at $V_{C E}=-V_{A}$ for all values of $I_{B}$. The intercept voltage value, $V_{A}$, is referred to as the Early voltage for bipolar transistors, with typical values ranging from 50 V to 100 V. This dependency results in a finite output impedance (similar to a MOS transistor) and can be modeled by modifying equation (8.1) [Sze, 1981] to be\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}} \\cong \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{CS}} \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE}} \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{T}}}\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CE}}}{\\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{A}}}\\right) \\tag{8.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n#### Large-Signal Modelling\n\nA conducting BJT with a $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {CE }}$ greater than $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CE} \\text {-sat }}$ (approximately 0.3 V) is considered to be operating in the active region. Such a collector-emitter voltage is necessary to ensure that none of the holes from the base reach the collector. A large-signal model of a BJT operating in the active region is shown in Fig. 8.6.\n\nSince $I_{B}=I_{C} / \\beta$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{B}=\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{CS}}}{\\beta} e^{v_{B E} / v_{T}}=I_{B S} e^{v_{B E} / V_{T}} \\tag{8.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhich resembles a diode equation but with a multiplying constant of $I_{C S} / \\beta=I_{B S}$. Since $I_{E}=I_{B}+I_{C}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{E}=I_{C S}\\left(\\frac{\\beta+1}{\\beta}\\right) e^{V_{B E} / V_{T}}=I_{E S} e^{V_{B E} / V_{T}} \\tag{8.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nor equivalently\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}=\\alpha \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{E}} \\tag{8.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha$ is defined as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\alpha=\\frac{\\beta}{\\beta+1} \\tag{8.7}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand for large $\\beta$ values, can be approximated as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\alpha \\cong 1-\\frac{1}{\\beta} \\cong 1 \\tag{8.8}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIf the effect of $V_{C E}$ on $I_{C}$ is incorporated into the model, the current-controlled source, $\\beta I_{B}$, should be replaced by a current source given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}=\\beta \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{B}}\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CE}}}{\\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{A}}}\\right) \\tag{8.9}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{A}}$ is the Early-voltage constant. This additional modeling of the finite output impedance is typically not performed in large-signal analysis without computer assistance due to its complexity.\n\nAs the collector-emitter voltage approaches $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {CE-sat }}$ (typically around 0.2 to 0.3 V), the base-collector junction becomes forward biased, and holes from the base start diffusing to the collector. A common model for this scenario, when the transistor is saturated or in the saturation region, is shown in Fig. 8.7. It should be noted that the value of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CE} \\text {-sat }}$ decreases for smaller collector current values.\n\nKey Point: As the base-collector junction approaches forward bias at collector-emitter voltages of about 0.2 to 0.3 V, a finite base-collector current flows, and the transistor is saturated.\n\n#### Base-Charge Storage in the Active Region\n\nWhen a transistor is in the active region, numerous minority carriers are stored in the base region (electrons are stored in an npn transistor). Recall that this minority charge is responsible for $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}$, so this charge must be removed (through the base contact) before a transistor can turn off. Similar to a forward-biased diode, this charge can be modeled as a diffusion capacitance, $C_{d}$, between the base and emitter given by (refer to the Appendix at the end of this chapter)\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{d}}=\\tau_{\\mathrm{b}} \\frac{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}}{\\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{T}}} \\tag{8.10}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\tau_{\\mathrm{b}}$ is the base-transit-time constant. Thus, we observe that the diffusion capacitance is proportional to $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}$. The total base-emitter capacitance, $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{be}}$, will include the base-emitter depletion capacitance, $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{j}}$, in parallel with $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{d}}$. Normally, however, $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{j}}$ is much less than $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{d}}$, unless the transistor current is small, and can often be ignored.\n\n#### Base-Charge Storage of a Saturated Transistor\n\nWhen a transistor becomes saturated, the minority-charge storage in the base and, even more so, in the lightly doped region of the collector, increases dramatically. The primary component of this charge storage is due to holes diffusing from the base, through the collector junction, and continuing through the lightly doped $\\mathrm{n}^{-}$ epitaxial region of the collector to the $\\mathrm{n}^{+}$ collector region. The $\\mathrm{n}^{-}$ epitaxial region is named as such because it is epitaxially grown on a p region. Most of the charge storage occurs in this region. Additionally, extra charge storage occurs because electrons that diffused from the collector are stored in the base, but this charge is usually smaller. The magnitude of the additional charge stored by a saturated transistor is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nQ_{s}=\\tau_{s}\\left(I_{B}-\\frac{I_{C}}{\\beta}\\right) \\tag{8.11}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere the base overdrive current, defined as $I_{B}-I_{C} / \\beta$, is approximately equal to the hole current from the base to the collector. Normally, in saturation, $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{B}}>>\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}} / \\beta$, and equation (8.11) can be approximated by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{Q}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\cong \\tau_{\\mathrm{s}} \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{B}} \\tag{8.12}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe constant $\\tau_{\\mathrm{s}}$ is approximately equal to the epitaxial-region transit time, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{E}}$ (ignoring the storage of electrons in the base that diffused from the collector). Since the epitaxial region is much wider than the base, the constant $\\tau_{\\mathrm{s}}$ is typically much larger than the base transit time, the constant $\\tau_{\\mathrm{b}}$, often by up to two orders of magnitude. The specific value of $\\tau_{\\mathrm{s}}$ is usually determined empirically for a given technology.\n\nWhen a saturated transistor is being turned off, the base current will first reverse. However, before the collector current changes, the saturation charge, $\\mathrm{Q}_{\\mathrm{s}}$, must be removed. After $\\mathrm{Q}_{\\mathrm{s}}$ is removed, the base minority charge, $Q_{b}$, will be removed. During this time, the collector current will decrease until the transistor shuts off. Typically, the time to remove $Q_{S}$ significantly dominates the overall charge removal time.\n\nIf the time required to remove the base saturation charge, $\\mathrm{t}_{\\mathrm{s}}$, is much shorter than the epitaxial-region transit time, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{E}}$, then a simple expression for the time required to remove the saturation charge can be derived. If the reverse base current (when the saturation charge is being removed), denoted by $I_{B R}$, remains constant while $Q_{S}$ is being removed, then we have [Hodges, 1988]\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{t}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\cong \\frac{\\mathrm{Q}_{\\mathrm{s}}}{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{BR}}} \\cong \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{s}}\\left(\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{B}}-\\frac{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}}{\\beta}\\right)}{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{BR}}} \\cong \\tau_{\\mathrm{s}} \\frac{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{B}}}{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{BR}}} \\tag{8.13}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\tau_{\\mathrm{s}} \\cong \\tau_{\\mathrm{E}}$.\n\nTypically, the forward base current during saturation, $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{B}}$, will be much smaller than the reverse base current during saturation-charge removal, $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{BR}}$. If this were not the case, then our original assumption that $\\mathrm{t}_{\\mathrm{S}} \\ll \\tau_{\\mathrm{E}} \\cong \\tau_{\\mathrm{S}}$ would not hold true. In such a scenario, the turn-off time of the BJT would be so slow as to render the circuit unusable in most applications. Nevertheless, the turn-off time for this case, when $\\mathrm{t}_{\\mathrm{S}}$ is not much less than $\\tau_{\\mathrm{E}}$, is given by [Hodges, 1988]\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{t}_{\\mathrm{s}}=\\tau_{\\mathrm{s}} \\ln \\left[\\frac{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{BR}}+\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{B}}}{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{BR}}+\\frac{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}}{\\beta}}\\right] \\tag{8.14}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe reader should verify that for $I_{B R} \\gg I_{B}$ and $I_{B R} \\gg I_{C} / \\beta$, the expression in (8.14) is approximately equivalent to the much simpler one in (8.13).\n\nIn both cases described, the time required to remove the storage charge of a saturated transistor is significantly longer than the time required to turn off a transistor in the active region. In high-speed microcircuit designs, bipolar transistors are never allowed to saturate to avoid the prolonged turn-off time that would ensue.\n\nKey Point: The time required to remove the charge stored in a saturated transistor is much longer than the time required to turn off a transistor in the active region. Thus, in high-speed microcircuit designs, bipolar transistors are never allowed to saturate.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 8.1\n\nFor $\\tau_{\\mathrm{b}}=0.2 \\mathrm{~ns}, \\tau_{\\mathrm{s}}=100 \\mathrm{~ns}$ (a small value for $\\tau_{\\mathrm{s}}$), $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{B}}=0.2 \\mathrm{~mA}, \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}=1 \\mathrm{~mA}, \\beta=100$, and $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{BR}}=1 \\mathrm{~mA}$, calculate the time required to remove the base saturation charge using (8.13), and compare it to the time obtained using the more accurate expression of (8.14).

    "text": "To comprehend the functioning of bipolar transistors, we'll examine an npn transistor configuration with its emitter grounded, as depicted in Fig. 8.4. Should the base voltage, $V_{B}$, fall below approximately 0.5 V, the transistor will be in cutoff mode, and no current will flow. We'll observe that when the base-emitter pn junction is forward biased, current begins to flow from the base to the emitter. However, due to the narrow base width, a significantly larger proportional current will flow from the collector to the emitter. Hence, the npn transistor can act as a current amplifier at low frequencies. In simpler terms, if the transistor is not in cutoff and the collector-base junction is reverse biased, a small base current can control a much larger collector-emitter current.\n\nA concise overview of an npn transistor's operation is as follows. When the base-emitter junction becomes forward biased, it begins to conduct, akin to any forward-biased junction. The current is composed of majority carriers from the base (holes in this instance) and majority carriers from the emitter (electrons) diffusing across the junction. Since the emitter is more heavily doped than the base, many more electrons are injected from the emitter than holes from the base. Assuming the collector voltage is sufficient to keep the collector-base junction reverse biased, no holes from the base will reach the collector. However, the electrons that move from the emitter to the base, now minority carriers, diffuse away from the base-emitter junction due to the minority-carrier concentration gradient in the base region. Any of these minority electrons that approach the collector-base junction will swiftly be attracted across the junction by the large positive voltage on the collector, which draws in the negatively charged electrons. In a well-designed bipolar transistor, like the one shown in Fig. 8.1, the vertical base width, W, is small, and nearly all the electrons that diffuse from the emitter to the base reach the collector-base junction and are swept across it, thereby contributing to the current flow in the collector. Consequently, the collector current closely matches the electron current flowing from the emitter to the base. The much smaller base current closely corresponds to the current due to the holes flowing from the base to the emitter. The total emitter current is the sum of the electron collector current and the hole base current, but since the hole current is much smaller than the electron current, the emitter current is approximately equal to the collector current.\n\nGiven that the collector current is approximately equal to the electron current flowing from the emitter to the base, and the amount of this electron current is determined by the base-emitter voltage, it can be demonstrated (refer to the Appendix at the end of this chapter) that the collector current is exponentially related to the base-emitter voltage by the relationship\n\n$$\nI_{C} \\cong I_{CS} e^{V_{BE} / V_{T}}\n$$\n\nwhere $I_{CS}$ is the scale current, which is proportional to the area of the base-emitter junction. The base current, determined by the hole current flowing from the base to the emitter, is also exponentially related to the base-emitter voltage. This results in the ratio of the collector current to the base current being a constant that, to a first-order approximation, is independent of voltage and current. This ratio, typically denoted as $\\beta$, is defined as\n\n$$\n\\beta \\equiv \\frac{I_{C}}{I_{B}}\n$$\n\nwhere $I_{C}$ and $I_{B}$ are the collector and base currents, respectively. Typical values of $\\beta$ range from 50 to 200. Lower values are found in lateral bipolar transistors, which are not optimized for high current gain, and higher values are found in heterojunction bipolar transistors.\n\nKey Point: In active mode, with the base-emitter junction forward biased and the base-collector junction reverse biased, the collector current increases exponentially with the base-emitter voltage, and the base current is a factor $\\beta$ smaller. The variation in collector current with collector voltage is first-order modeled by the Early voltage.\n\nNote that the equation implies that the collector current is independent of the collector voltage. This independence neglects second-order effects such as the decrease in effective base width, W, due to the increase in the width of the collector-base depletion region when the collector bias voltage is increased. To illustrate this point, a typical plot of the collector current, $I_{C}$, as a function of the collector-to-emitter voltage, $V_{CE}$, for different values of $I_{B}$ is shown in Fig. 8.5 for a practical transistor. The fact that the curves are not flat for $V_{CE} > V_{CE-sat}$ indicates the dependence of $I_{C}$ on $V_{CE}$. Indeed, to a good approximation, the dependence is linear with a slope that intercepts the $V_{CE}$ axis at $V_{CE} = -V_{A}$ for all values of $I_{B}$. The intercept voltage value, $V_{A}$, is called the Early voltage for bipolar transistors, with a typical value ranging from 50 V to 100 V. This dependency results in a finite output impedance (similar to a MOS transistor) and can be modeled by modifying the equation to be\n\n$$\nI_{C} \\cong I_{CS} e^{V_{BE} / V_{T}}\\left(1+\\frac{V_{CE}}{V_{A}}\\right)\n$$\n\n#### Large-Signal Modelling\n\nA conducting BJT with a $V_{CE}$ greater than $V_{CE-sat}$ (approximately 0.3 V) is said to be operating in the active region. Such a collector-emitter voltage is necessary to ensure that no holes from the base reach the collector. A large-signal model of a BJT operating in the active region is shown in Fig. 8.6.\n\nSince $I_{B} = I_{C} / \\beta$, we have\n\n$$\nI_{B} = \\frac{I_{CS}}{\\beta} e^{V_{BE} / V_{T}} = I_{BS} e^{V_{BE} / V_{T}}\n$$\n\nwhich is similar to a diode equation but with a multiplying constant of $I_{CS} / \\beta = I_{BS}$. Since $I_{E} = I_{B} + I_{C}$, we have\n\n$$\nI_{E} = I_{CS}\\left(\\frac{\\beta+1}{\\beta}\\right) e^{V_{BE} / V_{T}} = I_{ES} e^{V_{BE} / V_{T}}\n$$\n\nor equivalently\n\n$$\nI_{C} = \\alpha I_{E}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha$ is defined as\n\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{\\beta}{\\beta+1}\n$$\n\nand for large values of $\\beta$, can be approximated as\n\n$$\n\\alpha \\cong 1 - \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\cong 1\n$$\n\nIf the effect of $V_{CE}$ on $I_{C}$ is included in the model, the current-controlled source, $\\beta I_{B}$, should be replaced by a current source given by\n\n$$\nI_{C} = \\beta I_{B}\\left(1+\\frac{V_{CE}}{V_{A}}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $V_{A}$ is the Early-voltage constant. This additional modeling of the finite output impedance is normally not done in large-signal analysis without the use of a computer due to its complexity.\n\nAs the collector-emitter voltage approaches $V_{CE-sat}$ (typically around 0.2 to 0.3 V), the base-collector junction becomes forward biased, and holes from the base will begin to diffuse to the collector. A common model for this case, when the transistor is saturated or in the saturation region, is shown in Fig. 8.7. It should be noted that the value of $V_{CE-sat}$ decreases for smaller values of collector current.\n\nKey Point: As the base-collector junction approaches forward bias, at collector-emitter voltages of about 0.2 to 0.3 V, a finite base-collector current flows, and the transistor is saturated.\n\n#### Base-Charge Storage in the Active Region\n\nWhen a transistor is in the active region, many minority carriers are stored in the base region (electrons are stored in an npn transistor). Recall that this minority charge is responsible for $I_{C}$, so this charge must be removed (through the base contact) before a transistor can turn off. As in a forward-biased diode, this charge can be modeled as a diffusion capacitance, $C_{d}$, between the base and emitter given by (refer to the Appendix at the end of this chapter)\n\n$$\nC_{d} = \\tau_{b} \\frac{I_{C}}{V_{T}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\tau_{b}$ is the base-transit-time constant. Thus, we see that the diffusion capacitance is proportional to $I_{C}$. The total base-emitter capacitance, $C_{be}$, will include the base-emitter depletion capacitance, $C_{j}$, in parallel with $C_{d}$. Normally, however, $C_{j}$ is much less than $C_{d}$, unless the transistor current is small, and can often be ignored.\n\n#### Base-Charge Storage of a Saturated Transistor\n\nWhen a transistor becomes saturated, the minority-charge storage in the base and, even more so, in the lightly doped region of the collector, increases drastically. The major component of this charge storage is due to holes diffusing from the base, through the collector junction, and continuing on through the lightly doped $n^{-}$ epitaxial region of the collector to the $n^{+}$ collector region. The $n^{-}$ epitaxial region is so named because it is epitaxially grown on a p region. Most of the charge storage occurs in this region. Also, additional charge storage occurs because electrons that diffused from the collector are stored in the base, but this charge is normally smaller. The magnitude of the additional charge stored by a transistor that is saturated is given by\n\n$$\nQ_{s} = \\tau_{s}\\left(I_{B}-\\frac{I_{C}}{\\beta}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere the base overdrive current, defined as $I_{B}-I_{C} / \\beta$, is approximately equal to the hole current from the base to the collector. Normally, in saturation, $I_{B} \\gg I_{C} / \\beta$, and the equation can be approximated by\n\n$$\nQ_{s} \\cong \\tau_{s} I_{B}\n$$\n\nThe constant $\\tau_{s}$ is approximately equal to the epitaxial-region transit time, $\\tau_{E}$ (ignoring the storage of electrons in the base that diffused from the collector). Since the epitaxial region is much wider than the base, the constant $\\tau_{s}$ is normally much larger than the base transit time, the constant $\\tau_{b}$, often by up to two orders of magnitude. The specific value of $\\tau_{s}$ is usually found empirically for a given technology.\n\nWhen a saturated transistor is being turned off, first the base current will reverse. However, before the collector current will change, the saturation charge, $Q_{s}$, must be removed. After $Q_{s}$ is removed, the base minority charge, $Q_{b}$, will be removed. During this time, the collector current will decrease until the transistor shuts off. Typically, the time to remove $Q_{S}$ greatly dominates the overall charge removal.\n\nIf the time required to remove the base saturation charge, $t_{s}$, is much shorter than the epitaxial-region transit time, $\\tau_{E}$, then one can derive a simple expression for the time required to remove the saturation charge. If the reverse base current (when the saturation charge is being removed), denoted by $I_{BR}$, remains constant while $Q_{S}$ is being removed, then we have\n\n$$\nt_{s} \\cong \\frac{Q_{s}}{I_{BR}} \\cong \\frac{\\tau_{s}\\left(I_{B}-\\frac{I_{C}}{\\beta}\\right)}{I_{BR}} \\cong \\tau_{s} \\frac{I_{B}}{I_{BR}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\tau_{s} \\cong \\tau_{E}$.\nNormally, the forward base current during saturation, $I_{B}$, will be much smaller than the reverse base current during saturation-charge removal, $I_{BR}$. If this were not the case, then our original assumption that $t_{S} \\ll \\tau_{E} \\cong \\tau_{S}$ would not be true. In this case, the turn-off time of the BJT would be so slow as to make the circuit unusable in most applications. Nevertheless, the turn-off time for this case, when $t_{S}$ is not much less than $\\tau_{E}$, is given by\n\n$$\nt_{s} = \\tau_{s} \\ln \\left[\\frac{I_{BR}+I_{B}}{I_{BR}+\\frac{I_{C}}{\\beta}}\\right]\n$$\n\nThe reader should verify that for $I_{BR} \\gg I_{B}$ and $I_{BR} \\gg I_{C} / \\beta$, the expression is approximately equivalent to the much simpler one.\n\nIn both of the cases just described, the time required to remove the storage charge of a saturated transistor is much larger than the time required to turn off a transistor in the active region. In high-speed microcircuit designs, one never allows bipolar transistors to saturate, to avoid the long turn-off time that would result.\n\nKey Point: The time required to remove the charge stored in a saturated transistor is much larger than the time required to turn off a transistor in the active region. Hence, in high-speed microcircuit designs, one never allows bipolar transistors to saturate.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 8.1\n\nFor $\\tau_{b} = 0.2 \\mathrm{~ns}, \\tau_{s} = 100 \\mathrm{~ns}$ (a small value for $\\tau_{s}$), $I_{B} = 0.2 \\mathrm{~mA}, I_{C} = 1 \\mathrm{~mA}, \\beta = 100$, and $I_{BR} = 1 \\mathrm{~mA}$, calculate the time required to remove the base saturation charge using the equation, and compare it to the time obtained using the more accurate expression. Compare these results to the time required to remove the base minority charge for the same $I_{BR}$.\n\n#### Solution\n\nUsing the equation, we have\n\n$$\nt_{s} = \\frac{10^{-7}\\left(2 \\times 10^{-4}\\right)}{10^{-3}} = 20 \\mathrm{~ns}\n$$\n\nUsing the more accurate expression, we have\n\n$$\nt_{s} = 10^{-7} \\ln \\left[\\frac{10^{-3}+2 \\times 10^{-4}}{10^{-3}+\\frac{10^{-3}}{100}}\\right] = 17.2 \\mathrm{~ns}\n$$\n\nwhich is fairly close to the first result.\nThe time required for an active transistor to remove the base minority charge, $Q_{b}$, is given by\n\n$$\nt_{A} = \\frac{Q_{b}}{I_{BR}} = \\frac{\\tau_{b} I_{C}}{I_{BR}} = 0.2 \\mathrm{~ns}\n$$\n\nThis is approximately 100 times shorter than the time for removing the base saturation charge!\n\n#### Small-Signal Modelling\n\nThe most commonly used small-signal model is the hybrid-π model. This model is similar to the small-signal model used for MOS transistors, except it includes a finite base-emitter impedance, $r_{\\pi}$, and it has no emitter-to-bulk capacitance. The hybrid-π model is shown in Fig. 8.8. As in the MOS case, we will first discuss the transconductance, $g_{m}$, and the small-signal resistances, and then we will discuss the parasitic capacitances.\n\nThe transistor transconductance, $g_{m}$, is perhaps the most important parameter of the small-signal model. The transconductance is the ratio of the small-signal collector current, $i_{c}$, to the small-signal base-emitter voltage, $v_{be}$. Thus, we have\n\n$$\ng_{m} = \\frac{i_{c}}{v_{be}} = \\frac{\\partial I_{C}}{\\partial V_{BE}}\n$$\n\nRecall that in the active region\n\n$$\nI_{C} = I_{CS} e^{v_{BE} / v_{T}}\n$$\n\nThen\n\n$$\ng_{m} = \\frac{\\partial I_{C}}{\\partial V_{BE}} = \\frac{I_{CS}}{v_{T}} e^{V_{BE} / v_{T}}\n$$\n\nUsing the equation again, we obtain\n\n$$\ng_{m} = \\frac{I_{C}}{V_{T}}\n$$\n\nwhere $V_{T}$ is given by\n\n$$\nV_{T} = \\frac{k T}{q}\n$$\n\nKey Point: BJT small-signal transconductance is proportional to collector current.\nand is approximately 26 mV at a room temperature of $T = 300 \\mathrm{~K}$. Thus, the transconductance is proportional to the bias current of a BJT.

    "text": "To comprehend the functionality of bipolar transistors, let's examine an npn transistor with its emitter grounded, as depicted in Fig. 8.4. Should the base voltage, denoted as $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{B}}$, fall below approximately 0.5 V, the transistor will be in a cutoff state, and no current will flow. We will observe that when the base-emitter pn junction becomes forward biased, current begins to flow from the base to the emitter. However, due to the narrow base width, a proportionally larger current will flow from the collector to the emitter. Hence, the npn transistor can be regarded as a current amplifier at low frequencies. In other words, if the transistor is not in cutoff and the collector-base junction is reverse biased, a small base current controls a much larger collector-emitter current.\n\nA simplified explanation of an npn transistor's operation is as follows. When the base-emitter junction becomes forward biased, it starts conducting, similar to any forward-biased junction. The current consists of majority carriers from the base (holes in this case) and majority carriers from the emitter (electrons) diffusing across the junction. Since the emitter is more heavily doped than the base, there are many more electrons injected from the emitter than there are holes injected from the base. Assuming the collector voltage is sufficient to keep the collector-base junction reverse biased, no holes from the base will reach the collector. However, the electrons that travel from the emitter to the base, where they are now minority carriers, diffuse away from the base-emitter junction due to the minority-carrier concentration gradient in the base region. Any of these minority electrons that get close to the collector-base junction will be quickly swept across the junction due to the large positive voltage on the collector, which attracts the negatively charged electrons. In a well-designed bipolar transistor, such as the one shown in Fig. 8.1, the vertical base width, W, is small, and almost all of the electrons that diffuse from the emitter to the base reach the collector-base junction and are swept across the junction, thus contributing to current flow in the collector. As a result, the collector current closely matches the electron current flowing from the emitter to the base. The much smaller base current closely matches the current due to the holes that flow from the base to the emitter. The total emitter current is the sum of the electron collector current and the hole base current, but since the hole current is much smaller than the electron current, the emitter current is approximately equal to the collector current.\n\nSince the collector current is approximately equal to the electron current flowing from the emitter to the base, and the amount of this electron current is determined by the base-emitter voltage, it can be shown (refer to the Appendix at the end of this chapter) that the collector current is exponentially related to the base-emitter voltage by the relationship\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}} \\cong \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{CS}} \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE}} / \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{T}}} \\tag{8.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{CS}}$ is the scale current. This scale current is proportional to the area of the base-emitter junction. The base current, determined by the hole current flowing from the base to the emitter, is also exponentially related to the base-emitter voltage, resulting in the ratio of the collector current to the base current being a constant that, to a first-order approximation, is independent of voltage and current. This ratio, typically denoted $\\beta$, is defined to be\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\beta \\equiv \\frac{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}}{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{B}}} \\tag{8.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $I_{C}$ and $I_{B}$ are the collector and base currents. Typical values of $\\beta$ range between 50 and 200. Lower values are found in lateral bipolar transistors, which are not optimized for high current gain, and higher values are found in heterojunction bipolar transistors.\n\nKey Point: In active mode, with base-emitter junction forward biased and base-collector junction reverse biased, collector current increases exponentially with base-emitter voltage, and the base current is a factor $\\beta$ smaller. The variation in collector current with collector voltage is first-order modeled by the Early voltage.\n\nNote that (8.1) suggests that the collector current is independent of the collector voltage. This independence overlooks second-order effects such as the decrease in effective base width, W, due to the increase in the width of the collector-base depletion region when the collector bias voltage is increased. To illustrate this point, a typical plot of the collector current, $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}$, as a function of collector-to-emitter voltage, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CE}}$, for different values of $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is shown in Fig. 8.5 for a practical transistor. The fact that the curves are not flat for $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CE}}>\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CE} \\text {-sat }}$ indicates the dependence of $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}$ on $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CE}}$. Indeed, to a good approximation, the dependence is linear with a slope that intercepts the $V_{C E}$ axis at $V_{C E}=-V_{A}$ for all values of $I_{B}$. The intercept voltage value, $V_{A}$, is called the Early voltage for bipolar transistors, with a typical value being from 50 V to 100 V. This dependency results in a finite output impedance (as in a MOS transistor) and can be modeled by modifying equation (8.1) [Sze, 1981] to be\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}} \\cong \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{CS}} \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE}} \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{T}}}\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CE}}}{\\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{A}}}\\right) \\tag{8.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n#### Large-Signal Modelling\n\nA conducting BJT that has a $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {CE }}$ greater than $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CE} \\text {-sat }}$ (which is approximately 0.3 V) is said to be operating in the active region. Such a collector-emitter voltage is required to ensure that none of the holes from the base go to the collector.

This additional modeling of the finite output impedance is normally not done in large-signal analysis without the use of a computer due to its complexity.\n\nAs the collector-emitter voltage approaches $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {CE-sat }}$ (typically around 0.2 to 0.3 V), the base-collector junction becomes forward biased, and holes from the base will begin to diffuse to the collector. A common model for this case, when the transistor is saturated or in the saturation region, is shown in Fig. 8.7. It should be noted that the value of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CE} \\text {-sat }}$ decreases for smaller values of collector current.\n\nKey Point: As the base-collector junction approaches forward-bias, at collector-emitter voltages of about 0.2 to 0.3 V, a finite base-collector current flows, and the transistor is saturated.\n\n#### Base-Charge Storage in the Active Region\n\nWhen a transistor is in the active region, many minority carriers are stored in the base region (electrons are stored in an npn transistor). Recall that this minority charge is responsible for $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}$, so this charge must be removed (through the base contact) before a transistor can turn off. As in a forward-bias diode, this charge can be modeled as a diffusion capacitance, $C_{d}$, between the base and emitter given by (refer to the Appendix at the end of this chapter)\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{d}}=\\tau_{\\mathrm{b}} \\frac{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}}{\\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{T}}} \\tag{8.10}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\tau_{\\mathrm{b}}$ is the base-transit-time constant. Thus, we see that the diffusion capacitance is proportional to $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}$. The total base-emitter capacitance, $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{be}}$, will include the base-emitter depletion capacitance, $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{j}}$, in parallel with $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{d}}$. Normally, however, $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{j}}$ is much less than $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{d}}$, unless the transistor current is small, and can often be ignored.\n\n#### Base-Charge Storage of a Saturated Transistor\n\nWhen a transistor becomes saturated, the minority-charge storage in the base and, even more so, in the lightly doped region of the collector, increases drastically. The major component of this charge storage is due to holes diffusing from the base, through the collector junction, and continuing on through the lightly doped $\\mathrm{n}^{-}$epitaxial region of the collector to the $\\mathrm{n}^{+}$collector region. The $\\mathrm{n}^{-}$epitaxial region is so named because it is epitaxially grown on a p region. Most of the charge storage occurs in this region. Also, additional charge storage occurs because electrons that diffused from the collector are stored in the base, but this charge is normally smaller. The magnitude of the additional charge stored by a transistor that is saturated is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nQ_{s}=\\tau_{s}\\left(I_{B}-\\frac{I_{C}}{\\beta}\\right) \\tag{8.11}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere the base overdrive current, defined to be $I_{B}-I_{C} / \\beta$, is approximately equal to the hole current from the base to the collector. Normally, in saturation, $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{B}}>>\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}} / \\beta$, and (8.11) can be approximated by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{Q}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\cong \\tau_{\\mathrm{s}} \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{B}} \\tag{8.12}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe constant $\\tau_{\\mathrm{s}}$ is approximately equal to the epitaxial-region transit time, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{E}}$ (ignoring the storage of electrons in the base that diffused from the collector). Since the epitaxial region is much wider than the base, the constant $\\tau_{\\mathrm{s}}$ is normally much larger than the base transit time, the constant $\\tau_{\\mathrm{b}}$, often by up to two orders of magnitude. The specific value of $\\tau_{\\mathrm{s}}$ is usually found empirically for a given technology.\n\nWhen a saturated transistor is being turned off, first the base current will reverse. However, before the collector current will change, the saturation charge, $\\mathrm{Q}_{\\mathrm{s}}$, must be removed. After $\\mathrm{Q}_{\\mathrm{s}}$ is removed, the base minority charge, $Q_{b}$, will be removed. During this time, the collector current will decrease until the transistor shuts off. Typically, the time to remove $Q_{S}$ greatly dominates the overall charge removal.\n\nIf the time required to remove the base saturation charge, $\\mathrm{t}_{\\mathrm{s}}$, is much shorter than the epitaxial-region transit time, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{E}}$, then one can derive a simple expression for the time required to remove the saturation charge. If the reverse base current (when the saturation charge is being removed), denoted by $I_{B R}$, remains constant while $Q_{S}$ is being removed, then we have [Hodges, 1988]\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{t}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\cong \\frac{\\mathrm{Q}_{\\mathrm{s}}}{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{BR}}} \\cong \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{s}}\\left(\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{B}}-\\frac{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}}{\\beta}\\right)}{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{BR}}} \\cong \\tau_{\\mathrm{s}} \\frac{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{B}}}{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{BR}}} \\tag{8.13}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\tau_{\\mathrm{s}} \\cong \\tau_{\\mathrm{E}}$.\nimage_name:Fig. 8.7\ndescription:The circuit diagram represents a large-signal model for a BJT in the saturation region.

Typically, the time to remove $Q_{S}$ greatly dominates the overall charge removal.\n\nIf the time required to remove the base saturation charge, $\\mathrm{t}_{\\mathrm{s}}$, is much shorter than the epitaxial-region transit time, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{E}}$, then one can derive a simple expression for the time required to remove the saturation charge. If the reverse base current (when the saturation charge is being removed), denoted by $I_{B R}$, remains constant while $Q_{S}$ is being removed, then we have [Hodges, 1988]\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{t}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\cong \\frac{\\mathrm{Q}_{\\mathrm{s}}}{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{BR}}} \\cong \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{s}}\\left(\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{B}}-\\frac{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}}{\\beta}\\right)}{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{BR}}} \\cong \\tau_{\\mathrm{s}} \\frac{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{B}}}{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{BR}}} \\tag{8.13}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\tau_{\\mathrm{s}} \\cong \\tau_{\\mathrm{E}}$.\nNormally, the forward base current during saturation, $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{B}}$, will be much smaller than the reverse base current during saturation-charge removal, $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{BR}}$. If this were not the case, then our original assumption that $\\mathrm{t}_{\\mathrm{S}} \\ll \\tau_{\\mathrm{E}} \\cong \\tau_{\\mathrm{S}}$ would not be true. In this case, the turn-off time of the BJT would be so slow as to make the circuit unusable in most applications. Nevertheless, the turn-off time for this case, when $\\mathrm{t}_{\\mathrm{S}}$ is not much less than $\\tau_{\\mathrm{E}}$, is given by [Hodges, 1988]\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{t}_{\\mathrm{s}}=\\tau_{\\mathrm{s}} \\ln \\left[\\frac{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{BR}}+\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{B}}}{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{BR}}+\\frac{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}}{\\beta}}\\right] \\tag{8.14}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe reader should verify that for $I_{B R} \\gg I_{B}$ and $I_{B R} \\gg I_{C} / \\beta$, the expression in (8.14) is approximately equivalent to the much simpler one in (8.13).\n\nIn both of the cases just described, the time required to remove the storage charge of a saturated transistor is much larger than the time required to turn off a transistor in the active region. In high-speed microcircuit designs, one never allows bipolar transistors to saturate, to avoid the long turn-off time that would result.\n\nKey Point: The time required to remove the charge stored in a saturated transistor is much larger than the time required to turn off a transistor in the active region. Hence, in high-speed microcircuit designs, one never allows bipolar transistors to saturate.\n\n#### Small-Signal Modeling\n\nThe most commonly used small-signal model is the hybrid- $\\pi$ model. This model is similar to the small-signal model used for MOS transistors, except it includes a finite base-emitter impedance, $\\mathrm{r}_{\\pi}$, and it has no emitter-to-bulk capacitance. The hybrid- $\\pi$ model is shown in Fig. 8.8. As in the MOS case, we will first discuss the transconductance, $\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m}}$, and the small-signal resistances, and then we will discuss the parasitic capacitances.\n\nThe transistor transconductance, $g_{m}$, is perhaps the most important parameter of the small-signal model. The transconductance is the ratio of the small-signal collector current, $i_{c}$, to the small-signal base-emitter voltage, $v_{b e}$. Thus, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ng_{m}=\\frac{i_{c}}{v_{b e}}=\\frac{\\partial I_{C}}{\\partial V_{B E}} \\tag{8.18}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nRecall that in the active region\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C}=I_{C S} e^{v_{B E} / v_{T}} \\tag{8.19}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThen\n\n$$\n"

If the base voltage, $V_B$, is lower than approximately 0.5 V, the transistor will be in cutoff mode and no current will flow. As the base-emitter junction becomes forward biased, current starts to flow from the base to the emitter, but due to the small width of the base, a much larger proportional current will flow from the collector to the emitter. Therefore, the npn transistor can be regarded as a current amplifier at low frequencies. Essentially, if the transistor is not in cutoff and the collector-base junction is reverse biased, a small base current can control a significantly larger collector-emitter current.\n\nA basic overview of the operation of an npn transistor is as follows. When the base-emitter junction is forward biased, it begins to conduct like any forward-biased junction. The current is composed of majority carriers from the base (holes in this case) and majority carriers from the emitter (electrons) diffusing across the junction. Since the emitter is more heavily doped than the base, there are many more electrons that are injected from the emitter compared to holes that are injected from the base. Assuming the collector voltage is sufficient to reverse bias the collector-base junction, no holes from the base will reach the collector. However, the electrons that travel from the emitter to the base, where they are now minority carriers, diffuse away from the base-emitter junction due to the minority-carrier concentration gradient in the base region. Any minority electrons that get close to the collector-base junction will promptly be swept across the junction due to the strong positive voltage on the collector, which attracts the negatively charged electrons. In a well-designed bipolar transistor, like the one shown in Figure 8.1, the vertical width of the base, W, is small, and nearly all of the electrons that diffuse from the emitter to the base reach the collector-base junction and are swept across the junction, thus contributing to the current flow in the collector. Consequently, the collector current is almost equal to the electron current flowing from the emitter to the base. The much smaller base current is almost equal to the current due to the holes that flow from the base to the emitter. The total emitter current is the sum of the electron collector current and the hole base current, but since the hole current is much smaller than the electron current, the emitter current is roughly equal to the collector current.\n\nGiven that the collector current is almost equal to the electron current flowing from the emitter to the base, and the quantity of this electron current is determined by the base-emitter voltage, it can be demonstrated (refer to the Appendix at the end of this chapter) that the collector current is exponentially related to the base-emitter voltage according to the equation\n\n$$\nI_C \\cong I_{CS} e^{V_{BE} / V_T} \\tag{8.1}\n$$\n\nwhere $I_{CS}$ is the scale current. This scale current is proportional to the area of the base-emitter junction. The base current, which is determined by the hole current flowing from the base to the emitter, is also exponentially related to the base-emitter voltage, leading to the ratio of the collector current to the base current being a constant that, to a first-order approximation, is independent of voltage and current. This ratio, typically denoted as $\\beta$, is defined as\n\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{I_C}{I_B} \\tag{8.2}\n$$\n\nwhere $I_C$ and $I_B$ are the collector and base currents. Typical values of $\\beta$ range from 50 to 200. Lower values occur in lateral bipolar transistors, which are not optimized for high current gain, while higher values occur in heterojunction bipolar transistors.\n\nThe key aspect is that in the active mode, with the base-emitter junction forward biased and the base-collector junction reverse biased, the collector current increases exponentially with the base-emitter voltage, and the base current is a factor $\\beta$ smaller. The variation in collector current with collector voltage is first-order modeled by the Early voltage.\n\nNote that equation (8.1) implies that the collector current is independent of the collector voltage. This independence overlooks second-order effects, such as the reduction in effective base width, W, due to the expansion of the collector-base depletion region when the collector bias voltage is increased. To demonstrate this, a typical graph of the collector current, $I_C$, as a function of the collector-emitter voltage, $V_{CE}$, for various values of $I_B$ is shown in Figure 8.5 for a practical transistor. The fact that the curves are not flat for $V_{CE} > V_{CE-sat}$ indicates the dependence of $I_C$ on $V_{CE}$. Indeed, to a good approximation, the dependence is linear with a slope that intercepts the $V_{CE}$ axis at $V_{CE} = -V_A$ for all values of $I_B$. The intercept voltage value, $V_A$,\nis called the Early voltage for bipolar transistors, with a typical value ranging from 50 V to 100 V. This dependence leads to a finite output impedance (as in a MOS transistor) and can be modeled by modifying equation (8.1) [Sze, 1981] to be\n\n$$\nI_C \\cong I_{CS} e^{V_{BE} V_T} \\left(1+\\frac{V_{CE}}{V_A}\\right) \\tag{8.3}\n$$\n\n#### Large-Signal Modeling\n\nA conducting BJT with a $V_{CE}$ greater than $V_{CE-sat}$ (usually around 0.3 V) is considered to be in the active region. A large-signal model of a BJT operating in the active region is depicted in Figure 8.6.\n\nSince $I_B = I_C / \\beta$, we have\n\n$$\nI_B = \\frac{I_{CS}}{\\beta} e^{V_{BE} / V_T} = I_{BS} e^{V_{BE} / V_T} \\tag{8.4}\n```\n"

The current consists of majority carriers from the base (in this case, holes) and majority carriers from the emitter (in this case, electrons) diffusing across the junction. Since the emitter is more heavily doped than the base, there are many more electrons injected from the emitter than there are holes injected from the base. Assuming the collector voltage is large enough so that the collector-base junction is reverse biased, no holes from the base will reach the collector. However, the electrons that travel from the emitter to the base, where they are now minority carriers, diffuse away from the base-emitter junction due to the minority-carrier concentration gradient in the base region. Any of these minority electrons that approach the collector-base junction will be quickly swept across the junction due to the large positive voltage on the collector, which attracts the negatively charged electrons. In a properly designed bipolar transistor, such as that shown in Fig. 1, the vertical base width, W, is small, and almost all of the electrons that diffuse from the emitter to the base reach the collector-base junction and are swept across the junction, contributing to current flow in the collector. As a result, the collector current closely matches the electron current flowing from the emitter to the base. The much smaller base current closely matches the current due to the holes that flow from the base to the emitter. The total emitter current is the sum of the electron collector current and the hole base current, but since the hole current is much smaller than the electron current, the emitter current is approximately equal to the collector current.\n\nSince the collector current is approximately equal to the electron current flowing from the emitter to the base, and the amount of this electron current is determined by the base-emitter voltage, it can be shown that the collector current is exponentially related to the base-emitter voltage by the relationship\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C} \\cong I_{CS} e^{V_{BE} / V_{T}} \\tag{8.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $I_{CS}$ is the scale current. This scale current is proportional to the area of the base-emitter junction. The base current, determined by the hole current flowing from the base to the emitter, is also exponentially related to the base-emitter voltage, resulting in the ratio of the collector current to the base current being a constant that, to a first-order approximation, is independent of voltage and current. This ratio, typically denoted $\\beta$, is defined as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\beta \\equiv \\frac{I_{C}}{I_{B}} \\tag{8.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $I_{C}$ and $I_{B}$ are the collector and base currents. Typical values of $\\beta$ range from 50 to 200. Lower values are found in lateral bipolar transistors, which are not optimized for high current gain, while higher values are found in heterojunction bipolar transistors.\n\nKey Point: In active mode, with the base-emitter junction forward-biased and the base-collector junction reverse-biased, the collector current increases exponentially with the base-emitter voltage, and the base current is a factor $\\beta$ smaller. The variation in collector current with collector voltage is first-order modeled by the Early voltage.\n\nNote that equation (8.1) suggests that the collector current is independent of the collector voltage. This independence overlooks second-order effects such as the decrease in effective base width, W, due to the increase in the width of the collector-base depletion region when the collector bias voltage is increased. To illustrate this point, a typical plot of the collector current, $I_{C}$, as a function of collector-to-emitter voltage, $V_{CE}$, for different values of $I_{B}$ is shown in Fig. 8.5 for a practical transistor. The fact that the curves are not flat for $V_{CE} > V_{CE \\text{-sat}}$ indicates the dependence of $I_{C}$ on $V_{CE}$. Indeed, to a good approximation, the dependence is linear with a slope that intercepts the $V_{CE}$ axis at $V_{CE} = -V_{A}$ for all values of $I_{B}$. The intercept voltage value, $V_{A}$, is called the Early voltage for bipolar transistors, with typical values ranging from 50 V to 100 V. This dependency results in a finite output impedance (as in a MOS transistor) and can be modeled by modifying equation (8.1) [Sze, 1981] to be\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C} \\cong I_{CS} e^{V_{BE} / V_{T}} \\left(1 + \\frac{V_{CE}}{V_{A}}\\right) \\tag{8.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n#### Large-Signal Modeling\n\nA conducting BJT with a $V_{CE}$ greater than $V_{CE \\text{-sat}}$ (approximately 0.3 V) is said to be operating in the active region. Such a collector-emitter voltage is necessary to ensure that no holes from the base reach the collector. A large-signal model of a BJT operating in the active region is shown in Fig. 8.6.\n\nSince $I_{B} = I_{C} / \\beta$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{B} = \\frac{I_{CS}}{\\beta} e^{V_{BE} / V_{T}} = I_{BS} e^{V_{BE} / V_{T}} \\tag{8.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhich is similar to a diode equation but with a multiplying constant of $I_{CS} / \\beta = I_{BS}$. Since $I_{E} = I_{B} + I_{C}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{E} = I_{CS} \\left(\\frac{\\beta + 1}{\\beta}\\right) e^{V_{BE} / V_{T}} = I_{ES} e^{V_{BE} / V_{T}} \\tag{8.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nor equivalently\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C} = \\alpha I_{E} \\tag{8.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha$ is defined as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\alpha = \\frac{\\beta}{\\beta + 1} \\tag{8.7}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand for large values of $\\beta$, can be approximated as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\alpha \\cong 1 - \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\cong 1 \\tag{8.8}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIf the effect of $V_{CE}$ on $I_{C}$ is included in the model, the current-controlled source, $\\beta I_{B}$, should be replaced by a current source given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C} = \\beta I_{B} \\left(1 + \\frac{V_{CE}}{V_{A}}\\right) \\tag{8.9}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $V_{A}$ is the Early-voltage constant. This additional modeling of the finite output impedance is normally not done in large-signal analysis without the use of a computer due to its complexity.\n\nAs the collector-emitter voltage approaches $V_{CE \\text{-sat}}$ (typically around 0.2 to 0.3 V), the base-collector junction becomes forward biased, and holes from the base will begin to diffuse to the collector. A common model for this case, when the transistor is saturated or in the saturation region, is shown in Fig. 8.7. It should be noted that the value of $V_{CE \\text{-sat}}$ decreases for smaller values of collector current.\n\nKey Point: As the base-collector junction approaches forward-bias, at collector-emitter voltages of about 0.2 to 0.3 V, a finite base-collector current flows, and the transistor is saturated.\n\n#### Base-Charge Storage in the Active Region\n\nWhen a transistor is in the active region, many minority carriers are stored in the base region (electrons are stored in an npn transistor). Recall that this minority charge is responsible for $I_{C}$, so this charge must be removed (through the base contact) before a transistor can turn off. As in a forward-biased diode, this charge can be modeled as a diffusion capacitance, $C_{d}$, between the base and emitter given by (see Appendix at the end of this chapter)\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{d} = \\tau_{b} \\frac{I_{C}}{V_{T}} \\tag{8.10}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\tau_{b}$ is the base-transit-time constant. Thus, we see that the diffusion capacitance is proportional to $I_{C}$. The total base-emitter capacitance, $C_{be}$, will include the base-emitter depletion capacitance, $C_{j}$, in parallel with $C_{d}$. Normally, however, $C_{j}$ is much less than $C_{d}$, unless the transistor current is small, and can often be ignored.\n\n#### Base-Charge Storage of a Saturated Transistor\n\nWhen a transistor becomes saturated, the minority-charge storage in the base and, even more so, in the lightly doped region of the collector, increases drastically. The major component of this charge storage is due to holes diffusing from the base, through the collector junction, and continuing on through the lightly doped $n^{-}$ epitaxial region of the collector to the $n^{+}$ collector region. The $n^{-}$ epitaxial region is so named because it is epitaxially grown on a p region. Most of the charge storage occurs in this region. Additionally, extra charge storage occurs because electrons that diffused from the collector are stored in the base, but this charge is normally smaller. The magnitude of the additional charge stored by a transistor that is saturated is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nQ_{s} = \\tau_{s} \\left(I_{B} - \\frac{I_{C}}{\\beta}\\right) \\tag{8.11}\n\\"

Indeed, to a good approximation, the dependence is linear with a slope that intercepts the $V_{CE}$ axis at $V_{CE} = -V_{A}$ for all values of $I_{B}$. The intercept voltage value, $V_{A}$, is called the Early voltage for bipolar transistors, with typical values ranging from 50 V to 100 V. This dependency results in a finite output impedance (similar to a MOS transistor) and can be modeled by modifying the equation to be:\n\n$$\nI_{C} \\cong I_{CS} e^{V_{BE} / V_{T}}\\left(1+\\frac{V_{CE}}{V_{A}}\\right)\n$$\n\n#### Large-Signal Modeling\n\nA conducting BJT with a $V_{CE}$ greater than $V_{CE-sat}$ (approximately 0.3 V) is said to be operating in the active region. Such a collector-emitter voltage is necessary to prevent holes from the base reaching the collector. A large-signal model of a BJT operating in the active region is shown in Fig. 8.6.\n\nSince $I_{B} = I_{C} / \\beta$, we have:\n\n$$\nI_{B} = \\frac{I_{CS}}{\\beta} e^{V_{BE} / V_{T}} = I_{BS} e^{V_{BE} / V_{T}}\n$$\n\nwhich resembles a diode equation but with a multiplying constant of $I_{CS} / \\beta = I_{BS}$. Since $I_{E} = I_{B} + I_{C}$, we have:\n\n$$\nI_{E} = I_{CS}\\left(\\frac{\\beta+1}{\\beta}\\right) e^{V_{BE} / V_{T}} = I_{ES} e^{V_{BE} / V_{T}}\n$$\n\nor equivalently:\n\n$$\nI_{C} = \\alpha I_{E}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha$ is defined as:\n\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{\\beta}{\\beta+1}\n$$\n\nand for large $\\beta$ values, can be approximated as:\n\n$$\n\\alpha \\cong 1 - \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\cong 1\n$$\n\nIf the effect of $V_{CE}$ on $I_{C}$ is included in the model, the current-controlled source, $\\beta I_{B}$, should be replaced by a current source given by:\n\n$$\nI_{C} = \\beta I_{B}\\left(1+\\frac{V_{CE}}{V_{A}}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $V_{A}$ is the Early-voltage constant. This additional modeling of the finite output impedance is normally not performed in large-signal analysis without computer assistance due to its complexity.\n\nAs the collector-emitter voltage approaches $V_{CE-sat}$ (typically around 0.2 to 0.3 V), the base-collector junction becomes forward biased, and holes from the base begin to diffuse to the collector. A common model for this case, when the transistor is saturated or in the saturation region, is shown in Fig. 8.7. It should be noted that the value of $V_{CE-sat}$ decreases for smaller values of collector current.\n\nKey Point: As the base-collector junction approaches forward bias, at collector-emitter voltages of about 0.2 to 0.3 V, a finite base-collector current flows, and the transistor is saturated.\n\n#### Base-Charge Storage in the Active Region\n\nWhen a transistor is in the active region, many minority carriers are stored in the base region (electrons in an npn transistor). This minority charge is responsible for $I_{C}$, so this charge must be removed (through the base contact) before the transistor can turn off. As in a forward-biased diode, this charge can be modeled as a diffusion capacitance, $C_{d}$, between the base and emitter given by:\n\n$$\nC_{d} = \\tau_{b} \\frac{I_{C}}{V_{T}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\tau_{b}$ is the base-transit-time constant. Thus, the diffusion capacitance is proportional to $I_{C}$. The total base-emitter capacitance, $C_{be}$, will include the base-emitter depletion capacitance, $C_{j}$, in parallel with $C_{d}$. Normally, however, $C_{j}$ is much less than $C_{d}$, unless the transistor current is small, and can often be ignored.\n\n#### Base-Charge Storage of a Saturated Transistor\n\nWhen a transistor becomes saturated, the minority-charge storage in the base and, even more so, in the lightly doped region of the collector, increases significantly. The major component of this charge storage is due to holes diffusing from the base, through the collector junction, and continuing through the lightly doped $n^{-}$ epitaxial region of the collector to the $n^{+}$ collector region. The $n^{-}$ epitaxial region is so named because it is epitaxially grown on a p region. Most of the charge storage occurs in this region. Additionally, further charge storage occurs because electrons that diffused from the collector are stored in the base, but this charge is normally smaller. The magnitude of the additional charge stored by a saturated transistor is given by:\n\n$$\nQ_{s} = \\tau_{s}(I_{B} - \\frac{I_{C}}{\\beta})\n$$\n\nwhere the base overdrive current, defined as $I_{B} - I_{C} / \\beta$, is approximately equal to the hole current from the base to the collector. Normally, in saturation, $I_{B} >> I_{C} / \\beta$, and (8.11) can be approximated by:\n\n$$\nQ_{s} \\cong \\tau_{s} I_{B}\n$$\n\nThe constant $\\tau_{s}$ is approximately equal to the epitaxial-region transit time, $\\tau_{E}$ (ignoring the storage of electrons in the base that diffused from the collector). Since the epitaxial region is much wider than the base, the constant $\\tau_{s}$ is normally much larger than the base transit time, the constant $\\tau_{b}$, often by up to two orders of magnitude. The specific value of $\\tau_{s}$ is usually found empirically for a given technology.\n\nWhen a saturated transistor is being turned off, the base current will first reverse. However, before the collector current will change, the saturation charge, $Q_{s}$, must be removed. After $Q_{s}$ is removed, the base minority charge, $Q_{b}$, will be removed. During this time, the collector current will decrease until the transistor shuts off. Typically, the time to remove $Q_{s}$ greatly dominates the overall charge removal time.\n\nIf the time required to remove the base saturation charge, $t_{s}$, is much shorter than the epitaxial-region transit time, $\\tau_{E}$, then a simple expression for the time required to remove the saturation charge can be derived. If the reverse base current (when the saturation charge is being removed), denoted by $I_{BR}$, remains constant while $Q_{s}$ is being removed, then we have:\n\n$$\nt_{s} \\cong \\frac{Q_{s}}{I_{BR}} \\cong \\frac{\\tau_{s}(I_{B} - \\frac{I_{C}}{\\beta})}{I_{BR}} \\cong \\tau_{s} \\frac{I_{B}}{I_{BR}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\tau_{s} \\cong \\tau_{E}$.\n\nNormally, the forward base current during saturation, $I_{B}$, will be much smaller than the reverse base current during saturation-charge removal, $I_{BR}$. If this were not the case, then our original assumption that $t_{s} \\ll \\tau_{E} \\cong \\tau_{s}$ would not be true. In this case, the turn-off time of the BJT would be so slow as to make the circuit unusable in most applications. Nevertheless, the turn-off time for this case, when $t_{s}$ is not much less than $\\tau_{E}$, is given by:\n\n$$\nt_{s} = \\tau_{s} \\ln \\left[\\frac{I_{BR} + I_{B}}{I_{BR} + \\frac{I_{C}}{\\beta}}\\right]\n$$\n\nThe reader should verify that for $I_{BR} \\gg I_{B}$ and $I_{BR} \\gg I_{C} / \\beta$, the expression in (8.14) is approximately equivalent to the much simpler one in (8.13).\n\nIn both of the cases just described, the time required to remove the storage charge of a saturated transistor is much larger than the time required to turn off a transistor in the active region. In high-speed microcircuit designs, one never allows bipolar transistors to saturate, to avoid the long turn-off time that would result.\n\nKey Point: The time required to remove the charge stored in a saturated transistor is much larger than the time required to turn off a transistor in the active region. Hence, in high-speed microcircuit designs, one never allows bipolar transistors to saturate.\n\n#### Small-Signal Modeling\n\nThe most commonly used small-signal model is the hybrid-$\\pi$ model. This model is similar to the small-signal model used for MOS transistors, except it includes a finite base-emitter impedance, $r_{\\pi}$, and it has no emitter-to-bulk capacitance. The hybrid-$\\pi$ model is shown in Fig. 8.8. As in the MOS case, we will first discuss the transconductance, $g_{m}$, and the small-signal resistances, and then we will discuss the parasitic capacitances.\n\nThe transistor transconductance, $g_{m}$, is perhaps the most important parameter of the small-signal model. The transconductance is the ratio of the small-signal collector current, $i_{c}$, to the small-signal base-emitter voltage, $v_{be}$. Thus, we have:\n\n$$\ng_{m} = \\frac{i_{c}}{v_{be}} = \\frac{\\partial I_{C}}{\\partial V_{BE}}\n$$\n\nRecall that in the active region:\n\n$$\nI_{C} = I_{CS} e^{v_{BE} / v_{T}}\n$$\n\nThen:\n\n$$\ng_{m} = \\frac{\\partial I_{C}}{\\partial V_{BE}} = \\frac{I_{CS}}{v_{T}} e^{V_{BE} / v_{T}}\n$$\n\nUsing (8.19) again, we obtain:\n\n$$\ng_{m} = \\frac{I_{C}}{V_{T}}\n$$\n\nwhere $V_{T}$ is given by:\n\n$$\nV_{T} = \\frac{k T}{q}\n$$\n\nKey Point: BJT small-signal transconductance is proportional to collector current and is approximately 26 mV at a room temperature of $T = 300 K$. Thus, the transconductance is proportional to the bias current of a BJT. In integrated-circuit design, it is important that the transconductance (which determines the bandwidth of many circuits) remains temperature independent, so the bias currents are usually made proportional to absolute temperature (since $V_{T}$ is proportional to absolute temperature).\n\nThe presence of the resistor $r_{\\pi}$ reflects the fact that the base current is nonzero. We have:\n\n$$\nr_{\\pi} = \\frac{\\partial V_{BE}}{\\partial I_{B}}\n$$\n\nBecause from (8.4) we have:\n\n$$\nI_{B} = \\frac{I_{C}}{\\beta} = \\frac{I_{CS}}{\\beta} e^{V_{BE} / v_{T}}\n$$\n\nwe therefore have:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r_{\\pi}} = \\frac{\\partial I_{B}}{\\partial V_{BE}} = \\frac{I_{CS}}{\\beta v_{T}} e^{v_{BE} / v_{T}}\n$$\n\nUsing (8.24) again, we have:\n\n$$\nr_{\\pi} = \\frac{V_{T}}{I_{B}}\n$$\n\nor equivalently:\n\n$$\nr_{\\pi} = \\beta \\frac{V_{T}}{I_{C}} = \\frac{\\beta}{g_{m}}\n$$\n\nSince:\n\n$$\ni_{e} = i_{c} + i_{b}\n$$\n\nwe also have:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial I_{E}}{\\partial V_{BE}} = \\frac{\\partial I_{c}}{\\partial V_{BE}} + \\frac{\\partial I_{B}}{\\partial V_{BE}} = g_{m} + \\frac{g_{m}}{\\beta} = g_{m}\\left(\\frac{1+\\beta}{\\beta}\\right)\n$$\n\nContinuing, we have:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r_{0}} = \\frac{\\partial I_{C}}{\\partial V_{CE}}\n$$\n\nThe small-signal resistance, $r_{0}$, models the dependence of the collector current on the collector-emitter voltage. Repeating (8.3) here for convenience:\n\n$$\nI_{C} = I_{CS} e^{v_{BE} v_{T}}\\left(1+\\frac{V_{CE}}{V_{A}}\\right)\n$$\n\nwe have:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r_{0}} = \\frac{\\partial I_{C}}{\\partial V_{CE}} = \\frac{I_{CS}}{V_{A}} e^{V_{BE} v_{T}}\n$$\n\nThus:\n\n$$\nr_{0} = \\frac{V_{A}}{I_{C}}\n$$\n\nwhich is inversely proportional to the collector current. The resistor $r_{b}$ models the resistance of the semiconductor material between the base contact and the effective base region due to the moderately lightly doped base p material (see Fig. 8.1). This resistor, although small (typically a few hundred ohms or less), can be important in limiting the speed of very-high-frequency low-gain BJT circuits and is a major source of noise.\n\nThe hybrid-$\\pi$ model is only one of a number of small-signal models that can be used. One common alternative is the $T$ model shown in Fig. 8.9. It incorporates"

    "text": "To comprehend the functionality of bipolar transistors, we examine an npn transistor with its emitter grounded, as depicted in Fig. 8.4. If the base voltage, $V_{B}$, falls below around 0.5 V, the transistor will be in cutoff mode, and no current will flow. We will observe that when the base-emitter pn junction becomes forward biased, current begins to flow from the base to the emitter, but due to the narrow base width, a significantly larger proportional current will flow from the collector to the emitter. Consequently, the npn transistor can be regarded as a current amplifier at low frequencies. In simpler terms, if the transistor is not in cutoff mode and the collector-base junction is reverse biased, a small base current governs a much larger collector-emitter current.\n\nA concise explanation of an npn transistor's operation is as follows. When the base-emitter junction becomes forward biased, it starts to conduct, similar to any forward-biased junction. The current consists of majority carriers from the base (holes in this case) and majority carriers from the emitter (electrons) diffusing across the junction. Since the emitter is more heavily doped than the base, there are significantly more electrons injected from the emitter than there are holes injected from the base. Assuming the collector voltage is sufficient to keep the collector-base junction reverse biased, no holes from the base will reach the collector. However, the electrons that travel from the emitter to the base, where they are now minority carriers, diffuse away from the base-emitter junction due to the minority-carrier concentration gradient in the base region. Any of these minority electrons that approach the collector-base junction will promptly be swept across the junction by the large positive voltage on the collector, which attracts the negatively charged electrons. In a well-designed bipolar transistor, such as the one shown in Fig. 8.1, the vertical base width, W, is small, and almost all of the electrons that diffuse from the emitter to the base reach the collector-base junction and are swept across the junction, thereby contributing to current flow in the collector. As a result, the collector current closely approximates the electron current flowing from the emitter to the base. The much smaller base current closely approximates the current due to the holes that flow from the base to the emitter. The total emitter current is the sum of the electron collector current and the hole base current, but since the hole current is much smaller than the electron current, the emitter current is approximately equal to the collector current.\n\nSince the collector current is approximately equal to the electron current flowing from the emitter to the base, and the amount of this electron current is determined by the base-emitter voltage, it can be demonstrated (see Appendix at the end of this chapter) that the collector current is exponentially related to the base-emitter voltage by the relationship\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C} \\cong I_{CS} e^{V_{BE} / V_{T}} \\tag{8.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $I_{CS}$ is the scale current. This scale current is proportional to the area of the base-emitter junction. The base current, determined by the hole current flowing from the base to the emitter, is also exponentially related to the base-emitter voltage, resulting in the ratio of the collector current to the base current being a constant that, to a first-order approximation, is independent of voltage and current. This ratio, typically denoted $\\beta$, is defined as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\beta \\equiv \\frac{I_{C}}{I_{B}} \\tag{8.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $I_{C}$ and $I_{B}$ are the collector and base currents, respectively. Typical values of $\\beta$ range from 50 to 200. Lower values are found in lateral bipolar transistors, which are not optimized for high current gain, and higher values are found in heterojunction bipolar transistors.\n\nKey Point: In active mode, with the base-emitter junction forward biased and the base-collector junction reverse biased, the collector current increases exponentially with the base-emitter voltage, and the base current is a factor $\\beta$ smaller. The variation in collector current with collector voltage is first-order modeled by the Early voltage.\n\nNote that (8.1) implies that the collector current is independent of the collector voltage. This independence neglects second-order effects such as the decrease in effective base width, W, due to the increase in the width of the collector-base depletion region when the collector bias voltage is increased. To illustrate this point, a typical plot of the collector current, $I_{C}$, as a function of the collector-to-emitter voltage, $V_{CE}$, for different values of $I_{B}$ is shown in Fig. 8.5 for a practical transistor. The fact that the curves are not flat for $V_{CE} > V_{CE-sat}$ indicates the dependence of $I_{C}$ on $V_{CE}$. Indeed, to a good approximation, the dependence is linear with a slope that intercepts the $V_{CE}$ axis at $V_{CE} = -V_{A}$ for all values of $I_{B}$. The intercept voltage value, $V_{A}$, is called the Early voltage for bipolar transistors, with a typical value ranging from 50 V to 100 V. This dependency results in a finite output impedance (as in a MOS transistor) and can be modeled by modifying equation (8.1) [Sze, 1981] to be\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C} \\cong I_{CS} e^{V_{BE} / V_{T}} \\left(1 + \\frac{V_{CE}}{V_{A}}\\right) \\tag{8.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n#### Large-Signal Modelling\n\nA conducting BJT with a $V_{CE}$ greater than $V_{CE-sat}$ (approximately 0.3 V) is said to be operating in the active region. Such a collector-emitter voltage is necessary to ensure that none of the holes from the base reach the collector. A large-signal model of a BJT operating in the active region is shown in Fig. 8.6.\n\nSince $I_{B} = I_{C} / \\beta$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{B} = \\frac{I_{CS}}{\\beta} e^{V_{BE} / V_{T}} = I_{BS} e^{V_{BE} / V_{T}} \\tag{8.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhich is similar to a diode equation but with a multiplying constant of $I_{CS} / \\beta = I_{BS}$. Since $I_{E} = I_{B} + I_{C}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{E} = I_{CS} \\left(\\frac{\\beta + 1}{\\beta}\\right) e^{V_{BE} / V_{T}} = I_{ES} e^{V_{BE} / V_{T}} \\tag{8.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nor equivalently\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C} = \\alpha I_{E} \\tag{8.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha$ has been defined as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\alpha = \\frac{\\beta}{\\beta + 1} \\tag{8.7}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand for large values of $\\beta$, can be approximated as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\alpha \\cong 1 - \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\cong 1 \\tag{8.8}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIf the effect of $V_{CE}$ on $I_{C}$ is included in the model, the current-controlled source, $\\beta I_{B}$, should be replaced by a current source given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C} = \\beta I_{B} \\left(1 + \\frac{V_{CE}}{V_{A}}\\right) \\tag{8.9}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $V_{A}$ is the Early-voltage constant. This additional modeling of the finite output impedance is normally not done in large-signal analysis without the use of a computer due to its complexity.\n\nAs the collector-emitter voltage approaches $V_{CE-sat}$ (typically around 0.2 to 0.3 V), the base-collector junction becomes forward biased, and holes from the base will begin to diffuse to the collector. A common model for this case, when the transistor is saturated or in the saturation region, is shown in Fig. 8.7. It should be noted that the value of $V_{CE-sat}$ decreases for smaller values of collector current.\n\nKey Point: As the base-collector junction approaches forward bias, at collector-emitter voltages of about 0.2 to 0.3 V, a finite base-collector current flows, and the transistor is saturated.\n\n#### Base-Charge Storage in the Active Region\n\nWhen a transistor is in the active region, many minority carriers are stored in the base region (electrons are stored in an npn transistor). Recall that this minority charge is responsible for $I_{C}$, so this charge must be removed (through the base contact) before a transistor can turn off. As in a forward-biased diode, this charge can be modeled as a diffusion capacitance, $C_{d}$, between the base and emitter given by (see Appendix at the end of this chapter)\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{d} = \\tau_{b} \\frac{I_{C}}{V_{T}} \\tag{8.10}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\tau_{b}$ is the base-transit-time constant. Thus, we see that the diffusion capacitance is proportional to $I_{C}$. The total base-emitter capacitance, $C_{be}$, will include the base-emitter depletion capacitance, $C_{j}$, in parallel with $C_{d}$. Normally, however, $C_{j}$ is much less than $C_{d}$, unless the transistor current is small, and can often be ignored.\n\n#### Base-Charge Storage of a Saturated Transistor\n\nWhen a transistor becomes saturated, the minority-charge storage in the base and, even more so, in the lightly doped region of the collector, increases drastically. The major component of this charge storage is due to holes diffusing from the base, through the collector junction, and continuing on through the lightly doped $n^{-}$ epitaxial region of the collector to the $n^{+}$ collector region. The $n^{-}$ epitaxial region is so named because it is epitaxially grown on a p region. Most of the charge storage occurs in this region. Also, additional charge storage occurs because electrons that diffused from the collector are stored in the base, but this charge is normally smaller. The magnitude of the additional charge stored by a transistor that is saturated is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nQ_{s} = \\tau_{s} \\left(I_{B} - \\frac{I_{C}}{\\beta}\\right) \\tag{8.11}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere the base overdrive current, defined as $I_{B} - I_{C} / \\beta$, is approximately equal to the hole current from the base to the collector. Normally, in saturation, $I_{B} >> I_{C} / \\beta$, and (8.11) can be approximated as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nQ_{s} \\cong \\tau_{s} I_{B} \\tag{8.12}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe constant $\\tau_{s}$ is approximately equal to the epitaxial-region transit time, $\\tau_{E}$ (ignoring the storage of electrons in the base that diffused from the collector). Since the epitaxial region is much wider than the base, the constant $\\tau_{s}$ is normally much larger than the base transit time, the constant $\\tau_{b}$, often by up to two orders of magnitude. The specific value of $\\tau_{s}$ is usually found empirically for a given technology.\n\nWhen a saturated transistor is being turned off, first the base current will reverse. However, before the collector current will change, the saturation charge, $Q_{s}$, must be removed. After $Q_{s}$ is removed, the base minority charge, $Q_{b}$, will be removed. During this time, the collector current will decrease until the transistor shuts off. Typically, the time to remove $Q_{s}$ greatly dominates the overall charge removal.\n\nIf the time required to remove the base saturation charge, $t_{s}$, is much shorter than the epitaxial-region transit time, $\\tau_{E}$, then one can derive a simple expression for the time required to remove the saturation charge. If the reverse base current (when the saturation charge is being removed), denoted by $I_{BR}$, remains constant while $Q_{s}$ is being removed, then we have [Hodges, 1988]\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nt_{s} \\cong \\frac{Q_{s}}{I_{BR}} \\cong \\frac{\\tau_{s} \\left(I_{B} - \\frac{I_{C}}{\\beta}\\right)}{I_{BR}} \\cong \\tau_{s} \\frac{I_{B}}{I_{BR}} \\tag{8.13}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\tau_{s} \\cong \\tau_{E}$.\n"

Since $I_{E} = I_{B} + I_{C}$, we have:\n\n$$\nI_{E} = I_{CS}\\left(\\frac{\\beta+1}{\\beta}\\right) e^{V_{BE} / V_{T}} = I_{ES} e^{V_{BE} / V_{T}}\n$$\n\nor equivalently:\n\n$$\nI_{C} = \\alpha I_{E}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha$ has been defined as:\n\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{\\beta}{\\beta+1}\n$$\n\nand for large values of $\\beta$, can be approximated as:\n\n$$\n\\alpha \\cong 1 - \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\cong 1\n$$\n\nIf the effect of $V_{CE}$ on $I_{C}$ is included in the model, the current-controlled source, $\\beta I_{B}$, should be replaced by a current source given by:\n\n$$\nI_{C} = \\beta I_{B}\\left(1+\\frac{V_{CE}}{V_{A}}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $V_{A}$ is the Early-voltage constant. This additional modeling of the finite output impedance is normally not done in large-signal analysis without the use of a computer due to its complexity.\n\nAs the collector-emitter voltage approaches $V_{CE-sat}$ (typically around 0.2 to 0.3 V), the base-collector junction becomes forward biased, and holes from the base will begin to diffuse to the collector. A common model for this case, when the transistor is saturated or in the saturation region, is shown in Fig. 8.7. It should be noted that the value of $V_{CE-sat}$ decreases for smaller values of collector current.\n\nKey Point: As the base-collector junction approaches forward bias at collector-emitter voltages of about 0.2 to 0.3 V, a finite base-collector current flows, and the transistor is saturated.\n\n#### Base-Charge Storage in the Active Region\n\nWhen a transistor is in the active region, many minority carriers are stored in the base region (electrons are stored in an npn transistor). Recall that this minority charge is responsible for $I_{C}$, so this charge must be removed (through the base contact) before a transistor can turn off. As in a forward-biased diode, this charge can be modeled as a diffusion capacitance, $C_{d}$, between the base and emitter given by:\n\n$$\nC_{d} = \\tau_{b} \\frac{I_{C}}{V_{T}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\tau_{b}$ is the base-transit-time constant. Thus, we see that the diffusion capacitance is proportional to $I_{C}$. The total base-emitter capacitance, $C_{be}$, will include the base-emitter depletion capacitance, $C_{j}$, in parallel with $C_{d}$. Normally, however, $C_{j}$ is much less than $C_{d}$, unless the transistor current is small, and can often be ignored.\n\n#### Base-Charge Storage of a Saturated Transistor\n\nWhen a transistor becomes saturated, the minority-charge storage in the base and, even more so, in the lightly doped region of the collector, increases drastically. The major component of this charge storage is due to holes diffusing from the base, through the collector junction, and continuing on through the lightly doped $n^{-}$ epitaxial region of the collector to the $n^{+}$ collector region. The $n^{-}$ epitaxial region is so named because it is epitaxially grown on a p region. Most of the charge storage occurs in this region. Also, additional charge storage occurs because electrons that diffused from the collector are stored in the base, but this charge is normally smaller. The magnitude of the additional charge stored by a transistor that is saturated is given by:\n\n$$\nQ_{s} = \\tau_{s}\\left(I_{B} - \\frac{I_{C}}{\\beta}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere the base overdrive current, defined to be $I_{B} - I_{C} / \\beta$, is approximately equal to the hole current from the base to the collector. Normally, in saturation, $I_{B} >> I_{C} / \\beta$, and the above equation can be approximated by:\n\n$$\nQ_{s} \\cong \\tau_{s} I_{B}\n$$\n\nThe constant $\\tau_{s}$ is approximately equal to the epitaxial-region transit time, $\\tau_{E}$ (ignoring the storage of electrons in the base that diffused from the collector). Since the epitaxial region is much wider than the base, the constant $\\tau_{s}$ is normally much larger than the base transit time, the constant $\\tau_{b}$, often by up to two orders of magnitude. The specific value of $\\tau_{s}$ is usually found empirically for a given technology.\n\nWhen a saturated transistor is being turned off, first the base current will reverse. However, before the collector current will change, the saturation charge, $Q_{s}$, must be removed. After $Q_{s}$ is removed, the base minority charge, $Q_{b}$, will be removed. During this time, the collector current will decrease until the transistor shuts off. Typically, the time to remove $Q_{s}$ greatly dominates the overall charge removal.\n\nIf the time required to remove the base saturation charge, $t_{s}$, is much shorter than the epitaxial-region transit time, $\\tau_{E}$, then one can derive a simple expression for the time required to remove the saturation charge. If the reverse base current (when the saturation charge is being removed), denoted by $I_{BR}$, remains constant while $Q_{s}$ is being removed, then we have:\n\n$$\nt_{s} \\cong \\frac{Q_{s}}{I_{BR}} \\cong \\frac{\\tau_{s}\\left(I_{B} - \\frac{I_{C}}{\\beta}\\right)}{I_{BR}} \\cong \\tau_{s} \\frac{I_{B}}{I_{BR}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\tau_{s} \\cong \\tau_{E}$.\n\nNormally, the forward base current during saturation, $I_{B}$, will be much smaller than the reverse base current during saturation-charge removal, $I_{BR}$. If this were not the case, then our original assumption that $t_{s} \\ll \\tau_{E} \\cong \\tau_{s}$ would not be true. In this case, the turn-off time of the BJT would be so slow as to make the circuit unusable in most applications. Nevertheless, the turn-off time for this case, when $t_{s}$ is not much less than $\\tau_{E}$, is given by:\n\n$$\nt_{s} = \\tau_{s} \\ln \\left[\\frac{I_{BR} + I_{B}}{I_{BR} + \\frac{I_{C}}{\\beta}}\\right]\n$$\n\nThe reader should verify that for $I_{BR} \\gg I_{B}$ and $I_{BR} \\gg I_{C} / \\beta$, the expression in the above equation is approximately equivalent to the much simpler one previously provided.\n\nIn both of the cases just described, the time required to remove the storage charge of a saturated transistor is much larger than the time required to turn off a transistor in the active region. In high-speed microcircuit designs, one never allows bipolar transistors to saturate, to avoid the long turn-off time that would result.\n\nKey Point: The time required to remove the charge stored in a saturated transistor is much larger than the time required to turn off a transistor in the active region. Hence, in high-speed microcircuit designs, one never allows bipolar transistors to saturate.\n\n#### Small-Signal Modeling\n\nThe most commonly used small-signal model is the hybrid-$\\pi$ model. This model is similar to the small-signal model used for MOS transistors, except it includes a finite base-emitter impedance, $r_{\\pi}$, and it has no emitter-to-bulk capacitance. The hybrid-$\\pi$ model is shown in Fig. 8.8. As in the MOS case, we will first discuss the transconductance, $g_{m}$, and the small-signal resistances, and then we will discuss the parasitic capacitances.\n\nThe transistor transconductance, $g_{m}$, is perhaps the most important parameter of the small-signal model. The transconductance is the ratio of the small-signal collector current, $i_{c}$, to the small-signal base-emitter voltage, $v_{be}$. Thus, we have:\n\n$$\ng_{m} = \\frac{i_{c}}{v_{be}} = \\frac{\\partial I_{C}}{\\partial V_{BE}}\n$$\n\nRecall that in the active region:\n\n$$\nI_{C} = I_{CS} e^{v_{BE} / v_{T}}\n$$\n\nThen:\n\n$$\ng_{m} = \\frac{\\partial I_{C}}{\\partial V_{BE}} = \\frac{I_{CS}}{v_{T}} e^{V_{BE} / v_{T}}\n$$\n\nUsing the above equation again, we obtain:\n\n$$\ng_{m} = \\frac{I_{C}}{v_{T}}\n$$\n\nwhere $v_{T}$ is given by:\n\n$$\nv_{T} = \\frac{k T}{q}\n$$\n\nKey Point: BJT small-signal transconductance is proportional to collector current and is approximately 26 mV at a room temperature of $T = 300 K$. Thus, the transconductance is proportional to the bias current of a BJT. In integrated-circuit design, it is important that the transconductance (which determines the bandwidth of many circuits) remains temperature independent, so the bias currents are usually made proportional to absolute temperature (since $v_{T}$ is proportional to absolute temperature).\n\nThe presence of the resistor $r_{\\pi}$ reflects the fact that the base current is nonzero. We have:\n\n$$\nr_{\\pi} = \\frac{\\partial V_{BE}}{\\partial I_{B}}\n$$\n\nBecause from the previously provided equation we have:\n\n$$\nI_{B} = \\frac{I_{C}}{\\beta} = \\frac{I_{CS}}{\\beta} e^{V_{BE} / v_{T}}\n$$\n\nwe therefore have:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r_{\\pi}} = \\frac{\\partial I_{B}}{\\partial V_{BE}} = \\frac{I_{CS}}{\\beta v_{T}} e^{v_{BE} / v_{T}}\n$$\n\nUsing the previously provided equation again, we have:\n\n$$\nr_{\\pi} = \\frac{v_{T}}{I_{B}}\n$$\n\nor equivalently:\n\n$$\nr_{\\pi} = \\beta \\frac{v_{T}}{I_{C}} = \\frac{\\beta}{g_{m}}\n$$\n\nSince:\n\n$$\ni_{e} = i_{c} + i_{b}\n$$\n\nwe also have:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial I_{E}}{\\partial V_{BE}} = \\frac{\\partial I_{c}}{\\partial V_{BE}} + \\frac{\\partial I_{B}}{\\partial V_{BE}} = g_{m} + \\frac{g_{m}}{\\beta} = g_{m}\\left(\\frac{1+\\beta}{\\beta}\\right)\n$$\n\nContinuing, we have:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r_{0}} = \\frac{\\partial I_{C}}{\\partial V_{CE}}\n$$\n\nThe small-signal resistance, $r_{0}$, models the dependence of the collector current on the collector-emitter voltage. Repeating the modified equation for convenience:\n\n$$\nI_{C} = I_{CS} e^{v_{BE} v_{T}}\\left(1+\\frac{V_{CE}}{V_{A}}\\right)\n$$\n\nwe have:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r_{0}} = \\frac{\\partial I_{C}}{\\partial V_{CE}} = \\frac{I_{CS}}{V_{A}} e^{V_{BE} v_{T}}\n$$\n\nThus:\n\n$$\nr_{0} = \\frac{V_{A}}{I_{C}}\n$$\n\nwhich is inversely proportional to the collector current. The resistor $r_{b}$ models the resistance of the semiconductor material between the base contact and the effective base region due to the moderately lightly doped base p material (see Fig. 8.1). This resistor, although small (typically a few hundred ohms or less), can be important in limiting the speed of very-high-frequency low-gain BJT circuits and is a major source of noise.\n\nThe hybrid-$\\pi$ model is only one of a number of small-signal models that can be"

When the base voltage, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{B}}$, falls below approximately 0.5 V, the transistor is in cutoff mode and ceases to conduct.\n\nThe cross-section of an npn bipolar-junction transistor, as shown in Fig. 8.1, reveals its internal structure and primary components: the emitter, base, and collector regions. The emitter, being an 'n+' region, is heavily doped and connected to a metal contact. The base, a 'p' type region situated between the emitter and collector, is lightly doped and connected to a metal contact designed to surround the emitter contact for minimizing resistance. The collector, represented as 'n-' and 'n+' regions, has varying doping levels and is also connected to a metal contact. A layer of silicon dioxide (SiO2) acts as an insulator, while the 'n+' buried collector region below the collector aids in efficient charge collection. The 'p-' substrate or bulk is the base layer upon which the transistor is constructed.\n\nThe metal contacts on these regions enable external circuit connections, with arrows indicating the direction of current flow, demonstrating electrons moving from the emitter to the collector via the base. The base contact's surrounding design minimizes resistance and enhances efficiency. Standard semiconductor labeling conventions ('n+', 'n-', 'p') are used to denote doping levels and types, with annotations clarifying features such as the base contact's design to minimize resistance and the effective base region's influence on operation.\n\nFig. 8.2 presents a simplified cross-sectional view of an npn BJT, focusing on its core structural components and doping characteristics.

    "text": "To comprehend the functioning of bipolar transistors, we will examine an npn transistor with its emitter grounded, as depicted in Fig. 8.4. If the base voltage, $V_{B}$, is less than approximately 0.5 V, the transistor will be in cutoff mode, and no current will flow. We will observe that when the base-emitter pn junction is forward-biased, current begins to flow from the base to the emitter. However, due to the narrow base width, a much larger proportional current will flow from the collector to the emitter. Thus, the npn transistor can be regarded as a current amplifier at low frequencies. In other words, if the transistor is not in cutoff mode and the collector-base junction is reverse-biased, a small base current controls a much larger collector-emitter current.\n\nA simplified explanation of how an npn transistor operates is as follows. When the base-emitter junction becomes forward-biased, it starts to conduct, similar to any forward-biased junction. The current consists of majority carriers from the base (holes) and majority carriers from the emitter (electrons) diffusing across the junction. Because the emitter is more heavily doped than the base, there are many more electrons injected from the emitter than there are holes injected from the base. Assuming the collector voltage is sufficient to keep the collector-base junction reverse-biased, no holes from the base will reach the collector. However, the electrons that travel from the emitter to the base, where they are now minority carriers, diffuse away from the base-emitter junction because of the minority-carrier concentration gradient in the base region. Any of these minority electrons that get close to the collector-base junction will be swept across the junction due to the large positive voltage on the collector, which attracts the negatively charged electrons. In a properly designed bipolar transistor, such as that shown in Fig. 8.1, the vertical base width, W, is small, and almost all of the electrons that diffuse from the emitter to the base reach the collector-base junction and are swept across the junction, thus contributing to current flow in the collector. The result is that the collector current very closely equals the electron current flowing from the emitter to the base. The much smaller base current very closely equals the current due to the holes that flow from the base to the emitter. The total emitter current is the sum of the electron collector current and the hole base current, but since the hole current is much smaller than the electron current, the emitter current is approximately equal to the collector current.\n\nSince the collector current is approximately equal to the electron current flowing from the emitter to the base, and the amount of this electron current is determined by the base-emitter voltage, it can be shown ( the collector current is exponentially related to the base-emitter voltage by the relationship\n\n$$\nIbegin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}} \\cong \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{CS}} \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE}} / \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{T}}} \\tag{8.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{CS}}$ is the scale current. This scale current is proportional to the area of the base-emitter junction. The base current, determined by the hole current flowing from the base to the emitter, is also exponentially related to the base-emitter voltage, resulting in the ratio of the collector current to the base current being a constant that, to a first-order approximation, is independent of voltage and current. This ratio, typically denoted $\\beta$, is defined to be\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\beta \\equiv \\frac{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}}{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{B}}} \\tag{8.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $I_{C}$ and $I_{B}$ are the collector and base currents. Typical values of $\\beta$ are between 50 and 200. Lower values arise in lateral bipolar transistors, which are not optimized for high current gain, and higher values arise in heterojunction bipolar transistors.\n\nKey Point: In active mode, with base-emitter junction forward-biased and base-collector junction reverse-biased, collector current increases exponentially with base-emitter voltage, and the base current is a factor $\\beta$ smaller. The variation in collector current with collector voltage is first-order modeled by the Early voltage.\n\nNote that (8.1) implies that the collector current is independent of the collector voltage. This independence ignores second-order effects such as the decrease in effective base width, W, due to the increase in the width of the collector-base depletion region when the collector bias voltage is increased. To illustrate this point, a typical plot of the collector current, $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}$, as a function of collector-to-emitter voltage, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CE}}$, for different values of $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is shown in Fig. 8.5 for a practical transistor. The fact that the curves are not flat for $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CE}}>\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CE} \\text {-sat }}$ indicates the dependence of $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}$ on $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CE}}$. Indeed, to a good approximation, the dependence is linear with a slope that intercepts the $V_{C E}$ axis at $V_{C E}=-V_{A}$ for all values of $I_{B}$. The intercept voltage value, $V_{A}$,\nis called the Early voltage for bipolar transistors, with a typical value being from 50 V to 100 V. This dependency results in a finite output impedance (as in a MOS transistor) and can be modeled by modifying equation (8.1) [Sze, 1981] to be\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}} \\cong \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{CS}} \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE}} \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{T}}}\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CE}}}{\\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{A}}}\\right) \\tag{8.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n#### Large-Signal Modelling\n\nA conducting BJT that has a $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {CE }}$ greater than $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CE} \\text {-sat }}$ (which is approximately 0.3 V) is said to be operating in the active region. Such a collector-emitter voltage is required to ensure that none of the holes from the base go to the collector.

Since $I_{E}=I_{B}+I_{C}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{E}=I_{C S}\\left(\\frac{\\beta+1}{\\beta}\\right) e^{V_{B E} / V_{T}}=I_{E S} e^{V_{B E} / V_{T}} \\tag{8.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nor equivalently\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}=\\alpha \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{E}} \\tag{8.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha$ has been defined as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\alpha=\\frac{\\beta}{\\beta+1} \\tag{8.7}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand for large values of $\\beta$, can be approximated as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\alpha \\cong 1-\\frac{1}{\\beta} \\cong 1 \\tag{8.8}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIf the effect of $V_{C E}$ on $I_{C}$ is included in the model, the current-controlled source, $\\beta I_{B}$, should be replaced by a current source given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}=\\beta \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{B}}\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CE}}}{\\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{A}}}\\right) \\tag{8.9}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{A}}$ is the Early-voltage constant. This additional modeling of the finite output impedance is normally not done in large-signal analysis without the use of a computer due to its complexity.\n\nAs the collector-emitter voltage approaches $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {CE-sat }}$ (typically around 0.2 to 0.3 V), the base-collector junction becomes forward biased, and holes from the base will begin to diffuse to the collector.

    "text": "To comprehend the functionality of bipolar transistors, we focus on an npn transistor configuration where the emitter is grounded, as depicted in Fig. 8.4. When the base voltage, $V_{B}$, falls below approximately 0.5 V, the transistor is in cutoff mode, ceasing current flow. Fig. 8.1 portrays a cross-section of an npn bipolar-junction transistor, detailing its internal structure and components, which include the heavily doped n-type emitter, the lightly doped p-type base, and the n-type collector with varying doping levels. The base's role is crucial as it controls the flow of electrons from the emitter to the collector. When forward-biased, the base-emitter junction allows current flow, with the base width, W, influencing the transistor's operation. The collector current, $I_{C}$, is exponentially related to the base-emitter voltage, $V_{BE}$, and is typically much larger than the base current, $I_{B}$, due to the transistor's current amplification property. This relationship is defined by the transistor's beta, $\\beta$, which is the ratio of $I_{C}$ to $I_{B}$ and typically ranges between 50 and 200. In active mode, with the base-emitter junction forward-biased and the base-collector junction reverse-biased, the collector current increases exponentially with the base-emitter voltage. The variation in collector current with collector voltage is first-order modeled by the Early voltage. At high frequencies, the transistor's operation is affected by capacitances associated with the depletion regions and the storage of diffusing charge-carriers in the base."

This contrasts with MOS transistors, whose intrinsic gain, as shown in equation (1.115) $\\mathrm{A}_{\\mathrm{i}} \\cong 2 / \\lambda \\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$, decreases with increasing bias current.

Additionally, this BJT's maximum gain is independent of the bias current. For MOS transistors, equation (1.115) indicates that the maximum gain is inversely proportional to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$ and, consequently, to the square-root of its bias current. This is a key reason why a single-transistor BJT amplifier can achieve a much higher gain than a MOS transistor, particularly at high current levels (and thus at high frequencies).\n\nA standard measure of a BJT's speed is the frequency at which its current gain drops to unity when its collector is connected to a small-signal ground.

This is a fundamental difference from MOS transistors, whose intrinsic gain, as shown in equation (1.115) $\\mathrm{A}_{\\mathrm{i}} \\cong 2 / \\lambda \\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$, decreases with increasing bias current. The intrinsic gain for an npn BJT usually ranges between 2000 and 8000.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 8.3\n\nDetermine the maximum possible gain of a single-transistor amplifier using the transistor from Example 8.2.\n\n#### Solution\n\nThe maximum gain is given by $\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m}} \\mathrm{r}_{\\mathrm{o}}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ng_{m} r_{o}=\\frac{V_{A}}{V_{T}}=3,846 \\tag{8.45}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nNote that this gain significantly exceeds the 32.9 observed for a single MOS transistor in Example 1.15. Additionally, this BJT's maximum gain is independent of the bias current. For MOS transistors, equation (1.115) indicates that the maximum gain is inversely proportional to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {eff }}$ and, consequently, to the square-root of its bias current. This is a key reason why a single-transistor BJT amplifier can achieve a much higher gain compared to a MOS transistor, particularly at high current levels (and thus at high frequencies).\n\nA standard measure of a BJT's speed is the frequency at which its current gain drops to unity when the collector is connected to a small-signal ground. This frequency, denoted as $\\mathrm{f}_{\\mathrm{t}}$, is termed the transistor's unity-gain frequency or cutoff frequency. The relationship between this frequency and the transistor model parameters can be analyzed through the small-signal circuit depicted in Fig. 8.10. In the simplified model shown in Fig. 8.10(b), the resistor $r_{b}$ is disregarded as it does not affect $i_{b}$ due to the circuit being driven by an ideal current source. We have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{be}}=\\mathrm{i}_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left(\\mathrm{r}_{\\pi}\\left\\|\\frac{1}{s \\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{be}}}\\right\\| \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{sC}}\\right) \\tag{8.46}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{i}_{\\mathrm{c}}=\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m}} \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{be}} \\tag{8.47}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSolving for $i_{c} / i_{b}$ yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{i_{c}}{i_{b}}=\\frac{g_{m} r_{\\pi}}{1+s\\left(C_{b e}+C_{c b}\\right) r_{\\pi}} \\tag{8.48}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAt low frequencies, the current gain is $g_{m} r_{\\pi}$, which corresponds to the expected $\\beta$ value using (8.27). At high frequencies, $i_{c} / i_{b}$ is approximately\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left|\\frac{i_{c}}{i_{b}}(\\omega)\\right| \\cong \\frac{g_{m} r_{\\pi}}{\\omega\\left(C_{b e}+C_{c b}\\right) r_{\\pi}}=\\frac{g_{m}}{\\omega\\left(C_{b e}+C_{c b}\\right)} \\tag{8.49}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nTo determine the unity-gain frequency, we set $\\left|\\left(\\mathrm{i}_{\\mathrm{c}} / \\mathrm{i}_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)\\left(\\omega_{\\mathrm{t}}\\right)\\right|=1$ and solve for $\\omega_{\\mathrm{t}}$, resulting in\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\omega_{\\mathrm{t}}=\\frac{g_{\\mathrm{m}}}{\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{be}}+\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{cb}}} \\tag{8.50}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nf_{t}=\\frac{g_{m}}{2 \\pi\\left(C_{b e}+C_{c b}\\right)} \\tag{8.51}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSubstituting (8.21) and (8.39) into (8.51) gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nf_{t}=\\left[2 \\pi\\left(\\frac{\\left(C_{b e}+C_{c b}\\right) V_{T}}{I_{C}}+\\tau_{b}\\right)\\right]^{-1} \\tag{8.52}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFinally, using the expression (8.102) for the base transit time from the Appendix, we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nf_{t}=\\left[2 \\pi\\left(\\frac{\\left(C_{b e}+C_{c b}\\right) V_{T}}{I_{C}}+\\frac{W^{2}}{2 D_{n}}\\right)\\right]^{-1} \\tag{8.53}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis expression omits some other charge storage effects but includes the most significant terms. At low collector currents, the unity-gain frequency is predominantly influenced by terms inversely proportional to $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}$. As the collector current rises, these terms diminish, and $f_{t}$ increases until it reaches a limit set by the base transit time constant, $\\tau_{b}$\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{f}_{\\mathrm{t}, \\max } \\approx \\frac{1}{2 \\pi} \\cdot \\frac{2 \\mathrm{D}_{\\mathrm{n}}}{\\mathrm{~W}^{2}} \\tag{8.54}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $D_{n}$ is the diffusion constant of minority carriers in the base, $\\left(\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}} \\mathrm{kT}\\right) / \\mathrm{q}$, and W is the base width. Clearly, the base width is a crucial dimension affecting the high-speed performance of a bipolar transistor, similar to the gate length in a MOSFET. Often, either $\\mathrm{f}_{\\mathrm{t}}, \\omega_{\\mathrm{t}}$, or $\\tau_{\\mathrm{t}}=1 / \\omega_{\\mathrm{t}}$ will be specified for a transistor at a given bias current. These values represent the upper limit on the maximum frequency at which the transistor can effectively operate at that bias current.\n\nNot accounted for in (8.53) are speed-limiting effects that occur at high current densities.\n\nKey Point: The BJT unity-gain frequency rises with the bias current up to a limit determined by the carrier transit time through the base. Therefore, the base thickness is a critical parameter limiting the maximum operating speed of a BJT.\nAt high current densities, for instance, the high concentration of charge carriers passing through the base shifts the effective base edge further towards and even into the collector. This increases the effective base width, W, leading to an extended base transit time and a decrease in $f_{t}$. This phenomenon is known as the Kirk effect [Kirk, 1962] and causes $f_{t}$ to decline at high collector currents, as depicted in Fig. 8.11.\n\nFig. 8.11 illustrates the relationship between the transition frequency, $f_t$, and the collector current, $I_C$, for a BJT.\n\n1. **Graph Type and Function:**\n- The graph plots $f_t$ (transition frequency) against $I_C$ (collector current).\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n- The vertical axis represents $f_t$ in hertz (Hz).\n- The horizontal axis represents $I_C$ in amperes (A).\n- Both axes use linear scales.\n\n3. **Behavior and Trends:**\n- The graph originates at the origin, indicating zero $f_t$ at zero $I_C$.\n- As $I_C$ increases, $f_t$ also increases, reaching a peak.\n- Beyond this peak, $f_t$ decreases with further increases in $I_C$, indicating the Kirk effect.\n\n4. **Key Features:**\n- The peak represents $f_{t,max}$, the highest frequency for effective transistor operation.\n- The initial rise and subsequent fall of $f_t$ highlight the optimal operating range before the Kirk effect.\n\n5. **Annotations:**\n- A dashed line marks $f_{t,max}$.\n- The graph provides a qualitative understanding of $f_t$ behavior with respect to $I_C$.\n\nThis graph is vital for understanding BJT performance variations with collector current, especially in high-speed applications where $f_t$ is crucial."

    "text": "A bipolar process typically commences with a $\\mathrm{p}^{-}$ substrate. The initial masking step entails the diffusion or ion implantation of $\\mathrm{n}^{+}$ regions into the substrate at locations where transistors are needed. These $\\mathrm{n}^{+}$ regions serve to reduce the series collector resistance. Subsequently, an $\\mathrm{n}^{-}$ single-crystal epitaxial layer is deposited.\n\nIn the subsequent step, isolation structures are created, either through field-oxide growth or by etching trenches and filling them with $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$. Following this, the $\\mathrm{n}^{+}$-collector contact region is implanted, extending from the surface down to the $\\mathrm{n}^{+}$-buried region beneath the transistor.\n\nPolysilicon is commonly employed to make contact with the emitter, base, and possibly the collector, as depicted in Fig. 8.12 for a typical npn BJT structure. One method involves initially depositing the base $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$ polysilicon. This polysilicon is heavily doped $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$ so that, during a subsequent high-temperature step, the boron dopant from the polysilicon contact diffuses into the silicon under the base polysilicon, converting the underlying region to $\\mathrm{p}^{+}$. The base polysilicon is then removed from the active area of the transistor. Next, using one of several possible techniques, the base polysilicon is covered with a thin $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ layer, approximately $0.5 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ thick, leaving an opening over the transistor's active area. This $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ spacer, which separates the base polysilicon from the emitter polysilicon as shown in Fig. 8.12, allows the base polysilicon (or contact) to be closely positioned to the emitter polysilicon (or contact), thereby minimizing base resistance.

This collector current mismatch is influenced by the disparity in the transistors' scale currents.\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{C S}=\\frac{A_{E} q D_{n} n_{i}^{2}}{W N_{A}} \\tag{8.55}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nVariations in the emitter area $A_{E}$, base width $W$, and base dopant concentration $N_{A}$ during manufacturing contribute to the mismatch in bipolar transistor scale currents, thereby affecting collector currents. Consequently, collector currents exhibit statistical variability as outlined in Section 2.3.3, such that the percentage mismatch between the collector currents of two identically sized bipolar transistors is inversely proportional to the device area. The mean squared deviation of a specific bipolar device's collector current from its nominal value is modeled as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\sigma^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}}{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{C}}}\\right)=\\sigma^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{CS}}}{\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{CS}}}\\right)=\\frac{\\mathrm{A}_{\\mathrm{IC}}^{2}}{\\mathrm{~A}_{\\mathrm{E}}} \\tag{8.56}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe constant $A_{I c}$ characterizes the matching precision of a specific bipolar fabrication process and typically ranges from $0.01-0.04 ~ \\mathrm{~m}^{-1}$ for contemporary bipolar processes [Tuinhout, 2003]."
