This chapter aims to introduce the basics of noise analysis, followed by an overview of electronic noise sources, circuit analysis, and ultimately, linearity.\n\nIt is important to note that this chapter focuses on inherent noise rather than interference noise. Interference noise arises from undesirable interactions between the circuit and its external environment or between different sections of the circuit itself.

Subsequently, a frequency-domain analysis of noise is discussed. Similar to deterministic signals, frequency-domain analysis offers more robust analytical tools compared to time-domain analysis alone. Next, noise models for various circuit elements are presented, followed by noise analyses of actual circuits to offer practical experience.

    "text": "Consider the scenario where two noise sources are combined, as depicted in Fig. 9.2.

The last term indicates the correlation between the two signal sources, $\\mathrm{v}_{\\mathrm{n} 1}(\\mathrm{t})$ and $\\mathrm{v}_{\\mathrm{n} 2}(\\mathrm{t})$. An alternative way to rewrite (9.11) that better highlights the effects of signal correlation is to define a correlation coefficient, C, as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{C} \\equiv \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{~T}} \\int_{0}^{\\mathrm{T}} \\mathrm{v}_{\\mathrm{n} 1}(\\mathrm{t}) \\mathrm{v}_{\\mathrm{n} 2}(\\mathrm{t}) \\mathrm{dt}}{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{n} 1(\\mathrm{rms})} \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{n} 2(\\mathrm{rms})}} \\tag{9.12}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWith this definition, (9.11) can also be expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{no}(\\mathrm{rms})}^{2}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{n} 1(\\mathrm{rms})}^{2}+\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{n} 2(\\mathrm{rms})}^{2}+2 \\mathrm{C} \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{n} 1(\\mathrm{rms})} \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{n} 2(\\mathrm{rms})} \\tag{9.13}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIt can be demonstrated that the correlation coefficient always satisfies the condition $-1 \\leq \\mathrm{C} \\leq 1$. Additionally, a value of $\\mathrm{C} = \\pm 1$ indicates that the two signals are fully correlated, while $\\mathrm{C} = 0$ signifies that the signals are uncorrelated. Intermediate values imply partial correlation. Fortunately, there is seldom a need to analyze partially correlated signals since different inherent noise sources are typically uncorrelated.\n\nFor two uncorrelated signals, the mean-squared value of their sum is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{no}(\\mathrm{rms})}^{2}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{n} 1(\\mathrm{rms})}^{2}+\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{n} 2(\\mathrm{rms})}^{2} \\tag{9.14}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nKey Point: The power of independent (uncorrelated) noise sources adds linearly, meaning their voltages and currents combine in a root-sum-of-squares manner. Consequently, to reduce overall noise, focus should be on the largest noise contributors.\n\nThis relationship suggests that when signals are uncorrelated, their rms values add as if they were the magnitudes of vectors at right angles to each other (i.e., orthogonal).\n\nIt is instructive to compare this uncorrelated scenario with the case of fully correlated signals. An example of two fully correlated (though deterministic) sources are two sinusoidal signals with the same frequency and a phase difference of 0 or 180 degrees. In this fully correlated case, the mean-squared value of their sum is given by\n\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:\n[\nname: Vn1(t), type: VoltageSource, value: Vn1(t), ports: {Np: Vno(t), Nn: X}\nname: Vn2(t), type: VoltageSource, value: Vn2(t), ports: {Np: X, Nn: GND}\n]\nextrainfo: The circuit diagram illustrates two voltage sources Vn1(t) and Vn2(t) connected in series to generate an output voltage Vno(t).

Thus, reducing $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{n} 1(\\mathrm{rms})}$ by 13 percent is equivalent to completely eliminating $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{n} 2(\\mathrm{rms})}$!\n\nThe foregoing example underscores a crucial principle: To mitigate overall noise, prioritize addressing the larger noise signals."

    "text": "```\nWhile periodic signals like sinusoids exhibit power at specific frequency points, random signals distribute their power across the entire frequency spectrum. For instance, if the time-domain signal depicted in Fig. 9.1 is analyzed using a spectrum analyzer, the resultant spectrum might resemble that shown in Fig. 9.3(a). Note that the horizontal axis represents the standard frequency scale, whereas the vertical axis is measured in microvolts-squared per hertz. This vertical axis quantifies the normalized noise power (mean-squared value) over a 1-Hz bandwidth at each frequency point. For example, the reading at 100 Hz in Fig. 9.3(a) signifies that the normalized power between 99.5 Hz and 100.5 Hz is $10(\\mu \\mathrm{~V})^{2}$.\n\nConsequently, we define the noise spectral density, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{n}}^{2}(\\mathrm{f})$, or for current, $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{n}}^{2}(\\mathrm{f})$, as the average normalized noise power within a 1-Hz bandwidth. The units for $V_{n}^{2}(\\mathrm{f})$ are volts-squared per hertz, and for $I_{n}^{2}(f)$, they are amps-squared per hertz. Additionally, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{n}}^{2}(\\mathrm{f})$ is a positive real-valued function.\n\nKey Point: The frequency-domain representation of a noise signal is its spectral density: the average normalized power measurable within a 1-Hz bandwidth.\n\nIt is crucial to highlight that the mean-squared value of a random noise signal at any single precise frequency is zero. In other words, the mean-squared value of the signal in Fig. 9.3(a) at 100 Hz is directly proportional to the bandwidth of the bandpass filter used for measurement. In a laboratory spectrum analyzer, the bandpass filter's bandwidth is controlled by the resolution-bandwidth setting. Thus, as the resolution bandwidth approaches zero, the mean-squared value also approaches zero. Conversely, as the resolution bandwidth increases, the measured mean-squared value rises. Regardless, the measured mean-squared value should be normalized to what would be obtained for a 1-Hz bandwidth when expressing the noise spectral density in units of $\\mathrm{V}^{2} /(\\mathrm{Hz})$. For instance, if the signal corresponding to Fig. 9.3(a) is measured around 0.1 Hz with a 1 mHz resolution bandwidth, the mean-squared value would be $1(\\mu \\mathrm{~V})^{2}$, which, when scaled to a 1-Hz bandwidth, equals $1,000\\left(\\mu \\mathrm{~V}^{2}\\right) / \\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\nAn intuitive explanation of measuring a random noise signal with a spectrum analyzer is as follows. A random noise signal continuously varies its frequency across a wide range. A spectrum analyzer, however, is sensitive only to a narrow frequency range defined by its filter's passband, measuring the mean-squared value within this range. The spectrum analyzer's filter responds with a time constant approximately given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\tau \\approx \\frac{1}{\\pi \\mathrm{~W}} \\tag{9.18}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere W is the filter's bandwidth. Occasionally, the random signal matches the frequency of the spectrum analyzer's filter. Thus, the analyzer effectively measures the proportion of time the random signal spends within the filter's frequency range. A narrower filter bandwidth results in a smaller percentage of time the signal is within this range, leading to a lower analyzer output. However, if the signal is deterministic and centered at the filter's frequency, the analyzer's reading is independent of the filter's bandwidth.\n\nWhen dealing with filtered noise, it is often practical to plot the square root of the noise spectral density, resulting in $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{n}}(\\mathrm{f})$, as shown in Fig. $9.3(b)$. We refer to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{n}}(\\mathrm{f})$ as the root spectral density, expressed in volts per root-hertz (i.e., $\\mathrm{V} / \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$).

This relationship is known as the Wiener-Khinchin theorem. The definition provided here is for a one-sided spectral density function, as the noise is integrated only over positive frequencies, primarily for historical reasons. A two-sided definition would result in the spectral density being halved, since for real-valued signals, the spectral density is symmetric for positive and negative frequencies, ensuring the total mean-squared value remains unchanged when integrated over both positive and negative frequencies.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 9.3\n\nWhat mean-squared value would be measured for the signal shown in Fig. 9.3 at 100 Hz using a resolution bandwidth of 30 Hz on a spectrum analyzer?

    "text": "While periodic signals, like sinusoids, exhibit power at specific frequency points, random signals distribute their power across the entire frequency spectrum. For instance, if the time-domain signal in Fig. 9.1 is analyzed using a spectrum analyzer, the resulting spectrum might resemble that in Fig. 9.3(a). Note that the horizontal axis represents the standard frequency, whereas the vertical axis measures microvolts-squared per hertz, indicating the normalized noise power (mean-squared value) over a 1-Hz bandwidth at each frequency. For example, the 100 Hz measurement in Fig. 9.3(a) shows a normalized power of $10(\\mu \\mathrm{~V})^{2}$ between 99.5 Hz and 100.5 Hz.\n\nThus, we define the noise spectral density, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{n}}^{2}(\\mathrm{f})$, or for current, $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{n}}^{2}(\\mathrm{f})$, as the average normalized noise power over a 1-Hz bandwidth. The units for $V_{n}^{2}(\\mathrm{f})$ are volts-squared per hertz, and for $I_{n}^{2}(f)$, they are amps-squared per hertz. Additionally, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{n}}^{2}(\\mathrm{f})$ is a positive real-valued function.\n\nKey Point: The frequency-domain representation of a noise signal is its spectral density: the average normalized power measurable within a 1-Hz bandwidth.\n\nIt's crucial to note that the mean-squared value of a random noise signal at a single precise frequency is zero. In other words, the mean-squared value of the signal in Fig. 9.3(a) at 100 Hz is directly proportional to the bandwidth of the bandpass filter used. In a lab spectrum analyzer, the filter's bandwidth is set by the resolution-bandwidth control. As the resolution bandwidth approaches zero, the mean-squared value also trends to zero. Conversely, increasing the resolution bandwidth raises the measured mean-squared value. Regardless, the measured mean-squared value should be normalized to what would be obtained for a 1-Hz bandwidth when stating the noise spectral density in $\\mathrm{V}^{2} /(\\mathrm{Hz})$. For instance, measuring the signal in Fig. 9.3(a) around 0.1 Hz with a 1 mHz resolution bandwidth yields a mean-squared value of $1(\\mu \\mathrm{~V})^{2}$, which scales to $1,000\\left(\\mu \\mathrm{~V}^{2}\\right) / \\mathrm{Hz}$ for a 1-Hz bandwidth.\n\nAn intuitive explanation for measuring random noise signals with a spectrum analyzer is as follows. A random noise signal constantly shifts across a wide range of frequencies. A spectrum analyzer, however, is sensitive only to a narrow frequency range defined by its filter's passband, measuring the mean-squared value within this range. The analyzer's filter responds with a time constant approximately given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\tau \\approx \\frac{1}{\\pi \\mathrm{~W}} \\tag{9.18}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere W is the filter's bandwidth. Occasionally, the random signal matches the filter's frequency, allowing the analyzer to measure the signal's presence within that range. Narrower filter bandwidths result in less signal presence, thus lower analyzer output. However, if the signal is deterministic and centered at the filter's frequency, the reading is independent of the bandwidth.\n\nWhen dealing with filtered noise, it's often useful to plot the square root of the noise spectral density, resulting in $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{n}}(\\mathrm{f})$, as shown in Fig. $9.3(b)$.

With a noise spectral density of $10(\\mu \\mathrm{~V})^{2} / \\mathrm{Hz}$ at 100 Hz, a 30 Hz filter yields $30 \\mathrm{~Hz} \\times 10(\\mu \\mathrm{~V})^{2} / \\mathrm{Hz} = 300(\\mu \\mathrm{~V})^{2}$ (or an rms value of $\\sqrt{300} \\mu \\mathrm{~V}$).\n\nFor a 0.1 Hz bandwidth, the measured value is 10 times smaller than for a 1 Hz bandwidth, resulting in $1(\\mu \\mathrm{~V})^{2}$ (or an rms value of $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~V}$)."

    "text": "While periodic signals, like sinusoids, exhibit power at specific frequency points, random signals distribute their power across the entire frequency spectrum. For instance, if the time-domain signal in Fig. 9.1 is analyzed using a spectrum analyzer, the resultant spectrum might resemble that in Fig. 9.3(a). Note that the horizontal axis represents the standard frequency, but the vertical axis is measured in microvolts-squared per hertz. Essentially, the vertical axis quantifies the normalized noise power (mean-squared value) over a 1-Hz bandwidth at each frequency. For example, the reading at 100 Hz in Fig. 9.3(a) signifies that the normalized power between 99.5 Hz and 100.5 Hz is $10(\\mu \\mathrm{~V})^{2}$.\n\nConsequently, the noise spectral density, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{n}}^{2}(\\mathrm{f})$, or for current, $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{n}}^{2}(\\mathrm{f})$, is defined as the average normalized noise power within a 1-Hz bandwidth. The units for $V_{n}^{2}(\\mathrm{f})$ are volts-squared per hertz, and for $I_{n}^{2}(f)$, they are amps-squared per hertz. Additionally, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{n}}^{2}(\\mathrm{f})$ is a positive real-valued function.\n\nKey Point: The frequency-domain representation of a noise signal is its spectral density: the average normalized power measurable within a 1-Hz bandwidth.\n\nIt is crucial to highlight that the mean-squared value of a random noise signal at any single precise frequency is zero. In other words, the mean-squared value of the signal in Fig. 9.3(a) at 100 Hz is directly proportional to the bandwidth of the bandpass filter used for measurement. In a lab spectrum analyzer, the filter's bandwidth is controlled by the resolution-bandwidth setting. Thus, as the resolution bandwidth approaches zero, the mean-squared value also trends towards zero. Conversely, as the resolution bandwidth increases, so does the measured mean-squared value. Regardless, the measured mean-squared value should be normalized to what would be obtained for a 1-Hz bandwidth when the noise spectral density is expressed in units of $\\mathrm{V}^{2} /(\\mathrm{Hz})$. For instance, if the signal in Fig. 9.3(a) is measured around 0.1 Hz with a 1 mHz resolution bandwidth, the mean-squared value would be $1(\\mu \\mathrm{~V})^{2}$, which scales to $1,000\\left(\\mu \\mathrm{~V}^{2}\\right) / \\mathrm{Hz}$ for a 1-Hz bandwidth.\n\nAn intuitive explanation for measuring random noise signals with a spectrum analyzer is as follows. A random noise signal constantly shifts across a wide range of frequencies. A spectrum analyzer, however, is sensitive only to a narrow frequency band—the passband of its filter—and measures the mean-squared value within this range. The filter's reaction time is approximately given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\tau \\approx \\frac{1}{\\pi \\mathrm{~W}} \\tag{9.18}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere W is the filter's bandwidth. Occasionally, the random signal's frequency matches the analyzer's filter frequency. Thus, the analyzer effectively measures the proportion of time the random signal spends within its filter's frequency range. A narrower filter bandwidth results in a smaller percentage of time the signal is within this range, leading to a lower analyzer output. However, if the signal is deterministic and centered at the filter's frequency, the analyzer's reading is independent of the filter's bandwidth.\n\nWhen dealing with filtered noise, it is often practical to plot the square root of the noise spectral density, resulting in $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{n}}(\\mathrm{f})$, as shown in Fig. $9.3(b)$. This is referred to as the root spectral density, expressed in volts per root-hertz (i.e., $\\mathrm{V} / \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$). For current noise, the units are amps per root-hertz. Note that while the horizontal axis remains unchanged, the vertical axis incorporates a root-hertz factor.\n\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:The graph labeled \"(a)\" is a logarithmic plot of voltage spectral density in the frequency domain, depicting the mean-squared voltage spectral density, \\( V_n^2(f) \\).\n\n1. **Type of Graph and Function:**\n- A logarithmic plot showing the spectral density of a voltage signal.\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n- The horizontal axis is frequency in hertz (Hz), logarithmically scaled from 0.1 Hz to 1,000 Hz.\n- The vertical axis is spectral density in microvolts squared per hertz \\((\\mu V)^2/\\text{Hz}\\), logarithmically scaled from 1 to 1,000 \\((\\mu V)^2/\\text{Hz}\\).\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- The graph starts with high spectral density at low frequencies, around 1,000 \\((\\mu V)^2/\\text{Hz}\\), and decreases with increasing frequency.\n- The decrease is initially sharp, then more gradual, showing a consistent downward trend.\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The spectral density decreases significantly from low to high frequencies, indicating more noise power at lower frequencies.\n- The curve transitions smoothly without specific peaks or valleys.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- Annotated as \"Spectral density.\"\n- No specific numerical values highlighted, but clear logarithmic scales for both axes.\n\nimage_name:(b)\ndescription:The graph labeled (b) plots root spectral density, specifically voltage spectral density in the frequency domain, on a logarithmic scale.\n\n1. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n- **Horizontal Axis:** Frequency in Hertz (Hz), logarithmically scaled from 0.1 Hz to 1,000 Hz.\n- **Vertical Axis:** Root spectral density in microvolts per root Hertz (µV/√Hz), logarithmically scaled from 1.0 µV/√Hz to 31.6 µV/√Hz.\n\n2. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- Shows a decreasing trend in root spectral density with increasing frequency.\n- Starts at 31.6 µV/√Hz at 0.1 Hz and decreases steadily.\n\n3. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- Higher root spectral density at lower frequencies, decreasing as frequency rises.\n- Smooth downward curve without sharp cutoffs.\n\n4. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- Labeled \"Root spectral density.\"\n- No specific numerical annotations beyond axis labels.\n\nThis graph helps understand how the root spectral density of a voltage signal varies with frequency, highlighting the decrease in noise power per root Hertz as frequency increases.\n\nFig. 9.3 Example of voltage spectral density (frequency domain), for (a) spectral density, and (b) root spectral density.\n\nSince spectral density measures the mean-squared value over a 1-Hz bandwidth, the total mean-squared value can be obtained by integrating the spectral density across the entire frequency spectrum. Thus, the rms value of a noise signal can also be derived in the frequency domain using the relationship:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{n(r m s)}^{2}=\\int_{0}^{\\infty} V_{n}^{2}(f) d f \\tag{9.19}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nKey Point: The mean square value of a noise signal is the integral of its spectral density over all frequencies.\nSimilarly, for current noise,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{n(r m s)}^{2}=\\int_{0}^{\\infty} I_{n}^{2}(f) d f \\tag{9.20}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nMore generally, the rms noise within a specific frequency range is obtained by integrating the noise spectral density over that range. For example, the rms voltage noise over the range $f_{1}<f<f_{2}$ is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\int_{f_{1}}^{f_{1}} V_{n}^{2}(f) d f \\tag{9.21}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFinally, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{n}}^{2}(\\mathrm{f})$ is rigorously defined as the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function of the time-domain signal, $\\mathrm{v}_{\\mathrm{n}}(\\mathrm{t})$. This relationship is known as the Wiener-Khinchin theorem. This definition yields a one-sided spectral density function since the noise is integrated only over positive frequencies, mainly for historical reasons. A two-sided definition would divide the spectral density by two, as the spectral density is the same for positive and negative frequencies for real-valued signals, ensuring the total mean-squared value remains unchanged when integrated over both positive and negative frequencies.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 9.3\n\nWhat mean-squared value would be measured for the signal in Fig. 9.3 at 100 Hz using a 30 Hz resolution bandwidth on a spectrum analyzer? Also, determine the value for a 0.1 Hz resolution bandwidth.\n\n#### Solution\n\nSince the spectral density function is flat around 100 Hz, the measured value should be directly proportional to the bandwidth. Given the noise spectral density is $10(\\mu \\mathrm{~V})^{2} / \\mathrm{Hz}$ at 100 Hz, the output for a 30 Hz filter is $30 \\mathrm{~Hz} \\times 10(\\mu \\mathrm{~V})^{2} / \\mathrm{Hz} = 300(\\mu \\mathrm{~V})^{2}$ (or an rms value of $\\sqrt{300} \\mu \\mathrm{~V}$).\n\nFor a 0.1 Hz bandwidth, the measured value would be ten times less than for a 1 Hz bandwidth, resulting in $1(\\mu \\mathrm{~V})^{2}$ (or an rms value of $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~V}$)."

Each filter shapes the root spectral density of its respective noise source, and the summing junction aggregates these contributions to produce the total output noise. This process is essential for understanding noise control and manipulation in signal processing applications.\n\nFig. 9.7 Filtered uncorrelated noise sources contributing to total output noise.\n\nKey Point: Passing a noise signal through a circuit shapes its root spectral density by the circuit's magnitude response.\n\nKey Point: Uncorrelated noise signals remain uncorrelated even when filtered by a circuit's magnitude response.\n\nThe relationship in (9.28) should be intuitively clear, as it indicates that the transfer function merely shapes the root spectral density of the input noise signal. It is important to note that the root spectral density is shaped by $|A(j 2 \\pi f)|$, whereas the spectral density is shaped by $|\\mathrm{A}(\\mathrm{j} 2 \\pi \\mathrm{f})|^{2}$, as seen in (9.26). Hence, dealing with root spectral densities simplifies transfer function analysis, avoiding the need for squared terms required when dealing with spectral densities.\n\nIt is also interesting to consider the case of multiple uncorrelated noise sources that are each filtered and then summed. For instance, in the system shown in Fig. 9.7, three filtered, uncorrelated noise sources combine to form the total output noise, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {no }}(\\mathrm{f})$. In this scenario, if the input random signals are uncorrelated, the filter outputs remain uncorrelated. Consequently, the output spectral density is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{n o}^{2}(f)=\\sum_{i=1,2,3}\\left|A_{i}(j 2 \\pi f)\\right|^{2} V_{n i}^{2}(f) \\tag{9.29}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n#### EXAMPLE 9.5\n\nConsider a noise signal, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{ni}}(\\mathrm{f})$, with a white root spectral density of $20 \\mathrm{nV} / \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$, as shown in Fig. 9.8(a). Determine the total noise rms value between dc and 100 kHz. What is the total noise rms value if it is filtered by the RC filter shown in Fig. 9.8(b), assuming the RC filter is noise-free?\n\n#### Solution\n\nFor the noise mean-square value from dc to 100 kHz of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{ni}}(\\mathrm{f})$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{n i(r m s)}^{2}=\\int_{0}^{10^{5}} 20^{2} \\mathrm{df}=4 \\times 10^{7}(\\mathrm{nV})^{2} \\tag{9.30}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nresulting in an rms value of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {ni(rms) }}=6.3 \\mu \\mathrm{~V}$ rms. Note that, for this simple case, the rms value can also be obtained by multiplying $20 \\mathrm{nV} / \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$ by the square root of the frequency span, $\\sqrt{100 \\mathrm{kHz}}$, yielding $6.3 \\mu \\mathrm{~V}$ rms.\n\nFor the filtered signal, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{no}}(\\mathrm{f})$, the RC filter has the frequency response shown in Fig. 9.8(c). Therefore, we can multiply the root spectral density of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {ni }}(\\mathrm{f})$ by the frequency response, $|A(j 2 \\pi f)|$, to obtain the root spectral density of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {no }}(\\mathrm{f})$, as shown in Fig. 9.8(d).

These filters, characterized by their respective transfer functions \\(A_i(s)\\), modify the spectral density of the input noise signals.\n- **Summing Junction**: The outputs of the filters are combined at a summing junction to calculate the total output noise \\(V_{no}(f)\\).\n\n2. **Flow of Information or Control:**\n- Each noise source \\(V_{ni}(f)\\) is individually processed by its corresponding filter \\(A_i(s)\\), which adjusts the magnitude response of the noise signal.\n- The filtered signals are then directed to a summing junction, where they are combined to form the total output noise \\(V_{no}(f)\\).\n- The information flow is linear, moving from the noise sources through the filters to the summing junction.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n- The diagram includes mathematical expressions indicating the relationship between the input noise signals and the output noise. The total output noise \\(V_{no}(f)\\) is given by the equation:\n\\[\nV_{no}(f) = \\left( \\sum_{i=1,2,3} |A_i(j2\\pi f)|^2 V_{ni}^2(f) \\right)^{1/2}\n\\]\n- This equation highlights how the magnitude of each transfer function \\(|A_i(j2\\pi f)|\\) affects the contribution of each noise source to the total output noise.\n\n4. **Overall System Function:**\n- The primary function of this system is to demonstrate how uncorrelated noise sources, when filtered through different transfer functions, contribute to the overall noise output. Each filter shapes the root spectral density of its respective noise source, and the summing junction aggregates these contributions to produce the total output noise. This process is essential in understanding how noise characteristics are controlled and manipulated in signal processing applications.\n\nFig. 9.7 Filtered uncorrelated noise sources contributing to total output noise.\n\nKey Point: Passing a noise signal through a circuit shapes its root spectral density by the circuit's magnitude response.\n\nKey Point: Uncorrelated noise signals remain uncorrelated, even when filtered by a circuit's magnitude response.\n\nThe relationship in (9.28) should make intuitive sense, as it indicates that the transfer function merely shapes the root spectral density of the input noise signal. It is important to note that the root spectral density is shaped by $|A(j 2 \\pi f)|$, while the spectral density is shaped by $|\\mathrm{A}(\\mathrm{j} 2 \\pi \\mathrm{f})|^{2}$, as seen in (9.26). Hence, dealing with root spectral densities simplifies transfer function analysis, avoiding the need for squared terms required when dealing with spectral densities.\n\nIt is also interesting to consider the case of multiple uncorrelated noise sources that are each filtered and then summed. For instance, consider the system shown in Fig. 9.7, where three filtered, uncorrelated noise sources combine to form the total output noise, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {no }}(\\mathrm{f})$. In this case, if the input random signals are uncorrelated, the filter outputs remain uncorrelated. Consequently, the output spectral density is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{n o}^{2}(f)=\\sum_{i=1,2,3}\\left|A_{i}(j 2 \\pi f)\\right|^{2} V_{n i}^{2}(f) \\tag{9.29}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n#### EXAMPLE 9.5\n\nConsider a noise signal, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{ni}}(\\mathrm{f})$, with a white root spectral density of $20 \\mathrm{nV} / \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$, as shown in Fig. 9.8(a). Determine the total noise rms value between dc and 100 kHz. What is the total noise rms value if it is filtered by the RC filter shown in Fig. 9.8(b), assuming the RC filter is noise-free?\n\n#### Solution\n\nFor the noise mean-square value from dc to 100 kHz of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{ni}}(\\mathrm{f})$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{n i(r m s)}^{2}=\\int_{0}^{10^{5}} 20^{2} \\mathrm{df}=4 \\times 10^{7}(\\mathrm{nV})^{2} \\tag{9.30}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nresulting in an rms value of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {ni(rms) }}=6.3 \\mu \\mathrm{~V}$ rms.

Therefore, we can multiply the root spectral density of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {ni }}(\\mathrm{f})$ by the frequency response, $|A(j 2 \\pi f)|$, to obtain the root spectral density of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {no }}(\\mathrm{f})$, as shown in Fig. 9.8(d).

These represent different noise signals with unique spectral characteristics.\n- **Filters (Transfer Functions):** Each noise source is passed through a filter, represented by blocks labeled \\(A_1(s)\\), \\(A_2(s)\\), and \\(A_3(s)\\). These filters are characterized by their respective transfer functions, \\(A_i(s)\\), which modify the spectral density of the input noise signals.\n- **Summing Junction:** The outputs of the filters are combined at a summing junction, which calculates the total output noise \\(V_{no}(f)\\).\n\n2. **Flow of Information or Control:**\n- Each noise source \\(V_{ni}(f)\\) is individually processed by its corresponding filter \\(A_i(s)\\), which adjusts the magnitude response of the noise signal.\n- The filtered signals are then directed to a summing junction, where they are combined to form the total output noise \\(V_{no}(f)\\).\n- The information flow is linear, moving from the noise sources through the filters to the summing junction.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n- The diagram includes mathematical expressions indicating the relationship between the input noise signals and the output noise. The total output noise \\(V_{no}(f)\\) is given by the equation:\n\\[\nV_{no}(f) = \\left( \\sum_{i=1,2,3} |A_i(j2\\pi f)|^2 V_{ni}^2(f) \\right)^{1/2}\n\\]\n- This equation highlights how the magnitude of each transfer function \\(|A_i(j2\\pi f)|\\) affects the contribution of each noise source to the total output noise.\n\n4. **Overall System Function:**\n- The primary function of this system is to demonstrate how uncorrelated noise sources, when filtered through different transfer functions, contribute to the overall noise output. Each filter shapes the root spectral density of its respective noise source, and the summing junction aggregates these contributions to produce the total output noise. This process is essential in understanding how noise characteristics are controlled and manipulated in signal processing applications.\n\nFig. 9.7 Filtered uncorrelated noise sources contributing to total output noise.\n\nKey Point: Passing a noise signal through a circuit shapes its root spectral density by the circuit's magnitude response.\n\nKey Point: Uncorrelated noise signals remain uncorrelated, even when filtered by a circuit's magnitude response.\n\nThe relationship in (9.28) should make intuitive sense, as it indicates that the transfer function merely shapes the root spectral density of the input noise signal. It is important to note that the root spectral density is shaped by $|A(j 2 \\pi f)|$, whereas the spectral density is shaped by $|\\mathrm{A}(\\mathrm{j} 2 \\pi \\mathrm{f})|^{2}$, as seen in (9.26). Hence, we see the advantage in dealing with root spectral densities rather than spectral densities. Specifically, straightforward transfer function analysis is applied when using root spectral densities, whereas squared terms are required for spectral densities.\n\nIt is also of interest to consider the case of multiple uncorrelated noise sources that are each filtered and summed together. For instance, consider the system shown in Fig. 9.7, where three filtered, uncorrelated noise sources combine to form the total output noise, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {no }}(\\mathrm{f})$. In this case, it can be shown that if the input random signals are uncorrelated, the filter outputs are also uncorrelated. Consequently, the output spectral density is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{n o}^{2}(f)=\\sum_{i=1,2,3}\\left|A_{i}(j 2 \\pi f)\\right|^{2} V_{n i}^{2}(f) \\tag{9.29}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n#### EXAMPLE 9.5\n\nConsider a noise signal, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{ni}}(\\mathrm{f})$, with a white root spectral density of $20 \\mathrm{nV} / \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$, as shown in Fig. 9.8(a). Determine the total noise rms value between dc and 100 kHz. What is the total noise rms value if it is filtered by the RC filter shown in Fig. 9.8(b), assuming the RC filter is noise-free?\n\n#### Solution\n\nFor the noise mean-square value from dc to 100 kHz of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{ni}}(\\mathrm{f})$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{n i(r m s)}^{2}=\\int_{0}^{10^{5}} 20^{2} \\mathrm{df}=4 \\times 10^{7}(\\mathrm{nV})^{2} \\tag{9.30}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nresulting in an rms value of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {ni(rms) }}=6.3 \\mu \\mathrm{~V}$ rms. Note that, for this simple case, the rms value can also be obtained by multiplying $20 \\mathrm{nV} / \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$ by the square root of the frequency span, or $\\sqrt{100 \\mathrm{kHz}}$, resulting in $6.3 \\mu \\mathrm{~V}$ rms.\n\nFor the filtered signal, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{no}}(\\mathrm{f})$, we find that the RC filter has the frequency response shown in Fig. 9.8(c). Therefore, we can multiply the root spectral density of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {ni }}(\\mathrm{f})$ by the frequency response, $|A(j 2 \\pi f)|$, to obtain the root spectral density of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {no }}(\\mathrm{f})$, as shown in Fig. 9.8(d).

Each filter shapes the root spectral density of its respective noise source, and the summing junction aggregates these contributions to produce the total output noise. This process is essential for understanding noise control and manipulation in signal processing applications.\n\nFig. 9.7 Filtered uncorrelated noise sources contributing to total output noise.\n\nKey Point: Passing a noise signal through a circuit shapes its root spectral density by the circuit's magnitude response.\n\nKey Point: Uncorrelated noise signals remain uncorrelated even when filtered by a circuit's magnitude response.\n\nThe relationship in (9.28) should intuitively make sense as it indicates that the transfer function merely shapes the root spectral density of the input noise signal. It is important to note that the root spectral density is shaped by $|A(j 2 \\pi f)|$, whereas the spectral density is shaped by $|\\mathrm{A}(\\mathrm{j} 2 \\pi \\mathrm{f})|^{2}$, as seen in (9.26). Hence, dealing with root spectral densities simplifies transfer function analysis, avoiding squared terms required for spectral densities.\n\nIt is also interesting to consider multiple uncorrelated noise sources that are each filtered and summed. For instance, in the system shown in Fig. 9.7, three filtered, uncorrelated noise sources combine to form the total output noise, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {no }}(\\mathrm{f})$. In this case, if the input random signals are uncorrelated, the filter outputs remain uncorrelated. Consequently, the output spectral density is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{n o}^{2}(f)=\\sum_{i=1,2,3}\\left|A_{i}(j 2 \\pi f)\\right|^{2} V_{n i}^{2}(f) \\tag{9.29}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n#### EXAMPLE 9.5\n\nConsider a noise signal, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{ni}}(\\mathrm{f})$, with a white root spectral density of $20 \\mathrm{nV} / \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$, as shown in Fig. 9.8(a).

These filters, characterized by their respective transfer functions \\(A_i(s)\\), modify the spectral density of the input noise signals.\n- **Summing Junction**: The outputs of the filters are combined at a summing junction to calculate the total output noise \\(V_{no}(f)\\).\n\n2. **Information and Control Flow**:\n- Each noise source \\(V_{ni}(f)\\) is individually processed by its corresponding filter \\(A_i(s)\\), which adjusts the magnitude response of the noise signal.\n- The filtered signals are then directed to a summing junction, where they are combined to form the total output noise \\(V_{no}(f)\\).\n- The flow of information is linear, moving from the noise sources through the filters to the summing junction.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators**:\n- The diagram includes mathematical expressions showing the relationship between the input noise signals and the output noise.

Each filter shapes the root spectral density of its respective noise source, and the summing junction aggregates these contributions to produce the total output noise. This process is essential for understanding noise control and manipulation in signal processing applications.\n\nFig. 9.7 Filtered uncorrelated noise sources contributing to total output noise.\n\nKey Point: Passing a noise signal through a circuit shapes its root spectral density by the circuit's magnitude response.\n\nKey Point: Uncorrelated noise signals remain uncorrelated even when filtered by a circuit's magnitude response.\n\nThe relationship in (9.28) should be intuitively clear, as it indicates that the transfer function merely shapes the root spectral density of the input noise signal. It is important to note that the root spectral density is shaped by $|A(j 2 \\pi f)|$, while the spectral density is shaped by $|\\mathrm{A}(\\mathrm{j} 2 \\pi \\mathrm{f})|^{2}$, as seen in (9.26). Hence, dealing with root spectral densities simplifies transfer function analysis, avoiding the need for squared terms required with spectral densities.\n\nIt is also interesting to consider multiple uncorrelated noise sources that are each filtered and then summed. For instance, in the system shown in Fig. 9.7, three filtered, uncorrelated noise sources combine to form the total output noise, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {no }}(\\mathrm{f})$. In this case, if the input random signals are uncorrelated, the filter outputs remain uncorrelated. Consequently, the output spectral density is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{n o}^{2}(f)=\\sum_{i=1,2,3}\\left|A_{i}(j 2 \\pi f)\\right|^{2} V_{n i}^{2}(f) \\tag{9.29}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n#### EXAMPLE 9.5\n\nConsider a noise signal, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{ni}}(\\mathrm{f})$, with a white root spectral density of $20 \\mathrm{nV} / \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$, as shown in Fig. 9.8(a).

Consequently, from (9.26), the total output mean-squared value is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {no }(\\mathrm{rms})}^{2}=\\int_{0}^{\\infty}|\\mathrm{A}(\\mathrm{j} 2 \\pi \\mathrm{f})|^{2} V_{\\mathrm{ni}}^{2}(\\mathrm{f}) \\mathrm{df} \\tag{9.27}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIf we opt to work with root spectral densities, we can take the square root of both sides of (9.26), resulting in\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{n o}(f)=|A(j 2 \\pi f)| V_{n i}(f) \\tag{9.28}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n**Fig. 9.6 Description:**\nThe system block diagram in Fig. 9.6 illustrates the application of a transfer function to a noise signal. It comprises the following main components:\n\n1. **Input Noise Signal**: The system input is denoted as $V_{ni}^2(f)$, representing the power spectral density of the input noise signal.\n\n2. **Transfer Function Block**: The core element is a block labeled $A(s)$, representing the system's transfer function or filter, which processes the input noise signal.\n\n3. **Output Noise Signal**: The output from the transfer function block is denoted as $V_{no}^2(f)$ and $V_{no}(f)$, representing the power spectral density and root spectral density of the output noise signal, respectively.\n\n**Information Flow**:\n- The input noise signal $V_{ni}^2(f)$ enters the transfer function block $A(s)$.\n- The transfer function modifies the input signal, shaping its spectral density according to its magnitude response.\n- The output from the block is a transformed noise signal $V_{no}^2(f) = |A(j2\\pi f)|^2 V_{ni}^2(f)$ and $V_{no}(f) = |A(j2\\pi f)| V_{ni}(f)$, indicating how the noise is altered by the filter.\n\n**Labels and Annotations**:\n- The diagram clearly labels the input and output signals with their respective spectral density expressions.\n- The transfer function $A(s)$ is central to the diagram, emphasizing its role in shaping the noise signal.\n\n**Overall System Function**:\nThe primary function of this system is to filter or shape the input noise signal's spectral density using a transfer function. The system demonstrates how the magnitude response of the transfer function affects the output noise signal, which is crucial in applications requiring noise characteristic control or modification, such as in signal processing and communication systems.\n\n**Fig. 9.6**: Applying a transfer function (i.e., filter) to a noise signal.\n\n**Fig. 9.7 Description**:\nThe system block diagram titled \"Fig. 9.7 Filtered uncorrelated noise sources contributing to total output noise\" illustrates the process of filtering multiple uncorrelated noise sources and their contribution to the total output noise.\n\n1. **Main Components**:\n- **Uncorrelated Noise Sources**: Three distinct noise sources, labeled $V_{n1}(f)$, $V_{n2}(f)$, and $V_{n3}(f)$, serve as the system inputs, each with different spectral characteristics.\n- **Filters (Transfer Functions)**: Each noise source is passed through a filter represented by blocks labeled $A_1(s)$, $A_2(s)$, and $A_3(s)$, characterized by their respective transfer functions $A_i(s)$, which modify the spectral density of the input noise signals.\n- **Summing Junction**: The filtered signals are combined at a summing junction to calculate the total output noise $V_{no}(f)$.\n\n2. **Flow of Information or Control**:\n- Each noise source $V_{ni}(f)$ is individually processed by its corresponding filter $A_i(s)$, adjusting the magnitude response of the noise signal.\n- The filtered signals are then summed at the summing junction to form the total output noise $V_{no}(f)$.\n- The information flow is linear, moving from the noise sources through the filters to the summing junction.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators**:\n- The diagram includes mathematical expressions indicating the relationship between the input noise signals and the output noise. The total output noise $V_{no}(f)$ is given by:\n\\[\nV_{no}(f) = \\left( \\sum_{i=1,2,3} |A_i(j2\\pi f)|^2 V_{ni}^2(f) \\right)^{1/2}\n\\]\n- This equation highlights how the magnitude of each transfer function $|A_i(j2\\pi f)|$ affects the contribution of each noise source to the total output noise.\n\n4. **Overall System Function**:\n- The primary function of this system is to demonstrate how uncorrelated noise sources, when filtered through different transfer functions, contribute to the overall noise output. Each filter shapes the root spectral density of its respective noise source, and the summing junction aggregates these contributions to produce the total output noise. This process is essential for understanding noise characteristic control and manipulation in signal processing applications.\n\n**Fig. 9.7**: Filtered uncorrelated noise sources contributing to total output noise.\n\n**Key Points**:\n- Passing a noise signal through a circuit shapes its root spectral density by the circuit's magnitude response.\n- Uncorrelated noise signals remain uncorrelated even when filtered by a circuit's magnitude response.\n\nThe relationship in (9.28) should intuitively make sense as it indicates that the transfer function merely shapes the root spectral density of the input noise signal. It is important to note that the root spectral density is shaped by $|A(j 2 \\pi f)|$, whereas the spectral density is shaped by $|\\mathrm{A}(\\mathrm{j} 2 \\pi \\mathrm{f})|^{2}$, as seen in (9.26). Thus, dealing with root spectral densities simplifies transfer function analysis, avoiding the need for squared terms required when dealing with spectral densities.\n\nIt is also interesting to consider multiple uncorrelated noise sources that are each filtered and summed. For instance, in the system shown in Fig. 9.7, three filtered, uncorrelated noise sources combine to form the total output noise, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {no }}(\\mathrm{f})$. In this case, if the input random signals are uncorrelated, the filter outputs remain uncorrelated. Consequently, the output spectral density is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{n o}^{2}(f)=\\sum_{i=1,2,3}\\left|A_{i}(j 2 \\pi f)\\right|^{2} V_{n i}^{2}(f) \\tag{9.29}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n#### EXAMPLE 9.5\n\nConsider a noise signal, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{ni}}(\\mathrm{f})$, with a white root spectral density of $20 \\mathrm{nV} / \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$, as shown in Fig. 9.8(a). Determine the total noise rms value between dc and 100 kHz. What is the total noise rms value if it is filtered by the RC filter shown in Fig. 9.8(b), assuming the RC filter is noise-free?\n\n#### Solution\n\nFor the noise mean-square value from dc to 100 kHz of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{ni}}(\\mathrm{f})$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{n i(r m s)}^{2}=\\int_{0}^{10^{5}} 20^{2} \\mathrm{df}=4 \\times 10^{7}(\\mathrm{nV})^{2} \\tag{9.30}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nresulting in an rms value of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {ni(rms) }}=6.3 \\mu \\mathrm{~V}$ rms. Note that for this simple case, the rms value can also be obtained by multiplying $20 \\mathrm{nV} / \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$ by the square root of the frequency span, $\\sqrt{100 \\mathrm{kHz}}$, yielding $6.3 \\mu \\mathrm{~V}$ rms.\n\nFor the filtered signal, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{no}}(\\mathrm{f})$, the RC filter has the frequency response shown in Fig. 9.8(c). Therefore, we can multiply the root spectral density of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {ni }}(\\mathrm{f})$ by the frequency response, $|A(j 2 \\pi f)|$, to obtain the root spectral density of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {no }}(\\mathrm{f})$, as shown in Fig. 9.8(d). Mathematically, the output root spectral density is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{n o}(f)=\\frac{20 \\times 10^{-9}}{\\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{f}}{\\mathrm{f}_{0}}\\right)^{2}}} \\tag{9.31}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n**Fig. 9.8(a) Description**:\nThe graph labeled (a) is a spectral density plot for $V_{ni}(f)$. It is a frequency-domain graph showing the root spectral density of the input voltage noise.\n\n1. **Axes Labels and Units**:\n- The vertical axis is labeled $V_{ni}(f)$ and is measured in nanovolts per square root hertz (nV/√Hz).\n- The horizontal axis represents frequency ($f$) in hertz (Hz) on a logarithmic scale, with markers at 1, 10, 100, 10³, and 10⁴ Hz.\n\n2. **Overall Behavior and Trends**:\n- The graph shows a constant value of 20 nV/√Hz across the entire frequency range from 1 Hz to 10⁴ Hz, indicating that the input voltage noise spectral density is frequency-independent, suggesting white noise.\n\n3. **Key Features and Technical Details**:\n- The spectral density remains flat at 20 nV/√Hz, with no peaks, valleys, or inflection points throughout the observed frequency range.\n- There are no annotations or specific data points marked on the graph, as the value is constant.\n\n4. **Annotations and Specific Data Points**:\n- No additional annotations or reference lines are present in this graph. The constant level of 20 nV/√Hz is the key feature.\n\n**Fig. 9.8(b) Description**:\nThis is an RC low-pass filter circuit, where the resistor R and capacitor C form a network to filter the input noise voltage $V_{ni}(f)$, resulting in an output noise voltage $V_{no}(f)$.

Note that the noise rms value of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {no }}(\\mathrm{f})$ is almost $1 / 10$ that of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{ni}}(\\mathrm{f})$ since high-frequency noise above 1 kHz was filtered. The lesson here is that circuit design should avoid larger bandwidths than necessary for the signal, as excess bandwidth can degrade noise performance."

    "text": "While simulation and computer techniques can precisely analyze circuits or systems, depending on their modeling accuracy, it is often useful to make approximations during the initial design stages. These approximations are particularly helpful in noise analysis, where significant inaccuracies naturally occur due to factors like unknown parasitic effects and incomplete noise models. One common approximation involves estimating total noise by integrating over frequency, assuming piecewise-linear Bode diagrams are accurate. This simplifies integration formulas, as one only needs to integrate under linear functions and sum the results. The following example illustrates this method.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 9.6\n\nConsider an input noise signal, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{ni}}(\\mathrm{f})$, applied to the amplifier $\\mathrm{A}(\\mathrm{s})$, as depicted in Fig. 9.10. Determine the output noise rms value, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{n}}$, for frequencies above 1 Hz.\n\n#### Solution\n\nAs shown, the output root spectral density, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {no }}(\\mathrm{f})$, is derived by combining the Bode diagrams for $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{ni}}(\\mathrm{f})$ and $A(s)$. To perform piecewise integration of $V_{n o}(f)$, the frequency range is divided into four regions, $N_{1}$ through $\\mathrm{N}_{4}$.\n\nFor region $\\mathrm{N}_{1}$, the total mean-square noise is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nN_{1}^{2}=\\int_{1}^{100} \\frac{200^{2}}{f} \\mathrm{df}=\\left.200^{2} \\ln (f)\\right|_{1} ^{100}=1.84 \\times 10^{5}(\\mathrm{nV})^{2} \\tag{9.42}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn region $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$, we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{N}_{2}^{2}=\\int_{100}^{10^{3}} 20^{2} \\mathrm{df}=\\left.20^{2} \\mathrm{f}\\right|_{100} ^{10^{3}}=3.6 \\times 10^{5}(\\mathrm{nV})^{2} \\tag{9.43}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe system block diagram titled \"A(s)\" illustrates an amplifier system processing an input noise signal \\( V_{ni}(f) \\) to produce an output noise signal \\( V_{no}(f) \\). It comprises three main components: the input noise spectrum, the amplifier gain, and the output noise spectrum, each plotted against frequency.\n\n1. **Main Components:**\n- **Input Noise Spectrum (\\( V_{ni}(f) \\))**: The top graph shows the root spectral density of the input noise in \\( \\text{nV}/\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}} \\) from 1 Hz to 10 MHz. The noise decreases from 200 \\( \\text{nV}/\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}} \\) at low frequencies to 20 \\( \\text{nV}/\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}} \\) and remains constant up to 10 kHz.\n- **Amplifier Gain (|A(j2\\pi f)|)**: The middle graph depicts the amplifier's frequency response in decibels (dB). The gain is flat at 0 dB up to 1 kHz, rises to 20 dB between 1 kHz and 10 kHz, and then decreases.\n- **Output Noise Spectrum (\\( V_{no}(f) \\))**: The bottom graph shows the root spectral density of the output noise, reflecting the input noise modified by the amplifier's gain.\n\n2. **Flow of Information or Control:**\n- The input noise \\( V_{ni}(f) \\) is processed by the amplifier \\( A(s) \\), which alters the noise based on its frequency response.\n- The resulting output noise \\( V_{no}(f) \\) shows the effects of this amplification across different frequency ranges.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n- The frequency axis is logarithmically scaled from 1 Hz to 10 MHz.\n- Regions \\( N_1, N_2, N_3, \\) and \\( N_4 \\) are marked, indicating different noise characteristics and amplifier responses.\n- A dotted line labeled \"1/f curve\" on the output noise graph shows expected noise behavior beyond the amplifier's bandwidth.\n\n4. **Overall System Function:**\n- The system amplifies noise, with the input noise modified by the amplifier's frequency response. The amplifier selectively boosts or attenuates noise at different frequencies, resulting in an output noise spectrum that reflects these changes. Regions \\( N_1, N_2, N_3, \\) and \\( N_4 \\) highlight how noise characteristics vary across frequency bands, influenced by the amplifier's gain.\n\nThe graph labeled \"V_{ni}(f)\" plots the input noise voltage spectral density against frequency, using a Bode plot format.\n\n1. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n- The x-axis represents frequency in Hertz (Hz) on a logarithmic scale from 1 Hz to 10^7 Hz.\n- The y-axis shows noise voltage spectral density in nanovolts per square root Hertz (nV/√Hz) on a logarithmic scale from 2 nV/√Hz to 200 nV/√Hz.\n\n2. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- The plot starts at 200 nV/√Hz at 1 Hz and decreases to a plateau.\n- From 1 Hz to 100 Hz, the spectral density decreases sharply.\n- Between 100 Hz and 10^3 Hz, it remains constant.\n- Beyond this, the spectral density stays constant until about 10^4 Hz.\n\n3. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The initial decline follows a 1/f noise pattern typical at low frequencies.\n- Flat regions indicate white noise characteristics.\n- No significant peaks or valleys are present beyond the initial decline.\n\n4. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- The graph is divided into regions N1, N2, N3, and N4, corresponding to different noise characteristics.\n- Transition between regions is smooth.\n\nThis plot helps understand input noise voltage variations across frequencies, crucial for analyzing amplifier and electronic system performance.\n\nThe provided Bode plot analyzes the frequency response of a system, consisting of three main plots:\n\n1. **Top Plot - Input Noise Voltage Density (Vni(f))**:\n- **Type**: Logarithmic plot.\n- **Axes**:\n  - X-axis: Frequency in Hertz (Hz), logarithmic scale from 1 Hz to 10^7 Hz.\n  - Y-axis: Input noise voltage density \\( V_{ni}(f) \\) in nanovolts per square root Hertz \\( \\frac{nV}{\\sqrt{Hz}} \\).\n- **Behavior**: Starts at 200 nV/√Hz at 1 Hz, decreases to 20 nV/√Hz at 100 Hz, and remains constant up to 10^7 Hz.\n\n2. **Middle Plot -

    "text": "While simulation and computer techniques can precisely analyze circuits or systems, depending on their modeling accuracy, it is often useful to make approximations during the initial design stages. These approximations are particularly valuable in noise analysis, where significant inaccuracies naturally arise due to factors like unknown parasitic effects and incomplete noise models. One common approximation involves estimating total noise by integrating over frequency, assuming that piecewise-linear Bode diagrams are accurate. This simplifies integration formulas, as one only needs to integrate under linear functions and sum the resulting parts. The following example illustrates this method.\n\n#### EXAMPLE 9.6\n\nConsider an input noise signal, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{ni}}(\\mathrm{f})$, applied to the amplifier $\\mathrm{A}(\\mathrm{s})$, as depicted in Fig. 9.10. Determine the output noise rms value, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{n}}$, for frequencies above 1 Hz.\n\n#### Solution\n\nAs shown, the output root spectral density, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{no}}(\\mathrm{f})$, is derived by combining the Bode diagrams for $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{ni}}(\\mathrm{f})$ and $A(s)$. To perform piecewise integration of $V_{\\text{no}}(f)$, the frequency range is divided into four regions, $N_{1}$ through $N_{4}$.\n\nFor region $N_{1}$, the total mean-square noise is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nN_{1}^{2}=\\int_{1}^{100} \\frac{200^{2}}{f} \\mathrm{df}=\\left.200^{2} \\ln (f)\\right|_{1} ^{100}=1.84 \\times 10^{5}(\\mathrm{nV})^{2} \\tag{9.42}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn region $N_{2}$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nN_{2}^{2}=\\int_{100}^{10^{3}} 20^{2} \\mathrm{df}=\\left.20^{2} \\mathrm{f}\\right|_{100} ^{10^{3}}=3.6 \\times 10^{5}(\\mathrm{nV})^{2} \\tag{9.43}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe system block diagram titled \"A(s)\" represents an amplifier system that processes an input noise signal \\( V_{ni}(f) \\) to produce an output noise signal \\( V_{no}(f) \\). The diagram comprises three main components: the input noise spectrum, the amplifier gain, and the output noise spectrum, each plotted against frequency.\n\n1. **Main Components:**\n- **Input Noise Spectrum (\\( V_{ni}(f) \\))**: The top graph shows the root spectral density of the input noise in \\( \\text{nV}/\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}} \\) from 1 Hz to 10 MHz. The noise decreases from 200 \\( \\text{nV}/\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}} \\) at low frequencies to 20 \\( \\text{nV}/\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}} \\) and remains constant up to 10 kHz.\n- **Amplifier Gain (|A(j2\\pi f)|)**: The middle graph depicts the amplifier's frequency response in decibels (dB). The gain is flat at 0 dB up to 1 kHz, rises to 20 dB between 1 kHz and 10 kHz, and then decreases.\n- **Output Noise Spectrum (\\( V_{no}(f) \\))**: The bottom graph shows the root spectral density of the output noise, reflecting the input noise modified by the amplifier's gain characteristics.\n\n2. **Flow of Information or Control:**\n- The input noise \\( V_{ni}(f) \\) is processed by the amplifier block \\( A(s) \\), which alters the noise based on its frequency response.\n- The resulting output noise \\( V_{no}(f) \\) reflects these modifications across different frequency ranges.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n- The frequency axis is logarithmically scaled from 1 Hz to 10 MHz.\n- Regions \\( N_1, N_2, N_3, \\) and \\( N_4 \\) are marked on the frequency axis, indicating different noise characteristics and amplifier responses.\n- A dotted line labeled \"1/f curve\" on the output noise graph shows the expected noise behavior beyond the amplifier's bandwidth.\n\n4. **Overall System Function:**\n- The system acts as a noise amplifier, modifying the input noise based on the amplifier's frequency response. The amplifier selectively boosts or attenuates the noise at different frequencies, resulting in an output noise spectrum that reflects these changes. The regions \\( N_1, N_2, N_3, \\) and \\( N_4 \\) highlight how noise characteristics vary across frequency bands, with the amplifier's gain significantly shaping the output noise profile.\n\nThe graph labeled \"V_{ni}(f)\" plots the input noise voltage spectral density against frequency. This Bode plot represents the frequency response of systems.\n\n1. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n- The x-axis is frequency in Hertz (Hz), plotted logarithmically from 1 Hz to 10^7 Hz.\n- The y-axis is the noise voltage spectral density in nanovolts per square root Hertz (nV/√Hz), also on a logarithmic scale, ranging from 2 nV/√Hz to 200 nV/√Hz.\n\n2. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- The plot starts at 200 nV/√Hz at 1 Hz and decreases, reaching a plateau.\n- From 1 Hz to 100 Hz, the spectral density decreases sharply.\n- Between 100 Hz and 10^3 Hz, the plot shows a flat region, indicating constant spectral density.\n- Beyond this, the spectral density remains constant until about 10^4 Hz.\n\n3. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The initial decline follows a 1/f noise characteristic, typical at low frequencies.\n- The flat regions indicate white noise characteristics.\n- There are no significant peaks or valleys beyond the initial decline.\n\n4. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- The graph is divided into regions labeled N1, N2, N3, and N4, corresponding to different noise characteristics.\n- The transition between regions is smooth, with no abrupt changes in slope.\n\nThis plot helps understand how input noise voltage varies across different frequency ranges, crucial for analyzing amplifier performance and electronic system noise behavior.\n\nThe provided graph, a Bode plot, analyzes the frequency response of a system with three main plots:\n\n1. **Top Plot -

    "text": "The principle of the $1 / f$ noise tangent is as follows: To identify the frequency region or regions that predominantly contribute to the noise, a 1/f noise line is lowered until it intersects the spectral density curve—the total noise can be estimated by the noise near the 1/f line [Kennedy, 1988; Franco, 2002]. For instance, lowering a $1 / \\mathrm{f}$ line towards the root spectral density of $V_{n o}(\\mathrm{f})$ in Fig. 9.10 shows that the noise around $10^{5}$ is dominant. This rule's effectiveness lies in the fact that a curve proportional to $1 / \\mathrm{x}$ yields equal power across each frequency decade. Thus, lowering this constant power/frequency curve causes the highest power contribution to contact it first. However, caution is needed when integrating $1 / x$, as it tends to infinity if the upper bound is infinity or the lower bound is zero, particularly when the spectral density curve parallels a $1 / \\mathrm{f}$ tangent line over a significant frequency range. For example, in Fig. 9.10, the region $\\mathrm{N}_{1}$ parallels the $1 / \\mathrm{f}$ tangent line but contributes minimal noise since the integration was limited to frequencies above 1 Hz. If a much lower frequency bound is applied, this region could also contribute significantly to the noise power. \n\nKey Point: To ascertain the frequency region or regions contributing the dominant noise, lower a 1/f noise line until it meets the spectral density curve.

    "text": "The primary noise sources for active MOSFET transistors are flicker and thermal noise, as depicted in Fig. 9.11. Flicker noise is represented as a voltage source in series with the gate, given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{g}^{2}(f)=\\frac{K}{W L C_{o x} f} \\tag{9.54}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nKey Point: At low frequencies, l/f noise is predominant in MOSFET circuits. Its impact is reduced by employing large gate areas and p-channel transistors whenever feasible.\nHere, the constant K depends on the device's characteristics and can vary significantly among devices in the same process. The variables $W, L$, and $C_{o x}$ denote the transistor's width, length, and gate capacitance per unit area, respectively. The 1/f noise is inversely proportional to the transistor area, WL, meaning larger devices exhibit less $1 / \\mathrm{f}$ noise. In MOSFET circuits, $1 / \\mathrm{f}$ noise is crucial because it typically dominates at low frequencies unless switching techniques are employed to mitigate its effects. Generally, the $1 / \\mathrm{f}$ noise constant K is\n\n[^7]lower for p-channel transistors compared to n-channel ones, as their majority carriers (holes) are less prone to trapping, making p-channel transistors preferable for reducing $1 / \\mathrm{f}$ noise.\n\nThe thermal noise term's derivation is straightforward, originating from the resistive channel of a MOS transistor in the active region. If the transistor were in the triode region, the thermal noise current in the drain due to channel resistance would be $I_{d}^{2}(f)=(4 k T) / r_{d s}$, where $r_{d s}$ is the channel resistance. However, in the active region, the channel is not homogeneous, necessitating integration over small channel segments to determine the total noise. This integration yields the drain noise current as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{d}}^{2}(\\mathrm{f})=4 \\mathrm{k} T \\gamma \\mathrm{~g}_{\\mathrm{m}} \\tag{9.55}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{DS}}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{GS}}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{T}}$ and assuming a long-channel device, $\\gamma=2 / 3$. Short-channel devices may exhibit much higher $\\gamma$ values. Note that the white noise parameter $\\gamma$ differs from the body-effect parameter $\\gamma$.\n\nOften, noise analysis includes this noise source between the transistor's drain and source. However, simplifying the analysis by replacing it with an equivalent input noise source is sometimes possible. To determine the equivalent noise voltage causing this drain current,\n\nKey Point: MOSFET thermal noise in triode mode is akin to a resistor with value $\\mathrm{r}_{\\mathrm{ds}}$. In active mode, it is modeled as a white current noise source between drain and source with spectral density $8 \\mathrm{k} \\mathrm{Tg}_{\\mathrm{m}} / 3$ for long-channel devices, and higher for short-channel devices.\nwe recognize that the drain current equals the gate voltage times the transconductance, or $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{d}}(\\mathrm{f})=\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m}} \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{i}}(\\mathrm{f})$. Dividing (9.55) by $\\mathrm{g}_{\\mathrm{m}}^{2}$ results in a simplified MOSFET model, also shown in Fig. 9.11, featuring a single voltage noise source. However, this model assumes zero gate current, valid at low and moderate frequencies.

The best noise performance is achieved by placing the 8 V/V amplifier first.\n\nFig. 9.16 Computing the input-referred noise of Example 9.9.\n\n#### Solution\n\nThe first amplifier has an input-referred noise of $3 \\mu \\mathrm{~V} / 3=1 \\mu \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{rms}}$, and the second has an input-referred noise of $6 \\mu \\mathrm{~V} / 8=0.75 \\mu \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{rms}}$.

This illustrates why, for example, the first stage is the dominant noise contributor in a two-stage op-amp. Generally, when processing very low-amplitude signals with high fidelity, it is desirable to use an initial low-noise and high-gain pre-amplifier. Doing so ensures that the noise performance of subsequent stages is less critical.\n\nThe noise spectral density at the circuit's output is generally the sum of the noise contributed by the circuit itself, $\\mathrm{v}_{\\mathrm{a}}(\\mathrm{f})$, and the thermal noise from the real part of the source impedance filtered by the circuit, $4 \\mathrm{kTR}_{\\mathrm{s}}|\\mathrm{A}(\\mathrm{f})|^{2}$. These quantities can be input-referred as illustrated in Fig. 9.17 for a voltage amplifier where\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{vail}_{\\mathrm{a}}^{2}(\\mathrm{f})=\\frac{\\mathrm{va}_{\\mathrm{a}(\\mathrm{f})}^{2}}{|\\mathrm{A}(\\mathrm{f})|^{2}} \\tag{9.65}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nimage_name: Fig. 9.17\ndescription:\n[\nname: Rs, type: Resistor, value: Rs, ports: {N1: In(A(f)), N2: GND}\nname: A(f), type: OpAmp, value: A(f), ports: {InP: In(A(f)), OutP: Out(A(f))}\nname: ZL, type: Resistor, value: ZL, ports: {N1: Out(A(f)), N2: GND}\n]\nextrainfo: The circuit diagram illustrates the separation of noise contributed by the source resistance and circuit noise.

The rms input-referred noise is simply the rms output noise divided by the mid-band gain, allowing it to be used to determine SNR assuming the input signal is confined to the circuit's mid-band region.\n\nIn radio-frequency applications, the signal input is narrowband, and filters can be used to eliminate all out-of-band noise. In this case, a measure of noise spectral density at a specific frequency, also called the spot noise, is useful. A common noise metric in this scenario is the noise factor, $\\mathrm{F}(\\mathrm{f})$, given by the ratio of the total noise to the noise that would arise if only the source resistance were noisy, at a particular frequency.\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nF(f)=\\frac{v_{n_{0}}^{2}(f)}{4 k R_{s}|A(f)|^{2}} \\tag{9.66}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis quantity can be related to the input-referred noise of the amplifier alone, $\\mathrm{v}_{\\mathrm{ai}}^{2}(\\mathrm{f})$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nF(f)=\\frac{4 k T R_{s}+v_{a i}^{2}(f)}{4 k T R_{s}}=1+\\frac{v_{a i}^{2}(f)}{4 k T R_{s}} \\tag{9.67}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nExpressed in decibels, the noise factor becomes the noise figure of the circuit,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nN F(f)=10 \\log _{10}[F(f)] d B \\tag{9.68}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$"

This result could also have been obtained by directly input-referring the noise contribution of each amplifier from Fig. 9.16(b).\n\n$$\nv_{\\text {in(rms) }}=\\sqrt{(0.75 \\mu \\mathrm{~V})^{2}+\\frac{(1 \\mu \\mathrm{~V})^{2}}{8^{2}}}=0.76 \\mu \\mathrm{~V}_{\\mathrm{rms}}\n$$\n\nThe larger gain in the first stage makes the noise from the second stage negligible. This demonstrates why, for instance, the first stage is the dominant noise contributor in a two-stage op-amp. In general, when very low-amplitude signals must be processed with high fidelity, it is desirable to use an initial low-noise and high-gain pre-amplifier. Doing so ensures the noise performance of subsequent stages is not critical.\n\nThe noise spectral density at the output of the circuit is generally the sum of the noise contributed by the circuit itself, $\\mathrm{v}_{\\mathrm{a}}(\\mathrm{f})$, and the thermal noise from the real part of the source impedance filtered by the circuit, $4 \\mathrm{kTR}_{\\mathrm{s}}|\\mathrm{A}(\\mathrm{f})|^{2}$. These quantities can be input-referred as shown in Fig. 9.17 for a voltage amplifier where\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{vail}_{\\mathrm{a}}^{2}(\\mathrm{f})=\\frac{\\mathrm{va}_{\\mathrm{a}(\\mathrm{f})}^{2}}{|\\mathrm{A}(\\mathrm{f})|^{2}} \\tag{9.65}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nimage_name: Fig. 9.17\ndescription:\n[\nname: Rs, type: Resistor, value: Rs, ports: {N1: In(A(f)), N2: GND}\nname: A(f), type: OpAmp, value: A(f), ports: {InP: In(A(f)), OutP: Out(A(f))}\nname: ZL, type: Resistor, value: ZL, ports: {N1: Out(A(f)), N2: GND}\n]\nextrainfo: The circuit diagram illustrates the separation of noise contributed by the source resistance and circuit noise. The input-referred noise is shown as an equivalent noiseless circuit with additional noise sources representing thermal noise and circuit noise.\n\nFig. 9.17 Separating noise contributed by the source resistance and circuit noise.\nNote that the input-referred noise $\\mathrm{v}_{\\text {in(rms) }}$ in (9.63) is not obtained by integrating the input-referred noise spectrum over some bandwidth. The rms input-referred noise divides the rms output noise by the mid-band gain only, so it can be used to determine SNR assuming the input signal is confined to the circuit's mid-band region.\n\nIn radio-frequency applications, the signal input is narrowband, and filters can be used to eliminate all out-of-band noise. In this case, a measure of noise spectral density at a particular frequency, also called the spot noise, is useful. A common noise metric in this case is the noise factor, $\\mathrm{F}(\\mathrm{f})$, given by the ratio of the total noise to the noise that would arise if only the source resistance were noisy, at a particular frequency.\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nF(f)=\\frac{v_{n_{0}}^{2}(f)}{4 k R_{s}|A(f)|^{2}} \\tag{9.66}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis quantity can be related to the input-referred noise of the amplifier alone, $\\mathrm{v}_{\\mathrm{ai}}^{2}(\\mathrm{f})$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nF(f)=\\frac{4 k T R_{s}+v_{a i}^{2}(f)}{4 k T R_{s}}=1+\\frac{v_{a i}^{2}(f)}{4 k T R_{s}} \\tag{9.67}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nExpressed in decibels, the noise factor becomes the noise figure of the circuit,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nN F(f)=10 \\log _{10}[F(f)] d B \\tag{9.68}\n\\end{equation*}\n```"
