# CHAPTER 1 Introduction to Analog Design

## 1.1 ■ Why Analog?

We are surrounded by "digital" devices: digital cameras, digital TVs, digital communications (cell phones and $\mathrm{WiFi}^{2}$ ), the Internet, etc. Why, then, are we still interested in analog circuits? Isn't analog design old and out of fashion? Will there even be jobs for analog designers ten years from now?

Interestingly, these questions have been raised about every five years over the past 50 years, but mostly by those who either did not understand analog design or did not want to deal with its challenges. In this section, we learn that analog design is still essential, relevant, and challenging and will remain so for decades to come.

### 1.1.1 Sensing and Processing Signals

Many electronic systems perform two principal functions: they sense (receive) a signal and subsequently process and extract information from it. Your cell phone receives a radio-frequency (RF) signal and, after processing it, provides voice or data information. Similarly, your digital camera senses the light intensity emitted from various parts of an object and processes the result to extract an image.

We know intuitively that the complex task of processing is preferably carried out in the digital domain. In fact, we may wonder whether we can directly digitize the signal and avoid any operations in the analog domain. Figure 1.1 shows an example where the RF signal received by the antenna is digitized by an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and processed entirely in the digital domain. Would this scenario send analog and RF designers to the unemployment office?

Figure 1.1 Hypothetical RF receiver with direct signal digitization.

The answer is an emphatic no. An ADC that could digitize the minuscule RF signal ${ }^{1}$ would consume much more power than today's cell phone receivers. Furthermore, even if this approach were seriously considered, only analog designers would be able to develop the ADC. The key point offered by this example is that the sensing interface still demands high-performance analog design.

Another interesting example of sensing challenges arises in the study of the brain signals. Each time a neuron in your brain "fires," it generates an electric pulse with a height of a few millivolts and a duration of a few hundred microseconds [Fig. 1.2(a)]. To monitor brain activities, a neural recording system may employ tens of "probes" (electrodes) [Fig. 1.2(b)], each sensing a series of pulses. The signal produced by each probe must now be amplified, digitized, and transmitted wirelessly so that the patient is free to move around [Fig. 1.2(c)]. The sensing, processing, and transmission electronics in this environment must consume a low amount of power for two reasons: (1) to permit the use of a small battery for days or weeks, and (2) to minimize the rise in the chip's temperature, which could otherwise damage the patient's tissue. Among the functions shown in Fig. 1.2(c), the amplifiers, the ADCs, and the RF transmitter-all analog circuits-consume most of the power.

### 1.1.2 When Digital Signals Become Analog

The use of analog circuits is not limited to analog signals. If a digital signal is so small and/or so distorted that a digital gate cannot interpret it correctly, then the analog designer must step in. For example, consider a long USB cable carrying data rate of hundreds of megabits per second between two laptops. As shown in Fig. 1.3, Laptop 1 delivers the data to the cable in the form of a sequence of ONEs and ZERO.

Figure 1.3 Equalization to compensate for high-frequency attenuation in a USB cable.
Unfortunately, the cable exhibits a finite bandwidth, attenuating high frequencies and distorting the data as it reaches Laptop 2. This device must now perform sensing and processing, the former requiring an analog circuit (called an "equalizer") that corrects the distortion. For example, since the cable attenuates high frequencies, we may design the equalizer to amplify such frequencies, as shown conceptually by the $1 /|H|$ plot in Fig. 1.3.

The reader may wonder whether the task of equalization in Fig. 1.3 could be performed in the digital domain. That is, could we directly digitize the received distorted signal, digitally correct for the cable's limited bandwidth, and then carry out the standard USB signal processing? Indeed, this is possible if the ADC required here demands less power and less complexity than the analog equalizer. Following a detailed analysis, the analog designer decides which approach to adopt, but we intuitively know that at very high data rates, e.g., tens of gigabits per second, an analog equalizer proves more efficient than an ADC.

The above equalization task exemplifies a general trend in electronics: at lower speeds, it is more efficient to digitize the signal and perform the required function(s) in the digital domain, whereas at higher speeds, we implement the function(s) in the analog domain. The speed boundary between these two paradigms depends on the nature of the problem, but it has risen over time.

### 1.1.3 Analog Design Is in Great Demand

Despite tremendous advances in semiconductor technology, analog design continues to face new challenges, thus calling for innovations. As a gauge of the demand for analog circuits, we can consider the papers published by industry and academia at circuits conferences and see what percentage fall in our domain. Figure 1.4 plots the number of analog papers published at the International Solid-State Circuits

Conference (ISSCC) in recent years, where "analog" is defined as a paper requiring the knowledge in this book. We observe that the majority of the papers involve analog design. This is true even though analog circuits are typically quite a lot less complex than digital circuits; an ADC contains several thousand transistors whereas a microprocessor employs billions.

### 1.1.4 Analog Design Challenges

Today's analog designers must deal with interesting and difficult problems. Our study of devices and circuits in this book will systematically illustrate various issues, but it is helpful to take a brief look at what lies ahead.

Transistor Imperfections As a result of scaling, MOS transistors continue to become faster, but at the cost of their "analog" properties. For example, the maximum voltage gain that a transistor can provide declines with each new generation of CMOS technology. Moreover, a transistor's characteristics may depend on its surroundings, i.e., the size, shape, and distance of other components around it on the chip.

Declining Supply Voltages As a result of device scaling, the supply voltage of CMOS circuits has inevitably fallen from about 12 V in the 1970 s to about 0.9 V today. Many circuit configurations have not survived this supply reduction and have been discarded. We continue to seek new topologies that operate well at low voltages.

Power Consumption The semiconductor industry, more than ever, is striving for low-power design. This effort applies both to portable devices-so as to increase their battery lifetime-and to larger systems-so as to reduce the cost of heat removal and ease their drag on the earth's resources. MOS device scaling directly lowers the power consumption of digital circuits, but its effect on analog circuits is much more complicated.

Circuit Complexity Today's analog circuits may contain tens of thousands of transistors, demanding long and tedious simulations. Indeed, modern analog designers must be as adept at SPICE as at higherlevel simulators such as MATLAB.

PVT Variations Many device and circuit parameters vary with the fabrication process, supply voltage, and ambient temperature. We denote these effects by PVT and design circuits such that their performance is acceptable for a specified range of PVT variations. For example, the supply voltage may vary from 1 V to 0.95 V and the temperature from $0^{\circ}$ to $80^{\circ}$. Robust analog design in CMOS technology is a challenging task because device parameters vary significantly across PVT.

## 1.2 ■ Why Integrated?

The idea of placing multiple electronic devices on the same substrate was conceived in the late 1950s. In 60 years, the technology has evolved from producing simple chips containing a handful of components to fabricating flash drives with one trillion transistors as well as microprocessors comprising several billion devices. As Gordon Moore (one of the founders of Intel) predicted in the early 1970s, the number of transistors per chip has continued to double approximately every one and a half years. At the same time, the minimum dimension of transistors has dropped from about $25 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in 1960 to about 12 nm in the year 2015, resulting in a tremendous improvement in the speed of integrated circuits.

Driven primarily by the memory and microprocessor market, integrated-circuit technologies have also embraced analog design, affording a complexity, speed, and precision that would be impossible to achieve using discrete implementations. We can no longer build a discrete prototype to predict the behavior and performance of modern analog circuits.

## 1.3 ■ Why CMOS?

The idea of metal-oxide-silicon field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) was patented by J. E. Lilienfeld in the early 1930s-well before the invention of the bipolar transistor. Owing to fabrication limitations, however, MOS technologies became practical only much later, in the early 1960s, with the first several generations producing only $n$-type transistors. It was in the mid-1960s that complementary MOS (CMOS) devices (i.e., with both $n$-type and $p$-type transistors) were introduced, initiating a revolution in the semiconductor industry.

CMOS technologies rapidly captured the digital market: CMOS gates dissipated power only during switching and required very few devices, two attributes in sharp contrast to their bipolar or GaAs counterparts. It was also soon discovered that the dimensions of MOS devices could be scaled down more easily than those of other types of transistors.

The next obvious step was to apply CMOS technology to analog design. The low cost of fabrication and the possibility of placing both analog and digital circuits on the same chip so as to improve the overall performance and/or reduce the cost of packaging made CMOS technology attractive. However, MOSFETs were slower and noisier than bipolar transistors, finding limited application.

How did CMOS technology come to dominate the analog market as well? The principal force was device scaling because it continued to improve the speed of MOSFETs. The intrinsic speed of MOS transistors has increased by orders of magnitude in the past 60 years, exceeding that of bipolar devices even though the latter have also been scaled (but not as fast).

Another critical advantage of MOS devices over bipolar transistors is that the former can operate with lower supply voltages. In today's technology, CMOS circuits run from supplies around 1 V and bipolar circuits around 2 V . The lower supplies have permitted a smaller power consumption for complex integrated circuits.

## 1.4 ■ Why This Book?

The design of analog circuits itself has evolved together with the technology and the performance requirements. As the device dimensions shrink, the supply voltage of intergrated circuits drops, and analog and digital circuits are fabricated on one chip, many design issues arise that were previously unimportant. Such trends demand that the analysis and design of circuits be accompanied by an in-depth understanding of new technology-imposed limitations.

Good analog design requires intuition, rigor, and creativity. As analog designers, we must wear our engineer's hat for a quick and intuitive understanding of a large circuit, our mathematician's hat for quantifying subtle, yet important effects in a circuit, and our artist's hat for inventing new circuit topologies.

This book describes modern analog design from both intuitive and rigorous angles. It also fosters the reader's creativity by carefully guiding him or her through the evolution of each circuit and presenting the thought process that occurs during the development of new circuit techniques.

## 1.5 ■ Levels of Abstraction

Analysis and design of integrated circuits often require thinking at various levels of abstraction. Depending on the effect or quantity of interest, we may study a complex circuit at device physics level, transistor level, architecture level, or system level. In other words, we may consider the behavior of individual devices in terms of their internal electric fields and charge transport [Fig. 1.5(a)], the interaction of a group of devices according to their electrical characteristics [Fig. 1.5(b)], the function of several building blocks operating as a unit [Fig. 1.5(c)], or the performance of the system in terms of that of its constituent subsystems
[Fig. 1.5(d)]. Switching between levels of abstraction becomes necessary in both understanding the details of the operation and optimizing the overall performance. In fact, in today's IC industry, the interaction among all groups, from device physicists to system designers, is essential to achieving high performance and low cost. In this book, we begin with device physics and develop increasingly more complex circuit topologies.
