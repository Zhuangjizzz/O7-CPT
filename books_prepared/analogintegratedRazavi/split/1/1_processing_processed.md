# CHAPTER 1 Introduction to Analog Design

## 1.1 â–  Why Analog?

We are surrounded by "digital" devices: digital cameras, digital TVs, digital communications (cell phones and $\mathrm{WiFi}^{2}$ ), the Internet, etc. Why, then, are we still interested in analog circuits? Isn't analog design old and out of fashion? Will there even be jobs for analog designers ten years from now?

Interestingly, these questions have been raised about every five years over the past 50 years, but mostly by those who either did not understand analog design or did not want to deal with its challenges. In this section, we learn that analog design is still essential, relevant, and challenging and will remain so for decades to come.

### 1.1.1 Sensing and Processing Signals

Many electronic systems perform two principal functions: they sense (receive) a signal and subsequently process and extract information from it. Your cell phone receives a radio-frequency (RF) signal and, after processing it, provides voice or data information. Similarly, your digital camera senses the light intensity emitted from various parts of an object and processes the result to extract an image.

We know intuitively that the complex task of processing is preferably carried out in the digital domain. In fact, we may wonder whether we can directly digitize the signal and avoid any operations in the analog domain. Figure 1.1 shows an example where the RF signal received by the antenna is digitized by an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and processed entirely in the digital domain. Would this scenario send analog and RF designers to the unemployment office?
image_name:Figure 1.1
description:The system block diagram titled "Figure 1.1" illustrates a hypothetical RF receiver with direct signal digitization. The main components of this system include:

1. **Antenna**: The diagram begins with an antenna, which is responsible for receiving the RF (Radio Frequency) signal from the environment. This is depicted on the left side of the diagram.

2. **Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)**: The RF signal captured by the antenna is fed into an Analog-to-Digital Converter. The ADC's role is to convert the analog RF signal into a digital format. This is a crucial step for enabling further digital processing.

3. **Digital Signal Processor (DSP)**: The digital output from the ADC is then sent to a Digital Signal Processor. The DSP is responsible for processing the digitized signal, performing various operations such as filtering, modulation, and demodulation in the digital domain.

**Flow of Information**:
- The RF signal is initially received by the antenna and passed as an analog signal to the ADC.
- The ADC converts the analog signal into a digital signal, represented by binary numbers (e.g., 0s and 1s) in the diagram.
- The digital signal is then processed by the DSP, where it undergoes necessary computations and manipulations.

**Annotations and Labels**:
- The diagram includes labels for each component (Antenna, Analog-to-Digital Converter, Digital Signal Processor) to clearly identify their functions.
- The binary numbers next to the ADC output illustrate the conversion of the analog signal to digital form.

**Overall System Function**:
The primary function of this system is to receive an RF signal using an antenna, convert this signal from analog to digital using an ADC, and then process the digital signal using a DSP. This setup demonstrates the concept of processing signals entirely in the digital domain, highlighting the potential efficiency and flexibility of digital processing compared to analog methods. However, it also underscores the challenges, such as power consumption, associated with digitizing high-frequency analog signals directly.

Figure 1.1 Hypothetical RF receiver with direct signal digitization.

The answer is an emphatic no. An ADC that could digitize the minuscule RF signal ${ }^{1}$ would consume much more power than today's cell phone receivers. Furthermore, even if this approach were seriously considered, only analog designers would be able to develop the ADC. The key point offered by this example is that the sensing interface still demands high-performance analog design.

It depicts a simplified representation of a human head with several probes inserted into the scalp. These probes are connected to a block labeled "Electronics," which likely contains amplifiers and other necessary circuitry to process the neural signals. The electronics box also features a small antenna, indicating that the processed signals are transmitted wirelessly, possibly to an external receiver for further analysis. The diagram emphasizes the role of the electronics in capturing and transmitting neural activity data, highlighting the importance of precise and sensitive measurement tools in neuroscience research.
image_name:(c)
description:The system block diagram labeled (c) represents a neural recording and signal transmission system. The primary components of this system include amplifiers, Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs), a processor, and an RF transmitter.

1. **Main Components:**
- **Amplifiers:** These are the initial blocks in the system. They receive the neural signals captured by probes, which are typically very weak, and amplify them to a level suitable for further processing.
- **ADCs (Analog-to-Digital Converters):** Each amplifier is connected to an ADC. The ADCs convert the amplified analog signals into digital signals, making them ready for digital processing.
- **Processor:** The digital signals from the ADCs are fed into a processor. This component likely performs data processing, such as filtering, feature extraction, or compression, to prepare the data for transmission.
- **RF Transmitter:** The processed digital signals are then sent to an RF transmitter, which wirelessly transmits the data to an external device or system for further analysis or monitoring.

2. **Flow of Information or Control:**
- The flow begins with neural signals being captured by probes and sent to the amplifiers.
- Amplified signals are converted to digital form by the ADCs.
- Digital signals are processed by the processor.
- The processed signals are transmitted wirelessly by the RF transmitter.
- The signal flow is linear from signal capture to transmission, with no feedback loops indicated in the diagram.

3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**
- The diagram includes labels for each component, such as "Amplifier," "ADC," "Processor," and "RF Transmitter."
- The use of arrows indicates the direction of signal flow between components.

4. **Overall System Function:**
- The primary function of this system is to capture neural activity, convert it into a digital format, process it, and transmit it wirelessly. This setup is crucial for applications like brain-computer interfaces or remote neural monitoring, where real-time data transmission is essential for analysis or interaction with external systems.

Figure 1.2 (a) Voltage waveform generated as a result of neural activity, (b) use of probes to measure action potentials, and (c) processing and transmission of signals.

Another interesting example of sensing challenges arises in the study of the brain signals. Each time a neuron in your brain "fires," it generates an electric pulse with a height of a few millivolts and a duration of a few hundred microseconds [Fig. 1.2(a)]. To monitor brain activities, a neural recording system may employ tens of "probes" (electrodes) [Fig. 1.2(b)], each sensing a series of pulses. The signal produced by each probe must now be amplified, digitized, and transmitted wirelessly so that the patient is free to move around [Fig. 1.2(c)]. The sensing, processing, and transmission electronics in this environment must consume a low amount of power for two reasons: (1) to permit the use of a small battery for days or weeks, and (2) to minimize the rise in the chip's temperature, which could otherwise damage the patient's tissue. Among the functions shown in Fig. 1.2(c), the amplifiers, the ADCs, and the RF transmitter-all analog circuits-consume most of the power.

### 1.1.2 When Digital Signals Become Analog

The use of analog circuits is not limited to analog signals. If a digital signal is so small and/or so distorted that a digital gate cannot interpret it correctly, then the analog designer must step in. For example, consider a long USB cable carrying data rate of hundreds of megabits per second between two laptops. As shown in Fig. 1.3, Laptop 1 delivers the data to the cable in the form of a sequence of ONEs and ZERO.

[^0]image_name:Equalization to compensate for high-frequency attenuation in a USB cable
description:The system block diagram illustrates the process of equalization to compensate for high-frequency attenuation in a USB cable connecting two laptops.

1. **Main Components:**
- **Laptop 1:** This block represents the source of the digital signal, delivering data in the form of binary sequences (ONEs and ZEROs) to the USB cable.
- **USB Cable:** The cable serves as the medium for data transmission between Laptop 1 and Laptop 2. It is depicted with a cylindrical shape and is labeled to indicate its role in the system.
- **Laptop 2:** This block receives the distorted signal from the USB cable. It includes an internal component called the "Equalizer."
- **Equalizer:** This is an analog circuit within Laptop 2 designed to correct the signal distortion caused by the cable's finite bandwidth. It specifically amplifies high frequencies that the cable attenuates.

2. **Flow of Information or Control:**
- The digital signal originates from Laptop 1, traveling through the USB cable. The signal is initially a clean sequence of digital pulses.
- As it passes through the USB cable, the signal experiences high-frequency attenuation, resulting in a distorted waveform by the time it reaches Laptop 2.
- The equalizer in Laptop 2 processes this distorted signal. It boosts the attenuated high frequencies to restore the original signal quality.

3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**
- The diagram includes a frequency response plot labeled \(|H|\) next to the USB cable, illustrating the attenuation of high frequencies.
- Another plot labeled \(1/|H|\) is shown next to the equalizer, indicating the amplification of high frequencies to counteract the cable's attenuation.

4. **Overall System Function:**
- The primary function of this system is to ensure that digital data transmitted from Laptop 1 to Laptop 2 via a USB cable is accurately received despite the cable's bandwidth limitations. The equalizer compensates for high-frequency losses, maintaining the integrity of the digital signal. This arrangement allows Laptop 2 to correctly interpret the incoming data by restoring the signal to its original form before the distortion occurred.
image_name:|H|
description:The graph labeled "|H|" is a frequency response plot, likely a Bode magnitude plot, which is commonly used to represent the gain of a system as a function of frequency. The x-axis represents frequency (f) and is typically in hertz (Hz), though the exact units are not specified in the image. The y-axis represents the magnitude of the transfer function |H|, which is usually in decibels (dB), but here it is depicted in linear scale without specific units.

The plot shows a downward trend, indicating that the magnitude of the system's response decreases as frequency increases. This is characteristic of a low-pass filter behavior, where low frequencies are passed with higher gain compared to high frequencies, which are attenuated. The curve starts at a higher value on the left (low frequencies) and decreases towards the right (high frequencies), suggesting that the USB cable is attenuating high-frequency components of the signal.

Key features of this graph include:
- A smooth, monotonically decreasing curve, indicating consistent attenuation of higher frequencies.
- The absence of any peaks or valleys, which suggests there are no resonant frequencies within the range shown.

The second graph, labeled "1/|H|", is likely the inverse of the first, representing the corrective action of an equalizer. The x-axis again represents frequency (f), while the y-axis represents the inverse magnitude of the transfer function. This graph shows an upward trend, indicating that the equalizer is designed to amplify higher frequencies to compensate for the attenuation caused by the USB cable.

Key features of the "1/|H|" graph include:
- A smooth, monotonically increasing curve, indicating a consistent boost to higher frequencies.
- The absence of peaks or valleys, suggesting a uniform compensation across the frequency range.

Overall, these graphs illustrate the concept of equalization used to compensate for high-frequency attenuation in a USB cable, as described in the context.
image_name:1/|H|
description:The graph labeled "1/|H|" is a frequency response plot, likely a Bode plot, used to illustrate the behavior of an equalizer designed to compensate for high-frequency attenuation in a USB cable.

1. **Type of Graph and Function:**
- This is a Bode plot, showing the magnitude response of an equalizer.

2. **Axes Labels and Units:**
- The horizontal axis represents frequency (f), usually in hertz (Hz), but no specific units are marked.
- The vertical axis represents the inverse magnitude of the transfer function (1/|H|), typically in decibels (dB), though not explicitly labeled.
- The scale is likely logarithmic for frequency, as is common in Bode plots.

3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**
- The plot shows an increasing trend, indicating that the equalizer amplifies higher frequencies. This behavior counteracts the attenuation caused by the USB cable.
- The graph starts at a lower value at low frequencies and rises as the frequency increases, suggesting a high-pass filter characteristic.

4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**
- The graph does not indicate specific cutoff frequencies or resonance peaks, but the increasing trend suggests a gradual amplification of higher frequencies.
- There are no visible inflection points or zero crossings.

5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**
- There are no specific annotations or markers on the graph. The conceptual nature of the plot implies a general representation of the equalizer's function rather than precise numerical data.

Overall, this graph conceptually illustrates how the equalizer compensates for the high-frequency loss in the USB cable, ensuring that the digital signal received by Laptop 2 is correctly interpreted.

Figure 1.3 Equalization to compensate for high-frequency attenuation in a USB cable.
Unfortunately, the cable exhibits a finite bandwidth, attenuating high frequencies and distorting the data as it reaches Laptop 2. This device must now perform sensing and processing, the former requiring an analog circuit (called an "equalizer") that corrects the distortion. For example, since the cable attenuates high frequencies, we may design the equalizer to amplify such frequencies, as shown conceptually by the $1 /|H|$ plot in Fig. 1.3.

The reader may wonder whether the task of equalization in Fig. 1.3 could be performed in the digital domain. That is, could we directly digitize the received distorted signal, digitally correct for the cable's limited bandwidth, and then carry out the standard USB signal processing? Indeed, this is possible if the ADC required here demands less power and less complexity than the analog equalizer. Following a detailed analysis, the analog designer decides which approach to adopt, but we intuitively know that at very high data rates, e.g., tens of gigabits per second, an analog equalizer proves more efficient than an ADC.

The above equalization task exemplifies a general trend in electronics: at lower speeds, it is more efficient to digitize the signal and perform the required function(s) in the digital domain, whereas at higher speeds, we implement the function(s) in the analog domain. The speed boundary between these two paradigms depends on the nature of the problem, but it has risen over time.

### 1.1.3 Analog Design Is in Great Demand

Despite tremendous advances in semiconductor technology, analog design continues to face new challenges, thus calling for innovations. As a gauge of the demand for analog circuits, we can consider the papers published by industry and academia at circuits conferences and see what percentage fall in our domain. Figure 1.4 plots the number of analog papers published at the International Solid-State Circuits
image_name:Figure 1.4 Number of analog papers published at the ISSCC in recent years.
description:The graph in Figure 1.4 is a bar chart representing the number of analog papers published at the International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC) from 2010 to 2014. The x-axis is labeled "Year," with discrete intervals marking each year from 2010 to 2014. The y-axis is labeled "Number of Analog Papers at ISSCC," with a linear scale ranging from 0 to 225, marked at intervals of 25.

Two sets of bars are presented for each year:
- A black bar representing the total number of papers published.
- A gray bar representing the number of analog papers specifically.

Key observations from the graph include:
- The total number of papers remains relatively stable across the years, hovering around 200.
- The number of analog papers shows slight variations but generally remains between 125 and 150.
- There is a noticeable gap between the total number of papers and the number of analog papers, indicating that analog papers constitute a significant portion but not the entirety of the publications.

The graph visually emphasizes the substantial and consistent contribution of analog papers to the conference, highlighting the ongoing demand and interest in analog design within the field.

Figure 1.4 Number of analog papers published at the ISSCC in recent years.

Conference (ISSCC) in recent years, where "analog" is defined as a paper requiring the knowledge in this book. We observe that the majority of the papers involve analog design. This is true even though analog circuits are typically quite a lot less complex than digital circuits; an ADC contains several thousand transistors whereas a microprocessor employs billions.

### 1.1.4 Analog Design Challenges

Today's analog designers must deal with interesting and difficult problems. Our study of devices and circuits in this book will systematically illustrate various issues, but it is helpful to take a brief look at what lies ahead.

Transistor Imperfections As a result of scaling, MOS transistors continue to become faster, but at the cost of their "analog" properties. For example, the maximum voltage gain that a transistor can provide declines with each new generation of CMOS technology. Moreover, a transistor's characteristics may depend on its surroundings, i.e., the size, shape, and distance of other components around it on the chip.

Declining Supply Voltages As a result of device scaling, the supply voltage of CMOS circuits has inevitably fallen from about 12 V in the 1970 s to about 0.9 V today. Many circuit configurations have not survived this supply reduction and have been discarded. We continue to seek new topologies that operate well at low voltages.

Power Consumption The semiconductor industry, more than ever, is striving for low-power design. This effort applies both to portable devices-so as to increase their battery lifetime-and to larger systems-so as to reduce the cost of heat removal and ease their drag on the earth's resources. MOS device scaling directly lowers the power consumption of digital circuits, but its effect on analog circuits is much more complicated.

Circuit Complexity Today's analog circuits may contain tens of thousands of transistors, demanding long and tedious simulations. Indeed, modern analog designers must be as adept at SPICE as at higherlevel simulators such as MATLAB.

PVT Variations Many device and circuit parameters vary with the fabrication process, supply voltage, and ambient temperature. We denote these effects by PVT and design circuits such that their performance is acceptable for a specified range of PVT variations. For example, the supply voltage may vary from 1 V to 0.95 V and the temperature from $0^{\circ}$ to $80^{\circ}$. Robust analog design in CMOS technology is a challenging task because device parameters vary significantly across PVT.

## 1.2 â–  Why Integrated?

The idea of placing multiple electronic devices on the same substrate was conceived in the late 1950s. In 60 years, the technology has evolved from producing simple chips containing a handful of components to fabricating flash drives with one trillion transistors as well as microprocessors comprising several billion devices. As Gordon Moore (one of the founders of Intel) predicted in the early 1970s, the number of transistors per chip has continued to double approximately every one and a half years. At the same time, the minimum dimension of transistors has dropped from about $25 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in 1960 to about 12 nm in the year 2015, resulting in a tremendous improvement in the speed of integrated circuits.

Driven primarily by the memory and microprocessor market, integrated-circuit technologies have also embraced analog design, affording a complexity, speed, and precision that would be impossible to achieve using discrete implementations. We can no longer build a discrete prototype to predict the behavior and performance of modern analog circuits.

## 1.3 â–  Why CMOS?

The idea of metal-oxide-silicon field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) was patented by J. E. Lilienfeld in the early 1930s-well before the invention of the bipolar transistor. Owing to fabrication limitations, however, MOS technologies became practical only much later, in the early 1960s, with the first several generations producing only $n$-type transistors. It was in the mid-1960s that complementary MOS (CMOS) devices (i.e., with both $n$-type and $p$-type transistors) were introduced, initiating a revolution in the semiconductor industry.

CMOS technologies rapidly captured the digital market: CMOS gates dissipated power only during switching and required very few devices, two attributes in sharp contrast to their bipolar or GaAs counterparts. It was also soon discovered that the dimensions of MOS devices could be scaled down more easily than those of other types of transistors.

The next obvious step was to apply CMOS technology to analog design. The low cost of fabrication and the possibility of placing both analog and digital circuits on the same chip so as to improve the overall performance and/or reduce the cost of packaging made CMOS technology attractive. However, MOSFETs were slower and noisier than bipolar transistors, finding limited application.

How did CMOS technology come to dominate the analog market as well? The principal force was device scaling because it continued to improve the speed of MOSFETs. The intrinsic speed of MOS transistors has increased by orders of magnitude in the past 60 years, exceeding that of bipolar devices even though the latter have also been scaled (but not as fast).

Another critical advantage of MOS devices over bipolar transistors is that the former can operate with lower supply voltages. In today's technology, CMOS circuits run from supplies around 1 V and bipolar circuits around 2 V . The lower supplies have permitted a smaller power consumption for complex integrated circuits.

## 1.4 â–  Why This Book?

The design of analog circuits itself has evolved together with the technology and the performance requirements. As the device dimensions shrink, the supply voltage of intergrated circuits drops, and analog and digital circuits are fabricated on one chip, many design issues arise that were previously unimportant. Such trends demand that the analysis and design of circuits be accompanied by an in-depth understanding of new technology-imposed limitations.

Good analog design requires intuition, rigor, and creativity. As analog designers, we must wear our engineer's hat for a quick and intuitive understanding of a large circuit, our mathematician's hat for quantifying subtle, yet important effects in a circuit, and our artist's hat for inventing new circuit topologies.

This book describes modern analog design from both intuitive and rigorous angles. It also fosters the reader's creativity by carefully guiding him or her through the evolution of each circuit and presenting the thought process that occurs during the development of new circuit techniques.

## 1.5 â–  Levels of Abstraction

Analysis and design of integrated circuits often require thinking at various levels of abstraction. Depending on the effect or quantity of interest, we may study a complex circuit at device physics level, transistor level, architecture level, or system level. In other words, we may consider the behavior of individual devices in terms of their internal electric fields and charge transport [Fig. 1.5(a)], the interaction of a group of devices according to their electrical characteristics [Fig. 1.5(b)], the function of several building blocks operating as a unit [Fig. 1.5(c)], or the performance of the system in terms of that of its constituent subsystems
[Fig. 1.5(d)]. Switching between levels of abstraction becomes necessary in both understanding the details of the operation and optimizing the overall performance. In fact, in today's IC industry, the interaction among all groups, from device physicists to system designers, is essential to achieving high performance and low cost. In this book, we begin with device physics and develop increasingly more complex circuit topologies.

The diagram shows two regions labeled as "n+", indicating heavily doped n-type semiconductor regions. These regions are typically the source and drain of a transistor.

Above these n+ regions is a horizontal layer, which could represent a gate or insulating layer, possibly made of oxide material, separating the gate from the underlying semiconductor. The gate is typically a conductive material that can control the flow of electrons between the source and drain by creating an electric field.

The structure suggests a basic MOSFET (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor) configuration with the n+ regions forming the source and drain, and the gate controlling the channel between them. The substrate beneath the n+ regions is not labeled, but it is usually a p-type material in an n-channel MOSFET setup.

4. **Overall System Function:**
- The primary function of this system is to convert an analog input signal into a high-quality digital output. The arrangement of components ensures that the signal is properly amplified, filtered, synchronized, and equalized, resulting in a reliable digital representation of the original analog signal. This makes the system suitable for applications requiring precise digital signal processing, such as telecommunications or data conversion.
