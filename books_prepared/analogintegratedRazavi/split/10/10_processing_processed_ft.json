Netlist: Figure 10.3 is a Bode plot, which consists of two graphs: one for magnitude and one for phase, both plotted against frequency on a logarithmic scale. The x-axis for both graphs is labeled as 'log ω', representing the logarithm of angular frequency ω. The y-axis of the upper graph is labeled '20 log |βH(ω)|', which shows the magnitude of the transfer function in decibels (dB). The y-axis of the lower graph is labeled '∠βH(ω)', which represents the phase angle of the transfer function. Magnitude Plot: The magnitude plot displays two curves. The black curve represents a higher β value, while the gray curve labeled 'Lower β' represents a reduced β value. Both curves start at the same level but diverge as frequency increases. The black curve maintains a higher magnitude compared to the gray curve. The slope of the curves changes at certain frequencies, indicating the presence of poles or zeros. The gray curve is shifted downward, indicating a lower magnitude for the reduced β value across the frequency spectrum. Phase Plot: The phase plot shows a single curve, which remains unchanged regardless of β value, consistent with the context that the phase angle of βH(ω) does not change. The phase angle decreases with increasing frequency, showing typical phase lag behavior as frequency increases. Key Features: The point where the magnitude plot crosses 0 dB is critical for stability analysis, as it indicates the gain crossover frequency. The phase plot is crucial for determining phase margin, which affects system stability. The dashed vertical lines connect corresponding points on the magnitude and phase plots, highlighting specific frequencies where changes occur. Overall, the plot illustrates how reducing β shifts the magnitude plot downward, potentially increasing system stability by moving the gain crossover frequency to the left, while the phase plot remains constant. Function: Bode plot illustrating the asymptotic behavior of the magnitude and phase of a complex function according to the magnitude of the poles and zeros."

Additionally, each pole within the $s$ contour contributes a phase change of 180 degrees in the clockwise direction. Therefore, the total phase change due to poles is $P * 180$ degrees. To find the number of zeros, we need to account for both contributions. Since each zero contributes a 360-degree phase change, the total phase change due to zeros must be $Z * 360$ degrees. Equating the total phase changes, we get $Z * 360 = N * 360 + P * 180$. Simplifying this, we find $Z = N + P$, which gives us the number of zeros within the $s$ contour."
