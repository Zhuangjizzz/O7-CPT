This local supply is defined by a reference VR1 and the ratio of resistors Rr1 and Rr2. The reference VR1 is established inside the core to minimize its dependence on the global supply voltage. By maintaining a stable local supply, the circuit reduces the impact of variations in the global supply voltage, thereby improving supply rejection."
