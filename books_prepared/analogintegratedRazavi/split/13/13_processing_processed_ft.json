Transistors M6 and M7 operate as a linear sense circuit because their gate voltages are nominally equal. The circuit settles such that the output CM level is equal to the sum of the gate-source voltages of M6, M7, and M5 (VGS6,7 + VGS5). When S1 turns off at the end of this mode, a voltage equal to VGS6,7 is left across capacitors C1 and C2, which is then used to control the output CM level during the amplification mode."

They help in stabilizing the output voltages Vout1 and Vout2 by providing a path for the feedback current. When the output CM level deviates, the voltage at node X changes, which affects the current through M5. M3 and M4 respond to this change by adjusting their drain currents, which in turn helps to bring the output CM level back to the desired value. Their role is crucial in maintaining the stability and accuracy of the output CM level."

This is important because large output swings can otherwise significantly influence the settling of the differential output, potentially affecting the stability and speed of the CMFB loop. By minimizing the adjustments required from M5, the constant current source helps in maintaining a faster and more stable CMFB loop, thereby improving the overall performance of the circuit, especially in applications with large output swings."
