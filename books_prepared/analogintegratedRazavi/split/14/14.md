# CHAPTER 15 Oscillators

Oscillators are an integral part of many electronic systems. Applications range from clock generation in microprocessors to carrier synthesis in cellular telephones, requiring vastly different oscillator topologies and performance parameters. Robust, high-performance oscillator design in CMOS technology continues to pose interesting challenges. As described in Chapter 16, oscillators are usually embedded in a phaselocked system.

This chapter deals with the analysis and design of CMOS oscillators, more specifically, voltagecontrolled oscillators (VCOs). Beginning with a general study of oscillation in feedback systems, we introduce ring oscillators and LC oscillators along with methods of varying the frequency of oscillation. We then describe a mathematical model of VCOs that will be used in the analysis of PLLs in Chapter 16.

## 15.1 ■ General Considerations

A simple oscillator produces a periodic output, usually in the form of voltage. As such, the circuit has no input while sustaining the output indefinitely. How can a circuit oscillate? Recall from Chapter 10 that negative-feedback systems may oscillate, i.e., an oscillator is a badly-designed feedback amplifier! ${ }^{1}$ Consider the unity-gain negative-feedback circuit shown in Fig. 15.1, where

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{V_{\text {out }}}{V_{\text {in }}}(s)=\frac{H(s)}{1+H(s)} \tag{15.1}
\end{equation*}
$$

As mentioned in Chapter 10, if the amplifier itself experiences so much phase shift at high frequencies that the overall feedback becomes positive, then oscillation may occur. More accurately, if for $s=j \omega_{0}, H\left(j \omega_{0}\right)=-1$, then the closed-loop gain approaches infinity at $\omega_{0}$. Under this condition, the circuit amplifies its own noise components at $\omega_{0}$ indefinitely. In fact, as conceptually illustrated in Fig. 15.2, a noise component at $\omega_{0}$ experiences a total gain of unity and a phase shift of $180^{\circ}$, returning to the subtractor as a negative replica of the input. Upon subtraction, the input and the feedback signals give a larger difference. Thus, the circuit continues to "regenerate," allowing the component at $\omega_{0}$ to grow.

Figure 15.2 Evolution of oscillatory system with time.

For the oscillation to begin, a loop gain of unity or greater is necessary. This can be seen by following the signal around the loop over many cycles and expressing the amplitude of the subtractor's output in Fig. 15.2 as a geometric series (if $\angle H\left(j \omega_{0}\right)=180^{\circ}$ ):

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{X}=V_{0}+\left|H\left(j \omega_{0}\right)\right| V_{0}+\left|H\left(j \omega_{0}\right)\right|^{2} V_{0}+\left|H\left(j \omega_{0}\right)\right|^{3} V_{0}+\cdots \tag{15.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

If $\left|H\left(j \omega_{0}\right)\right|>1$, the above summation diverges, whereas if $\left|H\left(j \omega_{0}\right)\right|<1$, then

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{X}=\frac{V_{0}}{1-\left|H\left(j \omega_{0}\right)\right|}<\infty \tag{15.3}
\end{equation*}
$$

In summary, if a negative-feedback circuit has a loop gain that satisfies two conditions:

$$
\begin{align*}
\left|H\left(j \omega_{0}\right)\right| & \geq 1  \tag{15.4}\\
\angle H\left(j \omega_{0}\right) & =180^{\circ} \tag{15.5}
\end{align*}
$$

then the circuit may oscillate at $\omega_{0}$. Called "Barkhausen criteria," these conditions are necessary but not sufficient [1]. ${ }^{2}$ In order to ensure oscillation in the presence of temperature and process variations, we typically choose the loop gain to be at least twice or three times the required value.

We may state the second Barkhausen criterion as $\angle H(j \omega)=180^{\circ}$ or a total phase shift of $360^{\circ}$. This should not be confusing: if the system is designed to have low-frequency negative feedback, it already produces $180^{\circ}$ of phase shift in the signal traveling around the loop (as represented by the subtractor in Fig. 15.1), and $\angle H(j \omega)=180^{\circ}$ denotes an additional frequency-dependent phase shift that, as illustrated in Fig. 15.2, ensures that the feedback signal enhances the original signal. Thus, the three cases illustrated in Fig. 15.3 are equivalent in terms of the second criterion. We say that the system of Fig. 15.3(a) exhibits a frequency-dependent phase shift of $180^{\circ}$ (denoted by the arrow) and a dc phase shift of $180^{\circ}$. The difference between Figs. 15.3(b) and (c) is that the open-loop amplifier in the former contains enough stages with proper polarities to provide a total phase shift of $360^{\circ}$ at $\omega_{0}$, whereas that in the latter produces no phase shift at $\omega_{0}$. Examples of these topologies are presented later in this chapter.

CMOS oscillators in today's technology are typically implemented as "ring oscillators" or "LC oscillators." We study each type in the following sections.

## 15.2 ■ Ring Oscillators

A ring oscillator consists of a number of gain stages in a loop. To arrive at the actual implementation, we begin by attempting to make a single-stage feedback circuit oscillate.

Example 15.1
Explain why a single common-source stage does not oscillate if it is placed in a unity-gain loop.

#### Solution

From Fig. 15.4, it is seen that the open-loop circuit contains only one pole, thereby providing a maximum frequencydependent phase shift of $90^{\circ}$ (at a frequency of infinity). Since the common-source stage exhibits a dc phase shift of $180^{\circ}$ due to the signal inversion from the gate to the drain, the maximum total phase shift is $270^{\circ}$. The loop therefore fails to sustain oscillation growth.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-609.jpg?height=314&width=411&top_left_y=1465&top_left_x=590)

Figure 15.4

The above example suggests that oscillation may occur if the circuit contains multiple stages and hence multiple poles. Indeed, such a topology was considered undesirable in Chapter 10 because it led to inadequate phase margin in op amps. We therefore surmise that if the circuit of Fig. 15.4 is modified as shown in Fig. 15.5, then two significant poles appear in the signal path, allowing the frequency-dependent
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-609.jpg?height=314&width=618&top_left_y=2091&top_left_x=489)

Figure 15.5 Two-pole feedback system.
phase shift to approach $180^{\circ}$. Unfortunately, this circuit exhibits positive feedback near zero frequency due to the signal inversion through each common-source stage. As a result, it simply "latches up" rather than oscillates. That is, if $V_{E}$ rises, $V_{F}$ falls, thereby turning $M_{1}$ off and allowing $V_{E}$ to rise further. This may continue until $V_{E}$ reaches $V_{D D}$ and $V_{F}$ drops to near zero, a state that will remain indefinitely.

To gain more insight into the oscillation conditions, let us assume that an ideal inverting stage (with zero phase shift at all frequencies) is inserted in the loop of Fig. 15.5, providing negative feedback near zero frequency and eliminating the problem of latch-up (Fig. 15.6). Does this circuit oscillate? We note that the loop contains only two poles: one at $E$ and another at $F$. The frequency-dependent phase shift can therefore reach $180^{\circ}$, but at a frequency of infinity. Since the loop gain vanishes at very high frequencies, we observe that the circuit does not satisfy both of Barkhausen's criteria at the same frequency (Fig. 15.7), and thus fails to oscillate.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-610.jpg?height=325&width=708&top_left_y=848&top_left_x=513)

Figure 15.7 Loop gain characteristics of a two-pole system.
The foregoing discussion points to the need for greater phase shift around the loop, suggesting the possibility of oscillation if the third inverting stage in Fig. 15.6 contains a pole that contributes significant phase. We then arrive at the topology depicted in Fig. 15.8. If the three stages are identical, the total phase shift around the loop, $\phi$, reaches $-135^{\circ}$ at $\omega=\omega_{p, E}\left(=\omega_{p, F}=\omega_{p, G}\right)$ and $-270^{\circ}$ at $\omega=\infty$. Consequently, $\phi$ equals $-180^{\circ}$ at $\omega<\infty$, where the loop gain can still be greater than or equal to unity. This circuit indeed oscillates if the loop gain is sufficient and it is an example of a ring oscillator.

It is instructive to calculate the minimum voltage gain per stage in Fig. 15.8 that is necessary for oscillation. Neglecting the effect of the gate-drain overlap capacitance and denoting the transfer function of each stage by $-A_{0} /\left(1+s / \omega_{0}\right)$, we have for the loop gain

$$
\begin{equation*}
H(s)=-\frac{A_{0}^{3}}{\left(1+\frac{s}{\omega_{0}}\right)^{3}} \tag{15.6}
\end{equation*}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-611.jpg?height=328&width=840&top_left_y=364&top_left_x=654)

Figure 15.8 Three-stage ring oscillator.

The circuit oscillates only if the frequency-dependent phase shift equals $180^{\circ}$, i.e., if each stage contributes $60^{\circ}$. The frequency at which this occurs is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\tan ^{-1} \frac{\omega_{\text {osc }}}{\omega_{0}}=60^{\circ} \tag{15.7}
\end{equation*}
$$

and hence

$$
\begin{equation*}
\omega_{o s c}=\sqrt{3} \omega_{0} \tag{15.8}
\end{equation*}
$$

The minimum voltage gain per stage must be such that the magnitude of the loop gain at $\omega_{o s c}$ is equal to unity:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{A_{0}^{3}}{\left[\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{\omega_{\text {osc }}}{\omega_{0}}\right)^{2}}\right]^{3}}=1 \tag{15.9}
\end{equation*}
$$

It follows from (15.8) and (15.9) that

$$
\begin{equation*}
A_{0}=2 \tag{15.10}
\end{equation*}
$$

In summary, a three-stage ring oscillator requires a low-frequency gain of 2 per stage, and it oscillates at a frequency of $\sqrt{3} \omega_{0}$, where $\omega_{0}$ is the $3-\mathrm{dB}$ bandwidth of each stage.

Let us now examine the waveforms at the three nodes of the oscillator of Fig. 15.8. Since each stage contributes a frequency-dependent phase shift of $60^{\circ}$ as well as a low-frequency signal inversion, the waveform at each node is $240^{\circ}$ (or $120^{\circ}$ ) out of phase with respect to its neighboring nodes (Fig. 15.9). The ability to generate multiple phases is a very useful property of ring oscillators.

Figure 15.10 Linear model of three-stage ring oscillator.

Amplitude Limiting The natural question at this point is-What happens if in the three-stage ring of Fig. 15.8, $A_{0} \neq 2$ ? We know from Barkhausen's criteria that if $A_{0}<2$, the circuit fails to oscillate, but what if $A_{0}>2$ ? To answer this question, we first model the oscillator by a linear feedback system, as depicted in Fig. 15.10. Note that the feedback is positive (i.e., $V_{\text {out }}$ is added to $V_{i n}$ ) because $H(s)$ in Eq. (15.6) already includes the negative polarity resulting from three inversions in the signal path. The closed-loop transfer function is

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{V_{\text {out }}(s)}{V_{\text {in }}(s)} & =\frac{\frac{-A_{0}^{3}}{\left(1+s / \omega_{0}\right)^{3}}}{1+\frac{A_{0}^{3}}{\left(1+s / \omega_{0}\right)^{3}}}  \tag{15.11}\\
& =\frac{-A_{0}^{3}}{\left(1+s / \omega_{0}\right)^{3}+A_{0}^{3}} \tag{15.12}
\end{align*}
$$

The denominator of (15.12) can be expanded as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left(1+\frac{s}{\omega_{0}}\right)^{3}+A_{0}^{3}=\left(1+\frac{s}{\omega_{0}}+A_{0}\right)\left[\left(1+\frac{s}{\omega_{0}}\right)^{2}-\left(1+\frac{s}{\omega_{0}}\right) A_{0}+A_{0}^{2}\right] \tag{15.13}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus, the closed-loop system exhibits three poles:

$$
\begin{align*}
s_{1} & =\left(-A_{0}-1\right) \omega_{0}  \tag{15.14}\\
s_{2,3} & =\left[\frac{A_{0}(1 \pm j \sqrt{3})}{2}-1\right] \omega_{0} \tag{15.15}
\end{align*}
$$

Since $A_{0}$ itself is positive, the first pole leads to a decaying exponential term: $\exp \left[\left(-A_{0}-1\right) \omega_{0} t\right]$, which can be neglected in the steady state. Figure 15.11 illustrates the locations of the poles for different values of $A_{0}$, revealing that for $A_{0}>2$, the two complex poles exhibit a positive real part and hence give rise to a growing sinusoid. Neglecting the effect of $s_{1}$, we express the output waveform as

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text {out }}(t)=a \exp \left(\frac{A_{0}-2}{2} \omega_{0} t\right) \cos \left(\frac{A_{0} \sqrt{3}}{2} \omega_{0} t\right) \tag{15.16}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus, if $A_{0}>2$, the exponential envelope grows to infinity.
In practice, as the oscillation amplitude increases, the stages in the signal path experience nonlinearity and eventually "saturation," limiting the maximum amplitude. We may say that the poles begin in the right half plane and eventually move to the imaginary axis to stop the growth. If the small-signal loop

Figure 15.11 Poles of three-stage ring oscillator for various values of gain.
gain is greater than unity, the circuit must spend enough time in saturation so that the "average" loop gain is still equal to unity. ${ }^{3}$

#### Example 15.2

Shown in Fig. 15.12 is a differential implementation of the oscillator of Fig. 15.8. What is the maximum voltage swing of each stage?
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-613.jpg?height=736&width=1015&top_left_y=1194&top_left_x=572)

Figure 15.12

#### Solution

If the gain per stage is well above 2, then the amplitude grows until each differential pair experiences complete switching, that is, until $I_{S S}$ is completely steered to one side every half cycle. As a result, the swing at each node is equal to $I_{S S} R_{1}$. From the waveforms shown in Fig. 15.12, we also observe that each stage is in its high-gain region for only a fraction of the period, (e.g., when $\left|V_{X}-V_{Y}\right|$ is small).

Figure 15.13 Ring oscillator using CMOS inverters.

A simple implementation of ring oscillators that does not require resistors is depicted in Fig. 15.13. Suppose the circuit is released with an initial voltage at each node equal to the trip point of the inverters, $V_{\text {trip }} .{ }^{4}$ With identical stages and no noise in the devices, the circuit would remain in this state indefinitely, ${ }^{5}$ but noise components disturb each node voltage, yielding a growing waveform. The signal eventually exhibits rail-to-rail swings.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-614.jpg?height=455&width=830&top_left_y=1257&top_left_x=564)

Figure 15.14 Waveforms of ring oscillator when one node is initialized at $V_{D D}$.

Let us now assume that the circuit of Fig. 15.13 begins with $V_{X}=V_{D D}$ (Fig. 15.14). Under this condition, $V_{Y}=0$ and $V_{Z}=V_{D D}$. Thus, when the circuit is released, $V_{X}$ begins to fall to zero (because the first inverter senses a high input), forcing $V_{Y}$ to rise to $V_{D D}$ after one inverter delay, $T_{D}$, and $V_{Z}$ to fall to zero after another inverter delay. The circuit therefore oscillates with a delay of $T_{D}$ between consecutive node voltages, yielding a period of $6 T_{D}$.

The above small-signal and large-signal analyses raise an interesting question. While the small-signal oscillation frequency is given by $A_{0} \sqrt{3} \omega_{0} / 2$ [from Eq. (15.16)], the large-signal value is $1 /\left(6 T_{D}\right)$. Are these two values equal? Not necessarily. After all, $\omega_{0}$ is determined by the small-signal output resistance and capacitance of each inverter near the trip point, whereas $T_{D}$ results from the large-signal, nonlinear

current drive and capacitances of each stage. In other words, when the circuit is released with all inverters at their trip point, the oscillation begins with a frequency of $\sqrt{3} A_{0} \omega_{0} / 2$, but, as the amplitude grows and the circuit becomes nonlinear, the frequency shifts to $1 /\left(6 T_{D}\right)$ (which is a lower value).

Ring oscillators employing more than three stages are also feasible. The total number of inversions in the loop must be odd so that the circuit does not latch up. For example, as shown in Fig. 15.15(a), a ring can incorporate five inverters, providing a frequency of $1 /\left(10 T_{D}\right)$. On the other hand, the differential implementation can utilize an even number of stages by simply configuring one stage such that it does not invert. Illustrated in Fig. 15.15(b), this flexibility demonstrates another advantage of differential circuits over their single-ended counterparts.

#### Example 15.3

What is the minimum required voltage gain per stage in the four-stage oscillator of Fig. 15.15(b)? How many signal phases are provided by the circuit?

#### Solution

Using a notation similar to that for Fig. 15.8, we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
H(s)=-\frac{A_{0}^{4}}{\left(1+\frac{s}{\omega_{0}}\right)^{4}} \tag{15.17}
\end{equation*}
$$

For the circuit to oscillate, each stage must contribute a frequency-dependent phase shift of $180^{\circ} / 4=45^{\circ}$. The frequency at which this occurs is given by $\tan ^{-1} \omega_{\text {osc }} / \omega_{0}=45^{\circ}$ and hence $\omega_{\text {osc }}=\omega_{0}$. The minimum voltage gain is therefore derived as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{A_{0}}{\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{\omega_{o s c}}{\omega_{0}}\right)^{2}}}=1 \tag{15.18}
\end{equation*}
$$

That is, $A_{0}=\sqrt{2}$. As expected, this value is lower than that required in a three-stage ring.
With $45^{\circ}$ of phase shift per stage, the oscillator provides four phases and their complements. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.16.

The number of stages in a ring oscillator is determined by various requirements, including speed, power dissipation, noise immunity, etc. In most applications, three to five stages provide optimum performance (for differential implementations).

Figure 15.16

#### Example 15.4

Determine the maximum voltage swings and the minimum supply voltage of a ring oscillator incorporating differential pairs with resistive loads (e.g., as in Fig. 15.12) if no transistor must enter the triode region. Assume that each stage experiences complete switching.

#### Solution

Figure 15.17(a) shows two stages in cascade. If each stage experiences complete switching, then each drain voltage, e.g., $V_{X}$ or $V_{Y}$, varies between $V_{D D}$ and $V_{D D}-I_{S S} R_{P}$. Thus, when $M_{1}$ is fully on, its gate and drain voltages are equal to $V_{D D}$ and $V_{D D}-I_{S S} R_{P}$, respectively. For this transistor to remain in saturation, we have $I_{S S} R_{P} \leq V_{T H}$, i.e., the peak-to-peak swing at each drain must not exceed $V_{T H}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-616.jpg?height=808&width=1511&top_left_y=1376&top_left_x=384)

Figure 15.17

How is the minimum supply voltage determined? If $V_{D D}$ is lowered, the voltage at the common source node of each differential pair, e.g., $V_{P}$ in Fig. 15.17(a), falls, eventually driving the tail transistor into the triode region. We must therefore calculate $V_{P}$ for the worst case, noting that $V_{P}$ does vary with time because $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ carry unequal currents when the input difference becomes large.

Now consider the stand-alone circuit of Fig. 15.17(b), assuming that the inputs vary between $V_{D D}$ and $V_{D D}-$ $I_{S S} R_{P}$. How does $V_{P}$ vary? When the gate voltage of $M_{1}, V_{1}$, is equal to $V_{D D}$ and $M_{1}$ carries all of $I_{S S}$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{P}=V_{D D}-\sqrt{\frac{2 I_{S S}}{\mu_{n} C_{o x}(W / L)_{1,2}}}-V_{T H} \tag{15.19}
\end{equation*}
$$

As $V_{1}$ falls and $V_{2}$ rises, so does $V_{P}$ because, so long as $M_{2}$ is off, $M_{1}$ operates as a source follower. When the difference between $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ reaches $\sqrt{2}\left(V_{G S, e q}-V_{T H}\right)$, where $V_{G S, e q}$ denotes the equilibrium overdrive of each transistor, $M_{2}$ turns on. To calculate $V_{P}$ after this point, we note that $I_{D 1}+I_{D 2}=I_{S S}, V_{G S 1}=V_{1}-V_{P}$, and $V_{G S 2}=V_{2}-V_{P}$. Thus,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{2} \mu_{n} C_{o x}\left(\frac{W}{L}\right)_{1,2}\left(V_{1}-V_{P}-V_{T H}\right)^{2}+\frac{1}{2} \mu_{n} C_{o x}\left(\frac{W}{L}\right)_{1,2}\left(V_{2}-V_{P}-V_{T H}\right)^{2}=I_{S S} \tag{15.20}
\end{equation*}
$$

Expanding the quadratic terms and rearranging the result, we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
2 V_{P}^{2}-2\left(V_{1}-V_{T H}+V_{2}-V_{T H}\right) V_{P}+\left(V_{1}-V_{T H}\right)^{2}+\left(V_{2}-V_{T H}\right)^{2}-\frac{2 I_{S S}}{\mu_{n} C_{o x}(W / L)_{1,2}}=0 \tag{15.21}
\end{equation*}
$$

It follows that

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{P}=\frac{1}{2}\left[V_{1}+V_{2}-2 V_{T H} \pm \sqrt{-\left(V_{1}-V_{2}\right)^{2}+\frac{4 I_{S S}}{\mu_{n} C_{o x}(W / L)_{1,2}}}\right] \tag{15.22}
\end{equation*}
$$

If $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ vary differentially, they can be expressed as $V_{1}=V_{C M}+\Delta V$ and $V_{2}=V_{C M}-\Delta V$, where $V_{C M}=V_{D D}-I_{S S} R_{P} / 2$, yielding

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{P}=V_{C M}-V_{T H} \pm \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{-(2 \Delta V)^{2}+\frac{4 I_{S S}}{\mu_{n} C_{o x}(W / L)_{1,2}}} \tag{15.23}
\end{equation*}
$$

This expression reveals why node $P$ is considered a virtual ground in small-signal operation: if $|\Delta V|$ is much less than the maximum overdrive voltage, then $V_{P}$ is relatively constant. Since the term under the square root reaches a maximum for $\Delta V=0$ (equilibrium condition),

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{P, \min }=V_{C M}-V_{T H}-\sqrt{\frac{I_{S S}}{\mu_{n} C_{o x}(W / L)_{1,2}}} \tag{15.24}
\end{equation*}
$$

As expected, the last term in (15.24) represents the overdrive voltage of each transistor in equilibrium (where $I_{D 1}=I_{D 2}=I_{S S} / 2$ ).

Figure 15.17(c) shows typical waveforms in the oscillator. Note that $V_{P}$ varies at twice the oscillation frequency. This property is sometimes exploited in "frequency doublers."

To determine the minimum supply voltage, we write $V_{P, \text { min }} \geq V_{I S S}$, where $V_{I S S}$ denotes the minimum required voltage across $I_{S S}$. Thus,

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{D D}-\frac{R_{P} I_{S S}}{2}-V_{T H}-\sqrt{\frac{I_{S S}}{\mu_{n} C_{o x}(W / L)_{1,2}}} \geq V_{I S S} \tag{15.25}
\end{equation*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{D D} \geq V_{I S S}+V_{T H}+\sqrt{\frac{I_{S S}}{\mu_{n} C_{o x}(W / L)_{1,2}}}+\frac{R_{P} I_{S S}}{2} \tag{15.26}
\end{equation*}
$$

The terms on the right are the voltage headroom consumed by a current source, one threshold voltage, the equilibrium overdrive, and half of the swing at each node.

In CMOS technologies lacking high-quality resistors, the implementation of Fig. 15.17(a) must be modified. While a PMOS transistor operating in the deep triode region can serve as the load [Fig. 15.18(a)], the gate voltage must be set so as to define the on-resistance accurately. Alternatively, a diodeconnected load can be utilized [Fig. 15.18(b)], but at the cost of one threshold voltage in the headroom. Figure 15.18(c) shows a more efficient load where an NMOS source follower is inserted between the drain and gate of each PMOS transistor. With the output sensed at nodes $X$ and $Y, M_{3}$ and $M_{4}$ consume only a voltage headroom equal to $\left|V_{D S 3,4}\right|$. If $V_{G S 5} \approx V_{T H 3}$, then $M_{3}$ operates at the edge of the triode region and the small-signal resistance of the load is roughly equal to $1 / g_{m 3}$ (with the assumption that $\lambda=\gamma=0$ ) (Problem 15.4).

Figure 15.18 Differential stages using PMOS loads.
The load of Fig. 15.18(c) exhibits another interesting property as well. Since the gate-source capacitance of $M_{3}$ is driven by the source follower, the time constant associated with the load is smaller than that of a diode-connected transistor. Also, the finite output resistance of the follower may yield an inductive behavior for the load (Problem 15.5).

## 15.3 ■ LC Oscillators

Monolithic inductors have become common in CMOS technologies, making it possible to design oscillators based on passive resonant circuits. Before delving into such oscillators, it is instructive to review the basic properties of RLC circuits.

### 15.3.1 Basic Concepts

As shown in Fig. 15.19(a), an inductor $L_{1}$ placed in parallel with a capacitor $C_{1}$ resonates at a frequency $\omega_{\text {res }}=1 / \sqrt{L_{1} C_{1}}$. At this frequency, the impedances of the inductor, $j L_{1} \omega_{\text {res }}$, and the capacitor, $1 /\left(j C_{1} \omega_{\text {res }}\right)$, are equal and opposite, thereby yielding an infinite impedance. We say that the circuit has an infinite quality factor, $Q$. In practice, inductors (and capacitors) suffer from resistive components. For example, the series resistance of the metal wire used in the inductor can be modeled as shown in Fig. 15.19(b). We define the $Q$ of the inductor as $L_{1} \omega / R_{S}$. For this circuit, the reader can show that the equivalent impedance is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
Z_{e q}(s)=\frac{R_{S}+L_{1} s}{1+L_{1} C_{1} s^{2}+R_{S} C_{1} s} \tag{15.27}
\end{equation*}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-619.jpg?height=368&width=563&top_left_y=370&top_left_x=531)

Figure 15.19 (a) Ideal and (b) realistic LC tanks.
and hence,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|Z_{e q}(s=j \omega)\right|^{2}=\frac{R_{S}^{2}+L_{1}^{2} \omega^{2}}{\left(1-L_{1} C_{1} \omega^{2}\right)^{2}+R_{S}^{2} C_{1}^{2} \omega^{2}} \tag{15.28}
\end{equation*}
$$

That is, the impedance does not go to infinity at any $s=j \omega$. We say that the circuit has a finite $Q$. The magnitude of $Z_{e q}$ in (15.28) reaches a peak in the vicinity of $\omega=1 / \sqrt{L_{1} C_{1}}$, but the actual resonance frequency has some dependency on $R_{S}$.

The circuit of Fig. 15.19(b) can be transformed to an equivalent topology that more easily lends itself to analysis and design. To this end, we first consider the series combination shown in Fig. 15.20(a). For a narrow frequency range, it is possible to convert the circuit to the parallel configuration of Fig. 15.20(b).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-619.jpg?height=325&width=535&top_left_y=1279&top_left_x=545)

Figure 15.20 Conversion of a series combination to a parallel combination.

For the two impedances to be equivalent,

$$
\begin{equation*}
L_{1} s+R_{S}=\frac{R_{P} L_{P} s}{R_{P}+L_{P} s} \tag{15.29}
\end{equation*}
$$

Considering only the steady-state response, we assume that $s=j \omega$ and rewrite (15.29) as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left(L_{1} R_{P}+L_{P} R_{S}\right) j \omega+R_{S} R_{P}-L_{1} L_{P} \omega^{2}=R_{P} L_{P} j \omega \tag{15.30}
\end{equation*}
$$

This relationship must hold for all values of $\omega$ (in a narrow range), dictating that

$$
\begin{align*}
L_{1} R_{P}+L_{P} R_{S} & =R_{P} L_{P}  \tag{15.31}\\
R_{S} R_{P}-L_{1} L_{P} \omega^{2} & =0 \tag{15.32}
\end{align*}
$$

Calculating $R_{P}$ from the latter and substituting in the former, we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
L_{P}=L_{1}\left(1+\frac{R_{S}^{2}}{L_{1}^{2} \omega^{2}}\right) \tag{15.33}
\end{equation*}
$$

Recall that $L_{1} \omega / R_{S}=Q$, a value typically greater than 3 for monolithic inductors. Thus,

$$
\begin{equation*}
L_{P} \approx L_{1} \tag{15.34}
\end{equation*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{align*}
R_{P} & \approx \frac{L_{1}^{2} \omega^{2}}{R_{S}}  \tag{15.35}\\
& \approx Q^{2} R_{S} \tag{15.36}
\end{align*}
$$

In other words, the parallel network has the same reactance but a resistance $Q^{2}$ times the series resistance. This concept holds valid for a first-order RC network as well if the $Q$ of the series combination is defined as $1 /(C \omega) / R_{S}$.

Figure 15.21 Conversion of a tank to three parallel components.

The above transformation allows the conversion illustrated in Fig. 15.21, where $C_{P}=C_{1}$. The equivalence of course breaks down as $\omega$ departs substantially from the resonance frequency. The insight gained from the parallel combination is that at $\omega_{1}=1 / \sqrt{L_{p} C_{p}}$, the tank reduces to a simple resistor; i.e., the phase difference between the voltage and current of the tank drops to zero. Plotting the magnitude of the tank impedance versus frequency [Fig. 15.22(a)], we note that the behavior is inductive for $\omega<\omega_{1}$ and capacitive for $\omega>\omega_{1}$. We then surmise that the phase of the impedance is positive for $\omega<\omega_{1}$ and negative for $\omega>\omega_{1}$ [Fig. 15.22(b)]. These observations prove useful in studying LC oscillators. (Why do we expect the phase shift to approach $+90^{\circ}$ at very low frequencies and $-90^{\circ}$ at very high frequencies?)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-620.jpg?height=738&width=633&top_left_y=1681&top_left_x=568)

Figure 15.22 (a) Magnitude and (b) phase of the impedance of an LC tank as a function of frequency.

Let us now consider the "tuned" stage of Fig. 15.23(a), where an LC tank operates as the load. At resonance, $j L_{p} \omega=1 /\left(j C_{p} \omega\right)$ and the voltage gain equals $-g_{m 1} R_{P}$. (Note that the gain of the circuit is very small at frequencies near zero.) Does this circuit oscillate if the output is connected to the input [Fig. 15.23(b)]? At resonance, the total phase shift around the loop is equal to $180^{\circ}$ (rather than $360^{\circ}$ ). Also, from Fig. 15.22(b), the frequency-dependent phase shift of the tank never reaches $180^{\circ}$. Thus, the circuit does not oscillate.

(b)

Figure 15.23 (a) Tuned gain stage; (b) stage of (a) in feedback.
Before modifying the circuit for oscillatory behavior, let us observe another interesting property of the gain stage of Fig. 15.23(a) that distinguishes it from a common-source topology using a resistive load. Suppose, as shown in Fig. 15.24, the stage is biased at a drain current $I_{1}$. If the series resistance of $L_{p}$ is small, the dc level of $V_{\text {out }}$ is close to $V_{D D}$. How does $V_{\text {out }}$ vary if a small sinusoidal voltage at the resonance frequency is applied to the input? We expect $V_{\text {out }}$ to be an inverted sinusoid with an average value near $V_{D D}$ because the inductor cannot sustain a large dc drop. In other words, if the average value of $V_{\text {out }}$ deviates significantly from $V_{D D}$, then the inductor series resistance must carry an average current greater than $I_{1}$. Thus, the peak output level in fact exceeds the supply voltage, an important and often useful attribute of the LC load. For example, with proper design, the output peak-to-peak swing can be larger than $V_{D D}$.

We now study two types of LC oscillators.

### 15.3.2 Cross-Coupled Oscillator

Suppose we place two stages of Fig. 15.23(a) in a cascade, as depicted in Fig. 15.25. While similar to the topology of Fig. 15.5, this configuration does not latch up because its low-frequency gain is very small. Furthermore, at resonance, the total phase shift around the loop is zero because each stage contributes zero frequency-dependent phase shift. That is, if $g_{m 1} R_{P} g_{m 2} R_{P} \geq 1$, then the loop oscillates. Note that $V_{X}$ and $V_{Y}$ are differential waveforms. (Why?)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-622.jpg?height=380&width=635&top_left_y=378&top_left_x=561)

Figure 15.25 Two tuned stages in a feedback loop.

#### Example 15.5

Sketch the open-loop voltage gain and phase of the circuit shown in Fig. 15.25. Neglect transistor capacitances.

#### Solution

The magnitude of the transfer function has a shape similar to that in Fig. 15.22(a), but with a sharper rise and fall because it results from the product of those of the two stages. The total phase at low frequencies is given by signal inversion by each common-source stage plus a $90^{\circ}$ phase shift due to each tank. A similar behavior occurs at high frequencies. The gain and phase are sketched in Fig. 15.26. From these plots, the reader can prove that the circuit cannot oscillate at any other frequency.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-622.jpg?height=724&width=1304&top_left_y=1197&top_left_x=505)

Figure 15.26 Loop gain characteristics of the circuit shown in Fig. 15.25.

The circuit of Fig. 15.25 serves as the core of many LC oscillators and is sometimes drawn as in Fig. 15.27(a) or (b). However, the drain currents of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$, and hence the output swings, heavily depend on the supply voltage. Since the waveforms at $X$ and $Y$ are differential, the drawing in Fig. 15.27(b) suggests that $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ can be converted to a differential pair as depicted in Fig. 15.27(c), where the total bias current is defined by $I_{S S}$.

#### Example 15.6

For the circuit of Fig. 15.27(c), plot $V_{X}$ and $V_{Y}$ and $I_{D 1}$ and $I_{D 2}$ as the oscillation begins.

(c)

Figure 15.27 (a) Redrawing of the oscillator shown in Fig. 15.25; (b) another redrawing of the circuit; (c) addition of tail current source to lower supply sensitivity.

#### Solution

If the circuit begins with zero difference between $V_{X}$ and $V_{Y}$, then $V_{X}=V_{Y} \approx V_{D D}$. The two transistors share the tail current equally. If $\left(g_{m 1,2} R_{P}\right)^{2} \geq 1$, where $R_{P}$ is the equivalent parallel resistance of the tank at resonance, then noise components at the resonance frequency are amplified by $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$, allowing the oscillation to grow. The drain currents of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ vary according to the instantaneous value of $V_{X}-V_{Y}$ (as in a differential pair).

As shown in Fig. 15.28, the oscillation amplitude grows until the loop gain drops at the peaks. In fact, if $g_{m 1,2} R_{P}$ is large enough, the difference between $V_{X}-V_{Y}$ reaches a level that steers the entire tail current to one transistor, turning the other off. Thus, in the steady state, $I_{D 1}$ and $I_{D 2}$ vary between zero and $I_{S S}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-623.jpg?height=396&width=714&top_left_y=1793&top_left_x=457)

Figure 15.28

The oscillator of Fig. 15.27(c) is constructed in fully differential form. The supply sensitivity of the circuit, however, is nonzero even with perfect symmetry. This is because the drain junction capacitances of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ vary with the supply voltage. We return to this issue in Example 15.9.

### 15.3.3 Colpitts Oscillator

An LC oscillator may be realized with only one transistor in the signal path. Consider the gain stage of Fig. 15.23(a) again and recall that the drain voltage cannot be applied to the gate because the overall phase shift at resonance equals $180^{\circ}$ rather than $360^{\circ}$. Also, recall that in a common-gate stage, the phase shift from the source to the drain is zero. We then surmise that if, as shown in Fig. 15.29(a), the drain voltage is returned to the source rather than the gate, the circuit may oscillate. The coupling must incorporate a capacitor to avoid disturbing the bias point of $M_{1}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-624.jpg?height=540&width=868&top_left_y=732&top_left_x=723)

Figure 15.29 (a) Tuned stage with feedback applied from drain to source; (b) addition of input current to calculate closed-loop gain.

Unfortunately, owing to insufficient loop gain, the circuit of Fig. 15.29(a) does not oscillate. To prove this point, we invoke the view of Fig. 15.1, where an oscillator is considered a feedback system with infinite closed-loop gain. Applying an input current as depicted in Fig. 15.29(b) and neglecting transistor parasitics, we obtain the closed-loop gain as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{V_{\text {out }}}{I_{\text {in }}}=L_{P} s\left\|\frac{1}{C_{P} S}\right\| R_{P} \tag{15.37}
\end{equation*}
$$

because $M_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ directly conduct the input current to the tank. Since the closed-loop gain cannot be equal to infinity at any frequency, the circuit fails to oscillate.

#### Example 15.7

The reader may wonder why the input to the feedback system is realized as a current source applied to the source of the transistor rather than a voltage source applied to its gate. Perform the analysis with the latter stimulus.

#### Solution

From Fig. 15.30, we note that with a finite variation of $V_{i n}$, the change in $I_{b}$ is still zero if the bias current source is ideal. Thus, if the source-bulk junction capacitance of $M_{1}$ is neglected, the change in the tank current is zero, yielding $V_{\text {out }} / V_{\text {in }}=0$. Interestingly, $V_{X}$ does vary with $V_{i n}$, but $M_{1}$ generates a small-signal current that cancels that through $C_{2}$. The reader can prove that $V_{X} / V_{i n}=g_{m} /\left(g_{m}+C_{2} s\right)$.

The above example reveals two important points. First, to excite a circuit into oscillation, the stimulus can be applied at different points. (That is, the noise of any device in the loop can initiate the
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-625.jpg?height=469&width=417&top_left_y=380&top_left_x=607)

Figure 15.30
oscillation. ${ }^{6}$ ) Second, in Fig. 15.30, $V_{\text {out }} / V_{\text {in }}$ is zero because the impedance connected between the source of $M_{1}$ and ground is infinity. We then add a capacitor from this node to ground as shown in Fig. 15.31(a), seeking conditions of oscillation. Note that the capacitor in parallel with $L_{P}$ is removed. The reason will become clear later.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-625.jpg?height=461&width=331&top_left_y=1096&top_left_x=541)

(b)

Figure 15.31 (a) Colpitts oscillator; (b) equivalent circuit of (a) with input stimulus.
Approximating $M_{1}$ by a single voltage-dependent current source, we construct the equivalent circuit of Fig. 15.31(b). Since the current through the parallel combination of $L_{P}$ and $R_{P}$ is given by $V_{\text {out }} /\left(L_{P} s\right)+$ $V_{\text {out }} / R_{P}$, the total current through $C_{1}$ is equal to $I_{\text {in }}-V_{\text {out }} /\left(L_{P} s\right)-V_{\text {out }} / R_{P}$, yielding

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{1}=-\left(I_{\text {in }}-\frac{V_{\text {out }}}{L_{P} S}-\frac{V_{\text {out }}}{R_{P}}\right) \frac{1}{C_{1} S} \tag{15.38}
\end{equation*}
$$

Writing the current through $C_{2}$ as $\left(V_{\text {out }}+V_{1}\right) C_{2} s$, we sum all of the currents at the output node:

$$
\begin{equation*}
-g_{m}\left(I_{\text {in }}-\frac{V_{\text {out }}}{L_{P} S}-\frac{V_{\text {out }}}{R_{P}}\right) \frac{1}{C_{1} s}+\left[V_{\text {out }}-\left(I_{\text {in }}-\frac{V_{\text {out }}}{L_{P} S}-\frac{V_{\text {out }}}{R_{P}}\right) \frac{1}{C_{1} s}\right] C_{2} s+\frac{V_{\text {out }}}{L_{P} S}+\frac{V_{\text {out }}}{R_{P}}=0 \tag{15.39}
\end{equation*}
$$

It follows that

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{V_{\text {out }}}{I_{\text {in }}}=\frac{R_{P} L_{P} s\left(g_{m}+C_{2} s\right)}{R_{P} C_{1} C_{2} L_{P} s^{3}+\left(C_{1}+C_{2}\right) L_{P} s^{2}+\left[g_{m} L_{P}+R_{P}\left(C_{1}+C_{2}\right)\right] s+g_{m} R_{P}} \tag{15.40}
\end{equation*}
$$

[^105]Note that, as expected, (15.40) reduces to $\left(L_{P} S \| R_{P}\right)$ if $C_{1}=0$. The circuit oscillates if the closed-loop transfer function goes to infinity at an imaginary value of $s, s_{R}=j \omega_{R}$. Consequently, both the real and imaginary parts of the denominator must drop to zero at this frequency:

$$
\begin{align*}
& -R_{P} C_{1} C_{2} L_{P} \omega_{R}^{3}+\left[g_{m} L_{P}+R_{P}\left(C_{1}+C_{2}\right)\right] \omega_{R}=0  \tag{15.41}\\
& -\left(C_{1}+C_{2}\right) L_{P} \omega_{R}^{2}+g_{m} R_{P}=0 \tag{15.42}
\end{align*}
$$

Since with typical values, $g_{m} L_{P} \ll R_{P}\left(C_{1}+C_{2}\right)$, Eq. (15.41) yields,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\omega_{R}^{2}=\frac{1}{L_{P} \frac{C_{1} C_{2}}{C_{1}+C_{2}}} \tag{15.43}
\end{equation*}
$$

and Eq. (15.42) results in

$$
\begin{align*}
g_{m} R_{P} & =\frac{\left(C_{1}+C_{2}\right)^{2}}{C_{1} C_{2}}  \tag{15.44}\\
& =\frac{C_{1}}{C_{2}}\left(1+\frac{C_{2}}{C_{1}}\right)^{2} \tag{15.45}
\end{align*}
$$

Recognizing that $g_{m} R_{P}$ is the voltage gain from the source of $M_{1}$ to the output (if $g_{m b}=0$ ), we determine the ratio $C_{1} / C_{2}$ for the minimum required gain. The reader can prove that the minimum occurs for $C_{1} / C_{2}=1$, requiring

$$
\begin{equation*}
g_{m} R_{P} \geq 4 \tag{15.46}
\end{equation*}
$$

Equation (15.46) demonstrates an important disadvantage of the Colpitts oscillator with respect to the cross-coupled topology of Fig. 15.27(c). The former demands a voltage gain of at least 4 at resonance, and the latter, only unity. This issue is critical if the inductor suffers from a low $Q$ and hence a small $R_{P}$, a common situation in CMOS technologies. As a consequence, the cross-coupled scheme is used more widely.

The foregoing analysis neglected the capacitance that appears in parallel with the inductor. As suggested in Problem 15.10, if this capacitance, $C_{P}$, is included in the equivalent circuit, Eq. (15.43) is modified as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\omega_{R}^{2}=\frac{1}{L_{P}\left(C_{P}+\frac{C_{1} C_{2}}{C_{1}+C_{2}}\right)} \tag{15.47}
\end{equation*}
$$

whereas (15.46) remains unchanged. Thus, $C_{P}$ is simply included in parallel with the series combination of $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$.

### 15.3.4 One-Port Oscillators

Our development of oscillators thus far has been based on feedback systems. An alternative view that provides more insight into the oscillation phenomenon employs the concept of "negative resistance." To arrive at this view, let us first consider a simple tank that is stimulated by a current impulse [Fig. 15.32(a)]. The tank responds with a decaying oscillatory behavior because, in every cycle, some of the energy that reciprocates between the capacitor and the inductor is lost in the form of heat in the resistor. Now suppose a resistor equal to $-R_{P}$ is placed in parallel with $R_{P}$ and the experiment is repeated [Fig. 15.32(b)].
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-627.jpg?height=871&width=995&top_left_y=363&top_left_x=588)

Since $R_{P} \|\left(-R_{P}\right)=\infty$, the tank oscillates indefinitely. Thus, if a one-port circuit exhibiting a negative resistance is placed in parallel with a tank [Fig. 15.32(c)], the combination may oscillate. Such a topology is called a one-port oscillator.

How can a circuit provide a negative resistance? Recall that feedback multiplies or divides the input and output impedances of circuits by a factor equal to one plus the loop gain. Thus, if the loop gain is sufficiently negative (i.e., the feedback is sufficiently positive), a negative resistance is achieved. As a simple example, let us apply positive feedback around a source follower. The follower introduces no signal inversion, and neither must the feedback network. As depicted in Fig. 15.33(a), we implement the feedback by a common-gate stage and add the current source $I_{b}$ to provide the bias current of $M_{2}{ }^{7}$ From the equivalent circuit in Fig. 15.33(b) (where channel-length modulation and body effect are neglected),

Negative resistance becomes more intuitive if we bear in mind that it is an incremental quantity; that is, negative resistance indicates that if the applied voltage increases, the current drawn by the circuit decreases. In Fig. 15.33(a), for example, if the input voltage increases, so does the source voltage of $M_{1}$, decreasing the drain current of $M_{2}$ and allowing part of $I_{b}$ to flow to the input source.

Figure 15.34 Oscillator using the negative input resistance of a source follower with positive feedback.

With a negative resistance available, we can now construct an oscillator as illustrated in Fig. 15.34. Here, $R_{P}$ denotes the equivalent parallel resistance of the tank and, for oscillation build-up, $R_{P}-2 / g_{m} \geq 0$. Note that the inductor provides the bias current of $M_{2}$, obviating the need for a current source. If the small-signal resistance presented by $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ to the tank is less negative than $-R_{P}$, then the circuit experiences large swings such that each transistor is nearly off for part of the period, thereby yielding an "average" resistance of $-R_{P}$.

The circuit of Fig. 15.34 is similar to the stage of Fig. 15.29(a), but with the feedback capacitor replaced by a source follower. More interestingly, the circuit can be redrawn as in Fig. 15.35(a), bearing a resemblance to Fig. 15.27(c). In fact, if the drain current of $M_{1}$ flows through a tank and the resulting voltage is applied to the gate of $M_{2}$, the topology of Fig. 15.35(b) is obtained. Ignoring bias paths and merging the two tanks into one (Fig. 15.36), we note that the cross-coupled pair must provide a negative resistance of $-R_{P}$ between nodes $X$ and $Y$ to enable oscillation. The reader can prove that this resistance is equal to $-2 / g_{m}$ and hence it is necessary that $R_{P} \geq 1 / g_{m}$. Thus, the circuit can be viewed as either a feedback system or a negative resistance in parallel with a lossy tank. This topology is also called a "negative- $G_{m}$ oscillator."

For $s=j \omega$, this impedance consists of a negative resistance equal to $-g_{m} /\left(C_{1} C_{2} \omega^{2}\right)$ in series with the series combination of $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ [Fig. 15.37(b)]. Thus, as shown in Fig. 15.37(c), if an inductor is placed between the gate and drain of $M_{1}$, the circuit may oscillate. Of the three nodes in the circuit, one can be an ac ground, resulting in the three different topologies illustrated in Fig. 15.38. The circuit of Fig. 15.38(a) is in fact based on a source follower, whose input impedance was found in Chapter 6 to contain a negative real part. The configuration of Fig. 15.38(b) is a Colpitts oscillator.

## 15.4 ■ Voltage-Controlled Oscillators

Most applications require that oscillators be "tunable," i.e., that their output frequency be a function of a control input, usually a voltage. An ideal voltage-controlled oscillator is a circuit whose output frequency

is a linear function of its control voltage (Fig. 15.40):

$$
\begin{equation*}
\omega_{\text {out }}=\omega_{0}+K_{V C O} V_{\text {cont }} \tag{15.55}
\end{equation*}
$$

Here, $\omega_{0}$ represents the intercept corresponding to $V_{c o n t}=0$ and $K_{V C O}$ denotes the "gain" or "sensitivity" of the circuit (expressed in rad/s/V). ${ }^{8}$ The achievable range, $\omega_{2}-\omega_{1}$, is called the "tuning range."

#### Example 15.9

In the negative- $G_{m}$ oscillator of Fig. 15.27(c), assume that $C_{P}=0$, consider only the drain junction capacitance, $C_{D B}$, of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$, and explain why $V_{D D}$ can be viewed as the control voltage. Calculate the gain of the VCO.

#### Solution

Since $C_{D B}$ varies with the drain-bulk voltage, if $V_{D D}$ changes, so does the resonance frequency of the tank. Noting that the average voltage across $C_{D B}$ is approximately equal to $V_{D D}$, we write

$$
\begin{equation*}
C_{D B}=\frac{C_{D B 0}}{\left(1+\frac{V_{D D}}{\phi_{B}}\right)^{m}} \tag{15.56}
\end{equation*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{align*}
K_{V C O} & =\frac{\partial \omega_{\text {out }}}{\partial V_{D D}}  \tag{15.57}\\
& =\frac{\partial \omega_{\text {out }}}{\partial C_{D B}} \cdot \frac{\partial C_{D B}}{\partial V_{D D}} \tag{15.58}
\end{align*}
$$

With $\omega_{\text {out }}=1 / \sqrt{L_{P} C_{D B}}$, we have

$$
\begin{align*}
K_{V C O} & =\frac{-1}{2 \sqrt{L_{P} C_{D B} C_{D B}}} \cdot \frac{-m C_{D B}}{\phi_{B}\left(1+\frac{V_{D D}}{\phi_{B}}\right)}  \tag{15.59}\\
& =\frac{m}{2 \phi_{B}\left(1+\frac{V_{D D}}{\phi_{B}}\right)} \cdot \omega_{\text {out }} \tag{15.60}
\end{align*}
$$

Note that the relationship between $\omega_{\text {out }}$ and $V_{\text {cont }}$ is nonlinear because $K_{V C O}$ varies with $V_{D D}$ and $\omega_{\text {out }}$.

[^107]Before modifying the oscillators studied in the previous sections for tunability, we summarize the important performance parameters of VCOs.

Center Frequency The center frequency (i.e., the midrange value in Fig. 15.40) is determined by the environment in which the VCO is used. For example, in the clock generation network of a microprocessor, the VCO may be required to run at the clock rate or even twice that. Today's CMOS VCOs achieve center frequencies as high as hundreds of gigahertz.
Tuning Range The required tuning range is dictated by two parameters: (1) the variation of the VCO center frequency with process and temperature, and (2) the frequency range necessary for the application. The center frequency of some CMOS oscillators may vary by a factor of two at the extremes of process and temperature, thus mandating a sufficiently wide $(\geq 2 \times)$ tuning range to guarantee that the VCO output frequency can be driven to the desired value. Also, some applications incorporate clock frequencies that must vary by one to two orders of magnitude depending on the mode of operation, demanding a proportionally wide tuning range.

An important concern in the design of VCOs is the disturbance of the output phase and frequency as a result of noise on the control line. For a given noise amplitude, the noise in the output frequency is proportional to $K_{V C O}$ because $\omega_{\text {out }}=\omega_{0}+K_{V C O} V_{\text {cont }}$. Thus, to minimize the effect of noise in $V_{\text {cont }}$, the VCO gain must be minimized, a constraint in direct conflict with the required tuning range. In fact, if, as shown in Fig. 15.40, the allowable range of $V_{\text {cont }}$ is from $V_{1}$ to $V_{2}$ (e.g., from 0 to $V_{D D}$ ) and the tuning range must span at least $\omega_{1}$ to $\omega_{2}$, then $K_{V C O}$ must satisfy the following requirement:

$$
\begin{equation*}
K_{V C O} \geq \frac{\omega_{2}-\omega_{1}}{V_{2}-V_{1}} \tag{15.61}
\end{equation*}
$$

Note that, for a given tuning range, $K_{V C O}$ increases as the supply voltage decreases, making the oscillator more sensitive to noise on the control line.

Tuning Linearity As exemplified by Eq. (15.60), the tuning characteristics of VCOs exhibit nonlinearity, i.e., their gain, $K_{V C O}$, is not constant. As explained in Chapter 16, such nonlinearity degrades the settling behavior of phase-locked loops. For this reason, it is desirable to minimize the variation of $K_{V C O}$ across the tuning range.

Actual oscillator characteristics typically exhibit a high-gain region in the middle of the range and a low gain at the two extremes (Fig. 15.41). Compared to a linear characteristic (the gray line), the actual behavior displays a maximum gain greater than that predicted by (15.61), implying that, for a given tuning range, nonlinearity inevitably leads to higher sensitivity for some region of the characteristic.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-632.jpg?height=372&width=558&top_left_y=1818&top_left_x=605)

Figure 15.41 Nonlinear VCO characteristic.

Output Amplitude It is desirable to achieve a large output oscillation amplitude, thus making the waveform less sensitive to noise. The amplitude trades with power dissipation, supply voltage, and (as explained in Sec. 15.4.2) even the tuning range. Also, the amplitude may vary across the tuning range, an undesirable effect.

Power Dissipation As with other analog circuits, oscillators suffer from trade-offs among speed, power dissipation, and noise. Typical oscillators drain 1 to 10 mW of power.
Supply and Common-Mode Rejection Oscillators are quite sensitive to noise, especially if they are realized in single-ended form. As seen in Example 15.9, even differential oscillators exhibit supply sensitivity. The design of oscillators for high noise immunity is a difficult challenge.
Output Signal Purity Even with a constant control voltage, the output waveform of a VCO is not perfectly periodic. The electronic noise of the devices in the oscillator and supply noise lead to noise in the output phase and frequency. These effects are quantified by "jitter" and "phase noise" and determined by the requirements of each application.

### 15.4.1 Tuning in Ring Oscillators

Recall from Sec. 15.2 that the oscillation frequency, $f_{o s c}$, of an $N$-stage ring equals $\left(2 N T_{D}\right)^{-1}$, where $T_{D}$ denotes the large-signal delay of each stage. Thus, to vary the frequency, $T_{D}$ can be adjusted.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-633.jpg?height=394&width=675&top_left_y=1003&top_left_x=478)

Figure 15.42 Differential pair with variable output time constant.

As a simple example, consider the differential pair of Fig. 15.42 as one stage of a ring oscillator. Here, $M_{3}$ and $M_{4}$ operate in the triode region, each acting as a variable resistor controlled by $V_{\text {cont }}$. As $V_{\text {cont }}$ becomes more positive, the on-resistance of $M_{3}$ and $M_{4}$ increases, thus raising the time constant at the output, $\tau_{1}$, and lowering $f_{o s c}$. If $M_{3}$ and $M_{4}$ remain in the deep triode region,

$$
\begin{align*}
\tau_{1} & =R_{o n 3,4} C_{L}  \tag{15.62}\\
& =\frac{C_{L}}{\mu_{p} C_{o x}\left(\frac{W}{L}\right)_{3,4}\left(V_{D D}-V_{c o n t}-\left|V_{T H P}\right|\right)} \tag{15.63}
\end{align*}
$$

In the above equation, $C_{L}$ denotes the total capacitance seen at each output to ground (including the input capacitance of the following stage). The delay of the circuit is roughly proportional to $\tau_{1}$, yielding

$$
\begin{align*}
f_{\text {osc }} & \propto \frac{1}{T_{D}}  \tag{15.64}\\
& \propto \frac{\mu_{p} C_{o x}\left(\frac{W}{L}\right)_{3,4}\left(V_{D D}-V_{c o n t}-\left|V_{T H P}\right|\right)}{C_{L}} \tag{15.65}
\end{align*}
$$

Interestingly, $f_{\text {osc }}$ is linearly proportional to $V_{\text {cont }}$.

- Example 15.10

For the given device dimensions and bias currents in Fig. 15.42, determine the maximum allowable value of $V_{\text {cont }}$. What happens if $M_{3}$ and $M_{4}$ enter saturation?

#### Solution

Let us assume (somewhat arbitrarily) that $M_{3}$ and $M_{4}$ remain in the deep triode region if $\left|V_{D S 3,4}\right| \leq 0.2 \times 2 \mid V_{G S 3,4}-$ $V_{T H P} \mid$. If each stage in the ring experiences complete switching, then the maximum drain current of $M_{3}$ and $M_{4}$ is equal to $I_{S S}$. To satisfy the above condition, we must have $I_{S S} R_{o n 3,4} \leq 0.4\left(V_{D D}-V_{c o n t}-\left|V_{T H P}\right|\right)$, and hence

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{I_{S S}}{\mu_{p} C_{o x}\left(\frac{W}{L}\right)_{3,4}\left(V_{D D}-V_{\text {cont }}-\left|V_{T H P}\right|\right)} \leq 0.4\left(V_{D D}-V_{\text {cont }}-\left|V_{T H P}\right|\right) \tag{15.66}
\end{equation*}
$$

It follows that

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text {cont }} \leq V_{D D}-\left|V_{T H P}\right|-\sqrt{\frac{I_{S S}}{0.4 \mu_{p} C_{o x}\left(\frac{W}{L}\right)_{3,4}}} \tag{15.67}
\end{equation*}
$$

If $V_{\text {cont }}$ exceeds this level by a large margin, $M_{3}$ and $M_{4}$ eventually enter saturation. Each stage then requires common-mode feedback to produce the output swings around a well-defined CM level.

The differential pair of Fig. 15.42 suffers from a critical drawback: the output swing of the circuit varies considerably across the tuning range. With complete switching, each stage provides a differential output swing of $2 I_{S S} R_{\text {on } 3,4}$. Thus, a tuning range of, say, two to one translates to a twofold variation in the swing.

In order to minimize the swing variation, the tail current can be adjusted by $V_{\text {cont }}$ as well such that, as $V_{\text {cont }}$ becomes more positive, $I_{S S}$ decreases. The circuit nonetheless requires a means of maintaining $I_{S S} R_{\text {on } 3,4}$ relatively constant. To this end, let us consider the circuit in Fig. 15.43(a), where $M_{5}$ operates in the deep triode region and amplifier $A_{1}$ applies negative feedback to the gate of $M_{5}$. If the loop gain is sufficiently large, the differential input voltage of $A_{1}$ must be small, giving $V_{P} \approx V_{R E F}$ and $\left|V_{D S 5}\right| \approx V_{D D}-V_{R E F}$. Thus, the feedback ensures a relatively constant drain-source voltage even if $I_{1}$ varies. In fact, as $I_{1}$, say, decreases, $A_{1}$ raises the gate voltage of $M_{5}$ such that $R_{o n 5} I_{1} \approx V_{D D}-V_{R E F}$.

Figure 15.43 (a) Simple feedback circuit defining $V_{P}$; (b) replica biasing to define voltage swings in a ring oscillator.

The topology of Fig. 15.43(a) can serve as a "replica circuit" for the stages of a ring oscillator, thereby defining the oscillation amplitude. Illustrated in Fig. 15.43(b), the idea is to "servo" the on-resistance of $M_{3}$ and $M_{4}$ to that of $M_{5}$ and vary the frequency by adjusting $I_{1}$ and $I_{S S}$ simultaneously [2]. If $M_{3}$ and $M_{4}$ are identical to $M_{5}$ and $I_{S S}$ to $I_{1}$, then $V_{X}$ and $V_{Y}$ vary from $V_{D D}$ to $V_{D D}-V_{R E F}$ as $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ steer the tail current to one side or the other. Thus, if process and temperature variations, say, decrease $I_{1}$ and $I_{S S}$, then $A_{1}$ increases the on-resistance of $M_{3}-M_{5}$, forcing $V_{P}$ and hence $V_{X}$ and $V_{Y}$ (when $M_{1}$ or $M_{2}$ is fully on) equal to $V_{R E F}$.

The bandwidth of the op amp $A_{1}$ in Fig. 15.43(b) is of some concern. If a change in $V_{\text {cont }}$ takes a long time to change $\omega_{\text {out }}$, then the settling speed of a PLL using this VCO degrades significantly (Chapter 16).

Example 15.11
How does the oscillation frequency depend on $I_{S S}$ for a VCO incorporating the stage of Fig. 15.43(b)?

#### Solution

Noting that $R_{o n 3,4} I_{S S} \approx V_{D D}-V_{R E F}$, we have $R_{o n 3,4} \approx\left(V_{D D}-V_{R E F}\right) / I_{S S}$, and hence

$$
\begin{align*}
f_{\text {osc }} & \propto \frac{1}{R_{o n 3,4} C_{L}}  \tag{15.68}\\
& \propto \frac{I_{S S}}{\left(V_{D D}-V_{R E F}\right) C_{L}} \tag{15.69}
\end{align*}
$$

Thus, the characteristic is relatively linear.

Delay Variation by Positive Feedback To arrive at another tuning technique, recall that a crosscoupled transistor pair such as that of Fig. 15.36 exhibits a negative resistance of $-2 / g_{m}$, a value that can be controlled by the bias current. A negative resistance $-R_{N}$ placed in parallel with a positive resistance $+R_{P}$ gives an equivalent value $+R_{N} R_{P} /\left(R_{N}-R_{P}\right)$, which is more positive if $\left|-R_{N}\right|>\left|+R_{P}\right|$. This idea can be applied to each stage of a ring oscillator as illustrated in Fig. 15.44(a). Here, the load of the differential pair consists of resistors $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}\left(R_{1}=R_{2}=R_{P}\right)$ and the cross-coupled pair $M_{3}-M_{4}$. As $I_{1}$ increases, the small-signal differential resistance $-2 / g_{m 3,4}$ becomes less negative and, from the half circuit of Fig. 15.44(b), the equivalent resistance $R_{P} \|\left(-1 / g_{m 3,4}\right)=R_{P} /\left(1-g_{m 3,4} R_{P}\right)$ increases, thereby lowering the frequency of oscillation.

Figure 15.44 (a) Differential stage with variable negative-resistance load; (b) half-circuit equivalent of (a).
An important issue in the circuit of Fig. 15.44(a) is that as $I_{1}$ varies, so do the currents steered by $M_{3}$ and $M_{4}$ to $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$. Thus, the output voltage swing is not constant across the tuning range. To minimize this effect, $I_{S S}$ can be varied in the opposite direction such that the total current steered between $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ remains constant. In other words, it is desirable to vary $I_{1}$ and $I_{S S}$ differentially while their sum is fixed, a characteristic provided by a differential pair. Illustrated in Fig. 15.45, the idea is to employ a differential pair $M_{5}-M_{6}$ to steer $I_{T}$ to $M_{1}-M_{2}$ or $M_{3}-M_{4}$ so that $I_{S S}+I_{1}=I_{T}$. Since $I_{T}$ must flow through $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$, if $M_{1}-M_{4}$ experience complete switching in each cycle of oscillation, then $I_{T}$ is steered to $R_{1}$ (through $M_{1}$ and $M_{3}$ ) in half a period and to $R_{2}$ (through $M_{2}$ and $M_{4}$ ) in the other half, giving a differential swing of $2 R_{P} I_{T}$.

Figure 15.45 Use of a differential pair to steer current between $M_{1}-M_{2}$ and $M_{3}-M_{4}$.

In the circuit of Fig. 15.45, $V_{\text {cont } 1}$ and $V_{\text {cont } 2}$ can be viewed as differential control lines if they vary by equal and opposite amounts. Such a topology provides higher noise immunity for the control input than if $V_{\text {cont }}$ is single-ended. Now, note that as $V_{\text {cont } 1}$ decreases and $V_{\text {cont } 2}$ increases, the cross-coupled pair exhibits a greater transconductance, thereby raising the time constant at the output nodes. But what happens if all of $I_{T}$ is steered by $M_{6}$ to $M_{3}$ and $M_{4}$ ? Since $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ carry no current, the gain of the stage falls to zero, prohibiting oscillation. To avoid this effect, a small constant current source, $I_{H}$, can be connected from node $P$ to ground, thereby ensuring that $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ always remain on. With typical values, this ring oscillator provides a two-to-one tuning range and reasonable linearity.

#### Example 15.12

Calculate the minimum value of $I_{H}$ in Fig. 15.45 to guarantee a low-frequency gain of 2 when all of $I_{T}$ is steered to the cross-coupled pair.

#### Solution

The small-signal voltage gain of the circuit equals $g_{m 1,2} R_{P} /\left(1-g_{m 3,4} R_{P}\right)$. Assuming square-law devices, we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
\sqrt{\mu_{n} C_{o x}\left(\frac{W}{L}\right)_{1,2} I_{H}} \frac{R_{P}}{1-\sqrt{\mu_{n} C_{o x}\left(\frac{W}{L}\right)_{3,4} I_{T} R_{P}}} \geq 2 \tag{15.70}
\end{equation*}
$$

That is

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{H} \geq \frac{4\left[1-\sqrt{\mu_{n} C_{o x}\left(\frac{W}{L}\right)_{3,4} I_{T}} R_{P}\right]^{2}}{\mu_{n} C_{o x}\left(\frac{W}{L}\right)_{1,2} R_{P}^{2}} \tag{15.71}
\end{equation*}
$$

An important drawback of using the differential pair $M_{5}-M_{6}$ in the circuit of Fig. 15.45 is the additional voltage headroom that it consumes. As depicted in Fig. 15.46, for $M_{5}$ to remain in saturation, $V_{P}$ must be sufficiently higher than $V_{N}$. When $V_{\text {cont } 1}=V_{\text {cont } 2}$, the minimum allowable drain-source voltage of $M_{5}$ is equal to its equilibrium overdrive voltage, implying that, compared to that calculated in Example 15.4,
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-637.jpg?height=420&width=615&top_left_y=344&top_left_x=505)

Figure 15.46 Headroom calculation for a current-steering topology.
the supply voltage must be higher by this value. Note also that if $V_{\text {cont } 1}$ or $V_{\text {cont2 }}$ is allowed to vary above its equilibrium value by more than $V_{T H}$, then $M_{5}$ or $M_{6}$ enters the triode region.

The previous observation reveals a trade-off between voltage headroom and the sensitivity of the VCO. In order to minimize the sensitivity with a given tuning range, the transconductance of $M_{5}-M_{6}$ must be minimized. (That is, to steer all of the tail current, the differential pair must require a large $V_{\text {cont } 1}-V_{\text {cont } 2}$.) However, for a given tail current, $g_{m}=2 I_{D} /\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\right)$, indicating a large equilibrium overdrive for $M_{5}-M_{6}$ and a correspondingly higher value for the minimum required supply voltage.

We should mention that the pair $M_{5}-M_{6}$ need not remain in complete saturation. If the drain voltages are low enough to drive these transistors into the triode region, then the equivalent transconductance of the differential pair drops, demanding a greater $V_{\text {cont } 1}-V_{\text {cont2 }}$ to steer the tail current. This phenomenon in fact translates to a lower VCO sensitivity. In practice, careful simulations are required to ensure that the VCO characteristic remains relatively linear across the range of interest. ${ }^{9}$

Figure 15.47 (a) Current folding topology; (b) application of current folding to current steering.
At low supply voltages, it is desirable to avoid the voltage headroom consumed by $M_{5}-M_{6}$ in Fig. 15.45. The issue can be resolved by means of "current folding." Suppose, as illustrated in Fig. 15.47(a), a differential pair drives two current mirrors, generating $I_{\text {out } 1}$ and $I_{\text {out } 2}$. Since $I_{1}+I_{2}=I_{S S}, I_{\text {out } 1}=K I_{1}$, and $I_{\text {out } 2}=K I_{2}$, we have $I_{\text {out } 1}+I_{\text {out } 2}=K I_{S S}$. Thus, as $V_{\text {in } 1}-V_{\text {in } 2}$ goes from a very negative value to a very positive value, $I_{\text {out } 1}$ varies from $K I_{S S}$ to zero and $I_{\text {out } 2}$ from zero to $K I_{S S}$ while their sum remains constant-a behavior similar to that of a differential pair.

[^108]We now utilize the topology of Fig. 15.47(a) in the gain stage of Fig. 15.44(a). Shown in Fig. 15.47(b), the resulting circuit operates from a low supply voltage. However, the devices in the control path contribute substantial noise, modulating the oscillation frequency.

Delay Variation by Interpolation Another approach to tuning ring oscillators is based on "interpolation" [3, 4]. As illustrated in Fig. 15.48(a), each stage consists of a fast path and a slow path whose outputs are summed and whose gains are adjusted by $V_{\text {cont }}$ in opposite directions. At one extreme of the control voltage, only the fast path is on and the slow path is disabled, yielding the maximum oscillation frequency [Fig. 15.48(b)]. Conversely, at the other extreme, only the slow path is on and the fast path is off, providing the minimum oscillation frequency [Fig. 15.48(c)]. If $V_{\text {cont }}$ lies between the two extremes, each path is partially on, and the total delay is a weighted sum of their delays.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-638.jpg?height=753&width=1471&top_left_y=858&top_left_x=419)

Figure 15.48 (a) Interpolating delay stage; (b) smallest delay; (b) largest delay.

To better understand the concept of interpolation, let us implement the topology of Fig. 15.48(a) at the transistor level. Each stage can be simply realized as a differential pair whose gain is controlled by its tail current. But how are the two outputs summed? Since the two transistors in a differential pair provide output currents, the outputs of the two pairs can be added in the current domain. As depicted in Fig. 15.49(a), simply shorting the outputs of two pairs performs the current addition, e.g., for small signals, $I_{o u t}=g_{m 1,2} V_{i n 1}+g_{m 3,4} V_{i n 2}$. The overall interpolating stage therefore assumes the configuration shown in Fig. 15.49(b), where $V_{\text {cont }}^{+}$and $V_{\text {cont }}^{-}$denote voltages that vary in opposite directions (so that when one path turns on, the other turns off). The output currents of $M_{1}-M_{2}$ and $M_{3}-M_{4}$ are summed at $X$ and $Y$ and flow through $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$, producing $V_{\text {out }}$.

In the circuit of Fig. 15.49(b), the gain of each stage is varied by the tail current to achieve interpolation. But it is desirable to maintain constant voltage swings. We also recognize that the gain of the differential pair $M_{5}-M_{6}$ need not be varied because even if only the gain of $M_{3}-M_{4}$ drops to zero, the slow path is fully disabled. We then surmise that if the tail currents of $M_{1}-M_{2}$ and $M_{3}-M_{4}$ vary in opposite directions such that their sum remains constant, we achieve both interpolation between the two paths and constant output swings. Illustrated in Fig. 15.50, the resulting circuit employs the differential pair $M_{7}-M_{8}$ to steer $I_{S S}$ between $M_{1}-M_{2}$ and $M_{3}-M_{4}$. If $V_{\text {cont }}$ is very negative, $M_{8}$ is off and only the fast path amplifies the input. Conversely, if $V_{\text {cont }}$ is very positive, $M_{7}$ is off and only the slow path is enabled. Since the

slow path in this case employs one more stage than the fast path, the VCO achieves a tuning range of roughly two to one. For operation with low supply voltages, the control pair $M_{7}-M_{8}$ can be replaced by the current-folding topology of Fig. 15.47(a).

#### Example 15.13

Combine the tuning techniques of Figs. 15.45 and 15.50 to achieve a wider tuning range.

#### Solution

We begin with the interpolating stage of Fig. 15.50 and add a cross-coupled pair to the output nodes [Fig. 15.51(a)]. However, in order to obtain constant voltage swings, the total current through the load resistors must remain
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-640.jpg?height=1356&width=1431&top_left_y=364&top_left_x=436)

constant. This is accomplished by replacing the control differential pair with the current-folding circuit of Fig. 15.47(a). Depicted in Fig. 15.51(b), the resulting configuration steers the current to $M_{1}-M_{2}$ to speed up the circuit and to $M_{3}-M_{4}$ and $M_{10}-M_{11}$ to slow down the circuit. The tail current source dimensions are chosen such that $I_{S S 1}=I_{S S 2}+I_{S S 3}$.

Wide-Range Tuning Except for the circuit of Fig. 15.43(b), the ring oscillator tuning techniques presented thus far achieve a tuning range of typically no more than three to one. In applications where the frequency must be varied by orders of magntitude, the topology shown in Fig. 15.52 can be used. Driven by the input, the additional PMOS transistors $M_{5}$ and $M_{6}$ pull each output node to $V_{D D}$, creating a relatively constant output swing even with large variations in $I_{S S}$. The oscillation frequency of a ring incorporating this stage can be varied by more than four orders of magnitude with less than a twofold variation in the amplitude.

### 15.4.2 Tuning in LC Oscillators

The oscillation frequency of LC topologies is equal to $f_{\text {osc }}=1 /(2 \pi \sqrt{L C})$, suggesting that only the inductor and capacitor values can be varied to tune the frequency, and other parameters such as bias currents and transistor transconductances affect $f_{\text {osc }}$ negligibly. Since it is difficult to vary the value of monolithic inductors, we simply change the tank capacitance to tune the oscillator. Voltage-dependent capacitors are called "varactors." 10

A reverse-biased $p n$ junction can serve as a varactor. The voltage dependence is expressed as

$$
\begin{equation*}
C_{v a r}=\frac{C_{0}}{\left(1+\frac{V_{R}}{\phi_{B}}\right)^{m}} \tag{15.72}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $C_{0}$ is the zero-bias value, $V_{R}$ the reverse-bias voltage, $\phi_{B}$ the built-in potential of the junction, and $m$ a value typically between 0.3 and 0.4. ${ }^{11}$ Equation (15.72) reveals an important drawback of LC oscillators: at low supply voltages, $V_{R}$ has a very limited range, yielding a small range for $C_{v a r}$ and hence for $f_{\text {osc }}$. We also note that to maximize the tuning range, constant capacitances in the tank must be minimized.

#### Example 15.14

Suppose that in Eq. (15.72), $\phi_{B}=0.7 \mathrm{~V}, m=0.35$, and $V_{R}$ can vary from zero to 2 V . How much tuning range can be achieved?

#### Solution

For $V_{R}=0, C_{j}=C_{0}$ and $f_{\text {osc }, \min }=1 /\left(2 \pi \sqrt{L C_{0}}\right)$. For $V_{R}=2 \mathrm{~V}, C_{j} \approx 0.62 C_{0}$ and $f_{\text {osc }, \max }=1 /$ $\left(2 \pi \sqrt{L \times 0.62 C_{0}}\right) \approx 1.27 f_{\text {osc }, \text { min }}$. Thus, the tuning range is approximately equal to $27 \%$. As explained later, the parasitic capacitances of the inductor and the transistor(s) further limit this range because they cannot be varied by the control voltage.

Let us now add varactor diodes to a cross-coupled LC oscillator (Fig. 15.53). To avoid forward-biasing $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$ significantly, $V_{\text {cont }}$ must not exceed $V_{X}$ or $V_{Y}$ by more than a few hundred millivolts. Thus, if the peak amplitude at each node is $A$, then $0<V_{\text {cont }}<V_{D D}-A+300 \mathrm{mV}$, where it is assumed that a forward bias of 300 mV creates negligible current. Interestingly, the circuit suffers from a trade-off between the output swing and the tuning range. This effect appears in most LC oscillators.

[^109]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-642.jpg?height=420&width=1202&top_left_y=364&top_left_x=553)

Figure 15.53 LC oscillator using varactor diodes.

Note that, since the swings at $X$ and $Y$ are typically large (e.g., $1 \mathrm{~V}_{p p}$ at each node), the capacitance of $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$ varies with time. Nonetheless, the "average" value of the capacitance is still a function of $V_{\text {cont }}$, providing the tuning range.

How are varactor diodes realized in CMOS technology? Illustrated in Fig. 15.54 are two types of $p n$ junctions. In Fig. 15.54(a), the anode is inevitably grounded whereas in Fig. 15.54(b), both terminals are floating. For the circuit of Fig. 15.53, only the floating diode can be used. To increase the capacitance of the junction, the $p^{+}$and $n^{+}$areas (and hence the $n$-well) are enlarged.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-642.jpg?height=661&width=1189&top_left_y=1171&top_left_x=554)

Figure 15.54 Diodes realized in CMOS technology.
Upon closer examination, the structure of Fig. 15.54(b) suffers from a number of drawbacks. First, the $n$-well material has a high resistivity, creating a resistance in series with the reverse-biased diode and lowering the quality factor of the capacitance. Second, the $n$-well displays substantial capacitance to the substrate, contributing a constant capacitance to the tank and limiting the tuning range. The diode is therefore represented as shown in Fig. 15.55, where $C_{n}$ represents the (voltage-dependent) capacitance between the $n$-well and the substrate. ${ }^{12}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-642.jpg?height=193&width=262&top_left_y=2160&top_left_x=753)

Figure 15.55 Circuit model of the varactor shown in Fig. 15.54(b).

[^110]In order to decrease the series resistance of the structure shown in Fig. 15.54(b), the $p^{+}$region can be surrounded by an $n^{+}$ring so that the displacement current flowing through the junction capacitance sees a low resistance in all four directions [Fig. 15.56(a)]. Since a single minimum-size $p^{+}$area has a small capacitance, many of these units can be placed in parallel [Fig. 15.56(b)]. The $n$-well, however, must accommodate the entire set, exhibiting a large capacitance to the substrate.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-643.jpg?height=438&width=792&top_left_y=611&top_left_x=678)

Figure 15.56 (a) Reduction of series resistance by surrounding the $p^{+}$region by an $n^{+}$ring; (b) several diodes in parallel.

It is instructive at this point to examine the unwanted capacitances in the circuit of Fig. 15.53, i.e., the components that are not varied by $V_{\text {cont }}$. We identify three such capacitances: (1) the capacitance between the $n$-well and the substrate associated with $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$; (2) the capacitances contributed by the transistors to each node, i.e., $C_{G D}, 2 C_{G D}$ (the factor of 2 arising from the Miller effect ${ }^{13}$ ), and $C_{D B}$; and (3) the parasitic capacitance of the inductor itself. Monolithic inductors are typically implemented as metal spiral structures (Fig. 15.57) having relatively large dimensions ( $S \approx 100-200 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ ).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-643.jpg?height=368&width=633&top_left_y=1447&top_left_x=496)

Figure 15.57 Spiral inductor structure.

In Fig. 15.53, it is desirable to connect the anode of the diodes to nodes $X$ and $Y$, thereby eliminating the parasitic $n$-well capacitances from the tank. Shown in Fig. 15.58 is a topology allowing such a modification. Here, the cross-coupled pair incorporates PMOS devices, providing swings around the ground potential. The use of PMOS devices also leads to less flicker noise, an important advantage because this noise may be "upconverted," appearing around the oscillation frequency.

In modern LC VCO design, we employ MOS varactors. Recall from Chapter 2 that the gate-channel capacitance of MOSFETs varies with the gate-source voltage [Fig. 15.59(a)]. However, the nonmonotonic dependence proves undesirable in VCO design (why?). To resolve this issue, an NMOS transistor can be placed inside an $n$-well, forming an "accumulation-mode" varactor [Fig. 15.59(b)]. The source, drain, and $n$-well are ohmically connected and serve as one terminal, and the gate as the other. The capacitance of this structure varies monotonically with $V_{G S}$, as shown in Fig. 15.59(c).

[^111]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-644.jpg?height=1293&width=1422&top_left_y=364&top_left_x=443)

Figure 15.59 (a) Voltage dependence of a MOS gate capacitance, (b) MOS varactor formed as an NFET inside an n-well, and (c) resulting characteristic.

An important advantage of the MOS varactor over the $p n$ junction is that the former does not experience forward bias and can therefore tolerate both positive and negative voltages. The design of LC VCOs entails numerous interesting concepts and issues. The reader is referred to [5] and the vast literature on the subject for details.

## 15.5 ■ Mathematical Model of VCOs

The definition of the voltage-controlled oscillator given by Eq. (15.55) specifies the relationship between the control voltage and the output frequency. The dependence is "memoryless" because a change in $V_{\text {cont }}$ immediately results in a change in $\omega_{\text {out }}$. But how is the output signal of the VCO expressed as a function of time? To answer this question, we must review the concepts of phase and frequency.

Consider the waveform $V_{0}(t)=V_{m} \sin \omega_{0} t$. The argument of the sinusoid is called the "total phase" of the signal. In this example, the phase varies linearly with time, exhibiting a slope equal to $\omega_{0}$. Note that, as depicted in Fig. 15.60, every time $\omega_{0} t$ crosses an integer multiple of $\pi, V_{0}(t)$ crosses zero.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-645.jpg?height=595&width=601&top_left_y=380&top_left_x=515)

Figure 15.60 Illustration of phase of a signal.

Now consider two waveforms $V_{1}(t)=V_{m} \sin \left[\phi_{1}(t)\right]$ and $V_{2}(t)=V_{m} \sin \left[\phi_{2}(t)\right]$, where $\phi_{1}(t)=$ $\omega_{1} t, \phi_{2}(t)=\omega_{2} t$, and $\omega_{1}<\omega_{2}$. As illustrated in Fig. 15.61, $\phi_{2}(t)$ crosses integer multiples of $\pi$ faster than $\phi_{1}(t)$ does, yielding faster variations in $V_{2}(t)$. We say that $V_{2}(t)$ accumulates phase faster.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-645.jpg?height=598&width=553&top_left_y=1217&top_left_x=536)

Figure 15.61 Variation of phase for two signals.

The above study reveals that the faster the phase of a waveform varies, the higher the frequency of the waveform, suggesting that the frequency ${ }^{14}$ can be defined as the derivative of the phase with respect to time:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\omega=\frac{d \phi}{d t} \tag{15.73}
\end{equation*}
$$

#### Solution

Taking the time derivative of $\phi(t)$, we obtain the behavior illustrated in Fig. 15.62(b). The frequency therefore periodically toggles between $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{2}$, yielding the waveform shown in Fig. 15.62(c). (This is a simple example of binary frequency modulation, called "frequency shift keying" and utilized in wireless pagers and many other communication systems.)

Equation (15.73) indicates that, if the frequency of a waveform is known as a function of time, then the phase can be computed as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\phi=\int \omega d t+\phi_{0} \tag{15.74}
\end{equation*}
$$

In particular, since for a $\mathrm{VCO}, \omega_{o u t}=\omega_{0}+K_{V C O} V_{c o n t}$, we have

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{\text {out }}(t) & =V_{m} \cos \left(\int \omega_{\text {out }} d t+\phi_{0}\right)  \tag{15.75}\\
& =V_{m} \cos \left(\omega_{0} t+K_{V C O} \int V_{c o n t} d t+\phi_{0}\right) \tag{15.76}
\end{align*}
$$

Equation (15.76) proves essential in the analysis of VCOs and PLLs. ${ }^{15}$ The initial phase $\phi_{0}$ is usually unimportant and is assumed zero hereafter.

#### Example 15.16

The control line of a VCO senses a rectangular signal toggling between $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ at a period $T_{m}$. Plot the frequency, phase, and output waveform as a function of time.

[^113]
#### Solution

Since $\omega_{\text {out }}=\omega_{0}+K_{V C O} V_{\text {cont }}$, the output frequency toggles between $\omega_{1}=\omega_{0}+K_{V C O} V_{1}$ and $\omega_{2}=\omega_{0}+K_{V C O} V_{2}$
(Fig. 15.63). The phase is equal to the time integral of this result, rising linearly with time at a slope of $\omega_{1}$ for half the input period and $\omega_{2}$ for the other half. The output waveform of the VCO is similar to that shown in Fig. 15.62. Thus, a VCO can operate as a frequency modulator.

Figure 15.63

As explained in Chapter 16, if a VCO is placed in a phase-locked loop, then only the second term of the total phase in Eq. (15.76) is of interest. This term, $K_{V C O} \int V_{c o n t} d t$, is called the "excess phase," $\phi_{e x}$. In fact, in the analysis of PLLs, we view the VCO as a system whose input and output are the control voltage and the excess phase, respectively:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\phi_{e x}=K_{V C O} \int V_{c o n t} d t \tag{15.77}
\end{equation*}
$$

That is, the VCO operates as an ideal integrator, providing a transfer function:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\Phi_{e x}}{V_{\text {cont }}}(s)=\frac{K_{V C O}}{s} \tag{15.78}
\end{equation*}
$$

#### Example 15.17

A VCO senses a small sinusoidal control voltage $V_{\text {cont }}=V_{m} \cos \omega_{m} t$. Determine the output waveform and its spectrum.

#### Solution

The output is expressed as

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{\text {out }}(t)= & V_{0} \cos \left(\omega_{0} t+K_{V C O} \int V_{\text {cont }} d t\right)  \tag{15.79}\\
= & V_{0} \cos \left(\omega_{0} t+K_{V C O} \frac{V_{m}}{\omega_{m}} \sin \omega_{m} t\right)  \tag{15.80}\\
= & V_{0} \cos \omega_{0} t \cos \left(K_{V C O} \frac{V_{m}}{\omega_{m}} \sin \omega_{m} t\right)  \tag{15.81}\\
& -V_{0} \sin \omega_{0} t \sin \left(K_{V C O} \frac{V_{m}}{\omega_{m}} \sin \omega_{m} t\right)
\end{align*}
$$

If $V_{m}$ is small enough that $K_{V C O} V_{m} / \omega_{m} \ll 1 \mathrm{rad}$, then

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{\text {out }}(t) & \approx V_{0} \cos \omega_{0} t-V_{0}\left(\sin \omega_{0} t\right)\left(K_{V C O} \frac{V_{m}}{\omega_{m}} \sin \omega_{m} t\right)  \tag{15.82}\\
& =V_{0} \cos \omega_{0} t-\frac{K_{V C O} V_{m} V_{0}}{2 \omega_{m}}\left[\cos \left(\omega_{0}-\omega_{m}\right) t-\cos \left(\omega_{0}+\omega_{m}\right) t\right] \tag{15.83}

The output therefore consists of three sinusoids having frequencies of $\omega_{0}, \omega_{0}-\omega_{m}$, and $\omega_{0}+\omega_{m}$. The spectrum is shown in Fig. 15.64. The components at $\omega_{0} \pm \omega_{m}$ are called "sidebands."

The above example reveals that variation of the control voltage with time may create unwanted components at the output. Indeed, when a VCO operates in the steady state, the control voltage must experience very little variation. ${ }^{16}$ This issue is studied in Chapter 16.

A common mistake in expressing the phase of signals arises from the familiar form $V_{m} \cos \omega_{0} t$. Here, the phase is equal to the product of frequency and time, creating the impression that such equality holds in all conditions. We may even deduce that, since the output frequency of a VCO is given by $\omega_{0}+K_{V C O} V_{\text {cont }}$, the output waveform can be written as $V_{m} \cos \left[\left(\omega_{0}+K_{V C O} V_{c o n t}\right) t\right]$. To understand why this is incorrect, let us compute the frequency as the derivative of the phase:

$$
\begin{align*}
\omega & =\frac{d}{d t}\left[\left(\omega_{0}+K_{V C O} V_{\text {cont }}\right) t\right]  \tag{15.84}\\
& =K_{V C O} \frac{d V_{\text {cont }}}{d t} t+\omega_{0}+K_{V C O} V_{\text {cont }} \tag{15.85}
\end{align*}
$$

The first term in this expression is redundant, vanishing only if $d V_{\text {cont }} / d t=0$. Thus, in the general case, the phase cannot be written as the product of time and frequency.

Our study of VCOs in this section has assumed sinusoidal output waveforms. In practice, depending on the type and speed of the oscillator, the output may contain significant harmonics, even approaching a rectangular waveform. How should Eq. (15.76) be modified in this case? We expect that $V_{\text {out }}(t)$ can be expressed as a Fourier series:

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text {out }}(t)=V_{1} \cos \left(\omega_{0} t+\phi_{1}\right)+V_{2} \cos \left(2 \omega_{0} t+\phi_{2}\right)+\cdots \tag{15.86}
\end{equation*}
$$

We also note that if the (fundamental) frequency of a rectagular waveform is changed by $\Delta f$, the frequency of its second harmonic must change by $2 \Delta f$, etc. Thus, if $V_{\text {cont }}$ varies by $\Delta V$, then the frequency of the first harmonic varies by $K_{V C O} \Delta V$, the frequency of the second harmonic by $2 K_{V C O} \Delta V$, etc. That is
$V_{\text {out }}(t)=V_{1} \cos \left(\omega_{0} t+K_{V C O} \int V_{\text {cont }} d t+\theta_{1}\right)+V_{2} \cos \left(2 \omega_{0} t+2 K_{V C O} \int V_{\text {cont }} d t+\theta_{2}\right)+\cdots$

[^114]where $\theta_{1}, \theta_{2}, \cdots$ are constant phases necessary for the representation of each harmonic in the Fourier series expansion.

Equation (15.87) suggests that the harmonics of an oscillator output can be readily taken into account. For this reason, we often limit our calculations to the first harmonic, even though we may draw the waveforms in rectangular shape rather than sinusoidal shape.
