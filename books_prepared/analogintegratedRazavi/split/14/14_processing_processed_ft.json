It takes the input signal \\( V_{in} \\) and subtracts the feedback signal from it. The output of this block is the difference between \\( V_{in} \\) and the feedback signal. 2. **Amplifier Block \\( H(s) \\):** This block represents the system's transfer function and amplifies the signal from the summing junction. The gain and phase characteristics of this block are defined by \\( H(s) \\), which is a function of the complex frequency variable \\( s \\). 3. **Feedback Path:** The output \\( V_{out} \\) is fed back into the summing junction. The feedback loop includes a direct connection from the output to the subtractor input, providing negative feedback. The flow of information is as follows: - The input signal \\( V_{in} \\) enters the summing junction, where the feedback signal is subtracted from it. - The resulting difference signal is then passed to the amplifier \\( H(s) \\), where it is amplified according to the transfer function. - The amplified output \\( V_{out} \\) is then fed back into the subtractor to form a closed-loop system. The primary function of this feedback system is to control the output \\( V_{out} \\) by adjusting the input \\( V_{in} \\) and the feedback loop.
