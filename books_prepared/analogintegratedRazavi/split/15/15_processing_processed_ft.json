The phase detector generates an error signal based on the phase difference. 2. **Charge Pump (CP):** The error signal from the PD is fed into the charge pump, which converts the phase difference into a control voltage, \\( V_{cont} \\). This voltage is used to adjust the delay line. 3. **Loop Filter:** Consisting of a resistor \\( R_P \\), and two capacitors \\( C_P \\) and \\( C_2 \\), the loop filter smooths the control voltage \\( V_{cont} \\) to reduce noise and stabilize the loop. 4. **Delay Line:** The delay line consists of a series of inverters. The control voltage \\( V_{cont} \\) adjusts the delay introduced by these inverters, thereby aligning the phase of the output with the input phase. **Flow of Information:** - The input signal \\( \\phi_{in} \\) is fed into the phase detector and also directed to the output. - The phase detector compares \\( \\phi_{in} \\) with the feedback from \\( \\phi_{out} \\) and sends the phase error to the charge pump. - The charge pump outputs a control voltage \\( V_{cont} \\), which is filtered by the loop filter components \\( R_P \\), \\( C_P \\), and \\( C_2 \\). - The filtered control voltage \\( V_{cont} \\) is then used to adjust the delay line, which consists of the series of inverters, ensuring that the output phase \\( \\phi_{out} \\) locks to the input phase \\( \\phi_{in} \\). **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:** - \\( \\phi_{in} \\) and \\( \\phi_{out} \\) are the input and output phases, respectively. - \\( V_{cont} \\) is the control voltage that adjusts the delay line. - The loop filter components \\( R_P \\), \\( C_P \\), and \\( C_2 \\) are crucial for stabilizing the control voltage. **Overall System Function:** The DLL in this diagram is designed to align the output phase \\( \\phi_{out} \\) with the input phase \\( \\phi_{in} \\) by adjusting the delay through the series of inverters.
