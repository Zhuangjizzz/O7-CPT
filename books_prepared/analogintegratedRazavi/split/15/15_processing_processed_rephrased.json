Since each period contains two pulses, the average value rises by $2\\left[V_{0} \\cdot \\Delta \\phi /(2 \\pi)\\right]$, resulting in a gain of $V_{0} / \\pi$. Note that this gain is independent of the input frequency.\n\nTo construct the input-output characteristic, we analyze the circuit's response to various input phase differences. As shown in Fig. 16.3, the average output voltage reaches $\\left[V_{0} / \\pi\\right] \\times \\pi / 2=V_{0} / 2$ for $\\Delta \\phi=\\pi / 2$ and $V_{0}$ for $\\Delta \\phi=\\pi$. For $\\Delta \\phi>\\pi$, the average begins to drop, falling to $V_{0} / 2$ for $\\Delta \\phi=3 \\pi / 2$ and zero for $\\Delta \\phi=2 \\pi$. The characteristic is thus periodic, exhibiting both negative and positive gains.\n\n**Figure 16.3 Description:**\nThe graph in Figure 16.3 illustrates the relationship between the phase difference (Δφ) and the average output voltage (V_out) of a phase detector. This piecewise linear graph shows how V_out varies as Δφ changes from -2π to 2π.\n\n**Type of Graph and Function:**\nThe graph is a piecewise linear plot representing the input-output characteristic of a phase detector circuit.\n\n**Axes Labels and Units:**\n- The horizontal axis represents the phase difference Δφ in radians, ranging from -2π to 2π.\n- The vertical axis represents the average output voltage V_out, with a scale from 0 to V_0.\n\n**Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- The graph is periodic and symmetric about the origin, repeating every 2π.\n- As Δφ increases from 0 to π, V_out increases linearly from 0 to V_0.\n- As Δφ continues from π to 2π, V_out decreases linearly back to 0.\n- For negative Δφ, the behavior is symmetric, with V_out decreasing from 0 to -V_0 as Δφ goes from 0 to -π, and increasing back to 0 as Δφ goes from -π to -2π.\n\n**Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- Peaks occur at Δφ = π and Δφ = -π, where V_out reaches V_0 and -V_0, respectively.\n- Zero crossings occur at Δφ = 0, ±2π.\n- The slopes of the linear segments are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction on either side of the peaks.\n\n**Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- Key points include (0, 0), (π, V_0), (2π, 0), (-π, -V_0), and (-2π, 0).\n- The graph is marked with dashed lines at the peaks to indicate the maximum output voltage V_0.\n\n**Figure 16.3 V_out vs Δφ Description:**\nThe graph titled \"V_out vs Δφ\" represents the relationship between the average output voltage \\( V_{out} \\) and the phase difference \\( \\Delta \\phi \\).

(Readers are advised to review the VCO mathematical model in the preceding chapter.) As depicted in Fig. 16.4(a), the rising edges of $V_{\\text{out}}$ are offset by $\\Delta t$ seconds relative to $V_{CK}$, and our goal is to eliminate this discrepancy. Assuming the VCO has a single control input, $V_{\\text{cont}}$, we recognize that to adjust the phase, we must modify the frequency and allow the integration $\\phi = \\int (\\omega_0 + K_{VCO} V_{cont}) dt$ to proceed. For instance, if the VCO frequency is increased at $t = t_1$, as shown in Fig. 16.4(b), the circuit accumulates phase more rapidly, gradually reducing the phase error. By $t = t_2$, the phase error reaches zero, and if $V_{cont}$ returns to its initial value, $V_{VCO}$ and $V_{CK}$ remain synchronized.

The process of aligning the VCO output phase with the reference phase is termed \"phase locking.\"\n\nFrom these observations, we infer that a PLL essentially consists of a Phase Detector (PD) and a VCO in a feedback loop [Fig. 16.5(a)]. The PD compares the phases of $V_{\\text{out}}$ and $V_{\\text{in}}$, generating an error signal that adjusts the VCO frequency until the phases align, i.e., the loop is locked. However, this basic topology requires modification.\n\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:The system block diagram labeled \"(a)\" represents a basic phase-locked loop (PLL) configuration. It includes two main components: a Phase Detector (PD) and a Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO), arranged in a feedback loop.\n\n1. **Main Components:**\n- **Phase Detector (PD):** This block receives two input signals: the reference signal $V_{in}$ and the feedback signal $V_{out}$. The PD compares their phases and generates an output voltage $V_{PD}$ proportional to the phase difference.\n- **Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO):** The VCO receives $V_{PD}$ and adjusts its frequency accordingly. The VCO output, $V_{out}$, is fed back to the PD for continuous phase comparison.\n\n2. **Flow of Information or Control:**\n- The input reference signal $V_{in}$ and the feedback signal $V_{out}$ are input to the PD.\n- The PD outputs a control voltage $V_{PD}$, which is sent to the VCO.\n- The VCO adjusts its output frequency based on $V_{PD}$ and generates $V_{out}$.\n- $V_{out}$ is then fed back to the PD, forming a feedback loop that continuously aligns the phase of $V_{out}$ with $V_{in}$.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n- $V_{in}$ and $V_{out}$ are labeled as input and output signals, respectively.\n- $V_{PD}$ is the control voltage output from the PD to the VCO.\n\n4. **Overall System Function:**\n- The primary function of this system is to achieve phase locking, where the phase of $V_{out}$ is aligned with the phase of $V_{in}$. This is accomplished through a feedback loop that continuously adjusts the VCO's frequency based on the phase difference detected by the PD. This basic PLL configuration is fundamental in applications requiring precise phase alignment, such as in communication systems and signal processing.\n\nimage_name:(b)\ndescription:The system block diagram labeled as \"(b)\" shows a simple Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) with a low-pass filter (LPF) included in the feedback loop to achieve phase locking between an input signal and an output signal.\n\n1. **Main Components:**\n- **Phase Detector (PD):** This block compares the phase of the input signal $V_{in}$ with the phase of the output signal $V_{out}$, generating an output voltage $V_{PD}$ representing the phase difference.\n- **Low-Pass Filter (LPF):** The LPF filters out high-frequency components from $V_{PD}$, allowing only the DC component, $V_{cont}$, to pass through. This filtered signal is essential for adjusting the VCO.\n- **Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO):** The VCO receives $V_{cont}$ from the LPF and adjusts its output frequency accordingly. The VCO output, $V_{out}$, is fed back to the PD for continuous phase comparison.\n\n2. **Flow of Information or Control:**\n- The input signal $V_{in}$ is fed into the PD, which also receives the feedback signal $V_{out}$.\n- The PD outputs $V_{PD}$, which is then filtered by the LPF to remove high-frequency noise, resulting in the control voltage $V_{cont}$.\n- $V_{cont}$ controls the VCO, adjusting its output frequency $V_{out}$ to match the phase of $V_{in}$.\n- $V_{out}$ is fed back to the PD, completing the feedback loop.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n- The input phase is labeled as $\\phi_{in}$ and the output phase as $\\phi_{out}$, indicating their roles in phase comparison and locking.\n- The control voltage is labeled as $V_{cont}$, highlighting its role in controlling the VCO.\n\n4. **Overall System Function:**\n- The primary function of this PLL is to synchronize the phase of the VCO output with the phase of the input signal. The PD detects phase differences and generates an error signal $V_{PD}$, which is filtered by the LPF to produce a stable control voltage $V_{cont}$. This voltage adjusts the VCO's frequency to align $\\phi_{out}$ with $\\phi_{in}$, achieving phase lock. The inclusion of the LPF ensures that the control voltage remains stable and free from high-frequency noise, critical for the steady-state operation of the VCO.\n\nFigure 16.5 (a) Feedback loop comparing input and output phases; (b) simple PLL.\nbecause (1) as exemplified by the waveforms in Fig. 16.2, the PD output, $V_{PD}$, contains both a DC component (desired) and high-frequency components (undesired), and (2) as discussed in Chapter 15, the oscillator's control voltage must remain stable in the steady state, i.e., the PD output must be filtered. Therefore, we insert a low-pass filter (LPF) between the PD and the VCO [Fig. 16.5(b)], which suppresses the high-frequency components of $V_{PD}$ and presents the DC level to the oscillator. This forms the basic PLL topology. For simplicity, we assume the LPF has a unity gain at low frequencies (e.g., as in a first-order RC section).\n\nIt is crucial to remember that the feedback loop in Fig. 16.5(b) compares the phases of the input and output. Unlike feedback systems studied in previous chapters, PLLs typically do not require knowledge of voltages or currents in their feedback operation. If the loop gain is sufficiently high, the phase difference between the input phase, $\\phi_{in}$, and the output phase, $\\phi_{out}$, becomes minimal in the steady state, achieving phase alignment.\n\nFor detailed PLL analyses, we must precisely define the phase-lock condition. If the loop in Fig. 16.5(b) is locked, we assume that $\\phi_{out} - \\phi_{in}$ is constant and preferably small. Thus, we define the loop as locked if $\\phi_{out} - \\phi_{in}$ does not vary with time. An important implication of this definition is that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{d\\phi_{out}}{dt} - \\frac{d\\phi_{in}}{dt} = 0 \\tag{16.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand hence\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\omega_{out} = \\omega_{in} \\tag{16.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis unique property of PLLs will be further explored later. In summary, a locked PLL produces an output with a minimal phase error relative to the input but precisely the same frequency. One might wonder why a PLL is necessary when a simple wire could seemingly perform the task better! We address this in Sec. 16.5.\n\n#### Example 16.2\n\nImplement a simple PLL in CMOS technology.\n\n#### Solution\n\nFigure 16.6 illustrates an implementation using an XOR gate as the phase detector.

For instance, if the VCO frequency is increased at $t=t_{1}$, as shown in Fig. 16.4(b), the circuit accumulates phase more rapidly, gradually reducing the phase error. At $t=t_{2}$, the phase error reaches zero, and if $V_{c o n t}$ returns to its initial value, $V_{V C O}$ and $V_{C K}$ remain synchronized.

This process of aligning the VCO's output phase with the reference phase is termed \"phase locking.\"\n\nFrom these observations, we infer that a PLL fundamentally consists of a PD and a VCO in a feedback loop [Fig. 16.5(a)]. The PD compares the phases of $V_{\\text {out }}$ and $V_{\\text {in }}$, generating an error signal that adjusts the VCO frequency until the phases align, i.e., the loop is locked. However, this basic topology needs modification.\n\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:The system block diagram labeled \"(a)\" represents a basic phase-locked loop (PLL) configuration, comprising a Phase Detector (PD) and a Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO) in a feedback loop.\n\n1. **Main Components:**\n- **Phase Detector (PD):** This block receives the input signal \\( V_{in} \\) and the feedback signal \\( V_{out} \\), comparing their phases and generating an output voltage \\( V_{PD} \\) proportional to the phase difference.\n- **Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO):** The VCO receives \\( V_{PD} \\) and adjusts its frequency accordingly, producing the output signal \\( V_{out} \\), which is fed back to the PD.\n\n2. **Information and Control Flow:**\n- \\( V_{in} \\) and \\( V_{out} \\) are input to the PD.\n- The PD outputs \\( V_{PD} \\), which controls the VCO.\n- The VCO adjusts its output frequency based on \\( V_{PD} \\), generating \\( V_{out} \\).\n- \\( V_{out} \\) is fed back to the PD, forming a continuous feedback loop.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n- \\( V_{in} \\) and \\( V_{out} \\) are labeled as input and output signals, respectively.\n- \\( V_{PD} \\) is the control voltage from the PD to the VCO.\n\n4. **System Function:**\n- The primary function is to achieve phase locking, where \\( V_{out} \\)'s phase aligns with \\( V_{in} \\)'s phase.

This voltage adjusts the VCO's frequency to align \\( \\phi_{out} \\) with \\( \\phi_{in} \\), achieving phase lock. The LPF ensures the control voltage remains stable and free from high-frequency noise, critical for steady-state VCO operation.\n\nFigure 16.5 (a) Feedback loop comparing input and output phases; (b) simple PLL.\nThis modification is necessary because (1) as shown in Fig. 16.2, the PD output, $V_{P D}$, comprises a desirable DC component and undesirable high-frequency components, and (2) as discussed in Chapter 15, the oscillator's control voltage must remain stable in the steady state, i.e., the PD output must be filtered. We thus insert a low-pass filter (LPF) between the PD and the VCO [Fig. 16.5(b)], which suppresses the high-frequency components of the PD output and provides the DC level to the oscillator. This forms the basic PLL topology. For simplicity, we assume the LPF has a unity gain at low frequencies (e.g., like a first-order RC section).\n\nIt is crucial to remember that the feedback loop in Fig. 16.5(b) compares the phases of the input and output. Unlike other feedback topologies studied previously, PLLs typically do not require knowledge of voltages or currents for their feedback operation. If the loop gain is sufficiently high, the phase difference between \\( \\phi_{i n} \\) and \\( \\phi_{\\text {out }} \\) becomes minimal in the steady state, achieving phase alignment.\n\nFor detailed PLL analyses, we must precisely define the phase-lock condition. If the loop in Fig. 16.5(b) is locked, we assume \\( \\phi_{\\text {out }}-\\phi_{\\text {in }} \\) is constant and preferably small. Therefore, we define the loop as locked when \\( \\phi_{\\text {out }}-\\phi_{\\text {in }} \\) remains constant over time. An important corollary of this definition is that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{d \\phi_{\\text {out }}}{d t}-\\frac{d \\phi_{\\text {in }}}{d t}=0 \\tag{16.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand hence\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\omega_{\\text {out }}=\\omega_{\\text {in }} \\tag{16.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis unique property of PLLs will be further explored later.\nIn summary, a locked PLL produces an output with a minimal phase error relative to the input but with an identical frequency.

This is accomplished by the feedback loop that continuously adjusts the VCO's frequency based on the phase difference detected by the PD.

It generates an output voltage \\( V_{PD} \\) representing the phase difference.\n- **Low-Pass Filter (LPF):** The PD's output \\( V_{PD} \\) contains both a DC component and high-frequency noise. The LPF filters out the high-frequency components, allowing only the DC component, \\( V_{\\text{cont}} \\), to pass through, which is crucial for adjusting the VCO.\n- **Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO):** The VCO receives the control voltage \\( V_{\\text{cont}} \\) from the LPF and adjusts its output frequency accordingly. The VCO's output is \\( V_{\\text{out}} \\), which is fed back to the PD for continuous phase comparison.\n\n2. **Flow of Information or Control:**\n- The input signal \\( V_{\\text{in}} \\) is fed into the PD, which also receives the feedback signal \\( V_{\\text{out}} \\) from the VCO.\n- The PD outputs \\( V_{PD} \\), which is then passed through the LPF to remove high-frequency noise, resulting in the control voltage \\( V_{\\text{cont}} \\).\n- \\( V_{\\text{cont}} \\) controls the VCO, adjusting its output frequency \\( V_{\\text{out}} \\) to match the phase of \\( V_{\\text{in}} \\).\n- \\( V_{\\text{out}} \\) is fed back to the PD, completing the feedback loop.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n- The input phase is labeled as \\( \\phi_{\\text{in}} \\) and the output phase as \\( \\phi_{\\text{out}} \\), indicating their roles in phase comparison and locking.\n- The control voltage is labeled as \\( V_{\\text{cont}} \\), emphasizing its role in controlling the VCO.\n\n4. **Overall System Function:**\n- The primary function of this PLL is to synchronize the phase of the VCO output with the phase of the input signal. The PD detects phase differences and generates an error signal \\( V_{PD} \\), which is filtered by the LPF to produce a stable control voltage \\( V_{\\text{cont}} \\). This voltage adjusts the VCO's frequency to align \\( \\phi_{\\text{out}} \\) with \\( \\phi_{\\text{in}} \\), achieving phase lock. The inclusion of the LPF ensures that the control voltage remains stable and free from high-frequency noise, which is critical for the steady-state operation of the VCO.\n\nFigure 16.5 (a) Feedback loop comparing input and output phases; (b) simple PLL.\nbecause (1) as shown in the waveforms of Fig. 16.2, the PD output, \\( V_{PD} \\), includes a DC component (desired) and high-frequency components (undesired), and (2) as discussed in Chapter 15, the oscillator's control voltage must remain stable in the steady state, i.e., the PD output must be filtered. Therefore, we insert a low-pass filter (LPF) between the PD and the VCO [Fig. 16.5(b)], which suppresses the high-frequency components of the PD output and provides the DC level to the oscillator. This forms the basic PLL topology. For now, we assume the LPF has a gain of unity at low frequencies (e.g., as in a first-order RC section).\n\nIt is important to note that the feedback loop in Fig. 16.5(b) compares the phases of the input and output. Unlike the feedback configurations studied in previous chapters, PLLs typically do not require knowledge of voltages or currents for their feedback operation. If the loop gain is sufficiently high, the phase difference between the input phase \\( \\phi_{\\text{in}} \\) and the output phase \\( \\phi_{\\text{out}} \\) reduces to a small value in the steady state, achieving phase alignment.\n\nFor detailed PLL analyses, we must precisely define the phase-lock condition. If the loop in Fig. 16.5(b) is locked, we postulate that \\( \\phi_{\\text{out}} - \\phi_{\\text{in}} \\) is constant and preferably small. Thus, we define the loop as locked if \\( \\phi_{\\text{out}} - \\phi_{\\text{in}} \\) remains unchanged over time. An important corollary of this definition is that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{d \\phi_{\\text{out}}}{d t} - \\frac{d \\phi_{\\text{in}}}{d t} = 0 \\tag{16.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand hence\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\omega_{\\text{out}} = \\omega_{\\text{in}} \\tag{16.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis unique property of PLLs will be further explored later.\nIn summary, a locked PLL produces an output with a minimal phase error relative to the input but with exactly the same frequency. One might wonder why a PLL is necessary, as a simple wire might seem to perform the task more effectively! We address this in Sec. 16.5.\n\n#### Example 16.2\n\nImplement a simple PLL in CMOS technology.\n\n#### Solution\n\nFigure 16.6 illustrates an implementation using an XOR gate as the phase detector.

This process of aligning the VCO's output phase with the reference phase is termed \"phase locking.\"\n\nFrom these observations, we infer that a PLL essentially comprises a PD and a VCO in a feedback loop [Fig. 16.5(a)]. The PD compares the phases of $V_{\\text{out}}$ and $V_{\\text{in}}$, generating an error signal that adjusts the VCO frequency until the phases align, i.e., the loop is locked. However, this basic topology requires modification.\n\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:The system block diagram labeled \"(a)\" depicts a basic phase-locked loop (PLL) configuration. It includes two main components: a Phase Detector (PD) and a Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO), arranged in a feedback loop.\n\n1. **Main Components:**\n- **Phase Detector (PD):** This block receives two input signals: the reference signal $V_{\\text{in}}$ and the feedback signal $V_{\\text{out}}$. The PD compares their phases and generates an output voltage $V_{PD}$ proportional to the phase difference.\n- **Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO):** The VCO receives $V_{PD}$ and adjusts its frequency accordingly. Its output, $V_{\\text{out}}$, is fed back to the PD for continuous phase comparison.\n\n2. **Flow of Information or Control:**\n- $V_{\\text{in}}$ and $V_{\\text{out}}$ are input to the PD.\n- The PD outputs $V_{PD}$, which is sent to the VCO.\n- The VCO adjusts its frequency based on $V_{PD}$ and generates $V_{\\text{out}}$.\n- $V_{\\text{out}}$ is fed back to the PD, forming a feedback loop that continuously aligns $V_{\\text{out}}$'s phase with $V_{\\text{in}}$.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n- $V_{\\text{in}}$ and $V_{\\text{out}}$ are labeled as input and output signals, respectively.\n- $V_{PD}$ is the control voltage from the PD to the VCO.\n\n4. **Overall System Function:**\n- The system's primary function is to achieve phase locking, where $V_{\\text{out}}$'s phase aligns with $V_{\\text{in}}$'s phase. This is accomplished through a feedback loop that continuously adjusts the VCO's frequency based on the phase difference detected by the PD. This basic PLL configuration is fundamental in applications requiring precise phase alignment, such as in communication systems and signal processing.\n\nimage_name:(b)\ndescription:The system block diagram labeled \"(b)\" shows a simple Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) with a low-pass filter (LPF) included in the feedback loop to achieve phase locking between an input and output signal.\n\n1. **Main Components:**\n- **Phase Detector (PD):** This block compares the phase of the input signal $V_{\\text{in}}$ with the output signal $V_{\\text{out}}$, generating an output voltage $V_{PD}$ representing the phase difference.\n- **Low-Pass Filter (LPF):** The PD's output, $V_{PD}$, contains both a DC component and high-frequency noise. The LPF filters out the high-frequency components, allowing only the DC component, $V_{\\text{cont}}$, to pass through, which is crucial for adjusting the VCO.\n- **Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO):** The VCO receives $V_{\\text{cont}}$ from the LPF and adjusts its output frequency accordingly. Its output, $V_{\\text{out}}$, is fed back to the PD for continuous phase comparison.\n\n2. **Flow of Information or Control:**\n- $V_{\\text{in}}$ is input to the PD, along with the feedback signal $V_{\\text{out}}$ from the VCO.\n- The PD outputs $V_{PD}$, which is filtered by the LPF to remove high-frequency noise, resulting in $V_{\\text{cont}}$.\n- $V_{\\text{cont}}$ controls the VCO, adjusting its output frequency $V_{\\text{out}}$ to match $V_{\\text{in}}$'s phase.\n- $V_{\\text{out}}$ is fed back to the PD, completing the feedback loop.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n- The input phase is labeled $\\phi_{\\text{in}}$ and the output phase as $\\phi_{\\text{out}}$, indicating their roles in phase comparison and locking.\n- The control voltage is labeled $V_{\\text{cont}}$, emphasizing its role in controlling the VCO.\n\n4. **Overall System Function:**\n- The primary function of this PLL is to synchronize $V_{\\text{out}}$'s phase with $V_{\\text{in}}$'s phase. The PD detects phase differences and generates an error signal $V_{PD}$, which is filtered by the LPF to produce a stable control voltage $V_{\\text{cont}}$. This voltage adjusts the VCO's frequency to align $\\phi_{\\text{out}}$ with $\\phi_{\\text{in}}$, achieving phase lock. The inclusion of the LPF ensures that $V_{\\text{cont}}$ remains stable and free from high-frequency noise, critical for the VCO's steady-state operation.\n\nFigure 16.5 (a) Feedback loop comparing input and output phases; (b) simple PLL.\nbecause (1) as shown in Fig. 16.2, the PD output, $V_{PD}$, includes a DC component (desired) and high-frequency components (undesired), and (2) as discussed in Chapter 15, the oscillator's control voltage must remain stable in the steady state, i.e., the PD output must be filtered. We thus insert a low-pass filter (LPF) between the PD and the VCO [Fig. 16.5(b)], removing the high-frequency components of $V_{PD}$ and presenting the DC level to the oscillator. This forms the basic PLL topology. For now, we assume the LPF has a unity gain at low frequencies (e.g., as in a first-order RC section).\n\nIt is crucial to remember that the feedback loop in Fig. 16.5(b) compares the phases of the input and output. Unlike feedback systems studied in previous chapters, PLLs typically do not require knowledge of voltages or currents in their feedback operation. If the loop gain is sufficiently high, the phase difference between $\\phi_{\\text{in}}$ and $\\phi_{\\text{out}}$ becomes minimal in the steady state, achieving phase alignment.\n\nFor precise PLL analysis, we must clearly define the phase-lock condition. If the loop in Fig. 16.5(b) is locked, we assume $\\phi_{\\text{out}} - \\phi_{\\text{in}}$ is constant and preferably small. Thus, we define the loop as locked if $\\phi_{\\text{out}} - \\phi_{\\text{in}}$ remains constant over time. An important implication of this definition is that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{d \\phi_{\\text{out}}}{d t} - \\frac{d \\phi_{\\text{in}}}{d t} = 0 \\tag{16.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand hence\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\omega_{\\text{out}} = \\omega_{\\text{in}} \\tag{16.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis unique property of PLLs will be further explored later.\nIn summary, a locked PLL produces an output with a minimal phase error relative to the input but an exact frequency match. One might wonder why a PLL is necessary, as a simple wire might seem to perform better! We address this in Sec. 16.5.\n\n#### Example 16.2\n\nImplement a simple PLL in CMOS technology.\n\n#### Solution\n\nFigure 16.6 illustrates a CMOS implementation using an XOR gate as the phase detector. The VCO is configured as a negative-$G_m$ LC oscillator, with varactor diodes for frequency tuning.\nimage_name:Figure 16.6\ndescription:The circuit is a simple PLL implemented in CMOS technology.

This ripple is characteristic of the low-pass filter output in a PLL.\n\nAn annotation indicates the phase difference $\\phi_0$ between $V_{\\text{in}}$ and $V_{\\text{out}}$.\n\nThe ripple in $V_{\\text{cont}}$ is specifically labeled, emphasizing its presence and significance.\n\nThis waveform analysis provides insight into the dynamics of the PLL system, particularly how phase differences and filtering affect the control voltage and system behavior.\n\nThe diagram labeled (b) consists of two linear graphs, each depicting a relationship pertinent to the operation of a PLL.\n\nThe upper graph is a linear plot showing the relationship between output frequency and control voltage in a VCO.\n\nThe vertical axis is labeled as \\( \\omega_{\\text{out}} \\), representing the output frequency, and the horizontal axis is labeled as \\( V_{\\text{cont}} \\), representing the control voltage.\n\nThe graph shows a linear increase in output frequency \\( \\omega_{\\text{out}} \\) as the control voltage \\( V_{\\text{cont}} \\) increases.\n\nThe graph starts at a frequency \\( \\omega_0 \\) and increases to \\( \\omega_1 \\) as \\( V_{\\text{cont}} \\) reaches \\( V_1 \\).\n\nA dashed line indicates the specific point \\( V_1 \\) where the frequency is \\( \\omega_1 \\).\n\nThe lower graph is a linear plot showing the relationship between phase error and output voltage in a PD.\n\nThe vertical axis is labeled as \\( \\overline{V}_{\\text{out}} \\), representing the average output voltage, and the horizontal axis is labeled with phase difference symbols \\( \\phi_0 \\) and \\( \\Delta \\phi \\), indicating the phase error.\n\nThe graph shows a linear increase in average output voltage \\( \\overline{V}_{\\text{out}} \\) with increasing phase error.\n\nThe graph intersects the vertical axis at \\( V_1 \\), indicating the specific output voltage when the phase difference is \\( \\phi_0 \\).\n\nA dashed line highlights the phase difference \\( \\phi_0 \\) and the corresponding output voltage \\( V_1 \\).\n\nThese graphs collectively illustrate the dependencies of both frequency and voltage on control parameters within a PLL system, highlighting the linear characteristics of the VCO and PD components.\n\nIn the waveforms of Fig. 16.7(a), two quantities are unknown: $\\phi_{0}$ and the dc level of $V_{\\text {cont }}$. To determine these values, we construct the VCO and PD characteristics [Fig. 16.7(b)]. If the input and output frequencies are equal to $\\omega_{1}$, then the required oscillator control voltage is unique and equal to $V_{1}$. This voltage must be produced by the phase detector, demanding a phase error determined by the PD characteristic. More specifically, since $\\omega_{\\text {out }}=\\omega_{0}+K_{V C O} V_{\\text {cont }}$ and $\\overline{V_{P D}}=K_{P D} \\Delta \\phi$, we can write\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{1}=\\frac{\\omega_{1}-\\omega_{0}}{K_{V C O}}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\phi_{0} & =\\frac{V_{1}}{K_{P D}}\\\\\n& =\\frac{\\omega_{1}-\\omega_{0}}{K_{P D} K_{V C O}}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nEquation (16.5) reveals two important points: (1) as the input frequency of the PLL varies, so does the phase error; and (2) to minimize the phase error, $K_{P D} K_{V C O}$ must be maximized.\n\n#### Example 16.3\n\nA PLL incorporates a VCO and a PD having the characteristics shown in Fig. 16.8. Explain what happens as the input frequency varies in the locked condition.\n\nThe graph in Figure 16.8 consists of two separate plots that illustrate the characteristics of a PLL system, specifically focusing on the VCO and PD.\n\nLeft Plot: VCO Characteristic\n\nThe horizontal axis is labeled as $V_{cont}$, representing the control voltage, and the vertical axis is labeled as $\\omega_{out}$, representing the output frequency.\n\nThe plot shows a linear relationship between the control voltage $V_{cont}$ and the output frequency $\\omega_{out}$.\n\nThe line starts at $\\omega_{0}$ when $V_{cont}$ is zero and increases linearly with $V_{cont}$.\n\nThe line reaches $\\omega_{x}$ at the control voltage $V_{0}$, indicating the maximum output frequency achievable with this setup.\n\nThis behavior suggests that increasing the control voltage results in a proportional increase in the output frequency, up to a certain limit.\n\nRight Plot: PD Characteristic\n\nThe horizontal axis is labeled as $\\Delta \\phi$, representing the phase difference, and the vertical axis is labeled as $\\overline{V_{out}}$, representing the average output voltage.\n\nThe plot depicts a sinusoidal relationship between the phase difference $\\Delta \\phi$ and the average output voltage $\\overline{V_{out}}$.\n\nThe sine wave crosses the horizontal axis at the origin and has peaks at $\\pm \\pi/2$.\n\nThe maximum and minimum average output voltages are $\\pm V_{0}$, occurring at phase differences of $\\pm \\pi/2$.\n\nThis indicates that the PD has a linear response near the origin but saturates at $\\pm \\pi/2$, where the average output reaches its extreme values.\n\nThe linear plot on the left marks the specific points $\\omega_{0}$ and $\\omega_{x}$, with the corresponding control voltages $0$ and $V_{0}$, respectively.\n\nThe sinusoidal plot on the right highlights the critical phase differences $\\pm \\pi/2$ where the output voltage reaches $\\pm V_{0}$.\n\n#### Solution\n\nThe PD characteristic is relatively linear near the origin but exhibits a small-signal gain of zero if the phase difference equals $\\pm \\pi / 2$, at which point the average output is equal to $\\pm V_{0}$. Now suppose the input frequency increases from $\\omega_{0}$, requiring a greater control voltage. If the frequency is high enough $\\left(=\\omega_{x}\\right)$ to dictate $V_{c o n t}=V_{0}$, then the PD must operate at the peak of its characteristic. However, the PD gain drops to zero here and the feedback loop fails. Thus, the circuit cannot lock if the input frequency reaches $\\omega_{X}$.\n\nWith the basic understanding of PLLs developed thus far, we now return to Eq. (16.2). The exact equality of the input and output frequencies of a PLL in the locked condition is a critical attribute. The significance of this property can be seen from two observations. First, in many applications, even a very small (deterministic) frequency error may prove unacceptable. For example, if a data stream is to be processed synchronously by a clocked system, even a slight difference between the data rate and the clock frequency results in a \"drift,\" creating errors (Fig. 16.9). Second, the equality would not exist if the PLL compared the input and output frequencies rather than phases. As illustrated in Fig. 16.10(a), a loop employing a frequency detector (FD) would suffer from a finite difference between $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$ and $\\omega_{\\text {out }}$ due to various mismatches and other nonidealities. This can be understood by an analogy with the unity-gain feedback circuit of Fig. 16.10(b). Even if the op amp's open-loop gain is infinity, the input-referred offset voltage leads to a finite error between $V_{i n}$ and $V_{\\text {out }}$.\n\nSmall Transients in Locked Condition Let us now analyze the response of a PLL in the locked condition to small phase or frequency transients at the input.\n\nThe graph in Figure 16.9 illustrates the drift of data with respect to a clock signal in the presence of a small frequency error. This is a time-domain waveform graph with two signals plotted against time on the horizontal axis, which is typically measured in arbitrary time units (e.g., seconds, milliseconds). The vertical axis represents the logical levels of the signals, commonly denoted as high and low states. The two signals shown are labeled as 'Data' and 'Clock'.\n\nThe data signal is a square wave with a periodic pattern, representing a digital data signal. It alternates between high and low states. The transitions between these states are vertical, indicating instantaneous changes, which is characteristic of digital signals.\n\nThe clock signal is below the data signal and is also a square wave with a similar periodicity. However, due to a small frequency error, there is a noticeable drift between the data and clock signals. The clock signal is meant to synchronize with the data signal, but the misalignment due to frequency error is evident.\n\nThe graph shows that over time, the rising and falling edges of the data signal gradually shift relative to the clock signal. This drift is highlighted by dotted vertical lines that emphasize the misalignment at specific points in the waveform. Initially, the data and clock transitions are aligned, but as time progresses, the data signal transitions occur slightly later than the corresponding clock transitions.\n\nThe graph highlights the critical issue of timing misalignment due to frequency mismatches in systems that rely on precise synchronization, such as PLLs in communication systems. This drift can lead to errors in data interpretation if not corrected.\n\nThis graph effectively demonstrates the concept of timing drift and serves as a visual representation of the challenges posed by frequency errors in synchronized digital systems.\n\nFigure 16.9 Drift of data with respect to clock in the presence of small frequency error.\n\nThe system block diagram labeled \"(a)\" represents a Frequency-Locked Loop (FLL), which is commonly used in communication systems to maintain synchronization between an input and output frequency. This configuration consists of three main components:\n\n1. **Frequency Detector (FD):** This block receives the input signal \\( V_{in} \\) and compares its frequency with the feedback signal. The output of the FD is a signal that represents the frequency difference between the input and the feedback loop.\n\n2. **Low Pass Filter (LPF):** The output from the FD is fed into the LPF. The LPF smooths out the frequency difference signal by filtering out high-frequency noise, providing a stable control signal to the next stage. This helps in maintaining a steady state in the loop by removing rapid fluctuations.\n\n3. **Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO):** The filtered signal from the LPF is used to control the VCO. The VCO adjusts its output frequency based on the control signal, aligning it closely with the input frequency. The output \\( V_{out} \\) is then fed back into the FD to complete the loop.\n\nThe flow of information is as follows:\n\n- The input signal \\( V_{in} \\) enters the FD, where it is compared with the feedback signal.\n- The FD outputs a frequency error signal to the LPF.\n- The LPF processes this signal, filtering out noise, and sends a stable control signal to the VCO.\n- The VCO adjusts its frequency output based on the control signal, producing \\( V_{out} \\).\n- \\( V_{out} \\) is fed back into the FD, forming a closed-loop system.\n\nThe primary function of this system is to lock the output frequency \\( V_{out} \\) to the input frequency \\( V_{in} \\) by continuously adjusting the VCO based on the feedback from the FD and the control signal from the LPF. This ensures that any frequency drift is corrected, maintaining synchronization between input and output frequencies.\n\nThe circuit diagram (b) represents a unity-gain feedback amplifier, where the output is directly connected to the inverting input, creating a buffer configuration.\n\nFigure 16.10 (a) Frequency-locked loop; (b) unity-gain feedback amplifier.\n\nConsider a PLL in the locked condition and assume that the input and output waveforms can be expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nV_{\\text {in }}(t) & =V_{A} \\cos \\omega_{1} t\\\\\nV_{\\text {out }}(t) & =V_{B} \\cos \\left(\\omega_{1} t+\\phi_{0}\\right)\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere higher harmonics are neglected and $\\phi_{0}$ is the static phase error. Suppose, as shown in Fig. 16.11, the input experiences a phase step of $\\phi_{1}$ at $t=t_{1}$, i.e., $\\phi_{i n}=\\omega_{1} t+\\phi_{1} u\\left(t-t_{1}\\right) .$ The phase step manifests itself as a rising edge in $V_{i n}$ that occurs earlier (or later) than the periodicity would dictate. Alternatively, we can say that the phase step results in a shorter (or longer) period just before $t_{1}$. Since the output of the LPF does not change instantaneously, the VCO initially continues to oscillate at $\\omega_{1}$. The growing phase difference between the input and the output then creates wide pulses at the output of the PD, forcing $V_{L P F}$ to rise gradually. As a result, the VCO frequency begins to change, attempting to minimize the phase error. Note that the loop is not locked during the transient because the phase error varies with time.\n\nThe graph depicts the response of a PLL to a phase step, as illustrated in Figure 16.11. This is a time-domain waveform graph, which shows the behavior of various signals within the PLL system over time.\n\nThe horizontal axis represents time, denoted as 't', and the vertical axes represent different signals: \\(V_{in}\\), \\(V_{out}\\), \\(V_{PD}\\), \\(V_{LPF}\\), and \\(\\omega_{out}\\). The units for these signals are not explicitly labeled, but they are typically in volts for voltage signals and radians per second for frequency.\n\nThe phase step \\(\\phi_1\\) at \\(t_1\\) is a critical event, initiating the transient response.\n\nThe gray areas under the \\(V_{LPF}\\) and \\(\\omega_{out}\\) curves indicate the transient response of the PLL system as it attempts to lock back to the input frequency.\n\nThe time \\(t_1\\) is marked with a vertical dashed line, indicating the moment the phase step occurs.\n\nThe phase shift \\(\\phi_1\\) is annotated between the \\(\\phi_{in}\\) and \\(\\phi_{out}\\) lines, highlighting the initial phase difference introduced to the system.\n\nFigure 16.11 Response of a PLL to a phase step.\n\nWhat happens after the VCO frequency begins to change? If the loop is to return to lock, $\\omega_{\\text {out }}$ must eventually go back to $\\omega_{1}$, requiring that $V_{L P F}$ and hence $\\phi_{\\text {out }}-\\phi_{i n}$ also return to their original values. Since $\\phi_{\\text {in }}$ has changed by $\\phi_{1}$, the variation in the VCO frequency is such that the area under $\\omega_{\\text {out }}$ provides an additional phase of $\\phi_{1}$ in $\\phi_{\\text {out }}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\int_{t 1}^{\\infty} \\omega_{\\text {out }} d t=\\phi_{1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, when the loop settles, the output becomes equal to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {out }}(t)=V_{B} \\cos \\left[\\omega_{1} t+\\phi_{0}+\\phi_{1} u\\left(t-t_{1}\\right)\\right]\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nConsequently, as shown in Fig. 16.11, $\\phi_{\\text {out }}$ gradually \"catches up\" with $\\phi_{i n}$.\n\nIt is important to make two observations. (1) After the loop returns to lock, all of the parameters (except for the total input and output phases) assume their original values. That is, $\\phi_{\\text {in }}-\\phi_{\\text {out }}, V_{L P F}$, and the VCO frequency remain unchanged—an expected result because these three parameters bear a one-to-one relationship and the input frequency has stayed the same. (2) The control voltage of the oscillator can serve as a suitable test point in the analysis of PLLs. While it is difficult to measure the time variations of phase and frequency in Fig. 16.11, $V_{\\text {cont }}\\left(=V_{L P F}\\right)$ can be readily monitored in simulations and measurements.\n\nThe reader may wonder whether an input phase step always gives rise to the response shown in Fig. 16.11. For example, is it possible for $V_{L"

Since \\( \\phi_{\\text {in }} \\) has changed by \\( \\phi_{1} \\), the variation in the VCO frequency is such that the area under \\( \\omega_{\\text {out }} \\) provides an additional phase of \\( \\phi_{1} \\) in \\( \\phi_{\\text {out }} \\):\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\int_{t 1}^{\\infty} \\omega_{\\text {out }} d t=\\phi_{1} \\tag{16.8}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, when the loop settles, the output becomes equal to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {out }}(t)=V_{B} \\cos \\left[\\omega_{1} t+\\phi_{0}+\\phi_{1} u\\left(t-t_{1}\\right)\\right] \\tag{16.9}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nConsequently, as shown in Fig. 16.11, \\( \\phi_{\\text {out }} \\) gradually \"catches up\" with \\( \\phi_{i n} \\).\n\nIt is important to make two observations. (1) After the loop returns to lock, all of the parameters (except for the total input and output phases) assume their original values. That is, \\( \\phi_{\\text {in }}-\\phi_{\\text {out }}, V_{L P F} \\), and the VCO frequency remain unchanged—an expected result because these three parameters bear a one-to-one relationship and the input frequency has stayed the same. (2) The control voltage of the oscillator can serve as a suitable test point in the analysis of PLLs. While it is difficult to measure the time variations of phase and frequency in Fig. 16.11, \\( V_{\\text {cont }}\\left(=V_{L P F}\\right) \\) can be readily monitored in simulations and measurements.\n\nThe reader may wonder whether an input phase step always gives rise to the response shown in Fig. 16.11. For example, is it possible for \\( V_{L P F} \\) to ring before settling to its final value? Such behavior is indeed possible and will be quantified in Sec. 16.1.3.\n\nLet us now examine the response of PLLs to a small input frequency step \\( \\Delta \\omega \\) at \\( t=t_{1} \\) (Fig. 16.12). As with the case of a phase step, the VCO continues to oscillate at \\( \\omega_{1} \\) immediately after \\( t_{1} \\). Thus, the PD generates increasingly wider pulses, and \\( V_{L P F} \\) rises with time. As \\( \\omega_{\\text {out }} \\) approaches \\( \\omega_{1}+\\Delta \\omega \\), the width of the pulses generated by the PD decreases, eventually settling to a value that produces a dc component equal to \\( \\left(\\omega_{1}+\\Delta \\omega-\\omega_{0}\\right) / K_{V C O} \\). In contrast to the case of a phase step, the response of a PLL to a frequency step entails a permanent change in both the control voltage and the phase error. If the input frequency is varied slowly, \\( \\omega_{\\text {out }} \\) simply \"tracks\" \\( \\omega_{\\text {in }} \\).\n\nFigure 16.12 Response of a PLL to a small frequency step.\n\nThe exact settling behavior of PLLs depends on the various loop parameters and will be studied in Sec. 16.1.3. But, to arrive at an important observation, we consider the phase step response depicted in Fig. 16.13, where \\( V_{\\text {cont }} \\) rings before settling to its final value. Consider the state of the loop at \\( t=t_{2} \\). At this point, the output frequency is equal to its final value (because \\( V_{\\text {cont }} \\) is equal to its final value), but the loop continues the transient because the phase error deviates from the required value. Similarly, at \\( t=t_{3} \\), the phase error is equal to its final value, but the output frequency is not. In other words, for the loop to settle, both the phase and the frequency must settle to their proper values.\n\nFigure 16.13 Example of phase step response.\n\n#### Example 16.4\n\nIn the PLL shown in Fig. 16.14, an external voltage \\( V_{e x} \\) is added to the output of the low-pass filter. (a) Determine the phase error and \\( V_{L P F} \\) if the loop is locked and \\( V_{e x}=V_{1} \\). (b) Suppose \\( V_{e x} \\) steps from \\( V_{1} \\) to \\( V_{2} \\) at \\( t=t_{1} \\). How does the loop respond?\n\nFigure 16.14 illustrates a PLL system with several key components arranged in a feedback loop configuration: Phase Detector (PD), Low-Pass Filter (LPF), Summing Junction, Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO), and Feedback Loop.\n\nThe PLL system is designed to synchronize the frequency and phase of the output signal \\( V_{out} \\) with the input signal \\( V_{in} \\). The addition of the external voltage \\( V_{ex} \\) allows for adjustment of the control voltage, influencing how the loop responds to changes and maintains lock, particularly when \\( V_{ex} \\) changes from \\( V_{1} \\) to \\( V_{2} \\). The system's stability and damping characteristics are reflected in the gradual changes observed in the frequency and phase of the output signal.\n\nFigure 16.14\n\n#### Solution\n\n(a) If the loop is locked, \\( \\omega_{\\text {out }}=\\omega_{\\text {in }} \\) and \\( V_{\\text {cont }}=\\left(\\omega_{\\text {in }}-\\omega_{0}\\right) / K_{V C O} \\).

    "text": "In the previous section, we conducted a qualitative analysis of Phase-Locked Loops (PLLs), which now allows us to delve into their transient behavior with greater precision. Considering the loop to be initially locked, we approach the PLL as a feedback system, acknowledging that our analysis must focus on the phase of the Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO) as the output quantity since the \"error amplifier\" solely compares phases. Our goal is to ascertain the transfer function, $\\Phi_{\\text {out }}(s) / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s)$, for both the open-loop and closed-loop configurations, and thereafter to investigate the time-domain response. It's important to note the transition from phase to voltage through the Phase Detector (PD) and the subsequent conversion from voltage back to phase via the VCO.\n\nThe significance of $\\Phi_{\\text {out }}(s) / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s)$ can be elucidated through an analogy with more traditional transfer functions. A circuit with a transfer function $V_{\\text {out }}(s) / V_{\\text {in }}(s)=1 /\\left(1+s / \\omega_{0}\\right)$ is regarded as a low-pass filter because the output, $V_{\\text {out }}$, is unable to completely follow rapid variations in the input, $V_{\\text {in }}$. Similarly, $\\Phi_{\\text {out }}(s) / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s)$ discloses how the output phase tracks the input phase, regardless of whether the latter changes slowly or rapidly.\n\nTo conceptualize the progression of the excess phase over time, we can refer to the waveforms depicted in Figure 16.15. The period of the waveform evolves gradually in Figure 16.15(a) and swiftly in Figure 16.15(b). Consequently, $y_{2}(t)$ undergoes phase variations at a faster rate compared to $y_{1}(t)$.\n\nIn constructing a linear model of the PLL, we assume a first-order low-pass filter for simplicity. The PD output includes a direct current (dc) component equivalent to $K_{P D}\\left(\\phi_{\\text {out }}-\\phi_{i n}\\right)$, in addition to high-frequency components. As these high-frequency components are attenuated by the LPF, we can model the PD as a subtractor, the output of which is \"amplified\" by $K_{P D}$. The overall PLL model, as shown in Figure 16.16, comprises the phase subtractor, the LPF transfer function $1 /\\left(1+s / \\omega_{L P F}\\right)$ (where $\\omega_{L P F}$ signifies the $-3-\\mathrm{dB}$ bandwidth), and the VCO transfer function $K_{V C O} / s$ (as discussed in Chapter 15). Here, $\\Phi_{\\text {in }}$ and $\\Phi_{\\text {out }}$ represent the excess phases of the input and output waveforms, respectively.\n\nThe open-loop transfer function is expressed as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {open }} & =\\left.\\frac{\\Phi_{\\text {out }}}{\\Phi_{\\text {in }}}(s)\\right|_{\\text {open }}  \\tag{16.11}\\\\\n& =K_{P D} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{s}{\\omega_{L P F}}} \\cdot \\frac{K_{V C O}}{s} \\tag{16.12}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis reveals a pole at $s=-\\omega_{L P F}$ and another at $s=0$. The loop gain is equivalent to $\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {open }}$ due to the unity feedback factor. Because the loop gain possesses a pole at the origin, the system is classified as \"type I.\"\n\nPrior to calculating the closed-loop transfer function, we note an important observation. What is the loop gain when $s$ is exceptionally small, implying that the input excess phase changes very slowly? Due to the pole at the origin, the loop gain approaches infinity as $s$ approaches zero, a contrast to the feedback circuits examined in Chapters 8 and 10. Thus, the phase-locked loop (when in a closed-loop, locked state) ensures that the change in $\\phi_{\\text {out }}$ exactly matches the change in $\\phi_{\\text {in }}$ as $s$ tends to zero. This outcome portends two intriguing properties of PLLs. First, if the input excess phase changes very slowly, the output excess phase \"tracks\" it. (After all, $\\phi_{\\text {out }}$ is \"locked\" to $\\phi_{\\text {in }}$.) Second, if the transients in $\\phi_{i n}$ have dissipated (another scenario corresponding to $s \\rightarrow 0$ ), then the change in $\\phi_{\\text {out }}$ is exactly equal to the change in $\\phi_{i n}$. This is indeed accurate in the example portrayed in Figure 16.11.\n\nFrom (16.12), we can formulate the closed-loop transfer function as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {closed }}=\\frac{K_{P D} K_{V C O}}{\\frac{s^{2}}{\\omega_{L P F}}+s+K_{P D} K_{V C O}} \\tag{16.13}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor brevity, we henceforth denote $\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {closed }}$ simply by $H(s)$ or $\\Phi_{\\text {out }} / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}$. Predictably, if $s \\rightarrow 0, H(s) \\rightarrow 1$ due to the infinite loop gain.\n\nTo further analyze $H(s)$, we derive a relationship that facilitates a more intuitive comprehension of the system. Recollecting from Chapter 15 that the instantaneous frequency of a waveform is the time derivative of the phase: $\\omega=d \\phi / d t$. Since the frequency and the phase are related by a linear operator, the transfer function of (16.13) applies to fluctuations in the input and output frequencies as well:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\omega_{\\text {out }}}{\\omega_{\\text {in }}}(s)=\\frac{K_{P D} K_{V C O}}{\\frac{s^{2}}{\\omega_{L P F}}+s+K_{P D} K_{V C O}} \\tag{16.14}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor instance, this result indicates that if $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$ changes very slowly $(s \\rightarrow 0)$, then $\\omega_{\\text {out }}$ tracks $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$, which is an anticipated outcome since the loop is assumed to be locked. Equation (16.14) also suggests that if $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$ changes abruptly, but the system is allowed ample time to stabilize ( $s \\rightarrow 0$ ), then the change in $\\omega_{\\text {out }}$ equals that in $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$ (as exemplified in the case of Figure 16.12).\n\nThis observation aids the analysis in two dimensions. First, certain transient responses of the closed-loop system may be more straightforward to conceptualize in terms of alterations in the frequency variables rather than the phase variables. Second, since a change in $\\omega_{\\text {out }}$ must be accompanied by a change in $V_{\\text {cont }}$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nH(s)=K_{V C O} \\cdot \\frac{V_{\\text {cont }}}{\\omega_{\\text {in }}}(s) \\tag{16.15}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThat is, observing the response of $V_{\\text {cont }}$ to fluctuations in $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$ indeed yields the response of the closed-loop system.\n\nThe second-order transfer function of (16.13) implies that the step response of the type I system can be overdamped, critically damped, or underdamped. To derive the condition for each scenario, we rephrase the denominator in a familiar form used in control theory, $s^{2}+2 \\zeta \\omega_{n} s+\\omega_{n}^{2}$, where $\\zeta$ is the \"damping factor\" and $\\omega_{n}$ is the \"natural frequency.\" That is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nH(s)=\\frac{\\omega_{n}^{2}}{s^{2}+2 \\zeta \\omega_{n} s+\\omega_{n}^{2}} \\tag{16.16}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}\n\\omega_{n}=\\sqrt{\\omega_{L P F} K_{P D} K_{V C O}} \\\\\n\\zeta=\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega_{L P F}}{K_{P D} K_{V C O}}} \\tag{16.18}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe two poles of the closed-loop system are expressed as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ns_{1,2} & =-\\zeta \\omega_{n} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\zeta^{2}-1\\right) \\omega_{n}^{2}}  \\tag{16.19}\\\\\n& =\\left(-\\zeta \\pm \\sqrt{\\left.\\zeta^{2}-1\\right)} \\omega_{n}\\right. \\tag{16.20}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThus, if $\\zeta>1$, both poles are real, the system is overdamped, and the transient response contains two exponentials with time constants $1 / s_{1}$ and $1 / s_{2}$. Conversely, if $\\zeta<1$, the poles are complex, and the response to an input frequency step $\\omega_{i n}=\\Delta \\omega u(t)$ is represented by:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\omega_{\\text {out }}(t) & =\\left\\{1-e^{-\\zeta \\omega_{n} t}\\left[\\cos \\left(\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}} t\\right)+\\frac{\\zeta}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}} \\sin \\left(\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}} t\\right)\\right]\\right\\} \\Delta \\omega u(t)  \\tag{16.21}\\\\\n& =\\left[1-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}} e^{-\\zeta \\omega_{n} t} \\sin \\left(\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}} t+\\theta\\right)\\right] \\Delta \\omega u(t) \\tag{16.22}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\omega_{\\text {out }}$ denotes the shift in the output frequency and $\\theta=\\sin ^{-1} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}$. Therefore, as illustrated in Figure 16.17, the step response incorporates a sinusoidal component with a frequency $\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}$ that diminishes with a time constant $\\left(\\zeta \\omega_{n}\\right)^{-1}$. It is important to note that the system exhibits the same response if a phase step is applied to the input and the output phase is observed.\n\nThe settling speed of PLLs is of paramount importance in the majority of applications. Equation (16.22) suggests that the exponential decay dictates how swiftly the output approaches its final value, implying that $\\zeta \\omega_{n}$ must be maximized. For the type I PLL under examination, (16.17) and (16.18) yield:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\zeta \\omega_{n}=\\frac{1}{2} \\omega_{L P F} \\tag{16.23}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis outcome reveals a critical trade-off between the settling speed and the oscillation on the VCO control line: the lower the $\\omega_{L P F}$, the greater the suppression of the high-frequency components produced by the PD, but the longer the settling time constant.\n\n#### Example 16.5\n\nA cellular telephone incorporates a $900-\\mathrm{MHz}$ phase-locked loop to generate the carrier frequencies. If $\\omega_{L P F}=$ $2 \\pi \\times(20 \\mathrm{kHz})$ and the output frequency is to be changed from 901 MHz to 901.2 MHz, how long does the PLL output frequency take to stabilize within 100 Hz of its final value?\n\n#### Solution\n\nGiven that the step size is 200 kHz, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left[1-e^{-\\zeta \\omega_{n} t_{s}} \\sin \\left(\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}} t_{s}+\\theta\\right)\\right] \\times 200 \\mathrm{kHz}=200 \\mathrm{kHz}-100 \\mathrm{~Hz} \\tag{16.24}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ne^{-\\zeta \\omega_{n} t_{s}} \\sin \\left(\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}} t_{s}+\\theta\\right)=\\frac{100 \\mathrm{~Hz}}{200 \\mathrm{kHz}} \\tag{16.25}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, the sinusoid equals unity, leading to:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ne^{-\\zeta \\omega_{n} t_{s}}=0.0005 \\tag{16.26}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nTherefore:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nt_{s} & =\\frac{7.6}{\\zeta \\omega_{n}}  \\tag{16.27}\\\\\n& =\\frac{15.2}{\\omega_{L P F}}  \\tag{16.28}\\\\\n& =0.12 \\mathrm{~ms} \\tag{16.29}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIn addition to the product $\\zeta \\omega_{n}$, the value of $\\zeta$ itself is also significant. As depicted in Figure 16.18 for several values of $\\zeta$ and a constant $\\omega_{n}$, the step response exhibits severe ringing for $\\zeta<0.5$. Considering the potential process and temperature variation of the loop parameters, $\\zeta$ is typically selected to be greater than $\\sqrt{2} / 2$ or even 1 to avert excessive ringing.\n\nThis choice of $\\zeta$ entails other trade-offs as well. First, (16.18) implies that as $\\omega_{L P F}$ is diminished to minimize the oscillation on the control voltage, the stability deteriorates. Second, (16.5) and (16.18) indicate that both the phase error and $\\zeta$ are inversely proportional to $K_{P D} K_{V C O}$; diminishing the phase error unavoidably makes the system less stable. In summary, the type I PLL grapples with trade-offs among the settling speed, the oscillation on the control voltage (i.e., the quality of the output signal), the phase error, and the stability.\n\nThe stability characteristics of PLLs can also be analyzed graphically for further insight. Recollecting from Chapter 10 that the Bode plots of the magnitude and phase of the loop gain readily yield the phase margin. Let us employ (16.12) to construct such plots. As demonstrated in Figure 16.19, the loop gain commences at infinity at $\\omega=0$ and decreases at a rate of $20 \\mathrm{~dB} / \\mathrm{dec}$ for $\\omega<\\omega_{L P F}$ and at a rate of $40 \\mathrm{~dB} / \\mathrm{dec}$ thereafter. The phase begins at $-90^{\\circ}$ and asymptotically reaches $-180^{\\circ}$.\n\nWhat transpires if a higher $K_{P D} K_{V C O}$ is selected to minimize $\\phi_{o u t}-\\phi_{\\text {in }}$? Since the entire gain plot in Figure 16.19 is shifted upwards, the gain crossover shifts to the right, thereby degrading the phase margin. This aligns with the dependence of $\\zeta$ upon $K_{P D} K_{V C O}$.\n\nAs observed thus far, $K_{P D} K_{V C O}$ influences numerous pivotal parameters of PLLs. This quantity is occasionally termed the loop gain (even though it is not dimensionless) due to the similarity of $\\Delta \\phi=\\left(\\omega_{\\text {out }}-\\omega_{0}\\right) /\\left(K_{P D} K_{V C O}\\right)$ to the error equation in a feedback system.\n\nThe stability characteristics of type I PLLs can also be analyzed by the locus of their poles in the complex plane as the parameter $K_{P D} K_{V C O}$ varies (Figure 16.20). With $K_{P D} K_{V C O}=0$, the loop is open, $\\zeta=\\infty$, and the two poles are situated at $s_{1}=-\\omega_{L P F}$ and $s_{2}=0$. As $K_{P D} K_{V C O}$ increases (i.e., the feedback becomes stronger), $\\zeta$ diminishes, and the two poles, given by $s_{1,2}=\\left(-\\zeta \\pm \\sqrt{\\zeta^{2}-1}\\right) \\omega_{n}$, converge towards each other on the real axis. For $\\zeta=1$ (i.e., $\\left.K_{P D} K_{V C O}=\\omega_{L P F} / 4\\right), s_{1}=s_{2}=-\\zeta \\omega_{n}=-\\omega_{L P F} / 2$. As $K_{P D} K_{V C O}$ continues to increase, the two poles become complex, with a real part equal to $-\\zeta \\omega_{n}=-\\omega_{L P F} / 2$, moving in parallel with the $j \\omega$ axis.\n\nWe discern from Figure 16.20 that, as $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ drift away from the real axis, the system becomes less stable. In fact, the reader can verify that $\\cos"

    "text": "Having established a qualitative understanding of Phase-Locked Loops (PLLs) previously, we can now delve deeper into their transient behavior. Suppose the loop starts in a locked state; we will analyze the PLL as a feedback system, keeping in mind that the output quantity we focus on is the phase difference of the Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO), since the \"error amplifier\" is designed to compare phases. Our goal is to ascertain the transfer function, $\\Phi_{\\text {out }}(s) / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s)$, for both open-loop and closed-loop configurations and then examine the response in the time domain. It's crucial to note the conversion of dimensions from phase to voltage through the Phase Detector (PD) and back to phase through the VCO.\n\nThe meaning behind $\\Phi_{\\text {out }}(s) / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s)$ can be illuminated by an analogy with more conventional transfer functions. Consider a circuit with a transfer function $V_{\\text {out }}(s) / V_{\\text {in }}(s)=1 /\\left(1+s / \\omega_{0}\\right)$, which acts as a low-pass filter. If $V_{\\text {in }}$ changes quickly, $V_{\\text {out }}$ cannot keep up with the input variations. Similarly, $\\Phi_{\\text {out }}(s) / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s)$ shows how well the output phase follows the input phase, regardless of whether the latter changes slowly or quickly.\n\nTo visualize how the phase difference evolves over time, refer to the waveforms in Fig. 16.15. In Fig. 16.15(a), the period changes slowly, while in Fig. 16.15(b), it changes rapidly. Consequently, $y_{2}(t)$ undergoes faster phase changes compared to $y_{1}(t)$.\n\nIn constructing a linear model of the PLL, we simplify by assuming a first-order low-pass filter. The PD output includes a direct current (dc) component proportional to $K_{P D}\\left(\\phi_{\\text {out }}-\\phi_{i n}\\right)$ along with high-frequency components that are filtered out by the LPF. We model the PD as a subtractor with its output amplified by $K_{P D}$. As depicted in Fig. 16.16, the PLL model incorporates the phase subtractor, the LPF transfer function $1 /\\left(1+s / \\omega_{L P F}\\right)$, where $\\omega_{L P F}$ is the $-3-\\mathrm{dB}$ bandwidth, and the VCO transfer function $K_{V C O} / s$.\n\nWhen the total input phase undergoes a step change, $\\phi_{1} u(t)$, the Laplace transform of the input phase is $\\Phi_{i n}(s)=\\phi_{1} / s$.\n\nThe open-loop transfer function is expressed as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {open }} & =\\left.\\frac{\\Phi_{\\text {out }}}{\\Phi_{\\text {in }}}(s)\\right|_{\\text {open }}  \\tag{16.11}\\\\\n& =K_{P D} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{s}{\\omega_{L P F}}} \\cdot \\frac{K_{V C O}}{s} \\tag{16.12}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis function reveals a pole at $s=-\\omega_{L P F}$ and another at $s=0$. The loop gain is equal to $\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {open }}$ due to the unity feedback factor, and because the loop gain has a pole at the origin, the system is classified as \"type I.\"\n\nBefore calculating the closed-loop transfer function, it's essential to observe that when $s$ is very small, meaning the input phase changes slowly, the loop gain tends to infinity as $s$ approaches zero. This is unlike the feedback circuits studied in Chapters 8 and 10. Thus, under closed-loop conditions, the PLL ensures that any change in $\\phi_{\\text {out }}$ matches the change in $\\phi_{\\text {in }}$ as $s$ goes to zero. This leads to two key PLL properties: the output phase tracks the input phase if it varies slowly, and the change in $\\phi_{\\text {out }}$ matches the change in $\\phi_{i n}$ after transients have decayed.\n\nFrom the open-loop transfer function, we derive the closed-loop transfer function:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {closed }}=\\frac{K_{P D} K_{V C O}}{\\frac{s^{2}}{\\omega_{L P F}}+s+K_{P D} K_{V C O}} \\tag{16.13}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHereafter, we'll denote $\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {closed }}$ simply by $H(s)$ or $\\Phi_{\\text {out }} / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}$. As expected, if $s \\rightarrow 0, H(s) \\rightarrow 1$ due to the infinite loop gain.\n\nTo gain a more intuitive understanding of the system, we derive a relationship based on the instantaneous frequency of a waveform, which is the time derivative of the phase: $\\omega=d \\phi / d t$. Since the frequency and phase are related by a linear operator, the transfer function of (16.13) also applies to variations in input and output frequencies:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\omega_{\\text {out }}}{\\omega_{\\text {in }}}(s)=\\frac{K_{P D} K_{V C O}}{\\frac{s^{2}}{\\omega_{L P F}}+s+K_{P D} K_{V C O}} \\tag{16.14}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis result indicates that if $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$ changes slowly $(s \\rightarrow 0)$, then $\\omega_{\\text {out }}$ tracks $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$, as expected because the loop is locked. Equation (16.14) also shows that if $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$ changes abruptly but the system has enough time to stabilize $(s \\rightarrow 0)$, then the change in $\\omega_{\\text {out }}$ matches that in $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$.\n\nThe above observations facilitate the analysis in two ways. First, some transient responses are easier to visualize in terms of frequency changes rather than phase changes. Second, since a change in $\\omega_{\\text {out }}$ necessitates a change in $V_{\\text {cont }}$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nH(s)=K_{V C O} \\cdot \\frac{V_{\\text {cont }}}{\\omega_{\\text {in }}}(s) \\tag{16.15}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis implies that observing the response of $V_{\\text {cont }}$ to $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$ variations provides insight into the closed-loop system's response.\n\nThe second-order transfer function of (16.13) suggests that the step response of the type I system can be overdamped, critically damped, or underdamped. To determine the conditions for each case, we rewrite the denominator in the standard form $s^{2}+2 \\zeta \\omega_{n} s+\\omega_{n}^{2}$, where $\\zeta$ is the damping factor and $\\omega_{n}$ is the natural frequency:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nH(s)=\\frac{\\omega_{n}^{2}}{s^{2}+2 \\zeta \\omega_{n} s+\\omega_{n}^{2}} \\tag{16.16}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}\n\\omega_{n}=\\sqrt{\\omega_{L P F} K_{P D} K_{V C O}} \\\\\n\\zeta=\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega_{L P F}}{K_{P D} K_{V C O}}} \\tag{16.18}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe poles of the closed-loop system are given by:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ns_{1,2} & =-\\zeta \\omega_{n} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\zeta^{2}-1\\right) \\omega_{n}^{2}}  \\tag{16.19}\\\\\n& =\\left(-\\zeta \\pm \\sqrt{\\left.\\zeta^{2}-1\\right)} \\omega_{n}\\right. \\tag{16.20}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThus, if $\\zeta>1$, the system is overdamped, and the transient response consists of two exponentials with time constants $1 / s_{1}$ and $1 / s_{2}$. If $\\zeta<1$, the poles are complex, and the response to an input frequency step $\\omega_{i n}=\\Delta \\omega u(t)$ is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\omega_{\\text {out }}(t) & =\\left\\{1-e^{-\\zeta \\omega_{n} t}\\left[\\cos \\left(\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}} t\\right)+\\frac{\\zeta}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}} \\sin \\left(\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}} t\\right)\\right]\\right\\} \\Delta \\omega u(t)  \\tag{16.21}\\\\\n& =\\left[1-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}} e^{-\\zeta \\omega_{n} t} \\sin \\left(\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}} t+\\theta\\right)\\right] \\Delta \\omega u(t) \\tag{16.22}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\omega_{\\text {out }}$ denotes the change in the output frequency and $\\theta=\\sin ^{-1} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}$. As shown in Fig. 16.17, the step response includes a sinusoidal component with a frequency $\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}$ that decays with a time constant $\\left(\\zeta \\omega_{n}\\right)^{-1}$. This behavior also applies to a phase step input and the observation of the output phase.\n\nThe settling speed of PLLs is crucial in many applications. Equation (16.22) shows that the exponential decay governs how quickly the output reaches its final value, suggesting that $\\zeta \\omega_{n}$ should be maximized. For the type I PLL, (16.17) and (16.18) yield:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\zeta \\omega_{n}=\\frac{1}{2} \\omega_{L P F} \\tag{16.23}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis reveals a trade-off between settling speed and the ripple on the VCO control line: lower $\\omega_{L P F}$ values result in better high-frequency suppression but longer settling times.\n\n#### Example 16.5\n\nA cellular phone uses a $900-\\mathrm{MHz}$ PLL to generate carrier frequencies. Given $\\omega_{L P F}=$ $2 \\pi \\times(20 \\mathrm{kHz})$ and a required output frequency change from 901 MHz to 901.2 MHz, how long does the PLL take to settle within 100 Hz of its final value?\n\n#### Solution\n\nWith a step size of 200 kHz, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left[1-e^{-\\zeta \\omega_{n} t_{s}} \\sin \\left(\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}} t_{s}+\\theta\\right)\\right] \\times 200 \\mathrm{kHz}=200 \\mathrm{kHz}-100 \\mathrm{~Hz} \\tag{16.24}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ne^{-\\zeta \\omega_{n} t_{s}} \\sin \\left(\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}} t_{s}+\\theta\\right)=\\frac{100 \\mathrm{~Hz}}{200 \\mathrm{kHz}} \\tag{16.25}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn the worst case, the sinusoid equals unity, leading to:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ne^{-\\zeta \\omega_{n} t_{s}}=0.0005 \\tag{16.26}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nTherefore:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nt_{s} & =\\frac{7.6}{\\zeta \\omega_{n}}  \\tag{16.27}\\\\\n& =\\frac{15.2}{\\omega_{L P F}}  \\tag{16.28}\\\\\n& =0.12 \\mathrm{~ms} \\tag{16.29}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe choice of $\\zeta$ involves other trade-offs as well. First, (16.18) indicates that as $\\omega_{L P F}$ decreases to minimize control voltage ripple, stability worsens. Second, (16.5) and (16.18) show that both the phase error and $\\zeta$ are inversely proportional to $K_{P D} K_{V C O}$; reducing the phase error decreases stability. In summary, the type I PLL faces trade-offs among settling speed, control voltage ripple, phase error, and stability.\n\nThe stability of PLLs can also be analyzed graphically. The Bode plots of the magnitude and phase of the loop gain, as shown in Fig. 16.19, can be used to determine the phase margin. The loop gain starts at infinity at $\\omega=0$ and decreases at a rate of $20 \\mathrm{~dB} / \\mathrm{dec}$ for $\\omega<\\omega_{L P F}$ and at a rate of $40 \\mathrm{~dB} / \\mathrm{dec}$ thereafter. The phase starts at $-90^{\\circ}$ and asymptotically approaches $-180^{\\circ}$.\n\nIf a higher $K_{P D} K_{V C O}$ is chosen to minimize $\\phi_{o u t}-\\phi_{\\text {in }}$, the gain crossover shifts to the right, degrading the phase margin. This aligns with the dependence of $\\zeta$ on $K_{P D} K_{V C O}$.\n\nAs seen, $K_{P D} K_{V C O}$ influences many critical PLL parameters. This quantity is sometimes called the loop gain due to its similarity to the error equation in a feedback system.\n\nThe stability of type I PLLs can also be analyzed using the root locus plot as the loop gain varies (Fig. 16.20). With $K_{P D} K_{V C O}=0$, the loop is open, $\\zeta=\\infty$, and the poles are at $s_{1}=-\\omega_{L P F}$ and $s_{2}=0$. As $K_{P D} K_{V C O}$ increases, $\\zeta$ decreases, and the poles move towards each other on the real axis. At $\\zeta=1$ (i.e., $K_{P D} K_{V C O}=\\omega_{L P F} / 4$), $s_{1}=s_{2}=-\\zeta \\omega_{n}=-\\omega_{L P F} / 2$. As $K_{P D} K_{V C O}$ increases further, the poles become complex with a real part of $-\\zeta \\omega_{n}=-\\omega_{L P F} / 2$, moving parallel to the $j \\omega$ axis.\n\nThe root locus plot in Fig. 16.20 shows that as $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ move away from the real axis, the system becomes less stable. In fact, the reader can prove that $\\cos \\psi=\\zeta$ (Problem 16.8), concluding that as $\\psi$ approaches $90^{\\circ}, \\zeta$ decreases to zero.\n\nAnother transfer function that reveals the settling behavior of PLLs is that of the error at the output of the phase subtractor in Fig. 16.16. Defined as $H_{e}(s)=\\left(\\phi_{\\text {in }}-\\phi_{\\text {out }}\\right) / \\phi_{i n}$, this function can be obtained by noting that $\\phi_{\\text {out }} / \\phi_{\\text {in }}=H(s)$ and, from (16.13),\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nH_{e}(s) & =1-H(s)  \\tag{16.30}\\\\\n& =\\frac{s^{2}+2 \\zeta \\omega_{n} s}{s^{2}+2 \\zeta \\omega_{n} s+\\omega_{n}} \\tag{16.31}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nAs expected, $H_{e}(s) \\rightarrow 0$ if $s \\rightarrow 0$ because the output tracks the input when the latter changes slowly or the transient has settled.\n\n#### Example 16.6\n\nSuppose a type I PLL experiences a frequency step $\\Delta \\omega$ at $t=0$. Calculate the change in the phase error.\n\n#### Solution\n\nThe Laplace transform of the frequency step equals $\\Delta \\omega / s$. Since $H_{e}(s)$ relates the phase error to the input phase, we write $\\Phi_{i n}(s)=(\\Delta \\omega / s) / s=\\Delta \\omega / s^{2}$. Thus, the Laplace transform of the phase error is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Phi_{e}(s) & =H_{e}(s) \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta \\omega}{s^{2}}  \\tag{16.32}\\\\\n& =\\frac{s^{2}+2 \\zeta \\omega_{n} s}{s^{2}+2 \\zeta \\omega_{n} s+\\omega_{n}^{2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta \\omega}{s^{2}} \\tag{16.33}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nUsing the final value theorem:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\phi_{e}(t=\\infty) & =\\lim _{s \\rightarrow 0} s \\Phi_{e}(s)  \\tag{16.34}\\\\\n&"

    "text": "Building on the qualitative analysis of Phase-Locked Loops (PLLs) from the previous section, we can now delve deeper into their transient behavior. Starting with the assumption that the loop is initially in a locked state, we approach the PLL as a feedback system, acknowledging that the output quantity in our analysis must be the (excess) phase of the Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO), given that the \"error amplifier\" can only compare phases. Our goal is to ascertain the transfer function $\\Phi_{\\text {out }}(s) / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s)$ for both open-loop and closed-loop systems, and then examine the time-domain response. It is important to note that the dimensions shift from phase to voltage through the Phase Detector (PD) and from voltage to phase through the VCO.\n\nThe significance of $\\Phi_{\\text {out }}(s) / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s)$ can be illuminated by an analogy with more familiar transfer functions. A circuit with a transfer function $V_{\\text {out }}(s) / V_{\\text {in }}(s)=1 /\\left(1+s / \\omega_{0}\\right)$ is regarded as a low-pass filter because if $V_{\\text {in }}$ fluctuates rapidly, $V_{\\text {out }}$ cannot fully track the input fluctuations. Similarly, $\\Phi_{\\text {out }}(s) / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s)$ indicates how the output phase follows the input phase when the latter changes slowly or rapidly.\n\nTo visualize the variation of the excess phase over time, refer to the waveforms in Fig. 16.15. The period changes slowly in Fig. 16.15(a) and rapidly in Fig. 16.15(b). Consequently, $y_{2}(t)$ undergoes faster phase variations than $y_{1}(t)$.\n\nFor a more detailed understanding of the waveforms:\n\n- The graph labeled \"(a)\" in Fig. 16.15 is a time-domain waveform depicting the function $y_1(t)$. The horizontal axis represents time, denoted as $t$, and the vertical axis represents the amplitude of the waveform, labeled as $y_1(t)$. The waveform is a periodic square wave, distinguished by a consistent and uniform cycle of high and low states. The period of the waveform is relatively long, indicating a slow variation in phase over time. The waveform maintains a constant amplitude during each high and low state, with sharp transitions between these states, typical of a square wave. There are no annotations or specific markers on the graph, suggesting a focus on the qualitative behavior of the waveform rather than precise quantitative measurements. The general trend shows a steady repetition of the waveform pattern, implying stable phase characteristics over the observed time interval.\n\n- The diagram labeled \\( (b) \\) in the provided image represents a time-domain waveform \\( y_2(t) \\). This is a square wave graph that illustrates the variation of a signal over time.\n\nThe primary components of a linear model of the PLL, assuming a first-order low-pass filter for simplicity, are:\n\n- **Phase Detector (PD):** This block is represented by a subtractor followed by an amplifier with a gain of \\(K_{PD}\\). The subtractor takes the input phase \\(\\Phi_{in}\\) and subtracts the feedback phase \\(\\Phi_{out}\\), producing a phase difference.\n- **Low-Pass Filter (LPF):** This block is characterized by the transfer function \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{s}{\\omega_{LPF}}}\\), where \\(\\omega_{LPF}\\) is the cutoff frequency. It filters the output of the PD to suppress high-frequency noise.\n- **Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO):** The VCO is represented by the transfer function \\(\\frac{K_{VCO}}{s}\\), where \\(K_{VCO}\\) is the gain of the VCO. It converts the filtered phase difference into the output phase \\(\\Phi_{out}\\).\n\nThe flow of information or control in the PLL is as follows:\n\n- The input phase \\(\\Phi_{in}\\) enters the PD, where it is compared with the feedback phase \\(\\Phi_{out}\\). The resulting phase difference is amplified by \\(K_{PD}\\).\n- The amplified signal is then passed through the LPF to remove high-frequency components, resulting in a smoothed control signal.\n- This smoothed signal controls the VCO, which adjusts its output phase \\(\\Phi_{out}\\) accordingly.\n- The output phase \\(\\Phi_{out}\\) is fed back to the PD, completing the feedback loop.\n\nThe labels, annotations, and key indicators in the PLL model include:\n\n- \\(\\Phi_{in}\\) and \\(\\Phi_{out}\\) are labeled as the input and output phases, respectively.\n- \\(K_{PD}\\) and \\(K_{VCO}\\) are the gains for the phase detector and VCO.\n- The LPF is defined by its cutoff frequency \\(\\omega_{LPF}\\).\n\nThe overall system function of this Type I PLL is to lock the output phase \\(\\Phi_{out}\\) to the input phase \\(\\Phi_{in}\\) by continuously adjusting the VCO based on the phase difference detected by the PD. The LPF ensures stability by filtering out high-frequency noise, allowing the VCO to produce a stable and accurate output phase.\n\nThe system block diagram represents a linear model of a Type I Phase-Locked Loop (PLL). The key components of this PLL model include a phase detector (PD), a low-pass filter (LPF), and a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). The PD output contains a dc component equal to $K_{PD}\\left(\\phi_{out}-\\phi_{in}\\right)$ as well as high-frequency components. Since the latter are suppressed by the LPF, we simply model the PD by a subtractor whose output is \"amplified\" by $K_{PD}$. Illustrated in Fig. 16.16, the overall PLL model consists of the phase subtractor, the LPF transfer function $1 /\\left(1+s / \\omega_{LPF}\\right)$, where $\\omega_{LPF}$ denotes the $-3-\\mathrm{dB}$ bandwidth, and the VCO transfer function $K_{VCO} / s$ (Chapter 15). Here, $\\Phi_{in}$ and $\\Phi_{out}$ denote the excess phases of the input and output waveforms, respectively. For example, if the total input phase experiences a step change, $\\phi_{1} u(t)$, then $\\Phi_{in}(s)=\\phi_{1} / s$.\n\nThe open-loop transfer function is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {open }} & =\\left.\\frac{\\Phi_{\\text {out }}}{\\Phi_{\\text {in }}}(s)\\right|_{\\text {open }}  \\tag{16.11}\\\\\n& =K_{PD} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{s}{\\omega_{LPF}}} \\cdot \\frac{K_{VCO}}{s} \\tag{16.12}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nrevealing one pole at $s=-\\omega_{LPF}$ and another at $s=0$. Note that the loop gain is equal to $\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {open }}$ because of the unity feedback factor. Since the loop gain contains a pole at the origin, the system is called \"type I.\"\n\nBefore computing the closed-loop transfer function, let us make an important observation. What is the loop gain if $s$ is very small, i.e., if the input excess phase varies very slowly? Owing to the pole at the origin, the loop gain goes to infinity as $s$ approaches zero, a point of contrast to the feedback circuits studied in Chapters 8 and 10. Thus, the phase-locked loop (under closed-loop, locked condition) ensures that the change in $\\phi_{out}$ is exactly equal to the change in $\\phi_{in}$ as $s$ goes to zero. This result predicts two interesting properties of PLLs. First, if the input excess phase varies very slowly, the output excess phase \"tracks\" it. (After all, $\\phi_{out}$ is \"locked\" to $\\phi_{in}$.) Second, if the transients in $\\phi_{in}$ have decayed (another case corresponding to $s \\rightarrow 0$ ), then the change in $\\phi_{out}$ is precisely equal to the change in $\\phi_{in}$. This is indeed true in the example depicted in Fig. 16.11.\n\nFrom (16.12), we can write the closed-loop transfer function as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {closed }}=\\frac{K_{PD} K_{VCO}}{\\frac{s^{2}}{\\omega_{LPF}}+s+K_{PD} K_{VCO}} \\tag{16.13}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor the sake of brevity, we hereafter denote $\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {closed }}$ simply by $H(s)$ or $\\Phi_{\\text {out }} / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}$. As expected, if $s \\rightarrow 0, H(s) \\rightarrow 1$ because of the infinite loop gain.\n\nIn order to analyze $H(s)$ further, we derive a relationship that allows a more intuitive understanding of the system. Recall from Chapter 15 that the instantaneous frequency of a waveform is equal to the time derivative of the phase: $\\omega=d \\phi / d t$. Since the frequency and the phase are related by a linear operator, the transfer function of (16.13) applies to variations in the input and output frequencies as well:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\omega_{\\text {out }}}{\\omega_{\\text {in }}}(s)=\\frac{K_{PD} K_{VCO}}{\\frac{s^{2}}{\\omega_{LPF}}+s+K_{PD} K_{VCO}} \\tag{16.14}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor example, this result predicts that if $\\omega_{in}$ changes very slowly $(s \\rightarrow 0)$, then $\\omega_{out}$ tracks $\\omega_{in}$, again an expected result because the loop is assumed locked. Equation (16.14) also indicates that if $\\omega_{in}$ changes abruptly, but the system is given enough time to settle ( $s \\rightarrow 0$ ), then the change in $\\omega_{out}$ equals that in $\\omega_{in}$ (as illustrated in the example of Fig. 16.12).\n\nThe above observation aids the analysis in two directions. First, some transient responses of the closed-loop system may be simpler to visualize in terms of changes in the frequency quantities rather than the phase quantities. Second, since a change in $\\omega_{out}$ must be accompanied by a change in $V_{\\text {cont }}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nH(s)=K_{VCO} \\cdot \\frac{V_{\\text {cont }}}{\\omega_{\\text {in }}}(s) \\tag{16.15}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThat is, monitoring the response of $V_{\\text {cont }}$ to variations in $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$ indeed yields the response of the closed-loop system.\n\nThe second-order transfer function of (16.13) suggests that the step response of the type I system can be overdamped, critically damped, or underdamped. To derive the condition for each case, we rewrite the denominator in a familiar form used in control theory, $s^{2}+2 \\zeta \\omega_{n} s+\\omega_{n}^{2}$, where $\\zeta$ is the \"damping factor\" and $\\omega_{n}$ is the \"natural frequency.\" That is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nH(s)=\\frac{\\omega_{n}^{2}}{s^{2}+2 \\zeta \\omega_{n} s+\\omega_{n}^{2}} \\tag{16.16}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}\n\\omega_{n}=\\sqrt{\\omega_{LPF} K_{PD} K_{VCO}} \\\\\n\\zeta=\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega_{LPF}}{K_{PD} K_{VCO}}} \\tag{16.18}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe two poles of the closed-loop system are given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ns_{1,2} & =-\\zeta \\omega_{n} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\zeta^{2}-1\\right) \\omega_{n}^{2}}  \\tag{16.19}\\\\\n& =\\left(-\\zeta \\pm \\sqrt{\\left.\\zeta^{2}-1\\right)} \\omega_{n}\\right. \\tag{16.20}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThus, if $\\zeta>1$, both poles are real, the system is overdamped, and the transient response contains two exponentials with time constants $1 / s_{1}$ and $1 / s_{2}$. On the other hand, if $\\zeta<1$, the poles are complex and the response to an input frequency step $\\omega_{in}=\\Delta \\omega u(t)$ is equal to\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\omega_{\\text {out }}(t) & =\\left\\{1-e^{-\\zeta \\omega_{n} t}\\left[\\cos \\left(\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}} t\\right)+\\frac{\\zeta}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}} \\sin \\left(\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}} t\\right)\\right]\\right\\} \\Delta \\omega u(t)  \\tag{16.21}\\\\\n& =\\left[1-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}} e^{-\\zeta \\omega_{n} t} \\sin \\left(\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}} t+\\theta\\right)\\right] \\Delta \\omega u(t) \\tag{16.22}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\omega_{\\text {out }}$ denotes the change in the output frequency and $\\theta=\\sin ^{-1} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}$. Thus, as shown in Fig. 16.17, the step response contains a sinusoidal component with a frequency $\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}$ that decays with a time constant $\\left(\\zeta \\omega_{n}\\right)^{-1}$. Note that the system exhibits the same response if a phase step is applied to the input and the output phase is observed.\n\nThe settling speed of PLLs is of great concern in most applications. Equation (16.22) indicates that the exponential decay determines how fast the output approaches its final value, implying that $\\zeta \\omega_{n}$ must be maximized. For the type I PLL under study here, (16.17) and (16.18) yield\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\zeta \\omega_{n}=\\frac{1}{2} \\omega_{LPF} \\tag{16.23}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis result reveals a critical trade-off between the settling speed and the ripple on the VCO control line: the lower the $\\omega_{LPF}$, the greater the suppression of the high-frequency components produced by the PD, but the longer the settling time constant.\n\nExample 16.5\n\nA cellular telephone incorporates a $900-\\mathrm{MHz}$ phase-locked loop to generate the carrier frequencies. If $\\omega_{LPF}=$ $2 \\pi \\times(20 \\mathrm{kHz})$ and the output frequency is to be changed from 901 MHz to 901.2 MHz , how long does the PLL output frequency take to settle within 100 Hz of its final value?\n\nSolution\n\nSince the step size is 200 kHz , we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left[1-e^{-\\zeta \\omega_{n} t_{s}} \\sin \\left(\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}} t_{s}+\\theta\\right)\\right] \\times 200 \\mathrm{kHz}=200 \\mathrm{kHz}-100 \\mathrm{~Hz} \\tag{16.24}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ne^{-\\zeta \\omega_{n} t_{s}} \\sin \\left(\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}} t_{s}+\\theta\\right)=\\frac{100 \\mathrm{~Hz}}{200 \\mathrm{kHz}} \\tag{16.25}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn the worst case, the sinusoid is equal to unity and\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ne^{-\\zeta \\omega_{n} t_{s}}=0.0005 \\tag{16.26}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThat is\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nt_{s} & =\\frac{7.6}{\\zeta \\omega_{n}}  \\tag{16.27}\\\\\n& =\\frac{15.2}{\\omega_{LPF}}  \\tag{16.28}\\\\\n& =0.12 \\mathrm{~ms} \\tag{16.29}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIn addition to the product $\\zeta \\omega_{n}$, the value of $\\zeta$ itself is also important. Illustrated in Fig. 16.18 for several values of $\\zeta$ and a constant $\\omega_{n}$, the step response exhibits severe ringing for $\\zeta<0.5$. In view of process and temperature variation of the loop parameters, $\\zeta$ is usually chosen to be greater than $\\sqrt{2} / 2$ or even 1 to avoid excessive ringing. ${ }^{4}$\n\nThis result reveals a critical trade-off between the settling speed and the ripple on the VCO control line: the lower the $\\omega_{LPF}$, the greater the suppression of the high-frequency components produced by the PD, but the longer the settling time constant.\n\nThe choice of $\\zeta$ entails other trade-offs as well. First, (16.18) implies that as $\\omega_{LPF}$ is reduced to minimize the ripple on the control voltage, the stability degrades. Second, (16.5) and (16.18) indicate that both the phase error and $\\zeta$ are inversely proportional to $K_{PD} K_{VCO}$; lowering the phase error inevitably makes the system less stable.

The PD output includes a dc component equal to $K_{P D}\\left(\\phi_{\\text {out }}-\\phi_{i n}\\right)$ and high-frequency components. Since the high frequencies are filtered out by the LPF, we model the PD as a subtractor with its output amplified by $K_{P D}$. The overall PLL model, shown in Fig. 16.16, consists of the phase subtractor, the LPF transfer function $1 /\\left(1+s / \\omega_{L P F}\\right)$, where $\\omega_{L P F}$ is the $-3-\\mathrm{dB}$ bandwidth, and the VCO transfer function $K_{V C O} / s$ (Chapter 15).

    "text": "In the prior section, we conducted a qualitative analysis of Phase-Locked Loops (PLLs) and can now delve into their transient behavior with greater rigor. Starting with the assumption of an initially locked loop, we analyze the PLL as a feedback system, recognizing that the output quantity in this analysis is the phase of the Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO), as the \"error amplifier\" can only compare phases. Our goal is to determine the transfer function \\(\\frac{\\Phi_{\\text {out }}(s)}{\\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s)}\\) for both open-loop and closed-loop systems, and then study the time-domain response. It's important to note that the dimensions change from phase to voltage through the Phase Detector (PD) and from voltage to phase through the VCO.\n\nThe transfer function \\(\\frac{\\Phi_{\\text {out }}(s)}{\\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s)}\\) represents how the output phase tracks the input phase when it changes slowly or rapidly. To visualize the variation of the excess phase with time, consider the waveforms in Figure 16.15. The period varies slowly in Figure 16.15(a) and rapidly in Figure 16.15(b). Thus, \\(y_{2}(t)\\) experiences faster phase variations than \\(y_{1}(t)\\).\n\nLet's construct a linear model of the PLL, assuming a first-order low-pass filter for simplicity. The PD output contains a dc component equal to \\(K_{PD}(\\phi_{\\text {out }}-\\phi_{\\text {in }})\\) as well as high-frequency components. Since the latter are suppressed by the LPF, we simply model the PD by a subtractor whose output is \"amplified\" by \\(K_{PD}\\). Illustrated in Figure 16.16, the overall PLL model consists of the phase subtractor, the LPF transfer function \\(\\frac{1}{1+\\frac{s}{\\omega_{LPF}}}\\), where \\(\\omega_{LPF}\\) denotes the \\(-3\\text{dB}\\) bandwidth, and the VCO transfer function \\(\\frac{K_{VCO}}{s}\\).\n\nFor example, if the total input phase experiences a step change, \\(\\phi_{1} u(t)\\), then \\(\\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s)=\\frac{\\phi_{1}}{s}\\).\n\nThe open-loop transfer function is given by\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {open }} & =\\left.\\frac{\\Phi_{\\text {out }}}{\\Phi_{\\text {in }}}(s)\\right|_{\\text {open }} \\\\\n& =K_{PD} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{s}{\\omega_{LPF}}} \\cdot \\frac{K_{VCO}}{s}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nrevealing one pole at \\(s=-\\omega_{LPF}\\) and another at \\(s=0\\). Note that the loop gain is equal to \\(\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {open }}\\) because of the unity feedback factor. Since the loop gain contains a pole at the origin, the system is called \"type I.\"\n\nBefore computing the closed-loop transfer function, let us make an important observation. What is the loop gain if \\(s\\) is very small, i.e., if the input excess phase varies very slowly? Owing to the pole at the origin, the loop gain goes to infinity as \\(s\\) approaches zero, a point of contrast to the feedback circuits studied in Chapters 8 and 10. Thus, the phase-locked loop (under closed-loop, locked condition) ensures that the change in \\(\\phi_{\\text {out }}\\) is exactly equal to the change in \\(\\phi_{\\text {in }}\\) as \\(s\\) goes to zero. This result predicts two interesting properties of PLLs. First, if the input excess phase varies very slowly, the output excess phase \"tracks\" it. Second, if the transients in \\(\\phi_{\\text {in }}\\) have decayed (another case corresponding to \\(s \\rightarrow 0\\)), then the change in \\(\\phi_{\\text {out }}\\) is precisely equal to the change in \\(\\phi_{\\text {in }}\\).\n\nFrom the open-loop transfer function, we can write the closed-loop transfer function as\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {closed }}=\\frac{K_{PD} K_{VCO}}{\\frac{s^{2}}{\\omega_{LPF}}+s+K_{PD} K_{VCO}}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\n\nFor the sake of brevity, we hereafter denote \\(\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {closed }}\\) simply by \\(H(s)\\) or \\(\\frac{\\Phi_{\\text {out }}}{\\Phi_{\\text {in }}}\\). As expected, if \\(s \\rightarrow 0\\), \\(H(s) \\rightarrow 1\\) because of the infinite loop gain.\n\nIn order to analyze \\(H(s)\\) further, we derive a relationship that allows a more intuitive understanding of the system. Recall that the instantaneous frequency of a waveform is equal to the time derivative of the phase: \\(\\omega=\\frac{d \\phi}{dt}\\). Since the frequency and the phase are related by a linear operator, the transfer function of \\(H(s)\\) applies to variations in the input and output frequencies as well:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\omega_{\\text {out }}}{\\omega_{\\text {in }}}(s)=\\frac{K_{PD} K_{VCO}}{\\frac{s^{2}}{\\omega_{LPF}}+s+K_{PD} K_{VCO}}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\n\nFor example, this result predicts that if \\(\\omega_{\\text {in }}\\) changes very slowly (\\(s \\rightarrow 0\\)), then \\(\\omega_{\\text {out }}\\) tracks \\(\\omega_{\\text {in }}\\). Equation (16.14) also indicates that if \\(\\omega_{\\text {in }}\\) changes abruptly, but the system is given enough time to settle (\\(s \\rightarrow 0\\)), then the change in \\(\\omega_{\\text {out }}\\) equals that in \\(\\omega_{\\text {in }}\\).\n\nThe above observation aids the analysis in two directions. First, some transient responses of the closed-loop system may be simpler to visualize in terms of changes in the frequency quantities rather than the phase quantities. Second, since a change in \\(\\omega_{\\text {out }}\\) must be accompanied by a change in \\(V_{\\text {cont }}\\), we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\nH(s)=K_{VCO} \\cdot \\frac{V_{\\text {cont }}}{\\omega_{\\text {in }}}(s)\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\n\nThat is, monitoring the response of \\(V_{\\text {cont }}\\) to variations in \\(\\omega_{\\text {in }}\\) indeed yields the response of the closed-loop system.\n\nThe second-order transfer function of \\(H(s)\\) suggests that the step response of the type I system can be overdamped, critically damped, or underdamped. To derive the condition for each case, we rewrite the denominator in a familiar form used in control theory, \\(s^{2}+2 \\zeta \\omega_{n} s+\\omega_{n}^{2}\\), where \\(\\zeta\\) is the \"damping factor\" and \\(\\omega_{n}\\) is the \"natural frequency.\" That is\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\nH(s)=\\frac{\\omega_{n}^{2}}{s^{2}+2 \\zeta \\omega_{n} s+\\omega_{n}^{2}}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r}\n\\omega_{n}=\\sqrt{\\omega_{LPF} K_{PD} K_{VCO}} \\\\\n\\zeta=\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega_{LPF}}{K_{PD} K_{VCO}}}\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe two poles of the closed-loop system are given by\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ns_{1,2} & =-\\zeta \\omega_{n} \\pm \\sqrt{(\\zeta^{2}-1) \\omega_{n}^{2}} \\\\\n& =\\left(-\\zeta \\pm \\sqrt{(\\zeta^{2}-1)} \\omega_{n}\\right)\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThus, if \\(\\zeta>1\\), both poles are real, the system is overdamped, and the transient response contains two exponentials with time constants \\(1 / s_{1}\\) and \\(1 / s_{2}\\). On the other hand, if \\(\\zeta<1\\), the poles are complex and the response to an input frequency step \\(\\omega_{\\text {in }}=\\Delta \\omega u(t)\\) is equal to\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\omega_{\\text {out }}(t) & =\\left\\{1-e^{-\\zeta \\omega_{n} t}\\left[\\cos (\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}} t)+\\frac{\\zeta}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}} \\sin (\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}} t)\\right]\\right\\} \\Delta \\omega u(t) \\\\\n& =\\left[1-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}} e^{-\\zeta \\omega_{n} t} \\sin (\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}} t+\\theta)\\right] \\Delta \\omega u(t)\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\omega_{\\text {out }}\\) denotes the change in the output frequency and \\(\\theta=\\sin ^{-1} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}\\). Thus, as shown in Figure 16.17, the step response contains a sinusoidal component with a frequency \\(\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}\\) that decays with a time constant \\((\\zeta \\omega_{n})^{-1}\\). Note that the system exhibits the same response if a phase step is applied to the input and the output phase is observed.\n\nThe settling speed of PLLs is of great concern in most applications. Equation (16.22) indicates that the exponential decay determines how fast the output approaches its final value, implying that \\(\\zeta \\omega_{n}\\) must be maximized. For the type I PLL under study here, (16.17) and (16.18) yield\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\zeta \\omega_{n}=\\frac{1}{2} \\omega_{LPF}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\n\nThis result reveals a critical trade-off between the settling speed and the ripple on the VCO control line: the lower the \\(\\omega_{LPF}\\), the greater the suppression of the high-frequency components produced by the PD, but the longer the settling time constant.\n\n#### Example 16.5\n\nA cellular telephone incorporates a \\(900\\text{MHz}\\) phase-locked loop to generate the carrier frequencies. If \\(\\omega_{LPF}=2 \\pi \\times(20 \\text{kHz})\\) and the output frequency is to be changed from 901 MHz to 901.2 MHz, how long does the PLL output frequency take to settle within 100 Hz of its final value?\n\n#### Solution\n\nSince the step size is 200 kHz, we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left[1-e^{-\\zeta \\omega_{n} t_{s}} \\sin (\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}} t_{s}+\\theta)\\right] \\times 200 \\text{kHz}=200 \\text{kHz}-100 \\text{~Hz}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\ne^{-\\zeta \\omega_{n} t_{s}} \\sin (\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}} t_{s}+\\theta)=\\frac{100 \\text{~Hz}}{200 \\text{kHz}}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\n\nIn the worst case, the sinusoid is equal to unity and\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\ne^{-\\zeta \\omega_{n} t_{s}}=0.0005\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\n\nThat is\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nt_{s} & =\\frac{7.6}{\\zeta \\omega_{n}} \\\\\n& =\\frac{15.2}{\\omega_{LPF}} \\\\\n& =0.12 \\text{~ms}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nIn addition to the product \\(\\zeta \\omega_{n}\\), the value of \\(\\zeta\\) itself is also important. Illustrated in Figure 16.18 for several values of \\(\\zeta\\) and a constant \\(\\omega_{n}\\), the step response exhibits severe ringing for \\(\\zeta<0.5\\). In view of process and temperature variation of the loop parameters, \\(\\zeta\\) is usually chosen to be greater than \\(\\sqrt{2} / 2\\) or even 1 to avoid excessive ringing.\n\nThe choice of \\(\\zeta\\) entails other trade-offs as well. First, (16.18) implies that as \\(\\omega_{LPF}\\) is reduced to minimize the ripple on the control voltage, the stability degrades. Second, (16.5) and (16.18) indicate that both the phase error and \\(\\zeta\\) are inversely proportional to \\(K_{PD} K_{VCO}\\); lowering the phase error inevitably makes the system less stable. In summary, the type I PLL suffers from trade-offs among the settling speed, the ripple on the control voltage (i.e., the quality of the output signal), the phase error, and the stability.\n\nThe stability behavior of PLLs can also be analyzed graphically, providing more insight. Recall from Chapter 10 that the Bode plots of the magnitude and phase of the loop gain readily yield the phase margin. Let us utilize (16.12) to construct such plots. As shown in Figure 16.19, the loop gain begins from infinity at \\(\\omega=0\\) and falls at a rate of \\(20 \\text{~dB} / \\text{dec}\\) for \\(\\omega<\\omega_{LPF}\\) and at a rate of \\(40 \\text{~dB} / \\text{dec}\\) thereafter. The phase begins at \\(-90^{\\circ}\\) and asymptotically reaches \\(-180^{\\circ}\\).\n\nWhat happens if a higher \\(K_{PD} K_{VCO}\\) is chosen so as to minimize \\(\\phi_{out}-\\phi_{\\text {in }}\\)? Since the entire gain plot in Figure 16.19 is shifted up, the gain crossover moves to the right, thus degrading the phase margin. This is consistent with the dependence of \\(\\zeta\\) upon \\(K_{PD} K_{VCO}\\).\n\nAs observed thus far, \\(K_{PD} K_{VCO}\\) affects many important parameters of PLLs. This quantity is sometimes called the loop gain (even though it is not dimensionless) because of the resemblance of \\(\\Delta \\phi=\\left(\\omega_{\\text {out }}-\\omega_{0}\\right) / \\left(K_{PD} K_{VCO}\\right)\\) to the error equation in a feedback system.\n\nThe stability behavior of type I PLLs can also be analyzed by the locus of their poles in the complex plane as the parameter \\(K_{PD} K_{VCO}\\) varies (Figure 16.20). With \\(K_{PD} K_{VCO}=0\\), the loop is open, \\(\\zeta=\\infty\\), and the two poles are given by \\(s_{1}=-\\omega_{LPF}\\) and \\(s_{2}=0\\). As \\(K_{PD} K_{VCO}\\) increases (i.e., the feedback becomes stronger), \\(\\zeta\\) drops and the two poles, given by \\(s_{1,2}=\\left(-\\zeta \\pm \\sqrt{\\zeta^{2}-1}\\right) \\omega_{n}\\), move toward each other on the real axis. For \\(\\zeta=1\\) (i.e., \\(\\left.K_{PD} K_{VCO}=\\omega_{LPF} / 4\\right)\\), \\(s_{1}=s_{2}=-\\zeta \\omega_{n}=-\\omega_{LPF} / 2\\). As \\(K_{PD} K_{VCO}\\) increases further, the two poles become complex, with a real part equal to \\(-\\zeta \\omega_{n}=-\\omega_{LPF} / 2\\), moving in parallel with the \\(j \\omega\\) axis.\n\nWe recognize from Figure 16.20 that, as \\(s_{1}\\) and \\(s_{2}\\) move away from the real axis, the system becomes less stable. In fact, the reader can prove that \\(\\cos \\psi=\\zeta\\) (Problem 16.8), concluding that as \\(\\psi\\) approaches \\(90^{\\circ}\\), \\(\\zeta\\) drops to zero.\n\nAnother transfer function that reveals the settling behavior of PLLs is that of the error at the output of the phase subtractor in Figure 16.16. Defined as \\(H_{e}(s)=\\left(\\phi_{\\text {in }}-\\phi_{\\text {out }}\\right) / \\phi_{\\text {in }}\\), this transfer function can be obtained by noting that \\(\\phi_{\\text {out }} / \\phi_{\\text {in }}=H(s)\\) and, from (16.13),\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nH_{e}(s) & =1-H(s) \\\\\n& =\\frac{s^{2}+2 \\zeta \\omega_{n} s}{s^{2}+2 \\zeta \\omega_{n} s+\\omega_{n}^{2}}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nAs expected, \\(H_{e}(s) \\rightarrow 0\\) if \\(s \\rightarrow 0\\) because the output tracks the input when the input varies very slowly or the transient has settled.\n\n#### Example 16.6\n\nSuppose a type I PLL experiences a frequency step \\(\\Delta \\omega\\) at \\(t=0\\). Calculate the change in the phase error.\n\n#### Solution\n\nThe Laplace transform of the frequency step equals \\(\\frac{\\Delta \\omega}{s}\\). Since \\(H_{e}(s)\\"

    "text": "Building upon the qualitative examination of Phase-Locked Loops (PLLs) in the preceding section, we can now delve into a more meticulous analysis of their transient behavior. Given that the loop is initially in a locked state, we approach the PLL as a feedback system, acknowledging that the output quantity of interest in this analysis is the (excess) phase of the Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO), since the \"error amplifier\" is limited to phase comparison. Our aim is to establish the transfer function $\\Phi_{\\text {out }}(s) / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s)$ for both open-loop and closed-loop configurations, and then to examine the response in the time domain. It's important to note the conversion of dimensions from phase to voltage via the Phase Detector (PD) and from voltage back to phase through the VCO.\n\nThe meaning of $\\Phi_{\\text {out }}(s) / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s)$ can be elucidated through an analogy with more familiar transfer functions. A circuit with a transfer function $V_{\\text {out }}(s) / V_{\\text {in }}(s)=1 /\\left(1+s / \\omega_{0}\\right)$ acts as a low-pass filter because $V_{\\text {out }}$ cannot fully track rapid variations in $V_{\\text {in }}$. Similarly, $\\Phi_{\\text {out }}(s) / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s)$ indicates how well the output phase tracks the input phase when the latter undergoes slow or rapid changes.\n\nTo conceptualize the excess phase's temporal variation, refer to the waveforms in Fig. 16.15. The period changes slowly in Fig. 16.15(a) and rapidly in Fig. 16.15(b), suggesting that $y_{2}(t)$ undergoes faster phase changes than $y_{1}(t)$.\n\nWe proceed to construct a linear model of the PLL, simplifying with a first-order low-pass filter. The PD output includes a direct current (dc) component proportional to $K_{P D}\\left(\\phi_{\\text {out }}-\\phi_{i n}\\right)$ alongside high-frequency components that are filtered out by the LPF. We model the PD as a subtractor with its output amplified by $K_{P D}$. As shown in Fig. 16.16, the overall PLL model consists of the phase subtractor, the LPF with the transfer function $1 /\\left(1+s / \\omega_{L P F}\\right)$, where $\\omega_{L P F}$ denotes the $-3-\\mathrm{dB}$ bandwidth, and the VCO with the transfer function $K_{V C O} / s$. Here, $\\Phi_{\\text {in }}$ and $\\Phi_{\\text {out }}$ represent the excess phases of the input and output waveforms, respectively.\n\nThe open-loop transfer function is expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {open }} & =\\left.\\frac{\\Phi_{\\text {out }}}{\\Phi_{\\text {in }}}(s)\\right|_{\\text {open }}  \\tag{16.11}\\\\\n& =K_{P D} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{s}{\\omega_{L P F}}} \\cdot \\frac{K_{V C O}}{s} \\tag{16.12}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis reveals a pole at $s=-\\omega_{L P F}$ and another at $s=0$. The loop gain is equivalent to $\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {open }}$ due to the unity feedback factor. The presence of a pole at the origin classifies the system as \"type I.\"\n\nWe observe that if the input excess phase varies slowly, the loop gain tends to infinity as $s$ approaches zero, contrasting with feedback circuits studied earlier. This ensures that under closed-loop conditions, the change in $\\phi_{\\text {out }}$ exactly matches the change in $\\phi_{\\text {in }}$ as $s$ goes to zero. This implies two key PLL properties: first, slow input phase variations are tracked by the output phase, and second, after transients have decayed, the change in $\\phi_{\\text {out }}$ precisely equals the change in $\\phi_{i n}$.\n\nThe closed-loop transfer function is derived as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {closed }}=\\frac{K_{P D} K_{V C O}}{\\frac{s^{2}}{\\omega_{L P F}}+s+K_{P D} K_{V C O}} \\tag{16.13}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor convenience, we denote $\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {closed }}$ as $H(s)$ or $\\Phi_{\\text {out }} / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}$. As expected, as $s \\rightarrow 0$, $H(s) \\rightarrow 1$ due to the infinite loop gain.\n\nTo gain a more intuitive understanding, we relate the transfer function to frequency variations. The instantaneous frequency is the derivative of the phase, and thus the transfer function applies to input and output frequency variations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\omega_{\\text {out }}}{\\omega_{\\text {in }}}(s)=\\frac{K_{P D} K_{V C O}}{\\frac{s^{2}}{\\omega_{L P F}}+s+K_{P D} K_{V C O}} \\tag{16.14}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis indicates that if $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$ changes slowly, $\\omega_{\\text {out }}$ tracks $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$, consistent with the loop being locked. It also suggests that if $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$ changes abruptly but the system is allowed to settle, the change in $\\omega_{\\text {out }}$ equals that in $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$.\n\nWe further analyze $H(s)$ by relating it to the control voltage $V_{\\text {cont }}$ response to $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$ variations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nH(s)=K_{V C O} \\cdot \\frac{V_{\\text {cont }}}{\\omega_{\\text {in }}}(s) \\tag{16.15}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe second-order transfer function of (16.13) suggests that the step response of the type I system can be overdamped, critically damped, or underdamped. We rewrite the denominator to include the damping factor $\\zeta$ and the natural frequency $\\omega_{n}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nH(s)=\\frac{\\omega_{n}^{2}}{s^{2}+2 \\zeta \\omega_{n} s+\\omega_{n}^{2}} \\tag{16.16}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}\n\\omega_{n}=\\sqrt{\\omega_{L P F} K_{P D} K_{V C O}} \\\\\n\\zeta=\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega_{L P F}}{K_{P D} K_{V C O}}} \\tag{16.18}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe closed-loop system's poles are given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ns_{1,2} & =-\\zeta \\omega_{n} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\zeta^{2}-1\\right) \\omega_{n}^{2}}  \\tag{16.19}\\\\\n& =\\left(-\\zeta \\pm \\sqrt{\\left.\\zeta^{2}-1\\right)} \\omega_{n}\\right. \\tag{16.20}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIf $\\zeta>1$, the system is overdamped, and the transient response includes two exponentials with time constants $1 / s_{1}$ and $1 / s_{2}$. If $\\zeta<1$, the poles are complex, and the response to an input frequency step $\\omega_{i n}=\\Delta \\omega u(t)$ is\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\omega_{\\text {out }}(t) & =\\left\\{1-e^{-\\zeta \\omega_{n} t}\\left[\\cos \\left(\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}} t\\right)+\\frac{\\zeta}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}} \\sin \\left(\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}} t\\right)\\right]\\right\\} \\Delta \\omega u(t)  \\tag{16.21}\\\\\n& =\\left[1-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}} e^{-\\zeta \\omega_{n} t} \\sin \\left(\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}} t+\\theta\\right)\\right] \\Delta \\omega u(t) \\tag{16.22}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe exponential decay determines how quickly the output reaches its final value, implying that $\\zeta \\omega_{n}$ should be maximized. For the type I PLL, $\\zeta \\omega_{n}$ is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\zeta \\omega_{n}=\\frac{1}{2} \\omega_{L P F} \\tag{16.23}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis reveals a trade-off between settling speed and the ripple on the VCO control line: a lower $\\omega_{L P F}$ reduces high-frequency PD components but lengthens the settling time constant.\n\nIn practice, the choice of $\\zeta$ involves trade-offs. Reducing $\\omega_{L P F}$ to minimize control voltage ripple degrades stability. Additionally, lowering the phase error by increasing $K_{P D} K_{V C O}$ also reduces stability. Thus, type I PLLs balance settling speed, control voltage ripple, phase error, and stability.\n\nStability can also be analyzed graphically using Bode plots of the loop gain's magnitude and phase, as shown in Fig. 16.19. The loop gain starts at infinity at $\\omega=0$ and decreases at a rate of $20 \\mathrm{~dB} / \\mathrm{dec}$ for $\\omega<\\omega_{L P F}$ and $40 \\mathrm{~dB} / \\mathrm{dec}$ thereafter. The phase begins at $-90^{\\circ}$ and asymptotically reaches $-180^{\\circ}$.\n\nIf a higher $K_{P D} K_{V C O}$ is chosen to minimize $\\phi_{o u t}-\\phi_{\\text {in }}$, the gain crossover shifts to the right, degrading the phase margin, which is consistent with $\\zeta$'s dependence on $K_{P D} K_{V C O}$.\n\nThe stability behavior can be further analyzed using the root locus plot in Fig. 16.20, which shows how the poles move in the complex plane as $K_{P D} K_{V C O}$ varies. With $K_{P D} K_{V C O}=0$, the loop is open, $\\zeta=\\infty$, and the poles are at $s_{1}=-\\omega_{L P F}$ and $s_{2}=0$. As $K_{P D} K_{V C O}$ increases, the poles move towards each other on the real axis. At $\\zeta=1$, they coincide at $s_{1}=s_{2}=-\\omega_{L P F} / 2$. Further increasing $K_{P D} K_{V C O}$ results in complex poles with a real part of $-\\omega_{L P F} / 2$, moving in parallel with the $j \\omega$ axis.\n\nThe movement of poles away from the real axis indicates decreasing stability. As $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ move further from the real axis, the system becomes less stable. The reader can prove that $\\cos \\psi=\\zeta$, concluding that as $\\psi$ approaches $90^{\\circ}, \\zeta$ drops to zero.\n\nAnother transfer function that reveals the settling behavior is that of the error at the output of the phase subtractor, defined as $H_{e}(s)=\\left(\\phi_{\\text {in }}-\\phi_{\\text {out }}\\right) / \\phi_{i n}$.

Building upon this foundation, we are now better equipped to delve into their transient response in a more thorough manner. We assume that the loop is initially synchronized, approaching the PLL as a feedback mechanism. However, it is important to note that in this analysis, we must consider the VCO's phase as the output variable, since the error amplifier is capable only of phase comparison. Our goal is to ascertain the transfer function \\(\\Phi_{\\text {out }}(s) / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s)\\) for both open-loop and closed-loop configurations, and then proceed to analyze the system's response within the time domain. It is worth mentioning that the units of the phase change are transitioned to voltage via the phase detector and back to phase through the VCO.\n\nTo clarify the significance of \\(\\Phi_{\\text {out }}(s) / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s)\\), drawing an analogy to more well-known transfer functions is beneficial. A circuit with the transfer function \\(V_{\\text {out }}(s) / V_{\\text {in }}(s)=1 /\\left(1+s / \\omega_{0}\\right)\\) is classified as a low-pass filter, as rapid changes in \\(V_{\\text {in }}\\) prevent \\(V_{\\text {out }}\\) from fully mirroring the input variations. In a similar vein, \\(\\Phi_{\\text {out }}(s) / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s)\\) illustrates the manner in which the output phase follows the input phase as the latter changes at either a slow or fast pace.\n\nTo observe the evolution of the excess phase over time, refer to the waveforms depicted in Figure 16.15. The period changes slowly in Figure 16.15(a) and rapidly in Figure 16.15(b). Consequently, \\(y_{2}(t)\\) experiences more rapid phase shifts compared to \\(y_{1}(t)\\).\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:The graph labeled \"(a)\" in Figure 16.15 is a time-domain waveform that represents the function \\(y_1(t)\\).

Ensure that the rephrased version retains the original meaning and extent.\n---[Context Provided]---\nThe previous section delved into the qualitative aspects of Phase-Locked Loops (PLLs). Building on this foundation, we can now delve deeper into their transient response. Suppose the loop is in a locked state to begin with. In this scenario, we analyze the PLL as a feedback system. However, it's crucial to recognize that the focus of our analysis will be on the (excess) phase of the Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO), as the error amplifier is capable of comparing phases only. Our aim is to establish the transfer function $\\Phi_{\\text {out }}(s) / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s)$ for both open-loop and closed-loop configurations and then examine the time-domain behavior. Be aware that the units transition from phase to voltage via the Phase Detector (PD) and from voltage back to phase via the VCO.\n\nWhat does $\\Phi_{\\text {out }}(s) / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s)$ represent? Drawing an analogy to more commonly encountered transfer functions is helpful here. A circuit with the transfer function $V_{\\text {out }}(s) / V_{\\text {in }}(s) = 1 / (1 + s / \\omega_{0})$ is classified as a low-pass filter due to its inability to accurately track rapid variations in the input when present. Similarly, the ratio $\\Phi_{\\text {out }}(s) / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s)$ demonstrates how well the output phase follows the input phase in scenarios where the input phase changes at different rates, either slowly or quickly.\n\nTo observe the time-varying nature of the excess phase, refer to the waveforms depicted in Fig. 16.15. The period of variation is slow in Fig. 16.15(a) and fast in Fig. 16.15(b). Consequently, $y_{2}(t)$ undergoes more rapid phase changes compared to $y_{1}(t)$.\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:Figure 16.15(a) displays a time-domain waveform representing the function $y_1(t)$. The horizontal axis indicates time, labeled as $t$, and the vertical axis denotes the waveform's amplitude, denoted as $y_1(t)$. The waveform is a periodic square wave characterized by consistent high and low states with a prolonged cycle. The waveform's period is extended, indicating a slow phase change over time.\n\nThe waveform maintains a consistent amplitude during each high and low state and exhibits sharp transitions typical of a square wave. The graph contains no annotations or specific markers, suggesting an emphasis on the qualitative behavior of the waveform rather than precise quantitative measurements. The waveform pattern repeats steadily, suggesting stable phase characteristics over the observed time frame.\n\nThe diagram labeled (b) in the figure presents a time-domain waveform $y_2(t)$. This is a square wave graph that illustrates the variation of a signal over time.\n\n1. **Graph and Function Type:**\n- The graph is a time-domain waveform depicting a square wave.\n\n2. **Axis Labels and Units:**\n- The horizontal axis is denoted as $t$, signifying time. The units of time are unspecified but are typically in seconds or milliseconds in such contexts.\n- The vertical axis represents the waveform's amplitude. The amplitude values are not explicitly labeled, but the waveform alternates between two levels, possibly +1 and -1 or similar values.\n\n3. **Behavior and Trends:**\n- The waveform is periodic, oscillating between two distinct amplitude levels.\n- Compared to $y_1(t)$ in the same figure, $y_2(t)$ exhibits faster changes, pointing to a higher frequency.\n- The waveform displays a consistent pattern of rising and falling edges, which are characteristic of a square wave.\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The waveform has a consistent amplitude and period, with sharp transitions between the high and low states.\n- There are no discernible annotations or numerical markers within the diagram, indicating a focus on the qualitative difference in frequency between $y_1(t)$ and $y_2(t)$.\n\nThis waveform is utilized to illustrate the faster phase variations experienced by $y_2(t)$ compared to $y_1(t)$, as noted in the provided context. This observation is pertinent within the context of PLLs and their responses to fluctuating input phases.\n\nFigure 16.15: Variations of excess phase at slow and fast rates.\nLet's establish a linear model of the PLL, assuming a first-order low-pass filter for simplicity. The PD output encompasses a DC component proportional to $K_{P D}(\\phi_{\\text {out }}-\\phi_{\\text {in }})$ along with high-frequency components. However, these high-frequency elements are mitigated by the LPF, which leads us to model the PD as a subtractor with an output that is amplified by $K_{P D}$. As depicted in Fig. 16.16, the complete PLL model includes the phase subtractor, the LPF transfer function $1 / (1 + s / \\omega_{L P F})$, where $\\omega_{L P F}$ is the cutoff frequency, and the VCO transfer function $K_{V C O} / s$ (refer to Chapter 15). Here, $\\Phi_{\\text {in }}$ and $\\Phi_{\\text {out }}$ denote the excess phases of the input and output waveforms, respectively.\n\nFor example, if the total input phase experiences a step change, $\\phi_{1} u(t)$, then $\\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s) = \\phi_{1} / s$.\n\nThe open-loop transfer function is as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {open}} & =\\left.\\frac{\\Phi_{\\text {out }}}{\\Phi_{\\text {in }}}(s)\\right|_{\\text {open}}  \\tag{16.11}\\\\\n& =K_{P D} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{s}{\\omega_{L P F}}} \\cdot \\frac{K_{V C O}}{s}  \\tag{16.12}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis reveals one pole at $s=-\\omega_{L P F}$ and another at $s=0$. Notably, the loop gain equals $\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {open}}$ due to the unity feedback factor. Given that the loop gain possesses a pole at the origin, the system is termed \"type I.\"\n\nPrior to computing the closed-loop transfer function, let's make a pertinent observation. How does the loop gain behave as $s$ approaches zero, i.e., if the input excess phase changes slowly? Due to the pole at the origin, the loop gain increases significantly as $s$ tends towards zero, contrasting with feedback circuits examined in Chapters 8 and 10. Therefore, under the closed-loop, locked condition, the phase-locked loop ensures that the change in $\\phi_{\\text {out }}$ is precisely equal to the change in $\\phi_{\\text {in }}$ as $s$ approaches zero. This prediction indicates two intriguing characteristics of PLLs. Firstly, if the input excess phase varies slowly, the output excess phase \"tracks\" it. In essence, $\\phi_{\\text {out }}$ is \"locked\" to $\\phi_{\\text {in }}$. Secondly, if the transients in $\\phi_{\\text {in }}$ have decayed (another case corresponding to $s \\rightarrow 0$), the change in $\\phi_{\\text {out }}$ is exactly equal to the change in $\\phi_{\\text {in }}$. This is indeed accurate in the example depicted in Fig. 16.11.\n\nFrom (16.12), we can derive the closed-loop transfer function as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {closed}}=\\frac{K_{P D} K_{V C O}}{\\frac{s^{2}}{\\omega_{L P F}}+s+K_{P D} K_{V C O}} \\tag{16.13}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor brevity, we denote $\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {closed}}$ simply as $H(s)$ or $\\Phi_{\\text {out }} / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}$. As expected, if $s \\rightarrow 0$, $H(s) \\rightarrow 1$ due to the infinite loop gain.\n\nTo further analyze $H(s)$, we derive a relationship that offers a more intuitive understanding of the system. Recollect from Chapter 15 that the instantaneous frequency of a waveform is equivalent to the derivative of the phase with respect to time: $\\omega = \\frac{d\\phi}{dt}$. As frequency and phase are related through a linear operator, the transfer function of (16.13) also applies to variations in the input and output frequencies:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\omega_{\\text {out }}}{\\omega_{\\text {in }}}(s)=\\frac{K_{P D} K_{V C O}}{\\frac{s^{2}}{\\omega_{L P F}}+s+K_{P D} K_{V C O}} \\tag{16.14}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor instance, this result forecasts that if $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$ changes slowly $(s \\rightarrow 0)$, then $\\omega_{\\text {out }}$ will track $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$, as would be anticipated since the loop is assumed to be locked. Equation (16.14) also indicates that if $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$ changes abruptly but the system has ample time to stabilize ($s \\rightarrow 0$), the change in $\\omega_{\\text {out }}$ will be precisely equal to that in $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$ (as illustrated in the example in Fig. 16.12).\n\nThe aforementioned observation aids in analyzing the system in two ways. First, some transient responses of the closed-loop system may be simpler to visualize in terms of frequency changes rather than phase changes. Second, since a change in $\\omega_{\\text {out }}$ must be accompanied by a change in $V_{\\text {cont }}$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nH(s)=K_{V C O} \\cdot \\frac{V_{\\text {cont }}}{\\omega_{\\text {in }}}(s) \\tag{16.15}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis implies that monitoring the response of $V_{\\text {cont }}$ to variations in $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$ effectively yields the response of the closed-loop system.\n\nThe second-order transfer function of (16.13) suggests that the step response of the type I system can be over-damped, critically damped, or under-damped. To determine the condition for each, we express the denominator in a form familiar in control theory, $s^{2}+2 \\zeta \\omega_{n} s+\\omega_{n}^{2}$, where $\\zeta$ is the \"damping factor\" and $\\omega_{n}$ is the \"natural frequency.\" Thus,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nH(s)=\\frac{\\omega_{n}^{2}}{s^{2}+2 \\zeta \\omega_{n} s+\\omega_{n}^{2}} \\tag{16.16}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}\n\\omega_{n}=\\sqrt{\\omega_{L P F} K_{P D} K_{V C O}} \\\\\n\\zeta=\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega_{L P F}}{K_{P D} K_{V C O}}} \\tag{16.18}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe two poles of the closed-loop system are given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ns_{1,2} & =-\\zeta \\omega_{n} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\zeta^{2}-1\\right) \\omega_{n}^{2}}  \\tag{16.19}\\\\\n& =\\left(-\\zeta \\pm \\sqrt{\\zeta^{2}-1}\\right) \\omega_{n} \\tag{16.20}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nTherefore, if $\\zeta>1$, both poles are real, and the system is over-damped, with the transient response containing two exponentials with time constants $1 / s_{1}$ and $1 / s_{2}$. Conversely, if $\\zeta<1$, the poles are complex, and the response to an input frequency step $\\omega_{\\text {in }}=\\Delta \\omega u(t)$ is as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\omega_{\\text {out }}(t) & =\\left\\{1-e^{-\\zeta \\omega_{n} t}\\left[\\cos \\left(\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}} t\\right)+\\frac{\\zeta}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}} \\sin \\left(\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}} t\\right)\\right]\\right\\} \\Delta \\omega u(t)  \\tag{16.21}\\\\\n& =\\left[1-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}} e^{-\\zeta \\omega_{n} t} \\sin \\left(\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}} t+\\theta\\right)\\right] \\Delta \\omega u(t) \\tag{16.22}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\omega_{\\text {out }}$ denotes the change in the output frequency, and $\\theta=\\sin^{-1} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}$. Thus, as depicted in Fig. 16.17, the step response contains a sinusoidal component with a frequency $\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}$ that decays exponentially over time with a time constant $(\\zeta \\omega_{n})^{-1}$. Note that the system exhibits the same response if a phase step is applied to the input, and the output phase is observed.\n\nThe settling speed of PLLs is a critical factor in most applications. Equation (16.22) indicates that the exponential decay determines how quickly the output approaches its final value, implying that $\\zeta \\omega_{n}$ must be maximized. For the type I PLL under study, (16.17) and (16.18) yield:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\zeta \\omega_{n}=\\frac{1}{2} \\omega_{L P F} \\tag{16.23}\n\\end{equation*}\n```"

    "text": "Building upon the qualitative analysis of Phase-Locked Loops (PLLs) from the prior section, we can delve deeper into their transient behavior with a more rigorous approach. Given that the loop starts in a locked state, we analyze the PLL as a feedback system, acknowledging that the output quantity in this context is the VCO's phase error, as the \"error amplifier\" is designed to compare phases. Our goal is to ascertain the transfer function $\\frac{\\Phi_{\\text {out }}(s)}{\\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s)}$ for both open-loop and closed-loop configurations and subsequently examine the time-domain response. It's important to note the dimension shift from phase to voltage through the phase detector (PD) and back to phase through the VCO.\n\nThe significance of $\\frac{\\Phi_{\\text {out }}(s)}{\\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s)}$ can be elucidated through an analogy with more conventional transfer functions. For instance, a circuit with a transfer function $\\frac{V_{\\text {out }}(s)}{V_{\\text {in }}(s)} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{s}{\\omega_0}}$ is regarded as a low-pass filter, as $V_{\\text {out }}$ cannot keep pace with rapid variations in $V_{\\text {in }}$. Similarly, $\\frac{\\Phi_{\\text {out }}(s)}{\\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s)}$ indicates how the output phase tracks the input phase, whether it changes slowly or quickly.\n\nTo visualize the excess phase variation over time, we refer to the waveforms in Fig. 16.15. The period changes slowly in Fig. 16.15(a) and rapidly in Fig. 16.15(b), suggesting that $y_2(t)$ undergoes faster phase changes compared to $y_1(t)$.\n\nWe now develop a linear model of the PLL, assuming a first-order low-pass filter for simplicity. The PD output includes a dc component proportional to $K_{PD}(\\phi_{\\text {out }} - \\phi_{\\text {in}})$, along with high-frequency components that are filtered out by the LPF. Thus, we model the PD as a subtractor with its output amplified by $K_{PD}$. As shown in Fig. 16.16, the overall PLL model consists of the phase subtractor, the LPF with the transfer function $\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{s}{\\omega_{LPF}}}$, where $\\omega_{LPF}$ denotes the $-3\\text{dB}$ bandwidth, and the VCO with the transfer function $\\frac{K_{VCO}}{s}$ (refer to Chapter 15). Here, $\\Phi_{\\text {in }}$ and $\\Phi_{\\text {out }}$ represent the excess phases of the input and output, respectively.\n\nFor example, if the total input phase undergoes a step change, $\\phi_1 u(t)$, then $\\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s) = \\frac{\\phi_1}{s}$.\n\nThe open-loop transfer function is expressed as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {open }} & = \\left.\\frac{\\Phi_{\\text {out }}}{\\Phi_{\\text {in }}}(s)\\right|_{\\text {open }} \\tag{16.11}\\\\\n& = K_{PD} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{s}{\\omega_{LPF}}} \\cdot \\frac{K_{VCO}}{s} \\tag{16.12}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis reveals a pole at $s = -\\omega_{LPF}$ and another at $s = 0$. The loop gain is equal to $\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {open }}$ due to the unity feedback factor. The presence of a pole at the origin characterizes the system as \"type I.\"\n\nBefore deriving the closed-loop transfer function, we make an important observation: What is the loop gain when $s$ is very small, i.e., when the input excess phase changes slowly? Due to the pole at the origin, the loop gain approaches infinity as $s$ tends to zero, contrasting with the feedback circuits studied in Chapters 8 and 10. Hence, the phase-locked loop (under closed-loop, locked conditions) ensures that the change in $\\phi_{\\text {out }}$ exactly matches the change in $\\phi_{\\text {in }}$ as $s$ approaches zero. This result predicts two significant properties of PLLs: First, if the input excess phase changes slowly, the output excess phase \"tracks\" it. Second, if the transients in $\\phi_{\\text {in }}$ have decayed (another case corresponding to $s \\rightarrow 0$), then the change in $\\phi_{\\text {out }}$ is precisely equal to the change in $\\phi_{\\text {in }}$. This is confirmed in the example depicted in Fig. 16.11.\n\nFrom (16.12), the closed-loop transfer function is derived as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {closed }} = \\frac{K_{PD} K_{VCO}}{\\frac{s^2}{\\omega_{LPF}} + s + K_{PD} K_{VCO}} \\tag{16.13}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor simplicity, we denote $\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {closed }}$ by $H(s)$ or $\\frac{\\Phi_{\\text {out }}}{\\Phi_{\\text {in }}}$. As expected, if $s \\rightarrow 0$, $H(s) \\rightarrow 1$ due to the infinite loop gain.\n\nTo further analyze $H(s)$, we establish a relationship that offers a more intuitive understanding of the system. Recalling from Chapter 15 that the instantaneous frequency of a waveform is the time derivative of the phase, $\\omega = \\frac{d\\phi}{dt}$, and since frequency and phase are related linearly, the transfer function of (16.13) applies to variations in input and output frequencies as well:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\omega_{\\text {out }}}{\\omega_{\\text {in }}}(s) = \\frac{K_{PD} K_{VCO}}{\\frac{s^2}{\\omega_{LPF}} + s + K_{PD} K_{VCO}} \\tag{16.14}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis result predicts that if $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$ changes slowly ($s \\rightarrow 0$), then $\\omega_{\\text {out }}$ tracks $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$, as expected because the loop is locked. Equation (16.14) also indicates that if $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$ changes abruptly but the system is allowed to settle ($s \\rightarrow 0$), then the change in $\\omega_{\\text {out }}$ equals that in $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$ (as illustrated in the example of Fig. 16.12).\n\nThis observation aids the analysis in two ways: First, some transient responses of the closed-loop system may be simpler to visualize in terms of changes in the frequency quantities rather than the phase quantities.

To determine the conditions for each case, we rewrite the denominator in a familiar form from control theory, $s^2 + 2\\zeta\\omega_n s + \\omega_n^2$, where $\\zeta$ is the \"damping factor\" and $\\omega_n$ is the \"natural frequency\":\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nH(s) = \\frac{\\omega_n^2}{s^2 + 2\\zeta\\omega_n s + \\omega_n^2} \\tag{16.16}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}\n\\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\omega_{LPF} K_{PD} K_{VCO}} \\\\\n\\zeta = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega_{LPF}}{K_{PD} K_{VCO}}} \\tag{16.18}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe two poles of the closed-loop system are given by:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ns_{1,2} & = -\\zeta \\omega_n \\pm \\sqrt{(\\zeta^2 - 1) \\omega_n^2} \\tag{16.19}\\\\\n& = (-\\zeta \\pm \\sqrt{\\zeta^2 - 1}) \\omega_n \\tag{16.20}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThus, if $\\zeta > 1$, both poles are real, the system is overdamped, and the transient response contains two exponentials with time constants $1/s_1$ and $1/s_2$.

Equation (16.22) indicates that the exponential decay governs how quickly the output approaches its final value, implying that $\\zeta \\omega_n$ must be maximized. For the type I PLL under study, (16.17) and (16.18) yield:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\zeta \\omega_n = \\frac{1}{2} \\omega_{LPF} \\tag{16.23}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis result reveals a critical trade-off between the settling speed and the ripple on the VCO control line: a lower $\\omega_{LPF}$ leads to greater suppression of high-frequency components from the PD but results in a longer settling time constant.\n\nThe choice of $\\zeta$ also involves other trade-offs. First, (16.18) implies that as $\\omega_{LPF}$ is reduced to minimize the ripple on the control voltage, stability degrades. Second, (16.5) and (16.18) indicate that both the phase error and $\\zeta$ are inversely proportional to $K_{PD} K_{VCO}$; reducing the phase error necessarily makes the system less stable. In summary, the type I PLL is subject to trade-offs among settling speed, the quality of the output signal (ripple\nThe stability speed and stability\nThe settling speed and the stability\nThe settling speed and the quality of the output signal are important considerations in the design of Phase-Locked Loops (PLLs). The settling speed refers to how quickly the PLL can lock onto the input frequency after a change, while the quality of the output signal pertains to the stability and stability of the signal generated by the PLL-Controlled Oscillator (VCO). \n\nIn a type I PLL, there is a trade-off between these two parameters. To achieve a faster settling speed, a higher loop gain (product of the phase detector gain $K_{PD}$ and the VCO gain $K_{VCO}$) is required. However, increasing the loop gain can lead to a less stable system, potentially causing overshoot and oscill in the output signal, which degrades its quality.\n\nConversely, to maintain a high-quality output signal with minimal ripple and overshoot, the loop gain must be kept lower, which results in a slower settling speed. This trade-off is a key challenge in the design of PLLs, as the optimal balance between settling speed and output signal quality depends on the specific application requirements.\n\nFor instance, in communication systems, a faster settling speed is often necessary to quickly acquire and track the frequency of incoming signals. However, the quality of the output signal is also crucial to ensure reliable data transmission. In such cases, careful design considerations and parameter optimizations are required to achieve the best performance.\n\nIn addition to the loop gain, other factors such as the bandwidth of the low-pass filter (LPF), which determines the cutoff frequency $\\omega_{LPF}$, also influence the settling speed and output signal quality. A wider bandwidth allows for faster tracking of frequency changes but may result in more noise and ripple in the control voltage. Conversely, a narrower bandwidth provides a cleaner output signal but slows down the response to frequency changes.\n\nOverall, the design of a PLL involves a complex interplay of various parameters and components, each contributing to the system's performance in terms of settling speed and output signal quality. Engineers must carefully analyze and optimize these parameters to meet the specific needs of their applications."

    "text": "Building upon the qualitative analysis of Phase-Locked Loops (PLLs) in the preceding section, we can now delve deeper into their transient behavior. By assuming that the loop starts in a locked state, we analyze the PLL as a feedback system, acknowledging that the output quantity of interest in this context is the phase difference of the Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO). The \"error amplifier\" within the PLL compares phases, and our goal is to determine the transfer function $\\Phi_{\\text {out }}(s) / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s)$ for both open-loop and closed-loop configurations, and subsequently investigate the time-domain response. It is important to note the transformation of dimensions from phase to voltage through the Phase Detector (PD) and from voltage back to phase through the VCO.\n\nThe transfer function $\\Phi_{\\text {out }}(s) / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s)$ represents the manner in which the output phase follows the input phase, especially when the input phase changes at varying speeds. To visualize the excess phase variation over time, we examine the waveforms in Figure 16.15. The period changes slowly in Figure 16.15(a) and rapidly in Figure 16.15(b). Consequently, $y_{2}(t)$ undergoes faster phase variations compared to $y_{1}(t)$.\n\nMoving forward, we construct a linear model of the PLL, simplifying it with a first-order low-pass filter. The PD output includes a direct current (dc) component equivalent to $K_{P D}\\left(\\phi_{\\text {out }}-\\phi_{i n}\\right)$, along with high-frequency components that are filtered out by the LPF. We model the PD as a subtractor with its output amplified by $K_{P D}$. As depicted in Figure 16.16, the overall PLL model comprises the phase subtractor, the LPF transfer function $1 /\\left(1+s / \\omega_{L P F}\\right)$, where $\\omega_{L P F}$ denotes the $-3-\\mathrm{dB}$ bandwidth, and the VCO transfer function $K_{V C O} / s$.\n\nIn this model, $\\Phi_{\\text {in }}$ and $\\Phi_{\\text {out }}$ represent the excess phases of the input and output waveforms, respectively. For instance, if the total input phase undergoes a step change, $\\phi_{1} u(t)$, then $\\Phi_{i n}(s)=\\phi_{1} / s$. The open-loop transfer function is given by:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {open }} & =\\left.\\frac{\\Phi_{\\text {out }}}{\\Phi_{\\text {in }}}(s)\\right|_{\\text {open }}  \\tag{16.11}\\\\\n& =K_{P D} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{s}{\\omega_{L P F}}} \\cdot \\frac{K_{V C O}}{s} \\tag{16.12}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis transfer function reveals a pole at $s=-\\omega_{L P F}$ and another at $s=0$. The loop gain is equal to $\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {open }}$ due to the unity feedback factor. The presence of a pole at the origin classifies the system as \"type I.\"\n\nAn important observation before calculating the closed-loop transfer function is the behavior of the loop gain when $s$ is very small, meaning the input excess phase changes slowly. Because of the pole at the origin, the loop gain approaches infinity as $s$ tends to zero, which is a distinctive feature of PLLs. This ensures that the change in $\\phi_{\\text {out }}$ precisely matches the change in $\\phi_{\\text {in }}$ as $s$ approaches zero. This property predicts two key characteristics of PLLs: (1) if the input excess phase changes slowly, the output excess phase will track it, and (2) if the transients in $\\phi_{i n}$ have decayed, the change in $\\phi_{\\text {out }}$ will exactly equal the change in $\\phi_{\\text {in }}$.\n\nThe closed-loop transfer function can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {closed }}=\\frac{K_{P D} K_{V C O}}{\\frac{s^{2}}{\\omega_{L P F}}+s+K_{P D} K_{V C O}} \\tag{16.13}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor simplicity, we denote $\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {closed }}$ as $H(s)$ or $\\Phi_{\\text {out }} / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}$. As expected, as $s \\rightarrow 0$, $H(s) \\rightarrow 1$ due to the infinite loop gain.\n\nTo gain a more intuitive understanding of the system, we derive a relationship that connects the phase and frequency variations. The instantaneous frequency of a waveform is the derivative of the phase with respect to time. Since the frequency and phase are related linearly, the transfer function of (16.13) also applies to variations in the input and output frequencies:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\omega_{\\text {out }}}{\\omega_{\\text {in }}}(s)=\\frac{K_{P D} K_{V C O}}{\\frac{s^{2}}{\\omega_{L P F}}+s+K_{P D} K_{V C O}} \\tag{16.14}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis result indicates that if the input frequency changes very slowly, the output frequency will track it, which is consistent with the assumption that the loop is locked. Additionally, if the input frequency changes abruptly but the system is given sufficient time to stabilize, the change in output frequency will equal the change in input frequency.\n\nThe transfer function of (16.14) also implies that a change in output frequency must be accompanied by a change in the control voltage of the VCO. Therefore, monitoring the response of the control voltage to variations in the input frequency provides insights into the closed-loop system response.\n\nThe second-order transfer function of (16.13) suggests that the step response of the type I system can be overdamped, critically damped, or underdamped. To determine the conditions for each case, we rewrite the denominator in a standard form used in control theory, $s^{2}+2 \\zeta \\omega_{n} s+\\omega_{n}^{2}$, where $\\zeta$ is the damping factor and $\\omega_{n}$ is the natural frequency:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nH(s)=\\frac{\\omega_{n}^{2}}{s^{2}+2 \\zeta \\omega_{n} s+\\omega_{n}^{2}} \\tag{16.16}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}\n\\omega_{n}=\\sqrt{\\omega_{L P F} K_{P D} K_{V C O}} \\\\\n\\zeta=\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega_{L P F}}{K_{P D} K_{V C O}}} \\tag{16.18}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe poles of the closed-loop system are given by:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ns_{1,2} & =-\\zeta \\omega_{n} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\zeta^{2}-1\\right) \\omega_{n}^{2}}  \\tag{16.19}\\\\\n& =\\left(-\\zeta \\pm \\sqrt{\\left.\\zeta^{2}-1\\right)} \\omega_{n}\\right. \\tag{16.20}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThus, if $\\zeta>1$, both poles are real, and the system is overdamped, resulting in a transient response with two exponentials having time constants $1 / s_{1}$ and $1 / s_{2}$. If $\\zeta<1$, the poles are complex, and the response to an input frequency step $\\omega_{i n}=\\Delta \\omega u(t)$ is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\omega_{\\text {out }}(t) & =\\left\\{1-e^{-\\zeta \\omega_{n} t}\\left[\\cos \\left(\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}} t\\right)+\\frac{\\zeta}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}} \\sin \\left(\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}} t\\right)\\right]\\right\\} \\Delta \\omega u(t)  \\tag{16.21}\\\\\n& =\\left[1-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}} e^{-\\zeta \\omega_{n} t} \\sin \\left(\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}} t+\\theta\\right)\\right] \\Delta \\omega u(t) \\tag{16.22}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe step response exhibits a sinusoidal component with a frequency $\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}$ that decays exponentially with a time constant $\\left(\\zeta \\omega_{n}\\right)^{-1}$. This behavior is similar if a phase step is applied to the input and the output phase is observed.\n\nThe settling speed of PLLs is crucial in most applications. Equation (16.22) indicates that the exponential decay determines how quickly the output approaches its final value, implying that $\\zeta \\omega_{n}$ should be maximized. For the type I PLL under consideration, (16.17) and (16.18) yield:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\zeta \\omega_{n}=\\frac{1}{2} \\omega_{L P F} \\tag{16.23}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis result reveals a trade-off between the settling speed and the ripple on the VCO control line: decreasing $\\omega_{L P F}$ enhances the suppression of high-frequency components produced by the PD but lengthens the settling time constant.\n\nTo analyze the stability behavior of PLLs graphically, we can utilize Bode plots of the magnitude and phase of the loop gain. As shown in Figure 16.19, the loop gain starts at infinity at $\\omega=0$ and decreases at a rate of $20 \\mathrm{~dB} / \\mathrm{dec}$ for $\\omega<\\omega_{L P F}$ and at a rate of $40 \\mathrm{~dB} / \\mathrm{dec}$ thereafter. The phase starts at $-90^{\\circ}$ and asymptotically approaches $-180^{\\circ}$.\n\nIf a higher $K_{P D} K_{V C O}$ is chosen to minimize $\\phi_{o u t}-\\phi_{\\text {in }}$, the gain crossover shifts to the right, degrading the phase margin. This is consistent with the dependence of $\\zeta$ upon $K_{P D} K_{V C O}$.\n\nThe stability behavior of type I PLLs can also be analyzed using the root locus plot in the complex plane as the parameter $K_{P D} K_{V C O}$ varies (Figure 16.20). With $K_{P D} K_{V C O}=0$, the loop is open, $\\zeta=\\infty$, and the two poles are located at $s_{1}=-\\omega_{L P F}$ and $s_{2}=0$. As $K_{P D} K_{V C O}$ increases, $\\zeta$ decreases, and the poles move towards each other on the real axis. For $\\zeta=1$, the poles coincide at $s_{1}=s_{2}=-\\omega_{L P F} / 2$. Beyond this point, the poles become complex conjugates, moving vertically along lines parallel to the imaginary axis.\n\nFrom Figure 16.20, as $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ move away from the real axis, the system becomes less stable. In fact, it can be proven that $\\cos \\psi=\\zeta$, concluding that as $\\psi$ approaches $90^{\\circ}, \\zeta$ drops to zero.\n\nAnother transfer function that reveals the settling behavior of PLLs is that of the error at the output of the phase subtractor (Figure 16.16). Defined as $H_{e}(s)=\\left(\\phi_{\\text {in }}-\\phi_{\\text {out }}\\right) / \\phi_{i n}$, this transfer function can be obtained by noting that $\\phi_{\\text {out }} / \\phi_{\\text {in }}=H(s)$ and, from (16.13):\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nH_{e}(s) & =1-H(s)  \\tag{16.30}\\\\\n& =\\frac{s^{2}+2 \\zeta \\omega_{n} s}{s^{2}+2 \\zeta \\omega_{n} s+\\omega_{n}} \\tag{16.31}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nAs expected, $H_{e}(s) \\rightarrow 0$ if $s \\rightarrow 0$ because the output tracks the input when the input varies very slowly or the transient has settled."

Our goal is to establish the transfer function $\\Phi_{\\text {out }}(s) / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s)$ for both open-loop and closed-loop systems and then examine the time-domain response. It's important to note that the dimensions shift from phase to voltage through the phase detector (PD) and from voltage back to phase through the VCO.\n\nThe meaning of $\\Phi_{\\text {out }}(s) / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s)$ can be illuminated by an analogy with more familiar transfer functions. A circuit with a transfer function $V_{\\text {out }}(s) / V_{\\text {in }}(s)=1 /\\left(1+s / \\omega_{0}\\right)$ is seen as a low-pass filter, as $V_{\\text {out }}$ cannot fully follow rapid variations in $V_{\\text {in }}$. Similarly, $\\Phi_{\\text {out }}(s) / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s)$ shows how the output phase tracks the input phase, whether it changes slowly or quickly.\n\nTo observe how the excess phase changes over time, refer to the waveforms in Fig. 16.15. The period changes slowly in Fig. 16.15(a) and rapidly in Fig. 16.15(b). Consequently, $y_{2}(t)$ undergoes faster phase changes compared to $y_{1}(t)$.\n\nNow, let's build a linear model of the PLL, assuming a first-order low-pass filter for simplicity. The PD output includes a dc component equal to $K_{P D}\\left(\\phi_{\\text {out }}-\\phi_{i n}\\right)$ along with high-frequency components. Since the high frequencies are suppressed by the LPF, we model the PD as a subtractor whose output is \"amplified\" by $K_{P D}$. As shown in Fig. 16.16, the overall PLL model comprises the phase subtractor, the LPF transfer function $1 /\\left(1+s / \\omega_{L P F}\\right)$, where $\\omega_{L P F}$ denotes the $-3-\\mathrm{dB}$ bandwidth, and the VCO transfer function $K_{V C O} / s$ (Chapter 15). Here, $\\Phi_{\\text {in }}$ and $\\Phi_{\\text {out }}$ denote the excess phases of the input and output waveforms, respectively. For instance, if the total input phase undergoes a step change, $\\phi_{1} u(t)$, then $\\Phi_{i n}(s)=\\phi_{1} / s$.\n\nThe open-loop transfer function is given by:\n\n$$\n\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {open }} =K_{P D} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{s}{\\omega_{L P F}}} \\cdot \\frac{K_{V C O}}{s}\n$$\n\nThis reveals a pole at $s=-\\omega_{L P F}$ and another at $s=0$. The loop gain is equal to $\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {open }}$ due to the unity feedback factor. With a pole at the origin, the system is classified as \"type I.\"\n\nBefore computing the closed-loop transfer function, note that the loop gain approaches infinity as $s$ goes to zero, contrasting with feedback circuits studied in Chapters 8 and 10. Thus, the phase-locked loop (under closed-loop, locked condition) ensures that the change in $\\phi_{\\text {out }}$ matches the change in $\\phi_{\\text {in }}$ as $s$ approaches zero. This implies two interesting properties of PLLs: first, if the input excess phase varies slowly, the output excess phase \"tracks\" it; second, if transients in $\\phi_{i n}$ have decayed, the change in $\\phi_{\\text {out }}$ equals the change in $\\phi_{i n}$.\n\nThe closed-loop transfer function is:\n\n$$\n\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {closed }}=\\frac{K_{P D} K_{V C O}}{\\frac{s^{2}}{\\omega_{L P F}}+s+K_{P D} K_{V C O}}\n$$\n\nFor brevity, we denote $\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {closed }}$ simply by $H(s)$ or $\\Phi_{\\text {out }} / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}$. As expected, if $s \\rightarrow 0, H(s) \\rightarrow 1$ due to the infinite loop gain.\n\nTo further analyze $H(s)$, we derive a relationship that provides a more intuitive understanding of the system. The transfer function of (16.13) applies to variations in the input and output frequencies as well:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\omega_{\\text {out }}}{\\omega_{\\text {in }}}(s)=\\frac{K_{P D} K_{V C O}}{\\frac{s^{2}}{\\omega_{L P F}}+s+K_{P D} K_{V C O}}\n$$\n\nThis result indicates that if $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$ changes slowly, $\\omega_{\\text {out }}$ tracks $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$. Equation (16.14) also suggests that if $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$ changes abruptly but the system is given time to settle, the change in $\\omega_{\\text {out }}$ equals that in $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$.\n\nThe above observation aids the analysis in two directions. First, some transient responses of the closed-loop system may be simpler to visualize in terms of changes in the frequency quantities rather than the phase quantities. Second, since a change in $\\omega_{\\text {out }}$ must be accompanied by a change in $V_{\\text {cont }}$, we have:\n\n$$\nH(s)=K_{V C O} \\cdot \\frac{V_{\\text {cont }}}{\\omega_{\\text {in }}}(s)\n$$\n\nThe second-order transfer function of (16.13) suggests that the step response of the type I system can be overdamped, critically damped, or underdamped.

The Bode plots of the magnitude and phase of the loop gain yield the phase margin. Using (16.12) to construct such plots, as shown in Fig. 16.19, the loop gain starts from infinity at $\\omega=0$ and falls at a rate of $20 \\mathrm{~dB} / \\mathrm{dec}$ for $\\omega<\\omega_{L P F}$ and at a rate of $40 \\mathrm{~dB} / \\mathrm{dec}$ thereafter.

With $K_{P D} K_{V C O}=0$, the loop is open, $\\zeta=\\infty$, and the two poles are given by $s_{1}=-\\omega_{L P F}$ and $s_{2}=0$. As $K_{P D} K_{V C O}$ increases, $\\zeta$ drops and the two poles, given by $s_{1,2}=\\left(-\\zeta \\pm \\sqrt{\\zeta^{2}-1}\\right) \\omega_{n}$, move towards each other on the real axis. For $\\zeta=1$, $s_{1}=s_{2}=-\\zeta \\omega_{n}=-\\omega_{L P F} / 2$. As $K_{P D} K_{V C O}$ increases further, the two poles become complex, with a real part equal to $-\\zeta \\omega_{n}=-\\omega_{L P F} / 2$, moving in parallel with the $j \\omega$ axis.\n\nWe recognize from Fig. 16.20 that, as $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ move away from the real axis, the system becomes less stable. In fact, the reader can prove that $\\cos \\psi=\\zeta$ (Problem 16.8), concluding that as $\\psi$ approaches $90^{\\circ}, \\zeta$ drops to zero.\n\nAnother transfer function that reveals the settling behavior of PLLs is that of the error at the output of the phase subtractor in Fig. 16.16.

Given that the loop is initially in a locked state, we approach the PLL as a feedback system, bearing in mind that the relevant output quantity in this analysis is the phase variation of the Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO), since the \"error amplifier\" is limited to phase comparison. Our goal is to ascertain the transfer function, represented as $\\Phi_{\\text {out }}(s) / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s)$, for both the open-loop and closed-loop configurations, and subsequently to examine the response in the time domain. It is important to note that there is a dimensional shift from phase to voltage through the Phase Detector (PD) and from voltage back to phase through the VCO.\n\nThe significance of $\\Phi_{\\text {out }}(s) / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s)$ can be illuminated by drawing an analogy with more conventional transfer functions. A circuit with a transfer function of $V_{\\text {out }}(s) / V_{\\text {in }}(s)=1 /\\left(1+s / \\omega_{0}\\right)$ behaves as a low-pass filter; when the input voltage $V_{\\text {in }}$ changes rapidly, the output voltage $V_{\\text {out }}$ cannot fully follow these variations. Similarly, $\\Phi_{\\text {out }}(s) / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s)$ demonstrates how the output phase tracks the input phase, whether the latter changes slowly or quickly.\n\nTo conceptualize the variation of the phase over time, we can refer to the waveforms depicted in Figure 16.15. The period undergoes a gradual change in Figure 16.15(a) and a rapid change in Figure 16.15(b). Consequently, $y_{2}(t)$ undergoes more rapid phase fluctuations compared to $y_{1}(t)$.\n\n---\n\n**Figure 16.15(a) Description:**\n\nThe waveform graph labeled \"(a)\" in Figure 16.15 illustrates the function $y_1(t)$.

The depicted waveform is a periodic square wave, distinguished by a consistent and uniform pattern of alternating high and low states. The waveform's period is relatively extended, signifying a gradual phase change over time. The amplitude remains constant throughout each high and low phase, with abrupt transitions characteristic of square waves. The absence of annotations or specific markers suggests a focus on the waveform's qualitative behavior rather than precise measurements.

    "text": "We have already delved into the qualitative aspects of Phase-Locked Loops (PLLs) in the prior section, which now allows us to meticulously examine their transient characteristics. Presuming the loop to be initially in a locked state, we analyze the PLL as a feedback system, acknowledging that the output quantity in this context must be the phase deviation of the Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO), as the \"error amplifier\" is solely capable of comparing phases. Our goal is to ascertain the transfer function, $\\Phi_{\\text {out }}(s) / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s)$, for both open-loop and closed-loop configurations, and thereafter to scrutinize the time-domain response. It's important to note the transition of dimensions from phase to voltage via the Phase Detector (PD) and from voltage back to phase via the VCO.\n\nThe expression $\\Phi_{\\text {out }}(s) / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s)$ represents what? An analogy with more customary transfer functions can be instructive. A circuit with a transfer function $V_{\\text {out }}(s) / V_{\\text {in }}(s)=1 /\\left(1+s / \\omega_{0}\\right)$ behaves as a low-pass filter, since if $V_{\\text {in }}$ fluctuates rapidly, $V_{\\text {out }}$ cannot entirely follow the input fluctuations. Similarly, $\\Phi_{\\text {out }}(s) / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}(s)$ indicates how the output phase tracks the input phase when the latter changes either slowly or swiftly.\n\nTo conceptualize the temporal progression of the phase deviation, one can refer to the waveforms in Figure 16.15. The period changes slowly in Figure 16.15(a) and rapidly in Figure 16.15(b), demonstrating that $y_{2}(t)$ undergoes more rapid phase fluctuations compared to $y_{1}(t)$.\n\nFor a more simplified representation of the PLL, we assume a first-order low-pass filter. The PD's output includes a direct current component proportional to $K_{P D}\\left(\\phi_{\\text {out }}-\\phi_{i n}\\right)$ along with high-frequency components. As the latter are mitigated by the LPF, we can model the PD as a subtractor with an \"amplified\" output by $K_{P D}$. As depicted in Figure 16.16, the complete PLL model incorporates the phase subtractor, the LPF transfer function $1 /\\left(1+s / \\omega_{L P F}\\right)$, with $\\omega_{L P F}$ signifying the $-3-\\mathrm{dB}$ bandwidth, and the VCO transfer function $K_{V C O} / s$ (refer to Chapter 15). Here, $\\Phi_{\\text {in }}$ and $\\Phi_{\\text {out }}$ represent the phase deviations of the input and output signals, respectively.\n\nIf the total input phase undergoes a sudden change, say $\\phi_{1} u(t)$, then $\\Phi_{i n}(s)=\\phi_{1} / s$. The open-loop transfer function is expressed as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {open }} & =\\left.\\frac{\\Phi_{\\text {out }}}{\\Phi_{\\text {in }}}(s)\\right|_{\\text {open }}  \\tag{16.11}\\\\\n& =K_{P D} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{s}{\\omega_{L P F}}} \\cdot \\frac{K_{V C O}}{s} \\tag{16.12}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis reveals a pole at $s=-\\omega_{L P F}$ and another at $s=0$. It's worth noting that the loop gain equals $\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {open }}$ due to the unit feedback factor. Because the loop gain possesses a pole at the origin, the system is categorized as \"type I.\"\n\nBefore we derive the closed-loop transfer function, let's note an important observation. What is the loop gain when $s$ is negligible, implying that the input phase deviation changes very gradually? Due to the presence of the pole at the origin, the loop gain approaches infinity as $s$ tends to zero, contrasting with the feedback circuits examined in Chapters 8 and 10. Therefore, the phase-locked loop, under closed-loop and locked conditions, ensures that the change in $\\phi_{\\text {out }}$ precisely matches the change in $\\phi_{\\text {in }}$ as $s$ approaches zero. This result预示着PLL的两个有趣属性。首先，如果输入相位偏差变化非常缓慢，则输出相位偏差将“跟踪”它。（毕竟，$\\phi_{\\text {out }}$是“锁定”到$\\phi_{\\text {in }}$。）其次，如果$\\phi_{i n}$中的瞬态已经衰减（对应于$s \\rightarrow 0$的情况），则$\\phi_{\\text {out }}$的变化恰好等于$\\phi_{i n}$的变化。这在图16.11的示例中得到了证实。\n\nFrom (16.12), the closed-loop transfer function can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {closed }}=\\frac{K_{P D} K_{V C O}}{\\frac{s^{2}}{\\omega_{L P F}}+s+K_{P D} K_{V C O}} \\tag{16.13}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor brevity, we will hereafter denote $\\left.H(s)\\right|_{\\text {closed }}$ simply by $H(s)$ or $\\Phi_{\\text {out }} / \\Phi_{\\text {in }}$. As expected, if $s \\rightarrow 0, H(s) \\rightarrow 1$ due to the infinite loop gain.\n\nTo further analyze $H(s)$, we derive a relationship that allows for a more instinctive comprehension of the system. Recalling from Chapter 15 that the instantaneous frequency of a waveform corresponds to the time derivative of the phase: $\\omega=d \\phi / d t$. Since frequency and phase are related through a linear operator, the transfer function of (16.13)同样适用于输入和输出频率的变化:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{\\omega_{\\text {out }}}{\\omega_{\\text {in }}}(s)=\\frac{K_{P D} K_{V C O}}{\\frac{s^{2}}{\\omega_{L P F}}+s+K_{P D} K_{V C O}} \\tag{16.14}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis indicates that if $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$ changes very slowly $(s \\rightarrow 0)$, then $\\omega_{\\text {out }}$ will track $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$, which is a predictable outcome since the loop is assumed to be locked. Equation (16.14) also suggests that if $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$ changes abruptly but the system is allowed sufficient time to stabilize ( $s \\rightarrow 0$ ), then the change in $\\omega_{\\text {out }}$ will be equal to that in $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$ (as demonstrated in the example of Fig. 16.12).\n\nThis insight aids the analysis in two respects. Firstly, it may be simpler to visualize certain transient responses of the closed-loop system in terms of frequency changes rather than phase changes. Secondly, since a change in $\\omega_{\\text {out }}$ necessitates a corresponding change in $V_{\\text {cont }}$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nH(s)=K_{V C O} \\cdot \\frac{V_{\\text {cont }}}{\\omega_{\\text {in }}}(s) \\tag{16.15}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis implies that observing the response of $V_{\\text {cont }}$ to variations in $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$ indeed yields the response of the closed-loop system.\n\nThe second-order transfer function of (16.13) suggests that the step response of the type I system can be overdamped, critically damped, or underdamped. To determine the conditions for each case, we rewrite the denominator in a form familiar from control theory, $s^{2}+2 \\zeta \\omega_{n} s+\\omega_{n}^{2}$, where $\\zeta$ is the \"damping factor\" and $\\omega_{n}$ is the \"natural frequency.\" Thus:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nH(s)=\\frac{\\omega_{n}^{2}}{s^{2}+2 \\zeta \\omega_{n} s+\\omega_{n}^{2}} \\tag{16.16}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}\n\\omega_{n}=\\sqrt{\\omega_{L P F} K_{P D} K_{V C O}} \\\\\n\\zeta=\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega_{L P F}}{K_{P D} K_{V C O}}} \\tag{16.18}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe two poles of the closed-loop system are given by:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ns_{1,2} & =-\\zeta \\omega_{n} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\zeta^{2}-1\\right) \\omega_{n}^{2}}  \\tag{16.19}\\\\\n& =\\left(-\\zeta \\pm \\sqrt{\\left.\\zeta^{2}-1\\right)} \\omega_{n}\\right. \\tag{16.20}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nConsequently, if $\\zeta>1$, both poles are real, the system is overdamped, and the transient response comprises two exponentials with time constants $1 / s_{1}$ and $1 / s_{2}$. Conversely, if $\\zeta<1$, the poles are complex, and the response to an input frequency step $\\omega_{i n}=\\Delta \\omega u(t)$ is given by:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\omega_{\\text {out }}(t) & =\\left\\{1-e^{-\\zeta \\omega_{n} t}\\left[\\cos \\left(\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}} t\\right)+\\frac{\\zeta}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}} \\sin \\left(\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}} t\\right)\\right]\\right\\} \\Delta \\omega u(t)  \\tag{16.21}\\\\\n& =\\left[1-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}} e^{-\\zeta \\omega_{n} t} \\sin \\left(\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}} t+\\theta\\right)\\right] \\Delta \\omega u(t) \\tag{16.22}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\omega_{\\text {out }}$ signifies the change in the output frequency, and $\\theta=\\sin ^{-1} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}$. As shown in Fig. 16.17, the step response includes a sinusoidal component with a frequency $\\omega_{n} \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}$ that decays with a time constant $\\left(\\zeta \\omega_{n}\\right)^{-1}$. Note that the system exhibits the same response if a phase step is applied to the input and the output phase is monitored.\n\nThe settling speed of PLLs is a critical concern in most applications. Equation (16.22) suggests that the exponential decay governs how quickly the output approaches its final value, indicating that $\\zeta \\omega_{n}$ must be maximized. For the type I PLL under consideration, (16.17) and (16.18) yield:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\zeta \\omega_{n}=\\frac{1}{2} \\omega_{L P F} \\tag{16.23}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis result reveals a crucial trade-off between the settling speed and the ripple on the VCO control line: a lower $\\omega_{L P F}$ leads to greater suppression of high-frequency components produced by the PD but results in a longer settling time constant.\n\nThe stability characteristics of PLLs can also be examined graphically for further insight. We can use the Bode plots of the magnitude and phase of the loop gain, as discussed in Chapter 10, to easily determine the phase margin. Using (16.12), we can construct such plots. As shown in Fig. 16.19, the loop gain starts at infinity at $\\omega=0$ and decreases at a rate of $20 \\mathrm{~dB} / \\mathrm{dec}$ for $\\omega<\\omega_{L P F}$ and at a rate of $40 \\mathrm{~dB} / \\mathrm{dec}$ thereafter. The phase begins at $-90^{\\circ}$ and asymptotically reaches $-180^{\\circ}$.\n\nWhat occurs if a higher $K_{P D} K_{V C O}$ is chosen to minimize $\\phi_{o u t}-\\phi_{\\text {in }}$? Since the entire gain plot in Fig. 16.19 is shifted upwards, the gain crossover shifts to the right, thus degrading the phase margin. This aligns with the dependence of $\\zeta$ upon $K_{P D} K_{V C O}$.\n\nAs observed, $K_{P D} K_{V C O}$ influences numerous significant parameters of PLLs. This quantity is sometimes referred to as the loop gain (despite not being dimensionless) due to its similarity to the error equation in a feedback system.\n\nThe stability characteristics of type I PLLs can also be analyzed through the root locus of their poles in the complex plane as the parameter $K_{P D} K_{V C O}$ varies (Fig. 16.20). With $K_{P D} K_{V C O}=0$, the loop is open, $\\zeta=\\infty$, and the two poles are located at $s_{1}=-\\omega_{L P F}$ and $s_{2}=0$. As $K_{P D} K_{V C O}$ increases (i.e., the feedback becomes stronger), $\\zeta$ decreases, and the two poles, given by $s_{1,2}=\\left(-\\zeta \\pm \\sqrt{\\zeta^{2}-1}\\right) \\omega_{n}$, move towards each other on the real axis. At $\\zeta=1$ (i.e., $\\left.K_{P D} K_{V C O}=\\omega_{L P F} / 4\\right), s_{1}=s_{2}=-\\zeta \\omega_{n}=-\\omega_{L P F} / 2$. As $K_{P D} K_{V C O}$ continues to increase, the two poles become complex, with a real part equal to $-\\zeta \\omega_{n}=-\\omega_{L P F} / 2$, moving in parallel with the $j \\omega$ axis.\n\nFrom Fig. 16.20, it is evident that as $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ move away from the real axis, the system becomes less stable. In fact, the reader can prove that $\\cos \\psi=\\zeta$ (Problem 16.8), concluding that as $\\psi$ approaches $90^{\\circ}, \\zeta$ decreases to zero.\n\nAnother transfer function that elucidates the settling behavior of PLLs is that of the error at the output of the phase subtractor in Fig. 16.16. Defined as $H_{e}(s)=\\left(\\phi_{\\text {in }}-\\phi_{\\text {out }}\\right) / \\phi_{i n}$, this transfer function can be derived by noting that $\\phi_{\\text {out }} / \\phi_{\\text {in }}=H(s)$ and, from (16.13),\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nH_{e}(s) & =1-H(s)  \\tag{16.30}\\\\\n& =\\frac{s^{2}+2 \\zeta \\omega_{n} s}{s^{2}+2 \\zeta \\omega_{n} s+\\omega_{n}^{2}} \\tag{16.31}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nAs expected, $H_{e}(s) \\rightarrow 0$ if $s \\rightarrow 0$ because the output tracks the input when the input varies very slowly or the transient has settled.\n\nFor instance, suppose a type I PLL encounters a frequency step $\\Delta \\omega$ at $t=0$. The Laplace transform of the frequency step equals $\\Delta \\omega / s$. Since $H_{e}(s)$ relates the phase error to the input phase, we write $\\Phi_{i n}(s)=(\\Delta \\omega / s) / s=\\Delta \\omega / s^{2}$. Thus, the Laplace transform of the phase error is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Phi_{e}(s) & =H_{e}(s) \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta \\omega}{s^{2}}  \\tag{16.32}\\\\\n& =\\frac{s^{2}+2 \\zeta \\omega_{n} s}{s^{2}+2 \\zeta \\omega_{n} s+\\omega_{n}^{2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta \\omega}{s^{2}} \\tag{16.33}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nFrom the final value theorem:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\phi_{e}(t=\\infty) & =\\lim _{s \\rightarrow 0} s \\Phi_{e}(s)  \\tag{16.34}\\\\\n& =\\frac{2 \\zeta}{\\omega_{n}} \\Delta \\omega  \\tag{16.35}\\\\\n& =\\frac{\\Delta \\omega}{K_{P D} K_{V C O}} \\tag{16.36}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhich aligns with (16.5)."

    "text": "For periodic signals, the two loops in Fig. 16.21 can be combined using a circuit that detects both phase and frequency differences. This circuit is known as a phase/frequency detector (PFD), as shown conceptually in Fig. 16.22. It uses sequential logic to create three states and respond to the rising or falling edges of the two inputs. If initially $Q_{A}=Q_{B}=0$, a rising transition on $A$ will result in $Q_{A}=1, Q_{B}=0$. The circuit stays in this state until $B$ goes high, at which point $Q_{A}$ returns to zero. In other words, if a rising edge on $A$ is followed by a rising edge on $B$, then $Q_{A}$ goes high and returns to low. The behavior is similar for the $B$ input.\n\nThe system block diagram in Fig. 16.22 represents a Phase Frequency Detector (PFD) used to compare the phases and frequencies of two input signals, A and B. The diagram consists of the following main components and flow of information:\n\n1. **Main Components:**\n   - **PFD Block:** This is the central component that receives two input signals, A and B, and produces two output signals, Q_A and Q_B.\n\n2. **Flow of Information or Control:**\n   - **Inputs:**\n     - Signal A and Signal B are the input signals fed into the PFD block.\n   - **Outputs:**\n     - Q_A and Q_B are the output signals generated by the PFD block.\n   - **Signal Flow:**\n     - The PFD compares the phases (ϕ) and frequencies (ω) of the input signals A and B. The outputs Q_A and Q_B are determined by the relative phase and frequency differences between A and B.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n   - The diagram is divided into two scenarios labeled (a) and (b).\n   - **Scenario (a):**\n     - Describes a condition where the phases of A and B are unequal (ϕ_A ≠ ϕ_B), resulting in Q_A producing pulses while Q_B remains at zero.\n   - **Scenario (b):**\n     - Describes a condition where the frequencies of A and B are unequal (ω_A ≠ ω_B), leading to Q_A generating pulses while Q_B remains quiet.\n\n4. **Overall System Function:**\n   - The primary function of the PFD is to detect and indicate phase and frequency differences between two input signals. When the phase or frequency of A leads B, Q_A produces output pulses. Conversely, if A lags B, Q_B would produce pulses (not shown in the diagram). This behavior is crucial in applications like phase-locked loops (PLLs) where maintaining phase and frequency alignment between signals is necessary.\n\nThe graph in Fig. 16.22(a) is a time-domain waveform illustrating the operation of a Phase Frequency Detector (PFD) with two input signals, **A** and **B**, and two output signals, **Q_A** and **Q_B**.

This is a time-domain waveform graph, showing the behavior of the signals over time.\n\n1. **Type of Graph and Function:**\n   - The graph is a time-domain waveform representation.\n   - It displays the input signals \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) and the output signals \\( Q_A \\) and \\( Q_B \\) from the PFD.\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n   - The horizontal axis represents time \\( t \\), with no specific units or scale indicated.\n   - There are no vertical axis labels, but the vertical position indicates the logic levels (high or low) of the signals.\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n   - Signal \\( A \\) has a higher frequency than signal \\( B \\), as indicated by more frequent rising and falling edges.\n   - The output \\( Q_A \\) generates pulses corresponding to the frequency difference, while \\( Q_B \\) remains low.\n   - The pulses in \\( Q_A \\) occur at the rising edges of \\( A \\) where \\( B \\) remains low, indicating that \\( A \\) is leading in frequency.\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n   - The waveform for \\( A \\) shows more cycles in the same time frame compared to \\( B \\), confirming that \\( A \\) has a higher frequency.\n   - \\( Q_A \\) produces narrow pulses at each rising edge of \\( A \\) when \\( B \\) is low, illustrating the phase difference.\n   - \\( Q_B \\) remains consistently low, indicating no phase lead of \\( B \\) over \\( A \\).\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n   - The graph is annotated with \\( \\omega_A \\neq \\omega_B \\) to emphasize the frequency difference.\n   - No specific numerical values or additional markers are provided in the graph.\n\nFigure 16.22 Conceptual operation of a PFD.\nIn Fig. 16.22(a), the two inputs have equal frequencies, but $A$ leads $B$. The output $Q_{A}$ continues to produce pulses whose width is proportional to $\\phi_{A}-\\phi_{B}$ while $Q_{B}$ remains at zero. In Fig. 16.22(b), $A$ has a higher frequency than $B$, and $Q_{A}$ generates pulses while $Q_{B}$ does not. By symmetry, if $A$ lags $B$ or has a lower frequency than $B$, then $Q_{B}$ produces pulses and $Q_{A}$ remains quiet. Thus, the dc contents of $Q_{A}$ and $Q_{B}$ provide information about $\\phi_{A}-\\phi_{B}$ or $\\omega_{A}-\\omega_{B}$. The outputs $Q_{A}$ and $Q_{B}$ are called the \"UP\" and \"DOWN\" pulses, respectively.\n\n#### Example 16.7\n\nExplain whether a master-slave D flipflop can operate as a phase detector or a frequency detector. Assume that the flipflop provides differential outputs.\n\n#### Solution\n\nAs shown in Fig. 16.23(a), we first apply inputs having equal frequencies and a finite phase difference, assuming that the output changes on the rising edge of the clock input. If $A$ leads $B$, then $V_{\\text {out }}$ remains at a logical ONE indefinitely because the flipflop continues to sample the high levels of $A$. Conversely, if $A$ lags $B$, then $V_{\\text {out }}$ remains low. Plotted in Fig. 16.23(b), the input-output characteristic of the circuit displays a very high gain at $\\Delta \\phi=$ $0, \\pm \\pi, \\cdots$ and a zero gain at other values of $\\Delta \\phi$. The D flipflop is sometimes called a \"bang-bang\" phase detector to emphasize that the average value of $V_{\\text {out }}$ jumps from $-V_{1}$ to $+V_{1}$ as $\\Delta \\phi$ varies from slightly below zero to slightly above zero.\n\nNow let us assume unequal frequencies for $A$ and $B$. If the flipflop is to behave as a frequency detector, then the average value of $V_{\\text {out }}$ must exhibit different polarities for $\\omega_{A}>\\omega_{B}$ and $\\omega_{A}<\\omega_{B}$. However, as illustrated in Fig. 16.23(c), the average value is zero in both cases.\n\nThe diagram labeled (a) illustrates a D flip-flop circuit used as a phase detector. The main components of this system are:\n\n1. **D Flip-Flop**: This is the central component of the circuit. It has two inputs labeled A and B, and two outputs labeled Q and \\(\\overline{Q}\\). The D input is set to a logical ONE, and the clock input (CK) is connected to signal B.\n\n2. **Inputs**:\n   - **A**: A digital signal input to the D flip-flop.\n   - **B**: Another digital signal input, which acts as the clock (CK) for the flip-flop.\n\n3. **Outputs**:\n   - **\\(V_{out}\\)**: The output of the flip-flop, taken from the Q output, which shows the phase relationship between inputs A and B.\n\n**Flow of Information**:\n   - Signal A is fed into the D input of the flip-flop, while signal B is connected to the clock input. The flip-flop samples the value of A at the rising edge of B.\n   - The output \\(V_{out}\\) reflects the sampled value of A, depending on the phase relationship between A and B.\n\n**Annotations and Indicators**:\n   - The diagram shows timing waveforms for both inputs A and B, as well as the resulting \\(V_{out}\\).\n   - The output \\(V_{out}\\) is depicted as switching between +\\(V_1\\) and -\\(V_1\\), indicating the phase relationship.\n\n**Overall System Function**:\nThe primary function of this system is to detect the phase difference between two digital signals, A and B. When A leads B, the average value of \\(V_{out}\\) is +\\(V_1\\), and when A lags B, the average value is -\\(V_1\\). This behavior allows the D flip-flop to function as a phase detector, indicating the phase relationship between the input signals through the average output voltage.\n\nThe graph labeled as \"(b)\" represents the input-output characteristic of a D flip-flop used as a phase detector. This is a plot of the time average of the output voltage, $V_{\\text{out}}$, against the phase difference, $\\Delta \\phi$, between two input signals A and B.\n\n1. **Type of Graph and Function:**\n   - The graph is a characteristic curve showing the relationship between the average output voltage and the phase difference, which is typical for phase detectors.\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n   - The x-axis represents the phase difference, $\\Delta \\phi$, measured in radians. It is marked with values ranging from $-\\pi$ to $\\pi$.\n   - The y-axis represents the time average of the output voltage, $V_{\\text{out}}$, with units in volts. The axis is labeled with values $-V_1$ and $+V_1$.\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n   - The graph shows a periodic waveform with a square shape, alternating between $+V_1$ and $-V_1$ as the phase difference varies.\n   - The waveform has a period of $2\\pi$, indicating that the output voltage repeats every $2\\pi$ radians of phase difference.\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n   - The waveform crosses the zero line at $\\Delta \\phi = 0$, indicating that the average output voltage is zero when there is no phase difference between the input signals.\n   - The graph exhibits abrupt transitions at phase differences of $\\pm\\pi$, where the average output voltage jumps from $-V_1$ to $+V_1$ or vice versa.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n   - The key data points are the transitions at $\\Delta \\phi = -\\pi$, $0$, and $\\pi$, where the time average of $V_{\\text{out}}$ changes polarity.\n   - There are no additional annotations or markers on the graph, but the periodic nature and symmetry about the origin are visually clear.\n\nThe graph in Figure 16.23(c) is a time-domain waveform illustrating the behavior of a D flipflop when subjected to two unequal input frequencies, denoted as signals A and B. The graph displays the input signals A and B as square waves, along with the resulting output signal, V_out, over time.\n\n1. **Type of Graph and Function:**\n   - This is a time-domain waveform graph showing the output response of a digital circuit (D flipflop) to varying input signals.\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n   - The horizontal axis represents time (t), although no specific units are provided. The vertical axis represents voltage levels, with specific reference to +V1 and -V1 as potential output levels.\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n   - The input signals A and B are shown as periodic square waves with slightly different frequencies. The output V_out is also a square wave that changes according to the phase relationship between A and B. When the frequencies are unequal, V_out averages to zero over time, as indicated by the dashed line at the zero-voltage level.\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n   - The output waveform V_out is highlighted with shaded areas, indicating the portions of time when the output is either high or low. Despite the unequal frequencies, the average value of V_out remains zero, demonstrating the flipflop's inability to detect frequency differences through average voltage.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n   - The graph includes a dashed line representing the zero-voltage level, which is the average value of V_out over time. The shaded regions in the V_out waveform indicate the high and low states relative to this average.\n\nFigure 16.23 (a) D flipflop as a phase detector; (b) input-output characteristic; (c) response of D flipflop to unequal input frequencies.\n\nThe circuit of Fig. 16.22 can be realized in various forms. Figure 16.24(a) shows a simple implementation consisting of two edge-triggered, resettable D flipflops with their D inputs tied to a logical ONE.\n\nThe circuit is a Phase Frequency Detector (PFD) using two D flip-flops and an AND gate. Inputs A and B serve as clocks for the flip-flops. QA and QB outputs are reset simultaneously by the AND gate when both are high. This configuration helps detect phase differences between inputs A and B.\n\nThe graph titled \"A, B, Q_A, Q_B waveforms\" is a time-domain waveform representation. The x-axis represents time (t) with no specific units or scale indicated, suggesting a continuous flow of time. The y-axis denotes the logical states of the signals A, B, Q_A, and Q_B, which typically switch between logical high (1) and low (0).\n\n1. **Type of Graph and Function:**\n   - This is a time-domain waveform graph showing digital signals.\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n   - The x-axis is labeled as time (t), while the y-axis represents the logical state of the signals. No specific units are provided.\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n   - The waveforms for A and B are periodic square waves, both having similar frequencies but with a phase difference, where A leads B.\n   - Q_A and Q_B are also square waves but are triggered by the rising edges of A and B, respectively.\n   - Q_A goes high when A goes high and remains high until a reset condition is met.\n   - Similarly, Q_B goes high when B goes high and is reset shortly after.\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n   - The signals A and B serve as clock inputs for the flip-flops, and they are shown as periodic signals with equal time intervals between transitions.\n   - Q_A and Q_B are outputs of D flip-flops that respond to the rising edges of A and B, respectively.\n   - The reset condition, which is not explicitly shown in the waveforms, is implied to occur when both Q_A and Q_B are high, resetting both to low.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n   - The diagram does not provide specific numerical values or annotations for the waveforms, focusing instead on the logical interaction between A, B, Q_A, and Q_B.\n   - The timing of the reset is critical in ensuring that Q_A and Q_B do not remain high simultaneously for extended periods, which is a key aspect of their operation in phase detection.\n\nOverall, the graph illustrates how the D flip-flops respond to the input signals A and B, with Q_A and Q_B reflecting the phase relationship between these inputs, crucial for applications like phase frequency detectors.\n\nThe circuit is a Phase Frequency Detector (PFD) using D flip-flops and an AND gate. It compares the phase and frequency of two input signals, A and B.\n\nFigure 16.24 (a) Implementation of PFD; (b) implementation of D flipflop.\n\nThe inputs of interest, $A$ and $B$, serve as the clocks of the flipflops. If $Q_{A}=Q_{B}=0$ and $A$ goes high, $Q_{A}$ rises. If this event is followed by a rising transition on $B, Q_{B}$ goes high and the AND gate resets both flipflops. In other words, $Q_{A}$ and $Q_{B}$ are simultaneously high for a short time, but the difference between their average values still represents the input phase or frequency difference correctly. Each flipflop can be implemented as shown in Fig. 16.24(b), where two RS latches are cross-coupled. Latch 1 and Latch 2 respond to the rising edges of $C K$ and Reset, respectively.\n\n#### Example 16.8\n\nDetermine the width of the narrow reset pulses that appear in the $Q_{B}$ waveform in Fig. 16.24(a).\n\n#### Solution\n\nFigure 16.25(a) illustrates the overall PFD at the gate level."

    "text": "A phase/frequency detector (PFD) is capable of detecting both phase and frequency discrepancies between two periodic signals. This is achieved by integrating the two loops depicted in Fig. 16.21 into a single circuit. The PFD, as shown conceptually in Fig. 16.22, utilizes sequential logic to manage three distinct states and reacts to the rising or falling edges of the two input signals. When both $Q_{A}$ and $Q_{B}$ are initially at 0, a rising transition in $A$ causes $Q_{A}$ to shift to 1 while $Q_{B}$ remains at 0. The circuit maintains this state until $B$ rises, at which point $Q_{A}$ reverts to 0. This implies that if a rising edge in $A$ is succeeded by a rising edge in $B$, $Q_{A}$ will rise and then fall. The response is analogous for the $B$ input.\n\nThe block diagram in Fig. 16.22 portrays a PFD that compares the phases and frequencies of two input signals, A and B. The main components include the PFD block, which takes in signals A and B and generates outputs Q_A and Q_B. The information flow involves signals A and B being input into the PFD block, with Q_A and Q_B being the resulting outputs. The PFD assesses the phases (ϕ) and frequencies (ω) of A and B, determining Q_A and Q_B based on the relative phase and frequency discrepancies.\n\nThe diagram is segmented into two scenarios: (a) and (b). Scenario (a) describes a situation where A and B have unequal phases (ϕ_A ≠ ϕ_B), causing Q_A to generate pulses while Q_B stays at zero. Scenario (b) illustrates a condition where A and B have unequal frequencies (ω_A ≠ ω_B), resulting in Q_A emitting pulses while Q_B remains inactive.\n\nThe primary role of the PFD is to detect and signal phase and frequency disparities between two input signals. When the phase or frequency of A precedes B, Q_A generates output pulses. Conversely, if A trails B, Q_B would produce pulses (not depicted in the diagram). This behavior is essential in applications like phase-locked loops (PLLs), where maintaining phase and frequency alignment between signals is crucial.\n\nFig. 16.22(a) exhibits input signals with equal frequencies, but A leads B. Q_A generates pulses proportional to the phase difference (ϕ_A - ϕ_B) while Q_B stays at zero. In Fig. 16.22(b), A has a higher frequency than B, with Q_A emitting pulses and Q_B remaining inactive. If A lags B or has a lower frequency, Q_B would produce pulses while Q_A stays quiet. Hence, the DC content of Q_A and Q_B conveys information about the phase (ϕ_A - ϕ_B) or frequency (ω_A - ω_B) differences. Outputs Q_A and Q_B are referred to as the \"UP\" and \"DOWN\" pulses, respectively."

It utilizes sequential logic to generate three distinct states and respond to the ascending or descending edges of the dual inputs.

With an initial condition of $Q_{A}=Q_{B}=0$, a positive transition on $A$ will set $Q_{A}=1, Q_{B}=0$. This state persists until $B$ rises, causing $Q_{A}$ to revert to zero. Essentially, if a positive edge on $A$ is succeeded by a positive edge on $B$, $Q_{A}$ will activate and then deactivate. The same reaction occurs for the $B$ input.\n\nThe system block diagram in Fig. 16.22 illustrates a PFD designed to assess the phases and frequencies of two input signals, A and B.

When the phase or frequency of A precedes B, Q_A emits output pulses. If A trails B, Q_B would generate pulses (not depicted). This functionality is vital in applications like phase-locked loops (PLLs) where aligning phase and frequency between signals is crucial.\n\nIn Fig. 16.22(a), where the input frequencies are equal but A leads B, the output Q_A generates pulses with a width relative to the phase difference (φ_A - φ_B) while Q_B stays at zero. In Fig. 16.22(b), where A's frequency surpasses B's, Q_A produces pulses, and Q_B remains inactive. By symmetry, if A trails B or has a lower frequency, Q_B would pulse, and Q_A would be silent. Therefore, the direct current (dc) content of Q_A and Q_B conveys information about the phase (φ_A - φ_B) or frequency (ω_A - ω_B) differences. The outputs Q_A and Q_B are known as the \"UP\" and \"DOWN\" pulses, respectively.\n\n#### Example 16.7\n\nA master-slave D flip-flop can serve as a phase detector but not as a frequency detector. The flip-flop, which offers differential outputs, operates by sampling the input on the rising edge of the clock signal.

The input-output characteristic, as shown in Fig. 16.23(b), exhibits high gain at phase differences of 0, ±π, etc., and zero gain at other phase differences. The D flip-flop is sometimes termed a \"bang-bang\" phase detector due to the output's average value jumping between polarities as the phase difference fluctuates around zero.\n\nHowever, when the input frequencies are unequal, the average $V_{\\text{out}}$ value must show different polarities for ω_A > ω_B and ω_A < ω_B for the flip-flop to function as a frequency detector. Yet, as depicted in Fig. 16.23(c), the average output value is zero in both scenarios, indicating the flip-flop's ineffectiveness as a frequency detector.\n\nFigure 16.22 provides a conceptual view of the PFD's operation. Figure 16.24(a) presents a simple PFD implementation using two edge-triggered, resettable D flip-flops with their D inputs tied to a logical ONE. This circuit detects phase discrepancies between inputs A and B, with QA and QB outputs being reset concurrently by an AND gate when both are high.\n\nThe waveform graph titled \"A, B, Q_A, Q_B waveforms\" illustrates the PFD's behavior over time, showcasing the interactions between input signals A and B and the resulting outputs Q_A and Q_B.\n\nFigure 16.24(b) shows a D flip-flop implementation, which can be utilized in the PFD circuit. The flip-flops' inputs, A and B, act as their respective clocks. If $Q_{A}=Q_{B}=0$ and A rises, $Q_{A}$ activates. If followed by a rise in B, $Q_{B}$ goes high, and the AND gate resets both flip-flops. Hence, $Q_{A}$ and $Q_{B}$ are briefly high simultaneously, but their average value difference still accurately represents the input phase or frequency difference.\n\n#### Example 16.8\n\nTo determine the width of the narrow reset pulses on the $Q_{B}$ waveform in Fig. 16.24(a), one must consider the gate-level representation of the PFD in Fig. 16.25(a). A rising edge on B triggers a series of transitions that lead to a reset pulse on $Q_{B}$, approximately equal to 5 gate delays in width, as shown in Fig. 16.25(b).\n\nIn a phase-locked loop (PLL), the PFD's outputs, Q_A and Q_B, are low-pass filtered and sensed differentially, as depicted in Fig. 16.27. This configuration ensures the PLL always locks, but due to the finite \"loop gain,\" $K_{PFD} K_{VCO}$, it incurs a finite phase error."

A charge pump comprises two switched current sources that inject or remove charge from the loop filter based on two logical inputs. Figure 16.28 illustrates a charge pump driven by a PFD and driving a capacitor. The circuit operates in three states. If $Q_{A}=Q_{B}=0$, then $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ are off, and $V_{\\text {out }}$ remains constant. If $Q_{A}$ is high and $Q_{B}$ is low, $I_{1}$ charges $C_{P}$. Conversely, if $Q_{A}$ is low and $Q_{B}$ is high, $I_{2}$ discharges $C_{P}$. Thus, if, for instance, $A$ leads $B$, $Q_{A}$ continues to generate pulses, causing $V_{\\text {out }}$ to rise steadily. Referred to as UP and DOWN currents, $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ are generally equal.\n\n#### Example 16.9\n\nWhat impact do the narrow pulses in the $Q_{B}$ waveform in Fig. 16.28 have?\n\n#### Solution\n\nSince $Q_{A}$ and $Q_{B}$ are both high for a finite period (around 5 gate delays from Example 16.8), the current supplied by the charge pump to $C_{P}$ is affected. In fact, if $I_{1}=I_{2}$, the current through $S_{1}$ merely flows through $S_{2}$ during the narrow reset pulse, leaving no current to charge $C_{P}$. As depicted in Fig. 16.29, $V_{\\text {out }}$ remains constant once $Q_{B}$ goes high.\nimage_name:Figure 16.29\ndescription:The graph in Figure 16.29 is a time-domain waveform chart showing the behavior of signals A, B, Q_A, Q_B, and V_out over time.

It starts low, goes high when A is high and B is low, and returns to low when both A and B are high.\n\n4. **Signal Q_B**: This waveform shows narrow pulses that occur when both A and B are high, indicating a reset condition in the phase detector logic.\n\n5. **V_out**: This waveform starts at a low level, rises steadily when Q_A is high and Q_B is low, and then remains constant when Q_B goes high. This reflects the charging behavior of the capacitor \\( C_P \\) in the charge pump circuit, where the current flow is interrupted during the narrow pulses of Q_B, causing V_out to plateau.\n\nOverall, the graph illustrates the interaction between phase detector signals and the resulting output voltage behavior in a phase-locked loop (PLL) system. The key feature is the steady rise of V_out when Q_A is active, which is halted during the reset pulses of Q_B, demonstrating the charge pump's influence on the output voltage.\n\nThe PFD/CP/LPF cascade shown in Fig. 16.28 possesses an intriguing property. If $A$ leads $B$ by a finite amount, $Q_{A}$ continuously produces pulses, allowing the charge pump to inject $I_{1}$ into $C_{P}$ and causing $V_{\\text {out }}$ to rise steadily. In other words, for a finite input error, the output eventually reaches $+\\infty$ or $-\\infty$, implying that the circuit's \"gain\" is infinite.

The key feature is V_out's steady rise when Q_A is active, halted during Q_B's reset pulses, illustrating the charge pump's effect on the output voltage.\n\nThe PFD/CP/LPF cascade shown in Fig. 16.28 possesses an intriguing property. If A leads B by a finite amount, $Q_{A}$ generates pulses indefinitely, enabling the charge pump to inject $I_{1}$ into $C_{P}$ and driving $V_{\\text {out }}$ to rise continuously. In essence, for a finite input error, the output will eventually reach $+\\infty$ or $-\\infty$, implying the circuit's \"gain\" is infinite. In this cascade, the PFD converts the input phase error into a pulse width on $Q_{A}$ or $Q_{B}$, the charge pump translates this pulse width into charge, and the capacitor accumulates this charge."

    "text": "We shall now build a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) using the circuit depicted in Fig. 16.28. The design, as illustrated in Fig. 16.30 and known as a charge-pump PLL, discerns the transitions at the input and output, identifies phase or frequency discrepancies, and modulates the charge pump accordingly. Upon activation, the output frequency $\\omega_{\\text {out }}$ may significantly differ from the input frequency $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$. However, the Phase Frequency Detector (PFD) and the charge pump collaborate to adjust the control voltage, bringing $\\omega_{\\text {out }}$ closer to $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$. When the frequencies of input and output are sufficiently aligned, the PFD functions as a phase detector, achieving phase lock. The loop is considered locked when the phase discrepancy diminishes to zero, and the charge pump remains largely inactive.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the PFD/CP/LPF assembly exhibits infinite gain, implying that any nonzero, deterministic discrepancy between the input phase $\\phi_{\\text {in }}$ and the output phase $\\phi_{\\text {out }}$ triggers an indefinite accumulation of charge on the capacitor $C_{\\text {P}}$. What implications does this characteristic hold for a charge-pump PLL? When the loop depicted in Fig. 16.30 is locked, the control voltage $V_{\\text {cont }}$ is finite, necessitating the input phase error to be precisely zero. This contrasts with the type I PLL, where the phase error is finite and dependent on the output frequency.\n\nThe circuit in Fig. 16.30 represents a straightforward charge-pump PLL, incorporating a phase frequency detector, a charge pump, and a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). The input phase is compared with the output phase to govern the VCO frequency.\n\nFor a deeper understanding of the PLL's operation in Fig. 16.30, let's disregard the brief reset pulses on $Q_{A}$ and $Q_{B}$ and assume that once the phase difference $\\phi_{\\text {out }}-\\phi_{\\text {in }}$ reaches zero, the PFD outputs $Q_{A}=Q_{B}=0$. Consequently, the charge pump becomes dormant, and $C_{\\text {P}}$ maintains a steady control voltage. Does this imply that the PFD and the CP are redundant once the loop is locked? If $V_{\\text {cont }}$ remains constant over an extended period, the VCO's frequency and phase may begin to drift. Specifically, the noise inherent in the VCO introduces random fluctuations in the oscillation frequency, potentially leading to a substantial phase error accumulation. The PFD then detects this phase discrepancy and generates a corrective pulse on $Q_{A}$ or $Q_{B}$, adjusting the VCO frequency via the charge pump and the filter. This underscores why the PLL reacts solely to the surplus phase of waveforms. Additionally, since phase comparison occurs in every cycle in Fig. 16.30, the VCO's phase and frequency are precluded from significant drift.\n\nTo analyze the dynamics of CPPLL, we develop a linear model for the PFD, charge pump, and low-pass filter combination, thereby deriving the transfer function. We pose two questions: (1) Is the PFD/CP/LPF assembly in Fig. 16.28 a linear system? (2) If it is, how can we compute its transfer function?\n\nTo address the first question, we assess the system's linearity. For instance, as depicted in Fig. 16.31(a), we double the input phase difference and observe if $V_{\\text {out }}$ exactly doubles. Interestingly, the flat segments of $V_{\\text {out }}$ double, but not the ramp segments. This is because the current charging or discharging $C_{\\text {P}}$ is constant, resulting in a constant slope for the ramp—an effect analogous to slewing in operational amplifiers. Thus, the system is not strictly linear. To circumvent this issue, we approximate the output waveform as a ramp [Fig. 16.31(b)], establishing a linear relationship between $V_{\\text {out }}$ and $\\Delta \\phi$. In essence, we approximate a discrete-time system with a continuous-time model.\n\nTo answer the second question, we recall that the transfer function is the Laplace transform of the impulse response, necessitating the application of a phase difference impulse and calculation of $V_{\\text {out }}$ in the time domain. Since a phase difference impulse is challenging to visualize, we apply a phase difference step, derive $V_{\\text {out }}$, and differentiate the result with respect to time.\n\nAssuming the input period is $T_{i n}$ and the charge pump supplies a current of $\\pm I_{P}$ to the capacitor, as shown in Fig. 16.32, we commence with a zero phase difference and, at $t=0$, step the phase of $B$ by $\\phi_{0}$, i.e., $\\Delta \\phi=\\phi_{0} u(t)$. Consequently, $Q_{A}$ or $Q_{B}$ persists in generating pulses that are $\\phi_{0} T_{i n} /(2 \\pi)$ seconds wide, elevating the output voltage by $\\left(I_{P} / C_{\\text {P}}\\right) \\phi_{0} T_{i n} /(2 \\pi)$ in each period. Approximated by a ramp, $V_{\\text {out }}$ thus exhibits a slope of $\\left(I_{P} / C_{\\text {P}}\\right) \\phi_{0} /(2 \\pi)$ and can be expressed as:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text {out }}(t)=\\frac{I_{P}}{2 \\pi C_{\\text {P}}} t \\cdot \\phi_{0} u(t)\n$$\n\nThe impulse response is therefore given by:\n\n$$\nh(t)=\\frac{I_{P}}{2 \\pi C_{\\text {P}}} u(t)\n$$\n\nyielding the transfer function:\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{\\text {out }}}{\\Delta \\phi}(s)=\\frac{I_{P}}{2 \\pi C_{\\text {P}}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{s}\n$$\n\nAs a result, the PFD/CP/LPF assembly features a pole at the origin, differing from the $\\mathrm{PD} / \\mathrm{LPF}$ circuit employed in the type I PLL. Analogous to the expression $K_{V C O} / s$, we denote $I_{P} /\\left(2 \\pi C_{\\text {P}}\\right)$ as the \"gain\" of the PFD and denote it by $K_{P F D}$.\n\nLet us now construct a linear model of charge-pump PLLs. As depicted in Fig. 16.33, the model yields an open-loop transfer function:\n\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\Phi_{\\text {out }}}{\\Phi_{\\text {in }}}(s)\\right|_{\\mathrm{open}}=\\frac{I_{P}}{2 \\pi C_{\\text {P}}} \\frac{K_{V C O}}{s^{2}}\n$$\n\nSince the loop gain possesses two poles at the origin, this configuration is classified as a \"type II\" PLL. The closed-loop transfer function, denoted by $H(s)$ for brevity, is thus expressed as:\n\n$$\nH(s)=\\frac{\\frac{I_{P} K_{V C O}}{2 \\pi C_{\\text {P}}}}{s^{2}+\\frac{I_{P} K_{V C O}}{2 \\pi C_{\\text {P}}}}\n$$\n\nThis outcome is disconcerting because the closed-loop system harbors two imaginary poles at $s_{1,2}=$ $\\pm j \\sqrt{I_{P} K_{V C O} /\\left(2 \\pi C_{\\text {P}}\\right)}$ and is, therefore, unstable. The instability stems from the loop gain's two poles at the origin (i.e., two ideal integrators). As shown in Fig. 16.34(a), each integrator introduces a constant phase shift of $90^{\\circ}$, enabling the system to oscillate at the gain crossover frequency.\n\nTo stabilize the system, we must alter the phase characteristic such that the phase shift is less than $180^{\\circ}$ at the gain crossover. As depicted in Fig. 16.34(b), this is achieved by introducing a zero in the loop gain, i.e., by adding a resistor in series with the loop filter capacitor (Fig. 16.35). Utilizing the result from Example 16.10, the reader can demonstrate (Problem 16.11) that the PFD/CP/LPF now exhibits the following transfer function:\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{\\text {out }}}{\\Delta \\phi}(s)=\\frac{I_{P}}{2 \\pi}\\left(R_{P}+\\frac{1}{C_{\\text {P}} s}\\right)\n$$\n\nConsequently, the PLL open-loop transfer function is expressed as:\n\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\Phi_{\\text {out }}}{\\Phi_{\\text {in }}}(s)\\right|_{\\text {open }}=\\frac{I_{P}}{2 \\pi}\\left(R_{P}+\\frac{1}{C_{\\text {P}} s}\\right) \\frac{K_{V C O}}{s}\n$$\n\nand hence\n\n$$\nH(s)=\\frac{\\frac{I_{P} K_{V C O}}{2 \\pi C_{\\text {P}}}\\left(R_{P} C_{\\text {P}} s+1\\right)}{s^{2}+\\frac{I_{P}}{2 \\pi} K_{V C O} R_{P} s+\\frac{I_{P}}{2 \\pi C_{\\text {P}}} K_{V C O}}\n$$\n\nThe closed-loop system now includes a zero at $s_{z}=-1 /\\left(R_{P} C_{\\text {P}}\\right)$. Employing the same notation as that for the type I PLL, we have:\n\n$$\n\\omega_{n} =\\sqrt{\\frac{I_{P} K_{V C O}}{2 \\pi C_{\\text {P}}}}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\zeta =\\frac{R_{P}}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{I_{P} C_{\\text {P}} K_{V C O}}{2 \\pi}}\n$$\n\nAs anticipated, if $R_{P}=0$, then $\\zeta=0$. With complex poles, the decay time constant is given by $1 /\\left(\\zeta \\omega_{n}\\right)=$ $4 \\pi /\\left(R_{P} I_{P} K_{V C O}\\right)$.\n\nThe stability behavior of type II PLLs significantly differs from that of type I PLLs. We initiate the analysis with the Bode plots of the loop gain (the loop transmission) [Eq. (16.44)]. As illustrated in Fig. 16.36, these plots suggest that if $I_{P} K_{V C O}$ decreases, the gain crossover frequency shifts towards the origin, diminishing the phase margin. This trend, as predicted by (16.47), starkly contrasts with that expressed by (16.18) and depicted in Fig. 16.19.\n\nIt is also feasible to construct the root locus of the closed-loop system in the complex plane. For $I_{P} K_{V C O}=0$ (e.g., $I_{P}=0$ ), the loop is open, and both poles reside at the origin. For $I_{P} K_{V C O}>0$, we have $s_{1,2}=-\\zeta \\omega_{n} \\pm \\omega_{n} \\sqrt{\\zeta^{2}-1}$, and, since $\\zeta \\propto \\sqrt{I_{P} K_{V C O}}$, the poles are complex if $I_{P} K_{V C O}$ is small. The reader can demonstrate (Problem 16.14) that as $I_{P} K_{V C O}$ increases, $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ traverse a circle centered at $\\sigma=-1 /\\left(R_{P} C_{\\text {P}}\\right)$ with a radius $1 /\\left(R_{P} C_{\\text {P}}\\right)$ (Fig. 16.37). The poles revert to the real axis at $\\zeta=1$, assuming a value of $-2 /\\left(R_{P} C_{\\text {P}}\\right)$. For $\\zeta>1$, the poles remain real, one approaching $-1 /\\left(R_{P} C_{\\text {P}}\\right)$ and the other advancing towards negative infinity as $I_{P} K_{V C O} \\rightarrow+\\infty$. Since for complex $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}, \\zeta=\\cos \\psi$, we observe that as $I_{P} K_{V C O}$ surpasses zero, the system attains greater stability.\n\n#### Example 16.11\n\nA student contemplates the Bode plots in Fig. 16.36 and notes that at $\\omega_{1}$, the loop gain surpasses unity and the phase shift is $-180^{\\circ}$. The student then deduces that the PLL must oscillate at this frequency! Elucidate the flaw in this reasoning.\n\n#### Solution\n\nThe phase shift is actually slightly less than zero unless $\\omega_{1}=0$. As explained using Nyquist's approach in Chapter 10, a system composed of two integrators and one zero does not oscillate.\n\nThe compensated type II PLL of Fig. 16.35 encounters a critical limitation. Since the charge pump drives the series combination of $R_{P}$ and $C_{\\text {P}}$, each current injection into the loop filter induces a substantial voltage surge in the control voltage. Even in the locked state, discrepancies between $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ and the charge injection and clock feedthrough of $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ introduce voltage spikes in $V_{\\text {cont }}$. The resulting ripple significantly disturbs the VCO, compromising the output phase. To mitigate this issue, a second capacitor is typically introduced in parallel with $R_{P}$ and $C_{\\text {P}}$ (Fig. 16.38), suppressing the initial step. The loop filter now operates as a second-order system, yielding a third-order PLL and introducing stability challenges [4]. Nonetheless, if $C_{2}$ is approximately one-fifth to one-tenth of $C_{\\text {P}}$, the closed-loop time and frequency responses remain relatively unaffected.\n\nEquation (16.47) suggests that the loop achieves greater stability as $R_{P}$ increases. In reality, as $R_{P}$ becomes excessively large, stability deteriorates again. This effect is not anticipated by the preceding derivations because we have approximated the discrete-time system with a continuous-time loop. A more precise analysis is presented in [2], but simulations are often necessary to ascertain the stability boundaries of CPPLLs."

This doesn't imply that the PFD and CP are unnecessary; if $V_{\\text {cont }}$ remains constant over time, the VCO's frequency and phase might drift due to noise sources, potentially causing a significant phase error accumulation. The PFD detects this phase difference and generates corrective pulses on $Q_{A}$ or $Q_{B}$ to adjust the VCO frequency through the charge pump and the filter. This is why the PLL is sensitive only to the excess phase of waveforms. Additionally, since phase comparison occurs in every cycle in Fig. 16.30, the VCO phase and frequency cannot drift significantly.\n\nTo analyze the behavior of charge-pump PLLs quantitatively, we develop a linear model for the PFD, the charge pump, and the low-pass filter to derive the transfer function. We pose two questions: (1) Is the PFD/CP/LPF combination in Fig. 16.28 a linear system? (2) If it is, how can we compute its transfer function?\n\nTo address the first question, we test the system's linearity. For instance, as shown in Fig. 16.31(a), we double the input phase difference and observe if $V_{\\text {out }}$ doubles as well. Interestingly, only the flat sections of $V_{\\text {out }}$ double, not the ramp sections. This is because the current charging or discharging $C_{P}$ is constant, resulting in a constant slope for the ramp—a phenomenon akin to slewing in operational amplifiers. Hence, the system is not strictly linear. To circumvent this issue, we approximate the output waveform as a ramp [Fig. 16.31(b)], establishing a linear relationship between $V_{\\text {out }}$ and $\\Delta \\phi$. In a sense, we approximate a discrete-time system with a continuous-time model.\n\nTo answer the second question, we recall that the transfer function is the Laplace transform of the impulse response, which requires us to apply a phase difference impulse and calculate $V_{\\text {out }}$ in the time domain. Since visualizing a phase difference impulse is challenging, we apply a phase difference step instead, obtain $V_{\\text {out }}$, and differentiate the result with respect to time.\n\nAssuming the input period is $T_{i n}$ and the charge pump supplies a current of $\\pm I_{P}$ to the capacitor, we start with a zero phase difference and, at $t=0$, step the phase of $B$ by $\\phi_{0}$, i.e., $\\Delta \\phi=\\phi_{0} u(t)$. As a result, $Q_{A}$ or $Q_{B}$ continues to produce pulses that are $\\phi_{0} T_{i n} /(2 \\pi)$ seconds wide, raising the output voltage by $\\left(I_{P} / C_{P}\\right) \\phi_{0} T_{i n} /(2 \\pi)$ in every period. Approximated by a ramp, $V_{\\text {out }}$ thus exhibits a slope of $\\left(I_{P} / C_{P}\\right) \\phi_{0} /(2 \\pi)$ and can be expressed as:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text {out }}(t)=\\frac{I_{P}}{2 \\pi C_{P}} t \\cdot \\phi_{0} u(t)\n$$\n\nThe impulse response is therefore given by:\n\n$$\nh(t)=\\frac{I_{P}}{2 \\pi C_{P}} u(t)\n$$\n\nyielding the transfer function:\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{\\text {out }}}{\\Delta \\phi}(s)=\\frac{I_{P}}{2 \\pi C_{P}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{s}\n$$\n\nConsequently, the PFD/CP/LPF combination contains a pole at the origin, a point of contrast to the $\\mathrm{PD} / \\mathrm{LPF}$ circuit used in the type I PLL. In analogy with the expression $K_{V C O} / s$, we call $I_{P} /\\left(2 \\pi C_{P}\\right)$ the \"gain\" of the PFD and denote it by $K_{P F D}$.\n\n#### Example 16.10\n\nSuppose the output quantity of interest in the circuit of Fig. 16.28 is the current injected by the charge pump into the capacitor. Determine the transfer function from $\\Delta \\phi$ to this current, $I_{\\text {out }}$.\n\n#### Solution\n\nSince $V_{\\text {out }}(s)=I_{\\text {out }} /\\left(C_{P} s\\right)$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\frac{I_{\\text {out }}}{\\Delta \\phi}(s)=\\frac{I_{P}}{2 \\pi}\n$$\n\nLet us now construct a linear model of charge-pump PLLs. Shown in Fig. 16.33, the model gives an open-loop transfer function:\n\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\Phi_{\\text {out }}}{\\Phi_{\\text {in }}}(s)\\right|_{\\mathrm{open}}=\\frac{I_{P}}{2 \\pi C_{P}} \\frac{K_{V C O}}{s^{2}}\n$$\n\nSince the loop gain has two poles at the origin, this topology is called a \"type II\" PLL. The closed-loop transfer function, denoted by $H(s)$ for the sake of brevity, is thus equal to:\n\n$$\nH(s)=\\frac{\\frac{I_{P} K_{V C O}}{2 \\pi C_{P}}}{s^{2}+\\frac{I_{P} K_{V C O}}{2 \\pi C_{P}}}\n$$\n\nThis result is alarming because the closed-loop system contains two imaginary poles at $s_{1,2}=$ $\\pm j \\sqrt{I_{P} K_{V C O} /\\left(2 \\pi C_{P}\\right)}$ and is therefore unstable. The instability arises because the loop gain has only two poles at the origin (i.e., two ideal integrators). As shown in Fig. 16.34(a), each integrator contributes a constant phase shift of $90^{\\circ}$, allowing the system to oscillate at the gain crossover frequency.\nimage_name:Figure 16.33 Linear model of simple charge-pump PLL\ndescription:The block diagram represents a simple charge-pump Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) system, composed of several key components:\n\n1. **Main Components:**\n- **Phase Frequency Detector (PFD):** This block receives the input phase signal \\( \\phi_{in} \\) and the feedback signal from the output \\( \\phi_{out} \\).

    "text": "Let's now proceed to build a PLL utilizing the circuit depicted in Fig. 16.28. As shown in Fig. 16.30, this specific design is referred to as a charge-pump PLL, which detects input and output transitions to sense phase or frequency discrepancies and activates the charge pump accordingly. Upon activation, the output frequency $\\omega_{\\text {out }}$ might be significantly different from the input frequency $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$, but the phase frequency detector (PFD) and the charge pump adjust the control voltage to bring $\\omega_{\\text {out }}$ closer to $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$. Once the frequencies are nearly equivalent, the PFD functions as a phase detector to achieve phase lock. The loop is considered locked when the phase difference is reduced to zero, at which point the charge pump becomes less active.\n\nNotably, the PFD/CP/LPF system exhibits infinite gain, meaning any non-zero phase difference between $\\phi_{\\text {in }}$ and $\\phi_{\\text {out }}$ leads to an indefinite accumulation of charge on $C_{P}$. In a locked charge-pump PLL, the control voltage $V_{\\text {cont }}$ is finite, which necessitates an input phase error of exactly zero. This is in contrast to the type I PLL, where the phase error is finite and dependent on the output frequency.\n\nThe circuit depicted in Fig. 16.30 is a basic charge-pump PLL, incorporating a phase frequency detector, a charge pump, and a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO).

Consequently, the charge pump is idle, and $C_{P}$ maintains a steady control voltage. However, this does not imply that the PFD and the CP are redundant. If $V_{\\text {cont }}$ remains constant for an extended period, the VCO's frequency and phase may drift. In particular, noise sources within the VCO can induce random frequency fluctuations, potentially leading to a substantial phase error accumulation. The PFD then identifies the phase discrepancy and produces a corrective pulse on $Q_{A}$ or $Q_{B}$, adjusting the VCO frequency through the charge pump and filter. This confirms our earlier statement that the PLL reacts to the excess phase of waveforms. We also note that since phase comparison occurs in every cycle in Fig. 16.30, the VCO phase and frequency are unlikely to drift substantially.\n\nTo analyze the dynamics of CPPLL, we develop a linear model for the PFD, charge pump, and low-pass filter combination, thereby deriving the transfer function.

    "text": "We will now build a charge-pump Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) based on the circuit depicted in Fig. 16.28. As illustrated in Fig. 16.30, this particular design is known as a charge-pump PLL. It operates by monitoring the transitions at both the input and output, detecting any discrepancies in phase or frequency, and subsequently modulating the charge pump accordingly. Upon activation of the loop, the output frequency, $\\omega_{\\text {out }}$, might significantly deviate from the input frequency, $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$. However, the Phase Frequency Detector (PFD) and the charge pump work in tandem to adjust the control voltage, thereby bridging the gap between $\\omega_{\\text {out }}$ and $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$. When the frequencies of the input and output signals converge to a sufficiently close proximity, the PFD functions primarily as a phase detector, ensuring phase lock. The loop achieves lock when the phase discrepancy is reduced to nil, causing the charge pump to enter a state of relative inactivity.\n\nIt has been previously noted that the PFD/CP/LPF assembly boasts an infinite gain, meaning any non-zero, deterministic discrepancy between $\\phi_{\\text {in }}$ and $\\phi_{\\text {out }}$ results in an indefinite accumulation of charge on $C_{P}$. What implications does this characteristic hold for a charge-pump PLL? When the loop represented in Fig. 16.30 achieves lock, the control voltage, $V_{\\text {cont }}$, is finite. Consequently, the input phase error must be precisely zero. This is in stark contrast to the Type I PLL, where the phase error is finite and dependent on the output frequency.\n\nThe accompanying circuit, as shown in Fig. 16.30, is a straightforward charge-pump PLL, complete with a phase frequency detector, a charge pump, and a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). The input phase is constantly compared with the output phase to govern the VCO frequency.\n\nTo further our understanding of the PLL's operation as depicted in Fig. 16.30, let's momentarily disregard the brief reset pulses on $Q_{A}$ and $Q_{B}$, and assume that once $\\phi_{\\text {out }}-\\phi_{\\text {in }}$ diminishes to zero, the PFD yields $Q_{A}=Q_{B}=0$. Consequently, the charge pump remains dormant, allowing $C_{P}$ to maintain a steady control voltage. One might question the ongoing necessity of the PFD and the CP in this scenario. If $V_{\\text {cont }}$ remains constant over an extended period, the VCO's frequency and phase may begin to drift. Notably, the noise inherent in the VCO can introduce random fluctuations in the oscillation frequency, potentially leading to a substantial phase error accumulation. The PFD, upon detecting this phase discrepancy, generates a corrective pulse on $Q_{A}$ or $Q_{B}$, which, via the charge pump and the filter, adjusts the VCO frequency. This underscores the earlier assertion that the PLL reacts exclusively to the surplus phase of waveforms. Additionally, since phase comparison occurs in every cycle in Fig. 16.30, the VCO's phase and frequency are precluded from significant drift.\n\nTo quantify the behavior of charge-pump PLLs, we develop a linear model incorporating the PFD, the charge pump, and the low-pass filter, thereby deriving the transfer function. This leads us to pose two questions: (1) Is the PFD/CP/LPF assembly in Fig. 16.28 a linear system? (2) If it is, how can its transfer function be determined?\n\nTo address the first question, we subject the system to a linearity test. For instance, as depicted in Fig. 16.31(a), we double the input phase difference and observe whether $V_{\\text {out }}$ doubles accordingly. It is intriguing to note that while the flat segments of $V_{\\text {out }}$ double, the ramp segments do not. The reason lies in the constant current charging or discharging $C_{P}$, which results in a constant slope for the ramp—an effect analogous to slewing in operational amplifiers. Thus, the system is not strictly linear. To circumvent this issue, we approximate the output waveform as a ramp [Fig. 16.31(b)], establishing a linear relationship between $V_{\\text {out }}$ and $\\Delta \\phi$. In essence, we approximate a discrete-time system using a continuous-time model.\n\nTo answer the second question, we recall that the transfer function is the Laplace transform of the impulse response, necessitating the application of a phase difference impulse and the subsequent calculation of $V_{\\text {out }}$ in the time domain. Since a phase difference impulse is challenging to visualize, we employ a phase difference step, derive $V_{\\text {out }}$, and differentiate the result with respect to time.\n\nSuppose the input period is $T_{i n}$ and the charge pump supplies a current of $\\pm I_{P}$ to the capacitor. As depicted in Fig. 16.32, we initiate with a zero phase difference and, at $t=0$, abruptly shift the phase of $B$ by $\\phi_{0}$, i.e., $\\Delta \\phi=\\phi_{0} u(t)$. Consequently, $Q_{A}$ or $Q_{B}$ persists in generating pulses that are $\\phi_{0} T_{i n} /(2 \\pi)$ seconds wide, elevating the output voltage by $\\left(I_{P} / C_{P}\\right) \\phi_{0} T_{i n} /(2 \\pi)$ during each period. Approximated by a ramp, $V_{\\text {out }}$ thus exhibits a slope of $\\left(I_{P} / C_{P}\\right) \\phi_{0} /(2 \\pi)$ and can be expressed as:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text {out }}(t)=\\frac{I_{P}}{2 \\pi C_{P}} t \\cdot \\phi_{0} u(t) \\tag{16.37}\n$$\n\nThe impulse response is therefore given by:\n\n$$\nh(t)=\\frac{I_{P}}{2 \\pi C_{P}} u(t) \\tag{16.38}\n$$\n\nyielding the transfer function:\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{\\text {out }}}{\\Delta \\phi}(s)=\\frac{I_{P}}{2 \\pi C_{P}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{s} \\tag{16.39}\n$$\n\nHence, the PFD/CP/LPF assembly possesses a pole at the origin, differing from the $\\mathrm{PD} / \\mathrm{LPF}$ circuit employed in the Type I PLL. Analogous to the expression $K_{V C O} / s$, we refer to $I_{P} /\\left(2 \\pi C_{P}\\right)$ as the \"gain\" of the PFD and denote it by $K_{P F D}$.\n\n#### Example 16.10\n\nSuppose the output quantity of interest in the circuit of Fig. 16.28 is the current injected by the charge pump into the capacitor. Determine the transfer function from $\\Delta \\phi$ to this current, $I_{\\text {out }}$.\n\n#### Solution\n\nSince $V_{\\text {out }}(s)=I_{\\text {out }} /\\left(C_{P} s\\right)$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\frac{I_{\\text {out }}}{\\Delta \\phi}(s)=\\frac{I_{P}}{2 \\pi} \\tag{16.40}\n$$\n\nWe now proceed to construct a linear model of charge-pump PLLs. As depicted in Fig. 16.33, this model yields an open-loop transfer function:\n\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\Phi_{\\text {out }}}{\\Phi_{\\text {in }}}(s)\\right|_{\\mathrm{open}}=\\frac{I_{P}}{2 \\pi C_{P}} \\frac{K_{V C O}}{s^{2}} \\tag{16.41}\n$$\n\nGiven that the loop gain features two poles at the origin, this topology is classified as a \"type II\" PLL. The closed-loop transfer function, denoted by $H(s)$ for brevity, is thus expressed as:\n\n$$\nH(s)=\\frac{\\frac{I_{P} K_{V C O}}{2 \\pi C_{P}}}{s^{2}+\\frac{I_{P} K_{V C O}}{2 \\pi C_{P}}} \\tag{16.42}\n$$\n\nThis result is disconcerting because the closed-loop system harbors two imaginary poles at $s_{1,2}=$ $\\pm j \\sqrt{I_{P} K_{V C O} /\\left(2 \\pi C_{P}\\right)}$ and is, therefore, unstable. The instability stems from the loop gain's possession of only two poles at the origin (i.e., two ideal integrators). As demonstrated in Fig. 16.34(a), each integrator contributes a constant phase shift of $90^{\\circ}$, enabling the system to oscillate at the gain crossover frequency.\n\nTo stabilize the system, we must alter the phase characteristic such that the phase shift is less than $180^{\\circ}$ at the gain crossover. As demonstrated in Fig. 16.34(b), this is achieved by introducing a zero in the loop gain, i.e., by incorporating a resistor in series with the loop filter capacitor (Fig. 16.35). Utilizing the result of Example 16.10, the reader can verify (Problem 16.11) that the PFD/CP/LPF now exhibits the transfer function:\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{\\text {out }}}{\\Delta \\phi}(s)=\\frac{I_{P}}{2 \\pi}\\left(R_{P}+\\frac{1}{C_{P} S}\\right) \\tag{16.43}\n$$\n\nConsequently, the PLL open-loop transfer function is expressed as:\n\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\Phi_{\\text {out }}}{\\Phi_{\\text {in }}}(s)\\right|_{\\text {open }}=\\frac{I_{P}}{2 \\pi}\\left(R_{P}+\\frac{1}{C_{P} s}\\right) \\frac{K_{V C O}}{s} \\tag{16.44}\n$$\n\nand hence:\n\n$$\nH(s)=\\frac{\\frac{I_{P} K_{V C O}}{2 \\pi C_{P}}\\left(R_{P} C_{P} s+1\\right)}{s^{2}+\\frac{I_{P}}{2 \\pi} K_{V C O} R_{P} s+\\frac{I_{P}}{2 \\pi C_{P}} K_{V C O}} \\tag{16.45}\n$$\n\nThe closed-loop system now includes a zero at $s_{z}=-1 /\\left(R_{P} C_{P}\\right)$. Adopting the same notation as used for the Type I PLL, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\omega_{n} & =\\sqrt{\\frac{I_{P} K_{V C O}}{2 \\pi C_{P}}}  \\tag{16.46}\\\\\n\\zeta & =\\frac{R_{P}}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{I_{P} C_{P} K_{V C O}}{2 \\pi}} \\tag{16.47}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nAs anticipated, if $R_{P}=0$, then $\\zeta=0$. With complex poles, the decay time constant is given by $1 /\\left(\\zeta \\omega_{n}\\right)=$ $4 \\pi /\\left(R_{P} I_{P} K_{V C O}\\right)$.\n\nThe stability behavior of type II PLLs significantly diverges from that of type I PLLs. We initiate our analysis with the Bode plots of the loop gain (the loop transmission) [Eq. (16.44)]. As depicted in Fig. 16.36, these plots suggest that a decrease in $I_{P} K_{V C O}$ causes the gain crossover frequency to shift towards the origin, diminishing the phase margin. This trend, as predicted by (16.47), stands in stark contrast to that expressed by (16.18) and illustrated in Fig. 16.19.\n\nIt is also feasible to construct the root locus of the closed-loop system in the complex plane. For $I_{P} K_{V C O}=0$ (e.g., $I_{P}=0$ ), the loop is open and both poles reside at the origin. For $I_{P} K_{V C O}>0$, we have $s_{1,2}=-\\zeta \\omega_{n} \\pm \\omega_{n} \\sqrt{\\zeta^{2}-1}$, and, since $\\zeta \\propto \\sqrt{I_{P} K_{V C O}}$, the poles are complex if $I_{P} K_{V C O}$ is small. The reader can verify (Problem 16.14) that as $I_{P} K_{V C O}$ increases, $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ traverse a circle centered at $\\sigma=-1 /\\left(R_{P} C_{P}\\right)$ with a radius $1 /\\left(R_{P} C_{P}\\right)$ (Fig. 16.37). The poles rejoin the real axis at $\\zeta=1$, assuming a value of $-2 /\\left(R_{P} C_{P}\\right)$. For $\\zeta>1$, the poles remain real, one approaching $-1 /\\left(R_{P} C_{P}\\right)$ and the other moving towards negative infinity as $I_{P} K_{V C O} \\rightarrow+\\infty$. Since for complex $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}, \\zeta=\\cos \\psi$, we observe that as $I_{P} K_{V C O}$ exceeds zero, the system attains greater stability.\n\n#### Example 16.11\n\nA student, upon examining the Bode plots in Fig. 16.36, notes that at $\\omega_{1}$, the loop gain surpasses unity and the phase shift is $-180^{\\circ}$. The student then concludes that the PLL must oscillate at this frequency! Explain the flaw in this reasoning.\n\n#### Solution\n\nThe phase shift is, in reality, slightly less than zero unless $\\omega_{1}=0$. As explained using Nyquist's approach in Chapter 10, a system comprising two integrators and one zero does not oscillate.\n\nThe compensated type II PLL of Fig. 16.35 is not without its drawbacks. Since the charge pump drives the series combination of $R_{P}$ and $C_{P}$, each instance of current injection into the loop filter results in a significant voltage surge at the control voltage. Even when the loop is locked, discrepancies between $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$, as well as the charge injection and clock feedthrough of $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$, introduce voltage spikes in $V_{\\text {cont }}$. The resulting ripple severely disrupts the VCO, compromising the output phase. To mitigate this issue, a second capacitor is typically added in parallel with $R_{P}$ and $C_{P}$ (Fig. 16.38), damping the initial step. The loop filter is now of second order, resulting in a third-order PLL and introducing additional stability challenges [4]. Nonetheless, if $C_{2}$ is approximately one-fifth to one-tenth of $C_{P}$, the closed-loop time and frequency responses remain relatively unaffected.\n\nEquation (16.47) suggests that the loop's stability improves with increasing $R_{P}$. In practice, as $R_{P}$ grows excessively large, stability deteriorates once more. This effect is not accounted for by the preceding derivations because we have approximated the discrete-time system with a continuous-time loop. A more precise analysis is presented in [2], but simulations are often essential to ascertain the stability bounds of CPPLLs."

As illustrated in Fig. 16.30, this specific PLL design, known as a charge-pump PLL, detects phase or frequency discrepancies between the input and output by sensing their transitions. It then modulates the charge pump accordingly. Upon activation of the loop, the output frequency, $\\omega_{\\text {out }}$, may significantly differ from the input frequency, $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$. The Phase Frequency Detector (PFD) and the charge pump collaborate to modify the control voltage, gradually aligning $\\omega_{\\text {out }}$ with $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$. When the frequencies of input and output converge sufficiently, the PFD functions as a phase detector, executing phase lock. The loop achieves lock when the phase discrepancy diminishes to zero, and the charge pump assumes a dormant state.\n\nAs previously discussed, the PFD/CP/LPF assembly exhibits infinite gain; that is, any non-zero, deterministic discrepancy between $\\phi_{\\text {in }}$ and $\\phi_{\\text {out }}$ precipitates an unbounded accumulation of charge on $C_{\\text {P}}$. What are the implications of this characteristic within a charge-pump PLL? When the loop represented in Fig. 16.30 is in a locked state, the control voltage, $V_{\\text {cont }}$, is finite. Consequently, the input phase error must be precisely zero. This differs from the type I PLL, where the phase error is finite and dependent on the output frequency.\n\nThe described circuit is a basic charge-pump PLL incorporating a phase frequency detector, charge pump, and voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). It synchronizes the input phase with the output phase to govern the VCO frequency.\n\nFor a deeper understanding of the PLL's operation in Fig. 16.30, let's disregard the brief reset pulses on $Q_{A}$ and $Q_{B}$ and presume that once $\\phi_{\\text {out }}-\\phi_{\\text {in }}$ reaches zero, the PFD outputs $Q_{A}=Q_{B}=0$. Consequently, the charge pump becomes inactive, and $C_{\\text {P}}$ maintains a steady control voltage. Does this imply that the PFD and CP are redundant post-lock? If $V_{\\text {cont }}$ remains constant over an extended period, the VCO's frequency and phase may commence drifting. Notably, noise within the VCO can induce erratic fluctuations in the oscillation frequency, potentially leading to a substantial phase error accumulation. The PFD then identifies the phase discrepancy and emits a corrective pulse on $Q_{A}$ or $Q_{B}$, adjusting the VCO frequency via the charge pump and filter. This validates our earlier assertion that the PLL reacts exclusively to the surplus phase of waveforms. We also observe that, since phase comparison occurs in each cycle in Fig. 16.30, the VCO's phase and frequency are prevented from drifting substantially.\n\nIn order to quantify the dynamics of charge-pump PLLs, we devise a linear model that encapsulates the PFD, charge pump, and low-pass filter, thereby deriving the transfer function. We pose two inquiries: (1) Is the PFD/CP/LPF assembly in Fig. 16.28 a linear system? (2) If affirmative, how can its transfer function be computed?\n\nTo address the first question, we evaluate the system's linearity. For instance, as depicted in Fig. 16.31(a), we double the input phase discrepancy and observe if $V_{\\text {out }}$ doubles accordingly. Notably, the flat segments of $V_{\\text {out }}$ double, but not the ramp segments. This is because the current charging or discharging $C_{\\text {P}}$ is constant, resulting in a constant slope for the ramp—a phenomenon akin to slewing in operational amplifiers. Thus, the system is not strictly linear. To circumvent this issue, we approximate the output waveform as a ramp [Fig. 16.31(b)], establishing a linear relationship between $V_{\\text {out }}$ and $\\Delta \\phi$. Effectively, we approximate a discrete-time system using a continuous-time model.\n\nTo answer the second question, we recall that the transfer function is the Laplace transform of the impulse response, necessitating the application of a phase difference impulse and the calculation of $V_{\\text {out }}$ in the time domain. Given the difficulty of visualizing a phase difference impulse, we employ a phase difference step, derive $V_{\\text {out }}$, and differentiate the result with respect to time.\n\nAssuming the input period is $T_{i n}$ and the charge pump supplies a current of $\\pm I_{P}$ to the capacitor, as illustrated in Fig. 16.32, we initiate with a zero phase discrepancy and, at $t=0$, introduce a phase step of $\\phi_{0}$ in $B$, i.e., $\\Delta \\phi=\\phi_{0} u(t)$. Consequently, $Q_{A}$ or $Q_{B}$ generates pulses that are $\\phi_{0} T_{i n} /(2 \\pi)$ seconds wide, elevating the output voltage by $\\left(I_{P} / C_{\\text {P}}\\right) \\phi_{0} T_{i n} /(2 \\pi)$ during each period. Approximating as a ramp, $V_{\\text {out }}$ exhibits a slope of $\\left(I_{P} / C_{\\text {P}}\\right) \\phi_{0} /(2 \\pi)$ and can be expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {out }}(t)=\\frac{I_{P}}{2 \\pi C_{P}} t \\cdot \\phi_{0} u(t) \\tag{16.37}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFigure 16.31 (a) depicts the linearity test for a PFD/CP/LPF assembly. The graph is a time-domain waveform illustrating two pulse signals, labeled A and B, and the resultant output voltage, \\( V_{out} \\), over time \\( t \\). The graph on the left exhibits a smaller phase discrepancy \\( \\Delta \\phi \\) between A and B, yielding smaller voltage steps in \\( V_{out} \\). Conversely, the graph on the right portrays a larger phase discrepancy \\( 2\\Delta \\phi \\), resulting in larger voltage steps in \\( V_{out} \\).\n\nFigure 16.31 (b) illustrates the ramp approximation of the response from a PFD, CP, and LPF combination. The graph is a time-domain waveform representing the stepwise increasing output voltage \\( V_{out} \\) with a consistent upward trend, indicating a positive slope that approximates a continuous ramp.\n\nFigure 16.32 portrays the step response of a PFD/CP/LPF combination. The graph illustrates the behavior of a PFD, CP, and LPF assembly, depicting various signals involved in the system over time.\n\nFigure 16.33 represents a linear model of a simple charge-pump PLL. The block diagram delineates a PLL system composed of a phase frequency detector, charge pump, and voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). The input phase is compared to the output phase to regulate the VCO frequency.\n\nFigure 16.34 (a) exhibits the loop gain characteristics of a simple charge-pump PLL. The Bode plot comprises two separate graphs: the magnitude plot and the phase plot. The magnitude plot reveals a consistent slope indicative of a second-order system, while the phase plot shows a constant phase of \\(-180^{\\circ}\\).\n\nFigure 16.34 (b) illustrates the loop gain characteristics of a charge-pump PLL with the incorporation of a zero. The Bode plot demonstrates the improved stability and phase margin resulting from the addition of the zero.\n\nFigure 16.35 depicts a charge-pump phase-locked loop (PLL) circuit designed to stabilize the output frequency by modulating the control voltage at node X, influenced by the charge-pump action of I1, I2, S1, and S2.\n\nFigure 16.36 is a Bode plot analyzing the stability of a charge-pump PLL as the product of $I_{P}$ and $K_{VCO}$ varies. The magnitude plot exhibits a decreasing trend with a slope change at a specific frequency, $\\omega_1$. The phase plot shows a phase shift that approaches \\(-180^{\\circ}\\).\n\nFigure 16.37 is a root locus plot for a type II PLL system. The plot illustrates the movement of poles in the complex plane as system parameters change, providing insights into the system's stability characteristics.\n\nFigure 16.38 portrays a phase-locked loop (PLL) with a third-order loop filter designed to enhance stability. It utilizes current sources and switches to control the voltage across RP, CP, and C2, thereby governing the VCO output."

(2) If it is, how can we compute its transfer function?\n\nTo address the first question, we assess the system's linearity. For instance, as depicted in Fig. 16.31(a), we double the input phase difference and observe if $V_{\\text {out }}$ doubles accordingly. Notably, the flat segments of $V_{\\text {out }}$ double, but the ramp segments do not. Since the current charging or discharging $C_{P}$ is constant, the ramp exhibits a constant slope—an effect akin to slewing in operational amplifiers. Hence, the system is not strictly linear.

In a sense, we approximate a discrete-time system using a continuous-time model.\n\nTo answer the second question, we recall that the transfer function is the Laplace transform of the impulse response, which requires us to apply a phase difference impulse and compute $V_{\\text {out }}$ in the time domain.

Consequently, $Q_{A}$ or $Q_{B}$ continues to generate pulses that are $\\phi_{0} T_{i n} /(2 \\pi)$ seconds wide, increasing the output voltage by $\\left(I_{P} / C_{P}\\right) \\phi_{0} T_{i n} /(2 \\pi)$ during each period.

The instability stems from the loop gain having only two poles at the origin (i.e., two ideal integrators). As shown in Fig. 16.34(a), each integrator contributes a constant phase shift of $90^{\\circ}$, enabling the system to oscillate at the gain crossover frequency."

The charge pump then remains idle, and $C_{P}$ maintains a constant control voltage. Does this mean that the PFD and the CP are no longer needed? If $V_{\\text {cont }}$ remains constant for a long time, the VCO frequency and phase may start to drift. In particular, noise sources in the VCO can cause random variations in the oscillation frequency, leading to a significant accumulation of phase error. The PFD then detects the phase difference and produces a corrective pulse on $Q_{A}$ or $Q_{B}$ to adjust the VCO frequency through the charge pump and the filter. This is why we previously stated that the PLL responds only to the excess phase of waveforms. We also note that, since phase comparison is performed in every cycle in Fig. 16.30, the VCO phase and frequency cannot drift substantially.\n\nTo quantify the behavior of charge-pump PLLs, we develop a linear model for the PFD, charge pump, and low-pass filter, obtaining the transfer function. We raise two questions: (1) Is the PFD/CP/LPF combination in Fig. 16.28 a linear system? (2) If so, how can its transfer function be computed?\n\nTo answer the first question, we test the system for linearity. For example, as shown in Fig. 16.31(a), we double the input phase difference and observe if $V_{\\text {out }}$ exactly doubles. Interestingly, the flat sections of $V_{\\text {out }}$ double, but not the ramp sections. After all, the current charging or discharging $C_{P}$ is constant, yielding a constant slope for the ramp-an effect similar to slewing in op amps. Thus, the system is not linear in the strict sense. To overcome this issue, we approximate the output waveform by a ramp [Fig. 16.31(b)], arriving at a linear relationship between $V_{\\text {out }}$ and $\\Delta \\phi$. In a sense, we approximate a discrete-time system by a continuous-time model.\n\nTo answer the second question, we recall that the transfer function is the Laplace transform of the impulse response, requiring that we apply a phase difference impulse and compute $V_{\\text {out }}$ in the time domain. Since a phase difference impulse is difficult to visualize, we apply a phase difference step, obtain $V_{\\text {out }}$, and differentiate the result with respect to time.\n\nLet's assume that the input period is $T_{i n}$ and the charge pump provides a current of $\\pm I_{P}$ to the capacitor. As shown in Fig. 16.32, we start with a zero phase difference and, at $t=0$, step the phase of $B$ by $\\phi_{0}$, i.e., $\\Delta \\phi=\\phi_{0} u(t)$. As a result, $Q_{A}$ or $Q_{B}$ continues to produce pulses that are $\\phi_{0} T_{i n} /(2 \\pi)$ seconds wide, raising the output voltage by $\\left(I_{P} / C_{P}\\right) \\phi_{0} T_{i n} /(2 \\pi)$ in every period. Approximated by a ramp, $V_{\\text {out }}$ thus exhibits a slope of $\\left(I_{P} / C_{P}\\right) \\phi_{0} /(2 \\pi)$ and can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {out }}(t)=\\frac{I_{P}}{2 \\pi C_{P}} t \\cdot \\phi_{0} u(t) \\tag{16.37}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe impulse response is therefore given by:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nh(t)=\\frac{I_{P}}{2 \\pi C_{P}} u(t) \\tag{16.38}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nyielding the transfer function:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{V_{\\text {out }}}{\\Delta \\phi}(s)=\\frac{I_{P}}{2 \\pi C_{P}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{s} \\tag{16.39}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nConsequently, the PFD/CP/LPF combination contains a pole at the origin, a point of contrast to the $\\mathrm{PD} / \\mathrm{LPF}$ circuit used in the type I PLL. In analogy with the expression $K_{V C O} / s$, we call $I_{P} /\\left(2 \\pi C_{P}\\right)$ the \"gain\" of the PFD and denote it by $K_{P F D}$.\n\nLet us now construct a linear model of charge-pump PLLs.

The closed-loop transfer function, denoted by $H(s)$ for the sake of brevity, is thus equal to:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nH(s)=\\frac{\\frac{I_{P} K_{V C O}}{2 \\pi C_{P}}}{s^{2}+\\frac{I_{P} K_{V C O}}{2 \\pi C_{P}}} \\tag{16.42}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis result is alarming because the closed-loop system contains two imaginary poles at $s_{1,2}=$ $\\pm j \\sqrt{I_{P} K_{V C O} /\\left(2 \\pi C_{P}\\right)}$ and is therefore unstable. The instability arises because the loop gain has only two poles at the origin (i.e., two ideal integrators). As shown in Fig. 16.34(a), each integrator contributes a constant phase shift of $90^{\\circ}$, allowing the system to oscillate at the gain crossover frequency.\n\nIn order to stabilize the system, we must modify the phase characteristic such that the phase shift is less than $180^{\\circ}$ at the gain crossover. As shown in Fig. 16.34(b), this is accomplished by introducing a zero in the loop gain, i.e., by adding a resistor in series with the loop filter capacitor (Fig. 16.35). Using the result of Example 16.10, the reader can prove (Problem 16.11) that the PFD/CP/LPF now has a transfer function:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{V_{\\text {out }}}{\\Delta \\phi}(s)=\\frac{I_{P}}{2 \\pi}\\left(R_{P}+\\frac{1}{C_{P} S}\\right) \\tag{16.43}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIt follows that the PLL open-loop transfer function is equal to:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left.\\frac{\\Phi_{\\text {out }}}{\\Phi_{\\text {in }}}(s)\\right|_{\\text {open }}=\\frac{I_{P}}{2 \\pi}\\left(R_{P}+\\frac{1}{C_{P} s}\\right) \\frac{K_{V C O}}{s} \\tag{16.44}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand hence:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nH(s)=\\frac{\\frac{I_{P} K_{V C O}}{2 \\pi C_{P}}\\left(R_{P} C_{P} s+1\\right)}{s^{2}+\\frac{I_{P}}{2 \\pi} K_{V C O} R_{P} s+\\frac{I_{P}}{2 \\pi C_{P}} K_{V C O}} \\tag{16.45}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe closed-loop system contains a zero at $s_{z}=-1 /\\left(R_{P} C_{P}\\right)$. Using the same notation as that for the type I PLL, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\omega_{n} & =\\sqrt{\\frac{I_{P} K_{V C O}}{2 \\pi C_{P}}}  \\tag{16.46}\\\\\n\\zeta & =\\frac{R_{P}}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{I_{P} C_{P} K_{V C O}}{2 \\pi}} \\tag{16.47}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nAs expected, if $R_{P}=0$, then $\\zeta=0$. With complex poles, the decay time constant is given by $1 /\\left(\\zeta \\omega_{n}\\right)=$ $4 \\pi /\\left(R_{P} I_{P} K_{V C O}\\right)$.\n\nThe stability behavior of type II PLLs is quite different from that of type I PLLs. We begin the analysis with the Bode plots of the loop gain (the loop transmission) [Eq. (16.44)]. Shown in Fig. 16.36, these plots suggest that if $I_{P} K_{V C O}$ decreases, the gain crossover frequency moves toward the origin, degrading the phase margin. Predicted by (16.47), this trend is in sharp contrast to that expressed by (16.18) and illustrated in Fig. 16.19.\n\nIt is also possible to construct the root locus of the closed-loop system in the complex plane. For $I_{P} K_{V C O}=0$ (e.g., $I_{P}=0$ ), the loop is open and both poles lie at the origin. For $I_{P} K_{V C O}>0$, we have $s_{1,2}=-\\zeta \\omega_{n} \\pm \\omega_{n} \\sqrt{\\zeta^{2}-1}$, and, since $\\zeta \\propto \\sqrt{I_{P} K_{V C O}}$, the poles are complex if $I_{P} K_{V C O}$ is small. The reader can prove (Problem 16.14) that as $I_{P} K_{V C O}$ increases, $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ move on a circle centered at $\\sigma=-1 /\\left(R_{P} C_{P}\\right)$ with a radius $1 /\\left(R_{P} C_{P}\\right)$ (Fig. 16.37). The poles return to the real axis at $\\zeta=1$, assuming a value of $-2 /\\left(R_{P} C_{P}\\right)$. For $\\zeta>1$, the poles remain real, one approaching $-1 /\\left(R_{P} C_{P}\\right)$ and the other going to $-\\infty$ as $I_{P} K_{V C O} \\rightarrow+\\infty$. Since for complex $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}, \\zeta=\\cos \\psi$, we observe that as $I_{P} K_{V C O}$ exceeds zero, the system becomes more stable.\n\nA student considers the Bode plots in Fig. 16.36 and observes that at $\\omega_{1}$, the loop gain exceeds unity and the phase shift is $-180^{\\circ}$. The student then reasons that the PLL must oscillate at this frequency! Explain the flaw in this reasoning.\n\nThe phase shift is in fact slightly less than zero unless $\\omega_{1}=0$. As explained using Nyquist's approach in Chapter 10, a system containing two integrators and one zero does not oscillate.\n\nThe compensated type II PLL of Fig. 16.35 suffers from a critical drawback. Since the charge pump drives the series combination of $R_{P}$ and $C_{P}$, each time a current is injected into the loop filter, the control voltage experiences a large jump. Even in the locked condition, the mismatches between $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ and the charge injection and clock feedthrough of $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ introduce voltage jumps in $V_{\\text {cont }}$. The resulting ripple severely disturbs the VCO, corrupting the output phase. To relax this issue, a second capacitor is usually added in parallel with $R_{P}$ and $C_{P}$ (Fig. 16.38), suppressing the initial step. The loop filter now is of second order, yielding a third-order PLL and creating stability difficulties [4]. Nonetheless, if $C_{2}$ is about one-fifth to one-tenth of $C_{P}$, the closed-loop time and frequency responses remain relatively unchanged.\n\nEquation (16.47) implies that the loop becomes more stable as $R_{P}$ increases. In reality, as $R_{P}$ becomes very large, the stability degrades again. This effect is not predicted by the foregoing derivations because we have approximated the discrete-time system by a continuous-time loop. A more accurate analysis is given in [2], but simulations are often necessary to determine the stability bounds of CPPLLs."

    "text": "Several flaws within the PFD/CP circuit result in substantial ripple in the control voltage, even when the loop is in a locked state. As previously discussed, this ripple modulates the VCO frequency, causing the waveform to lose its periodic nature. We will examine these non-idealities in this section.\n\nThe PFD depicted in Fig. 16.24(a) produces narrow, simultaneous pulses on both $Q_{A}$ and $Q_{B}$, even when the input phase difference is zero. As shown in Fig. 16.39, when $A$ and $B$ rise at the same time, so do $Q_{A}$ and $Q_{B}$, triggering the reset. This means that even when the PLL is locked, $Q_{A}$ and $Q_{B}$ simultaneously activate the charge pump for a short duration $T_{P} \\approx 5 T_{D}$, where $T_{D}$ represents the gate delay (Example 16.8).\n\nWhat are the implications of the reset pulses on $Q_{A}$ and $Q_{B}$? To comprehend why these pulses are beneficial, let's consider a hypothetical PFD that doesn't generate pulses for a zero input phase difference [Fig. 16.40(a)]. How would such a PFD react to a minor phase error? As depicted in Fig. 16.40(b), the circuit produces very narrow pulses on $Q_{A}$ or $Q_{B}$. However, due to the finite rise and fall times caused by the capacitance at these nodes, the pulse may not have enough time to reach a logical high level and fail to activate the charge pump switches. In other words, if the input phase difference, $\\Delta \\phi$, falls below a certain value $\\phi_{0}$, then the output voltage of the PFD/CP/LPF combination is no longer a function of $\\Delta \\phi$. Since, as shown in Fig. 16.41, for $|\\Delta \\phi|<\\phi_{0}$ the charge pump injects no current, Eq. (16.41) suggests that the loop gain drops to zero and the output phase is not locked. We refer to this as the PFD/CP circuit having a dead zone equal to $\\pm \\phi_{0}$ around $\\Delta \\phi=0$.\n\nThe dead zone is highly undesirable since it permits the VCO to accumulate random phase error up to $\\phi_{0}$ relative to the input without receiving any corrective feedback. Consequently, as illustrated in Fig. 16.42, the zero crossing points of the VCO output experience significant random fluctuations, an effect known as \"jitter.\"\n\nInterestingly, the simultaneous pulses on $Q_{A}$ and $Q_{B}$ can eliminate the dead zone. This is because, for $\\Delta \\phi=0$, the pulses always activate the charge pump if they are wide enough. As a result, as shown in Fig. 16.43, a negligible increase in the phase difference leads to a proportional increase in the net current produced by the charge pump. In simpler terms, the dead zone disappears if $T_{P}$ is long enough to allow $Q_{A}$ and $Q_{B}$ to reach a valid logical level and activate the switches in the charge pump.\n\nWhile removing the dead zone, the reset pulses on $Q_{A}$ and $Q_{B}$ introduce other challenges. Let's first consider the charge pump implementation using MOS transistors [Fig. 16.44(a)]. Here, $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ function as current sources, and $M_{3}$ and $M_{4}$ as switches. The output $Q_{A}$ is inverted so that when it goes high, $M_{4}$ turns on.\n\nThe first issue in the circuit of Fig. 16.44(a) arises from the delay discrepancy between $\\overline{Q_{A}}$ and $Q_{B}$ in activating their respective switches. As shown in Fig. 16.44(b), the net current injected by the charge pump into the loop filter abruptly shifts to $+I_{P}$ and $-I_{P}$, perturbing the oscillator control voltage periodically, even if the loop is locked. To mitigate this effect, a complementary pass gate can be inserted between $Q_{B}$ and the gate of $M_{3}$, equalizing the delays [Fig. 16.44(c)].\n\nThe second issue in the CP of Fig. 16.44(c) concerns the mismatch between the drain currents of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$. As depicted in Fig. 16.45(a), even with perfect alignment of the UP and DOWN pulses, the net current generated by the charge pump is non-zero, altering $V_{\\text {cont }}$ by a constant increment at each phase comparison instant. How does the PLL react to this error? For the loop to stay locked, the average value of the control voltage must remain constant. The PLL, therefore, creates a phase error between the input and the output such that the net current injected by the CP in every cycle is zero [Fig. 16.45(b)]. The relationship between the current mismatch and the phase error is determined in Problem 16.12. It is important to note that (1) the control voltage still experiences a periodic ripple; (2) due to the low output impedance of short-channel MOSFETs, the current mismatch varies with the output voltage (i.e., with the VCO frequency); and (3) the clock feedthrough and charge injection mismatch between $M_{3}$ and $M_{4}$ further increase both the phase error and the ripple.\n\nThe third issue in the circuit of Fig. 16.44(c) stems from the finite capacitance observed at the drains of the current sources. Suppose, as illustrated in Fig. 16.46(a), $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ are off, allowing $M_{1}$ to discharge $X$ to ground and $M_{2}$ to charge $Y$ to $V_{D D}$. At the next phase comparison instant, both $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ turn on, $V_{X}$ rises, $V_{Y}$ falls, and $V_{X} \\approx V_{Y} \\approx V_{\\text {cont }}$ if the voltage drop across $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ is neglected [Fig. 16.46(b)]. If the phase error is zero and $I_{D 1}=\\left|I_{D 2}\\right|$, does $V_{\\text {cont }}$ remain constant after the switches turn on? Even if $C_{X}=C_{Y}$, the change in $V_{X}$ is not equal to that in $V_{Y}$. For instance, if $V_{\\text {cont }}$ is relatively high, $V_{X}$ changes by a large amount and $V_{Y}$ by a small amount. The discrepancy between the two changes must, therefore, be supplied by $C_{P}$, leading to a jump in $V_{\\text {cont }}$.\n\nThis charge-sharing phenomenon can be suppressed by \"bootstrapping.\" As illustrated in Fig. 16.47, the concept is to \"pin\" $V_{X}$ and $V_{Y}$ to $V_{c o n t}$ after phase comparison is complete. When $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ turn off, $S_{3}$ and $S_{4}$ turn on, enabling the unity-gain amplifier to hold nodes $X$ and $Y$ at a potential equal to $V_{\\text {cont }}$. Note that the amplifier does not need to provide much current because $I_{1} \\approx I_{2}$. At the next phase comparison instant, $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ turn on, $S_{3}$ and $S_{4}$ turn off, and $V_{X}$ and $V_{Y}$ begin with a value equal to $V_{c o n t}$. Consequently, no charge sharing occurs between $C_{P}$ and the capacitances at $X$ and $Y$."

As illustrated in Fig. 16.45(a), even with perfect alignment of the UP and DOWN pulses, the net current generated by the charge pump is non-zero, altering $V_{\\text {cont }}$ by a constant increment at each phase comparison instant. How does the PLL react to this error? To maintain lock, the average value of the control voltage must remain constant. Therefore, the PLL generates a phase error between the input and the output such that the net current injected by the CP in every cycle is zero (refer to Fig. 16.45(b)). The relationship between the current mismatch and the phase error is explored in Problem 16.12. It is crucial to note that (1) the control voltage still undergoes periodic ripple; (2) due to the low output impedance of short-channel MOSFETs, the current mismatch varies with the output voltage (i.e., with the VCO frequency); and (3) the clock feedthrough and charge injection mismatch between $M_{3}$ and $M_{4}$ further exacerbate both the phase error and the ripple.\n\nThe third issue in the circuit of Fig. 16.44(c) stems from the finite capacitance observed at the drains of the current sources. Consider, as illustrated in Fig. 16.46(a), that $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ are off, allowing $M_{1}$ to discharge $X$ to ground and $M_{2}$ to charge $Y$ to $V_{D D}$. At the next phase comparison instant, both $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ turn on, causing $V_{X}$ to rise, $V_{Y}$ to fall, and $V_{X} \\approx V_{Y} \\approx V_{\\text {cont }}$ if the voltage drop across $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ is negligible (refer to Fig. 16.46(b)). If the phase error is zero and $I_{D 1}=\\left|I_{D 2}\\right|$, does $V_{\\text {cont }}$ remain constant after the switches turn on? Even if $C_{X}=C_{Y}$, the change in $V_{X}$ is not equal to that in $V_{Y}$. For instance, if $V_{\\text {cont }}$ is relatively high, $V_{X}$ changes by a large amount and $V_{Y}$ by a small amount. The discrepancy between the two changes must therefore be compensated by $C_{P}$, resulting in a jump in $V_{\\text {cont }}$.\n\nThis charge-sharing phenomenon can be mitigated by \"bootstrapping.\" As shown in Fig. 16.47, the concept is to \"lock\" $V_{X}$ and $V_{Y}$ to $V_{c o n t}$ after phase comparison is complete. When $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ turn off, $S_{3}$ and $S_{4}$ turn on, enabling the unity-gain amplifier to maintain nodes $X$ and $Y$ at a potential equal to $V_{\\text {cont }}$. Note that the amplifier does not need to provide much current because $I_{1} \\approx I_{2}$. At the next phase comparison instant, $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ turn on, $S_{3}$ and $S_{4}$ turn off, and $V_{X}$ and $V_{Y}$ start with a value equal to $V_{c o n t}$. Thus, no charge sharing occurs between $C_{P}$ and the capacitances at $X$ and $Y$."

    "text": "The rephrased text:\n\nFlaws within the PFD/CP circuit result in significant control voltage ripple, even with a locked loop. As previously noted, this ripple modulates the VCO frequency, creating a waveform that is not periodic. We delve into these non-idealities in this section.\n\nThe PFD design in Fig. 16.24(a) produces narrow, simultaneous pulses on both $Q_{A}$ and $Q_{B}$, even when the input phase difference is zero. As shown in Fig. 16.39, if $A$ and $B$ rise together, $Q_{A}$ and $Q_{B}$ do the same, triggering the reset. This means that even when the PLL is locked, $Q_{A}$ and $Q_{B}$ simultaneously activate the charge pump for a short duration $T_{P} \\approx 5 T_{D}$, where $T_{D}$ is the gate delay (Example 16.8).\n\nWhat are the implications of the reset pulses on $Q_{A}$ and $Q_{B}$? To grasp why these pulses are beneficial, consider a theoretical PFD that generates no pulses for a zero input phase difference [Fig. 16.40(a)]. How would such a PFD react to a minor phase error? As depicted in Fig. 16.40(b), the circuit produces very narrow pulses on $Q_{A}$ or $Q_{B}$. However, due to the finite rise and fall times caused by the capacitance at these nodes, the pulse may not have enough time to reach a logical high level and activate the charge pump switches. In other words, if the input phase difference, $\\Delta \\phi$, falls below a certain threshold $\\phi_{0}$, then the output voltage of the PFD/CP/LPF combination is no longer a function of $\\Delta \\phi$. Since, as shown in Fig. 16.41, for $|\\Delta \\phi|<\\phi_{0}$ the charge pump injects no current, Eq. (16.41) suggests that the loop gain drops to zero and the output phase is not locked. We refer to this as the PFD/CP circuit having a dead zone equal to $\\pm \\phi_{0}$ around $\\Delta \\phi=0$.\n\nThe dead zone is highly undesirable because it permits the VCO to accumulate a random phase error of up to $\\phi_{0}$ with respect to the input while receiving no corrective feedback. Consequently, as illustrated in Fig. 16.42, the zero crossing points of the VCO output exhibit substantial random variations, an effect known as \"jitter.\"\n\nInterestingly, the simultaneous pulses on $Q_{A}$ and $Q_{B}$ can eliminate the dead zone. This is because, for $\\Delta \\phi=0$, the pulses always activate the charge pump if they are sufficiently wide. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 16.43, an infinitesimal increase in the phase difference results in a proportional increase in the net current produced by the charge pump. In other words, the dead zone disappears if $T_{P}$ is long enough to allow $Q_{A}$ and $Q_{B}$ to reach a valid logical level and activate the switches in the charge pump.\n\nHowever, while eliminating the dead zone, the reset pulses on $Q_{A}$ and $Q_{B}$ introduce other challenges. Let us initially consider the charge pump implementation using MOS transistors [Fig. 16.44(a)]. Here, $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ function as current sources, and $M_{3}$ and $M_{4}$ as switches. The output $Q_{A}$ is inverted so that when it goes high, $M_{4}$ turns on.\n\nThe first issue in the circuit of Fig. 16.44(a) arises from the delay discrepancy between $\\overline{Q_{A}}$ and $Q_{B}$ in activating their respective switches. As shown in Fig. 16.44(b), the net current injected by the charge pump into the loop filter jumps to $+I_{P}$ and $-I_{P}$, disturbing the oscillator control voltage periodically, even if the loop is locked. To mitigate this effect, a complementary pass gate can be inserted between $Q_{B}$ and the gate of $M_{3}$, equalizing the delays [Fig. 16.44(c)].\n\nThe second issue in the CP of Fig. 16.44(c) concerns the mismatch between the drain currents of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$. As shown in Fig. 16.45(a), even with perfect alignment of the UP and DOWN pulses, the net current produced by the charge pump is nonzero, changing $V_{\\text {cont }}$ by a constant increment at each phase comparison instant. How does the PLL react to this error? For the loop to remain locked, the average value of the control voltage must remain constant. The PLL therefore generates a phase error between the input and the output such that the net current injected by the CP in every cycle is zero [Fig. 16.45(b)]. The relationship between the current mismatch and the phase error is determined in Problem 16.12. It is essential to note that (1) the control voltage still experiences a periodic ripple; (2) due to the low output impedance of short-channel MOSFETs, the current mismatch varies with the output voltage (i.e., with the VCO frequency); and (3) the clock feedthrough and charge injection mismatch between $M_{3}$ and $M_{4}$ further increase both the phase error and the ripple.\n\nThe third issue in the circuit of Fig. 16.44(c) stems from the finite capacitance observed at the drains of the current sources. Suppose, as illustrated in Fig. 16.46(a), $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ are off, allowing $M_{1}$ to discharge $X$ to ground and $M_{2}$ to charge $Y$ to $V_{D D}$. At the next phase comparison instant, both $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ turn on, $V_{X}$ rises, $V_{Y}$ falls, and $V_{X} \\approx V_{Y} \\approx V_{\\text {cont }}$ if the voltage drop across $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ is ignored [Fig. 16.46(b)]. If the phase error is zero and $I_{D 1}=\\left|I_{D 2}\\right|$, does $V_{\\text {cont }}$ remain constant after the switches turn on? Even if $C_{X}=C_{Y}$, the change in $V_{X}$ is not equal to that in $V_{Y}$. For example, if $V_{\\text {cont }}$ is relatively high, $V_{X}$ changes by a large amount and $V_{Y}$ by a small amount. The difference between the two changes must therefore be supplied by $C_{P}$, leading to a jump in $V_{\\text {cont }}$."
