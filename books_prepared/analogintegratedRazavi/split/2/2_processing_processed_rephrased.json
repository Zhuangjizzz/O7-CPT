    "text": "Figure 2.2 illustrates a simplified layout of an $n$-type MOS (NMOS) device. Constructed on a $p$-type substrate, often referred to as the \"bulk\" or \"body,\" the device features two heavily-doped $n$ regions that constitute the source and drain terminals, a heavily-doped polysilicon segment (referred to as \"poly\") serving as the gate, and a slender layer of silicon dioxide ($\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$), known simply as \"oxide,\" which insulates the gate from the substrate. The device's functional activity occurs within the substrate region beneath the gate oxide. It is important to note that the structure exhibits symmetry with respect to S and D.\n\nImage Description: The image portrays the configuration of a Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) device, specifically highlighting the arrangement and interconnections of its components. The key elements visible in the diagram include:\n\n1. **Source (S) and Drain (D) Regions:** These are heavily-doped n+ regions, located on the left and right sides of the diagram, respectively. They serve as the entry and exit points for current within the device.\n\n2. **Gate (G):** A segment of heavily-doped polysilicon, labeled 'Poly' in the diagram, positioned above the substrate and responsible for regulating the conductivity of the channel between the source and drain.\n\n3. **Oxide Layer:** A thin silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer insulates the gate from the underlying p-substrate. This layer is marked as 'Oxide' and is pivotal for the MOS device's operation.\n\n4. **p-Substrate:** The primary body of the device, labeled as the p-substrate, forms the foundational layer for other components.\n\n5. **Dimensions and Labels:**\n   - The gate's lateral dimension along the source-drain path is termed the length, denoted as 'L'.\n   - The width 'W' is the dimension perpendicular to the length.\n   - 'L_drawn' represents the total drawn length, while 'L_eff' (effective length) is the actual distance between the source and drain, accounting for side diffusion, calculated as \\( L_{drawn} - 2L_D \\), where \\( L_D \\) is the side diffusion length.\n   - 't_ox' signifies the thickness of the oxide layer.\n\n6. **Connections and Interactions:**\n   - The diagram demonstrates how the gate controls the channel's conductivity between the source and drain, a fundamental aspect of MOS device operation.\n   - The symmetry between the source and drain is highlighted, indicating the device's capability to operate in either direction based on applied voltages.\n\nThis schematic offers a conceptual overview of a MOS device, emphasizing the critical components and their spatial relationships, which are vital for comprehending its functionality.\n\nFigure 2.2 Structure of a MOS device.\nThe gate's lateral dimension along the source-drain path is known as the length, $L$, and the dimension perpendicular to it is the width, $W$. Due to the side diffusion of S/D junctions during fabrication, the actual distance between the source and drain is marginally less than $L$. To prevent confusion, we express $L_{\\text {eff }}=L_{\\text {drawn }}-2 L_{D}$, where $L_{\\text {eff }}$ is the \"effective\" length, $L_{\\text {drawn }}$ is the total length, and $L_{D}$ is the side diffusion amount. As will be discussed later, $L_{e f f}$ and the gate oxide thickness, $t_{o x}$, are crucial for MOS circuit performance. Thus, the primary focus in MOS technology advancement is to reduce these dimensions from one generation to the next without compromising other device parameters. Typical values at the time of this writing are $L_{e f f} \\approx 10 \\mathrm{~nm}$ and $t_{o x} \\approx 15 \\AA$. Throughout this book, unless specified otherwise, the effective length is denoted by $L$.\n\n[^1]Given the symmetry of the MOS structure, why are the $n$ regions distinguished as source and drain? This becomes evident when the source is identified as the terminal supplying charge carriers (electrons in NMOS devices) and the drain as the terminal collecting them. Therefore, as the voltages at the three terminals vary, the source and drain may interchange roles. These concepts are explored in the chapter-end problems.\n\nSo far, we have overlooked the substrate on which the device is fabricated. In practice, the substrate potential significantly impacts device characteristics, rendering the MOSFET a four-terminal device. In standard MOS operation, the S/D junction diodes must be reverse-biased, so we assume the NMOS transistor substrate is connected to the most negative supply in the system. For instance, if a circuit operates between zero and 1.2 volts, $V_{\\text {sub,NMOS }}=0$. This connection is typically made through an ohmic $p^{+}$ region, as shown in the side view of the device in Fig. 2.3.\n\nImage Description: The image labeled \"Figure 2.3 Substrate connection\" presents a cross-sectional view of an NMOS transistor structure. The diagram showcases the essential components and connections within the device:\n\n1. **Components and Structure:**\n   - The NMOS transistor is constructed on a **p-type substrate**, forming the base layer.\n   - Three distinct regions are depicted: two **n+ regions** and one **p+ region**. The n+ regions are marked as **S** (Source) and **D** (Drain), while the p+ region is labeled as **B** (Body or Bulk).\n   - A **gate (G)** is shown above the substrate, separated by a thin insulating layer, representing the gate oxide.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n   - The Source (S) and Drain (D) regions are heavily doped n-type semiconductor regions that enable electron flow when a voltage is applied.\n   - The Body (B) is a p+ region connected to the most negative supply voltage, ensuring the source-body junction remains reverse-biased.\n   - The Gate (G) regulates current flow between the Source (S) and Drain (D) by creating an electric field that modulates the channel's conductivity beneath it.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n   - The diagram includes labels for each terminal: B (Body), S (Source), G (Gate), and D (Drain).\n   - The substrate is explicitly marked as \"p-substrate,\" indicating the doping type.\n   - The n+ and p+ symbols denote the doping concentrations, with n+ indicating a high donor atom concentration and p+ indicating a high acceptor atom concentration.\n\nThis structure is typical for NMOS devices, where the substrate is usually connected to a low potential to ensure proper operation and prevent unintended current paths.\n\nFigure 2.3 Substrate connection.\n\nIn complementary MOS (CMOS) technologies, both NMOS and PMOS transistors are utilized. From a basic perspective, the PMOS device is created by reversing all doping types (including the substrate) [Fig. 2.4(a)], but in reality, NMOS and PMOS devices must be fabricated on the same wafer, i.e., the same substrate.

In practice, the substrate potential significantly affects device characteristics, rendering the MOSFET a four-terminal device. Typically, to ensure reverse-biasing of the S/D junction diodes, the NMOS transistor substrate is connected to the system's most negative supply. For instance, in a circuit operating between zero and 1.2 volts, $V_{\\text {sub,NMOS }}=0$. This connection is usually made via an ohmic $p^{+}$ region, as shown in the device's side view in Fig. 2.3.\n\nImage Description: The image labeled \"Figure 2.3 Substrate connection\" presents a cross-sectional view of an NMOS transistor structure.

From a basic perspective, the PMOS device is formed by reversing all doping types, including the substrate [Fig. 2.4(a)]. However, in practice, NMOS and PMOS devices must coexist on the same wafer, i.e., the same substrate. Consequently, one device type is often placed in a \"local substrate,\" termed a \"well.\" In contemporary CMOS processes, PMOS devices are fabricated in an $n$-well [Fig. 2.4(b)]. Note that the $n$-well must be connected to a potential that keeps the PMOS transistor's S/D junction diodes reverse-biased under all conditions. Typically, the $n$-well is linked to the most positive supply voltage. For simplicity, we occasionally refer to NMOS and PMOS devices as \"NFETs\" and \"PFETs,\" respectively.\n\nFigure 2.4(b) highlights a notable difference between NMOS and PMOS transistors: while all NFETs share a common substrate, each PFET can have an individual $n$-well.

    "text": "Consider an NFET connected to external voltages as depicted in Fig. 2.6(a). What occurs as the gate voltage, $V_{G}$, rises from zero? Since the gate, dielectric, and substrate form a capacitor, as $V_{G}$ becomes more positive, the holes in the $p$-substrate are repelled from the gate area, leaving behind negative ions to mirror the charge on the gate. In other words, a depletion region is established [Fig. 2.6(b)]. Under this condition, no current flows due to the absence of available charge carriers.\n\nAs $V_{G}$ increases, both the width of the depletion region and the potential at the oxide-silicon interface also increase. Essentially, the structure resembles a voltage divider composed of two capacitors in series: the gate-oxide capacitor and the depletion-region capacitor [Fig. 2.6(c)].

As \\( V_G \\) increases, the depletion region widens, and the system approaches the threshold voltage for inversion, allowing current to flow from source to drain.\n\nimage_name:(d)\ndescription:Figure 2.6(d) shows the formation of an inversion layer in a MOSFET structure, indicating the transistor is turned on. The diagram provides a cross-sectional view of a MOSFET device with key components and annotations:\n\n1. **Components and Structure:**\n- The diagram includes a p-type substrate with two n+ regions representing the source and drain.\n- Above the substrate is a gate oxide layer, and above this is the gate electrode connected to a gate voltage, V_G.\n- The source and drain are labeled with a voltage of +0.1 V.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- The gate is connected to a voltage source labeled V_G, which is positive, indicating a positive gate voltage.\n- As V_G increases, an inversion layer forms at the oxide-silicon interface, depicted by negative symbols (electrons) beneath the gate oxide, creating a conductive channel between the source and drain.\n- This channel allows electrons to flow from the source to the drain, indicating the MOSFET is in the 'on' state.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- Annotated with 'Electrons (Channel)' to indicate the inversion layer formation.\n- The substrate is labeled 'p-substrate,' and the n+ regions are clearly marked.\n- The diagram visually represents inversion, where the positive gate voltage induces a conductive channel of electrons in the p-type substrate, allowing current flow between the source and drain.\n\nFigure 2.6 (a) A MOSFET driven by a gate voltage; (b) formation of depletion region; (c) onset of inversion; (d) formation of inversion layer.\n\nThus, a \"channel\" of charge carriers forms under the gate oxide between S and D, and the transistor is \"turned on.\" We say the interface is \"inverted.\" For this reason, the channel is also called the \"inversion layer.\" The value of $V_{G}$ for this to occur is termed the \"threshold voltage,\" $V_{T H}$. If $V_{G}$ increases further, the charge in the depletion region remains relatively constant while the channel charge density continues to rise, providing greater current from S to D.\n\nIn reality, the turn-on process is a gradual function of the gate voltage, making $V_{T H}$ difficult to define unambiguously. In semiconductor physics, the $V_{T H}$ of an NFET is usually defined as the gate voltage at which the interface is \"as much $n$-type as the substrate is $p$-type.\" It can be proven [1] that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{T H}=\\Phi_{M S}+2 \\Phi_{F}+\\frac{Q_{d e p}}{C_{o x}} \\tag{2.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Phi_{M S}$ is the difference between the work functions of the polysilicon gate and the silicon substrate, $\\Phi_{F}=(k T / q) \\ln \\left(N_{\\text {sub }} / n_{i}\\right), k$ is Boltzmann's constant, $q$ is the electron charge, $N_{\\text {sub }}$ is the substrate doping density, $n_{i}$ is the density of electrons in undoped silicon, $Q_{d e p}$ is the charge in the depletion region, and $C_{o x}$ is the gate-oxide capacitance per unit area. From $p n$ junction theory, $Q_{d e p}=\\sqrt{4 q \\epsilon_{s i}\\left|\\Phi_{F}\\right| N_{s u b}}$, where $\\epsilon_{s i}$ is the dielectric constant of silicon. Since $C_{o x}$ frequently appears in device and circuit calculations, it is useful to remember that for $t_{o x} \\approx 20 \\AA, C_{o x} \\approx 17.25 \\mathrm{fF} / \\mu \\mathrm{m}^{2}$. The value of $C_{o x}$ can then be scaled proportionally for other oxide thicknesses.\n\nIn practice, the \"native\" threshold value from the above equation may not suit circuit design, e.g., $V_{T H}=0$ and the device does not turn off for $V_{G} \\geq 0 .{ }^{4}$ For this reason, the threshold voltage is typically adjusted by doping the channel area during fabrication, altering the substrate doping near the oxide interface. For example, as shown in Fig. 2.7, creating a thin $p^{+}$ layer increases the gate voltage required to deplete this region.\n\nimage_name:Figure 2.7\ndescription:Figure 2.7 illustrates a cross-sectional view of a semiconductor device with $p^+$ dopants implanted to modify the threshold voltage.\n\n1. **Identification of Components and Structure:**\n- The diagram shows a \"p-substrate,\" indicating a p-type base material.\n- Two n+ regions on either side represent heavily doped n-type source and drain regions.\n- A thin $p^+$ sheet is depicted beneath the gate oxide, crucial for adjusting the threshold voltage.\n- Above the $p^+$ region is the gate oxide and gate electrode.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- The $p^+$ region under the gate oxide affects the electric field distribution when a voltage is applied to the gate, increasing the gate voltage needed to deplete the channel.\n- The n+ regions are separated by the $p^+$ channel, modulated by the gate voltage to control current flow.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- Labeled \"p-substrate,\" \"n+,\" and \"p+\" to identify regions and doping types.\n- An arrow points to the $p^+$ region, emphasizing its role.\n- The layout suggests a typical MOSFET configuration, where channel doping manipulation adjusts the device's electrical characteristics, specifically the threshold voltage.\n\nFigure 2.7 Implantation of $p+$ dopants to alter the threshold.\n\nThe above definition is not directly applicable to measuring $V_{T H}$. In Fig. 2.6(a), only the drain current indicates whether the device is \"on\" or \"off,\" failing to reveal at what $V_{G S}$ the interface is as much $n$-type as the bulk is $p$-type. Thus, calculating $V_{T H}$ from I/V measurements is somewhat ambiguous. We will return to this point later, but assume for now that the device turns on abruptly for $V_{G S} \\geq V_{T H}$.\n\nThe turn-on phenomenon in a PMOS device is similar to that of NFETs, but with polarities reversed. As shown in Fig. 2.8, if the gate-source voltage becomes sufficiently negative, an inversion layer of holes forms at the oxide-silicon interface, providing a conduction path between the source and drain. Thus, the threshold voltage of a PMOS device is typically negative.\n\nimage_name:Figure 2.8 Formation of inversion layer in a PFET\ndescription:\n[\nname: M1, type: PMOS, ports: {S: GND, D: d1, G: g1}\nname: VG, type: VoltageSource, value: VG, ports: {Np: GND, Nn: g1}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit shows the formation of an inversion layer in a PMOS device when the gate-source voltage is sufficiently negative.

In semiconductor physics, $V_{T H}$ for an NFET is typically defined as the gate voltage at which the interface is \"as much $n$-type as the substrate is $p$-type.\" It can be proven [1] that:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{T H}=\\Phi_{M S}+2 \\Phi_{F}+\\frac{Q_{d e p}}{C_{o x}} \\tag{2.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Phi_{M S}$ is the difference between the work functions of the polysilicon gate and the silicon substrate, $\\Phi_{F}=(k T / q) \\ln \\left(N_{\\text {sub }} / n_{i}\\right), k$ is Boltzmann's constant, $q$ is the electron charge, $N_{\\text {sub }}$ is the substrate doping density, $n_{i}$ is the electron density in undoped silicon, $Q_{d e p}$ is the charge in the depletion region, and $C_{o x}$ is the gate-oxide capacitance per unit area.

Since $C_{o x}$ frequently appears in device and circuit calculations, it is useful to remember that for $t_{o x} \\approx 20 \\AA, C_{o x} \\approx 17.25 \\mathrm{fF} / \\mu \\mathrm{m}^{2}$. The value of $C_{o x}$ can be scaled proportionally for other oxide thicknesses.\n\nIn practice, the \"native\" threshold value from the above equation may not suit circuit design, e.g., $V_{T H}=0$ and the device doesn't turn off for $V_{G} \\geq 0$. Therefore, the threshold voltage is typically adjusted by doping the channel area during fabrication, altering the substrate doping near the oxide interface. For instance, as shown in Fig. 2.7, creating a thin $p^{+}$ layer increases the gate voltage required to deplete this region.\n\n**Figure 2.7:** This image illustrates a cross-sectional view of a semiconductor device with $p^+$ dopants to alter the threshold voltage:\n  - **Components and Structure:**\n    - p-substrate as the base material.\n    - n+ source and drain regions.\n    - A thin $p^+$ sheet beneath the gate oxide.\n    - Gate oxide layer and gate electrode.\n  - **Connections and Interactions:**\n    - The $p^+$ region affects the electric field distribution when a voltage is applied to the gate, increasing the gate voltage needed to deplete the channel.\n    - The n+ regions are separated by the $p^+$ channel, modulated by the gate voltage to control current flow.\n  - **Labels and Annotations:**\n    - Labels include \"p-substrate,\" \"n+,\" and \"p+.\"\n    - An arrow points to the $p^+$ region, emphasizing its role.\n    - The layout shows a typical MOSFET configuration with channel doping manipulation to adjust electrical characteristics.\n\nFigure 2.7: Implantation of $p^+$ dopants to alter the threshold.\n\nThe above definition isn't directly applicable to measuring $V_{T H}$. In Fig. 2.6(a), only the drain current indicates whether the device is \"on\" or \"off,\" without revealing the $V_{G S}$ at which the interface is as much $n$-type as the bulk is $p$-type. Thus, calculating $V_{T H}$ from I/V measurements is somewhat ambiguous. We will revisit this later, but assume for now that the device turns on abruptly for $V_{G S} \\geq V_{T H}$.\n\nThe turn-on phenomenon in a PMOS device is similar to that in NFETs, but with polarities reversed. As shown in Fig. 2.8, if the gate-source voltage becomes sufficiently negative, an inversion layer of holes forms at the oxide-silicon interface, providing a conduction path between the source and drain. Thus, the threshold voltage of a PMOS device is typically negative.\n\n**Figure 2.8:** This circuit illustrates the formation of an inversion layer in a PMOS device when the gate-source voltage is sufficiently negative.

If $V_{G}$ increases further, the charge in the depletion region remains relatively constant while the channel charge density continues to rise, providing a greater current from S to D.\n\nIn reality, the turn-on phenomenon is a gradual function of the gate voltage, making it challenging to define $V_{T H}$ unambiguously. In semiconductor physics, the $V_{T H}$ of an NFET is typically defined as the gate voltage at which the interface is \"as much $n$-type as the substrate is $p$-type.\" It can be proven [1] that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{T H}=\\Phi_{M S}+2 \\Phi_{F}+\\frac{Q_{d e p}}{C_{o x}} \\tag{2.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Phi_{M S}$ is the difference between the work functions of the polysilicon gate and the silicon substrate, $\\Phi_{F}=(k T / q) \\ln \\left(N_{\\text {sub }} / n_{i}\\right), k$ is Boltzmann's constant, $q$ is the electron charge, $N_{\\text {sub }}$ is the substrate doping density, $n_{i}$ is the density of electrons in undoped silicon, $Q_{d e p}$ is the charge in the depletion region, and $C_{o x}$ is the gate-oxide capacitance per unit area.

Since $C_{o x}$ frequently appears in device and circuit calculations, it is helpful to remember that for $t_{o x} \\approx 20 \\AA, C_{o x} \\approx 17.25 \\mathrm{fF} / \\mu \\mathrm{m}^{2}$. The value of $C_{o x}$ can then be scaled proportionally for other oxide thicknesses.\n\nIn practice, the \"native\" threshold value obtained from the above equation may not be suitable for circuit design, e.g., $V_{T H}=0$ and the device does not turn off for $V_{G} \\geq 0 .{ }^{4}$ For this reason, the threshold voltage is typically adjusted by implanting dopants into the channel area during device fabrication, effectively altering the doping level of the substrate near the oxide interface. For example, as shown in Fig. 2.7, if a thin sheet of $p^{+}$ is created, the gate voltage required to deplete this region increases.\n\nimage_name:Figure 2.7\ndescription:Figure 2.7 illustrates a cross-sectional view of a semiconductor device structure, focusing on the implantation of $p^+$ dopants to modify the threshold voltage.\n\n1. **Identification of Components and Structure:**\n- The diagram shows a \"p-substrate,\" indicating a p-type semiconductor base.\n- Two n+ regions on either side represent heavily doped n-type source and drain regions.\n- A thin sheet of $p^+$ is depicted beneath the gate oxide, crucial for adjusting the threshold voltage.\n- Above the $p^+$ region is the gate oxide layer and gate electrode.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- The $p^+$ region under the gate oxide affects the electric field distribution when a voltage is applied to the gate, increasing the gate voltage needed to deplete the channel.\n- The n+ regions are separated by the $p^+$ channel, modulated by the gate voltage to control current flow between the source and drain.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- Annotated with labels like \"p-substrate,\" \"n+,\" and \"p+\" to clearly identify regions and doping types.\n- An arrow points to the $p^+$ region, emphasizing its role.\n- The layout suggests a typical MOSFET configuration, where channel doping manipulation adjusts the device's electrical characteristics, specifically the threshold voltage.\n\nFigure 2.7 Implantation of $p+$ dopants to alter the threshold.\n\nThe above definition is not directly applicable to measuring $V_{T H}$. In Fig. 2.6(a), only the drain current can indicate whether the device is \"on\" or \"off,\" failing to reveal at what $V_{G S}$ the interface is as much $n$-type as the bulk is $p$-type. Consequently, calculating $V_{T H}$ from I/V measurements is somewhat ambiguous. We will return to this point later, but assume for now that the device turns on abruptly for $V_{G S} \\geq V_{T H}$.\n\nThe turn-on phenomenon in a PMOS device is similar to that of NFETs, but with all polarities reversed. As shown in Fig. 2.8, if the gate-source voltage becomes sufficiently negative, an inversion layer consisting of holes forms at the oxide-silicon interface, providing a conduction path between the source and the drain.

The value of $C_{o x}$ can then be scaled proportionally for other oxide thicknesses.\n\nIn practice, the \"native\" threshold value from the above equation may not suit circuit design, e.g., $V_{T H}=0$ and the device does not turn off for $V_{G} \\geq 0 .{ }^{4}$ Consequently, the threshold voltage is typically adjusted by doping the channel area during fabrication, altering the substrate doping near the oxide interface. For example, as shown in Fig. 2.7, creating a thin $p^{+}$ layer increases the gate voltage needed to deplete this region.\n\n[^2]image_name:Figure 2.7\ndescription:Figure 2.7 illustrates a cross-sectional view of a semiconductor device with $p^+$ dopants implanted to modify the threshold voltage.\n\n1. **Identification of Components and Structure:**\n- The diagram shows a \"p-substrate,\" indicating a p-type base material.\n- Two n+ regions on either side represent heavily doped n-type source and drain regions.\n- A thin $p^+$ sheet is depicted beneath the gate oxide, crucial for adjusting the threshold voltage.\n- Above the $p^+$ region is the gate oxide and gate electrode.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- The $p^+$ region under the gate oxide affects the electric field distribution when a voltage is applied to the gate, increasing the gate voltage required to deplete the channel and adjust the threshold voltage.\n- The n+ regions are separated by the $p^+$ channel, modulated by the gate voltage to control current flow between the source and drain.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- Annotated with labels like \"p-substrate,\" \"n+,\" and \"p+\" to clearly identify regions and doping types.\n- An arrow points to the $p^+$ region, emphasizing its role.\n- The layout suggests a typical MOSFET configuration, where channel doping manipulation adjusts the device's electrical characteristics, specifically the threshold voltage.\n\nFigure 2.7 Implantation of $p+$ dopants to alter the threshold.\n\nThe above definition is not directly applicable to measuring $V_{T H}$. In Fig. 2.6(a), only the drain current indicates whether the device is \"on\" or \"off,\" without revealing the $V_{G S}$ at which the interface is as much $n$-type as the bulk is $p$-type. Thus, calculating $V_{T H}$ from I/V measurements is somewhat ambiguous. We will revisit this point later, but assume for now that the device turns on abruptly for $V_{G S} \\geq V_{T H}$.\n\nThe turn-on process in a PMOS device resembles that of NFETs, but with reversed polarities. As shown in Fig. 2.8, if the gate-source voltage becomes sufficiently negative, an inversion layer of holes forms at the oxide-silicon interface, providing a conduction path between the source and drain. Thus, the threshold voltage of a PMOS device is typically negative.\n\nimage_name:Figure 2.8 Formation of inversion layer in a PFET\ndescription:\n[\nname: M1, type: PMOS, ports: {S: GND, D: d1, G: g1}\nname: VG, type: VoltageSource, value: VG, ports: {Np: GND, Nn: g1}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit shows the formation of an inversion layer in a PMOS device when the gate-source voltage is sufficiently negative.

    "text": "Consider an NFET connected to external voltages as depicted in Fig. 2.6(a). What occurs as the gate voltage, $V_{G}$, rises from zero? Since the gate, dielectric, and substrate form a capacitor, as $V_{G}$ becomes more positive, the holes in the $p$-substrate are repelled from the gate area, leaving behind negative ions to mirror the charge on the gate. In other words, a depletion region is formed [Fig. 2.6(b)]. Under this condition, no current flows due to the absence of charge carriers.\n\nAs $V_{G}$ continues to increase, both the width of the depletion region and the potential at the oxide-silicon interface also increase. Essentially, the structure behaves like a voltage divider composed of two capacitors in series: the gate oxide capacitor and the depletion region capacitor [Fig. 2.6(c)]. When the interface potential reaches a sufficiently positive level, electrons move from the source to the interface and eventually to the drain.\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:The image labeled \"(a)\" shows a MOSFET (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor) driven by a gate voltage, $V_G$.

The diagram provides a cross-sectional view of a MOSFET device with key components and annotations:\n\n1. **Components and Structure:**\n- The diagram includes a p-type substrate with two n+ regions representing the source and drain.\n- Above the substrate is a gate oxide layer, and above this is the gate electrode connected to a gate voltage, V_G.\n- The source and drain are labeled with a voltage of +0.1 V.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- The gate is connected to a voltage source labeled V_G, which is positive, indicating a positive gate voltage.\n- As V_G increases, an inversion layer forms at the oxide-silicon interface, depicted by negative symbols (electrons) beneath the gate oxide, creating a conductive channel between the source and drain.\n- This channel allows electrons to flow from the source to the drain, indicating the MOSFET is in the 'on' state.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- The diagram is annotated with 'Electrons (Channel)' to indicate the inversion layer formation.\n- The substrate is labeled 'p-substrate,' and the n+ regions are clearly marked.\n- The diagram visually represents inversion, where the positive gate voltage induces a conductive channel of electrons in the p-type substrate, allowing current flow between the source and drain.\n\nFigure 2.6 (a) A MOSFET driven by a gate voltage; (b) formation of depletion region; (c) onset of inversion; (d) formation of inversion layer.\n\nThus, a \"channel\" of charge carriers forms under the gate oxide between S and D, and the transistor is \"turned on.\" We say the interface is \"inverted.\" For this reason, the channel is also called the \"inversion layer.\" The value of $V_{G}$ for this to occur is termed the \"threshold voltage,\" $V_{T H}$. If $V_{G}$ increases further, the charge in the depletion region remains relatively constant while the channel charge density continues to rise, providing a greater current from S to D.\n\nIn reality, the turn-on phenomenon is a gradual function of the gate voltage, making it challenging to define $V_{T H}$ unambiguously. In semiconductor physics, the $V_{T H}$ of an NFET is typically defined as the gate voltage at which the interface is \"as much $n$-type as the substrate is $p$-type.\" It can be proven [1] that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{T H}=\\Phi_{M S}+2 \\Phi_{F}+\\frac{Q_{d e p}}{C_{o x}} \\tag{2.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Phi_{M S}$ is the difference between the work functions of the polysilicon gate and the silicon substrate, $\\Phi_{F}=(k T / q) \\ln \\left(N_{\\text {sub }} / n_{i}\\right), k$ is Boltzmann's constant, $q$ is the electron charge, $N_{\\text {sub }}$ is the substrate doping density, $n_{i}$ is the density of electrons in undoped silicon, $Q_{d e p}$ is the charge in the depletion region, and $C_{o x}$ is the gate-oxide capacitance per unit area. From $p n$ junction theory, $Q_{d e p}=\\sqrt{4 q \\epsilon_{s i}\\left|\\Phi_{F}\\right| N_{s u b}}$, where $\\epsilon_{s i}$ denotes the dielectric constant of silicon. Since $C_{o x}$ appears frequently in device and circuit calculations, it is helpful to remember that for $t_{o x} \\approx 20 \\AA, C_{o x} \\approx 17.25 \\mathrm{fF} / \\mu \\mathrm{m}^{2}$. The value of $C_{o x}$ can then be scaled proportionally for other oxide thicknesses.\n\nIn practice, the \"native\" threshold value obtained from the above equation may not be suitable for circuit design, e.g., $V_{T H}=0$ and the device does not turn off for $V_{G} \\geq 0 .{ }^{4}$ For this reason, the threshold voltage is typically adjusted by implanting dopants into the channel area during device fabrication, effectively altering the doping level of the substrate near the oxide interface. For example, as shown in Fig. 2.7, if a thin sheet of $p^{+}$ is created, the gate voltage required to deplete this region increases.\n\n[^2]image_name:Figure 2.7\ndescription:Figure 2.7 illustrates a cross-sectional view of a semiconductor device structure, focusing on the implantation of $p^+$ dopants to modify the threshold voltage.\n\n1. **Identification of Components and Structure:**\n- The diagram shows a semiconductor substrate labeled \"p-substrate,\" indicating a p-type base material.\n- There are two n+ regions on either side, representing heavily doped n-type source and drain regions.\n- A thin sheet of $p^+$ is depicted beneath the gate oxide, indicating a highly doped p-type region crucial for adjusting the threshold voltage.\n- Above the $p^+$ region is a layer representing the gate oxide and gate electrode.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- The $p^+$ region is strategically placed under the gate oxide layer, affecting the electric field distribution when a voltage is applied to the gate.

In Fig. 2.6(a), only the drain current can indicate whether the device is \"on\" or \"off,\" failing to reveal at what $V_{G S}$ the interface is as much $n$-type as the bulk is $p$-type. As a result, calculating $V_{T H}$ from I/V measurements is somewhat ambiguous. We will return to this point later, but assume for now that the device turns on abruptly for $V_{G S} \\geq V_{T H}$.\n\nThe turn-on phenomenon in a PMOS device is similar to that of NFETs, but with all polarities reversed. As shown in Fig. 2.8, if the gate-source voltage becomes sufficiently negative, an inversion layer consisting of holes forms at the oxide-silicon interface, providing a conduction path between the source and the drain. Thus, the threshold voltage of a PMOS device is typically negative.\nimage_name:Figure 2.8 Formation of inversion layer in a PFET\ndescription:\n[\nname: M1, type: PMOS, ports: {S: GND, D: d1, G: g1}\nname: VG, type: VoltageSource, value: VG, ports: {Np: GND, Nn: g1}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit illustrates the formation of an inversion layer in a PMOS device when the gate-source voltage is sufficiently negative.

This is also evident from the characteristics of Fig. 2.11 for small \\( V_{DS} \\): as shown in Fig. 2.12, each parabola can be approximated by a straight line. The linear relationship implies that the path from the source to the drain can be represented by a linear resistor equal to\n\n\\[\nR_{on} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}\\left(V_{GS} - V_{TH}\\right)} \\tag{2.11}\n\\]\n\nA MOSFET can therefore operate as a resistor whose value is controlled by the overdrive voltage [so long as \\( V_{DS} \\ll 2\\left(V_{GS} - V_{TH}\\right) \\)]. This is conceptually illustrated in Fig. 2.13. Note that in contrast to bipolar transistors, a MOS device may be on even if it carries no current. With the condition \\( V_{DS} \\ll 2\\left(V_{GS} - V_{TH}\\right) \\), we say the device operates in the deep triode region.\n\n#### Example 2.1\n\nFor the arrangement in Fig. 2.14(a), plot the on-resistance of \\( M_1 \\) as a function of \\( V_G \\).

Note that the drain terminal is open.\n\n#### Solution\n\nSince the drain terminal is open, \\( I_D = 0 \\) and \\( V_{DS} = 0 \\). Thus, if the device is on, it operates in the deep triode region. For \\( V_G < 1 \\mathrm{~V} + V_{TH} \\), \\( M_1 \\) is off and \\( R_{on} = \\infty \\). For \\( V_G > 1 \\mathrm{~V} + V_{TH} \\), we have\n\n\\[\nR_{on} = \\frac{1}{50 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} / \\mathrm{V}^2 \\times 10\\left(V_G - 1 \\mathrm{~V} - 0.3 \\mathrm{~V}\\right)} \\tag{2.12}\n\\]\n\nThe result is plotted in Fig. 2.14(b).\n\nMOSFETs operating as controllable resistors play a crucial role in many analog circuits. For example, a voltage-controlled resistor can be used to adjust the frequency of the clock generator in a laptop computer if the system must go into a power saving mode. As studied in Chapter 13, MOSFETs also serve as switches.\n\nWhat happens if the drain-source voltage in Fig. 2.11 exceeds \\( V_{GS} - V_{TH} \\)? In reality, the drain current does not follow the parabolic behavior for \\( V_{DS} > V_{GS} - V_{TH} \\). In fact, as shown in Fig. 2.15, \\( I_D \\) becomes relatively constant, and we say the device operates in the \"saturation\" region. ${ }^{6}$ To understand this phenomenon, recall from (2.4) that the local density of the inversion-layer charge is proportional to \\( V_{GS} - V(x) - V_{TH} \\). Thus, if \\( V(x) \\) approaches \\( V_{GS} - V_{TH} \\), then \\( Q_d(x) \\) drops to zero. In other words, as depicted in Fig. 2.16, if \\( V_{DS} \\) is slightly greater than \\( V_{GS} - V_{TH} \\), then the inversion layer stops at \\( x \\leq L \\), and we say the channel is \"pinched off.\" As \\( V_{DS} \\) increases further, the point at which \\( Q_d \\) equals zero gradually moves toward the source. Thus, at some point along the channel, the local potential difference between the gate and the oxide-silicon interface is not sufficient to support an inversion layer.\n\nHow does the device conduct current in the presence of pinch-off? As the electrons approach the pinch-off point (where \\( Q_d \\rightarrow 0 \\)), their velocity rises tremendously ( \\( v = I / Q_d \\)). Upon passing the pinch-off point, the electrons simply shoot through the depletion region near the drain junction and arrive at the drain terminal.\n\n[^4]With the above observations, we reexamine (2.7) for a saturated device. Since \\( Q_d \\) is the density of mobile charge, the integral on the left-hand side of (2.7) must be taken from \\( x = 0 \\) to \\( x = L' \\), where \\( L' \\) is the point at which \\( Q_d \\) drops to zero (e.g., \\( x_2 \\) in Fig. 2.16), and that on the right from \\( V(x) = 0 \\) to \\( V(x) = V_{GS} - V_{TH} \\). As a result,\n\n\\[\nI_D = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L'}\\left(V_{GS} - V_{TH}\\right)^2 \\tag{2.13}\n\\]\n\nindicating that \\( I_D \\) is relatively independent of \\( V_{DS} \\) if \\( L' \\) remains close to \\( L \\). We say the device exhibits a \"square-law\" behavior. If \\( I_D \\) is known, then \\( V_{GS} \\) is obtained as\n\n\\[\nV_{GS} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 I_D}{\\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L'}}} + V_{TH} \\tag{2.14}\n\\]\n\nWe must emphasize that for the transistor to remain in saturation (as is the case in many analog circuits), the drain-source voltage must be equal to or greater than the overdrive voltage. For this reason, some books write \\( V_{DSat} = V_{GS} - V_{TH} \\), where \\( V_{DSat} \\) denotes the minimum \\( V_{DS} \\) necessary for operation in saturation. As seen later in this book, if the signal swings at the drain or the gate cause \\( V_{DS} \\) to fall below \\( V_{GS} - V_{TH} \\), then a number of undesirable effects occur. For this reason, the choice of the overdrive and hence \\( V_{DSat} \\) translates to a certain voltage \"headroom\" for the signal swings in the circuit: the larger the \\( V_{DSat} \\), the less headroom is available for the signals.\n\nEquations (2.8) and (2.13) represent the \"large-signal\" behavior of NMOS devices; i.e., they can predict the drain current for arbitrary voltages applied to the gate, source, and drain (but only if the device is on). Since the nonlinear nature of these equations makes the analysis difficult, we often resort to linear approximations (\"small-signal\" models) so as to develop some understanding of a given circuit. This point becomes clear in Sec. 2.4.3.\n\nFor PMOS devices, Eqs.

Note that \\( V_{GS} \\), \\( V_{DS} \\), \\( V_{TH} \\), and \\( V_{GS} - V_{TH} \\) are negative for a PMOS transistor that is turned on. Since the mobility of holes is about one-half the mobility of electrons, PMOS devices suffer from lower \"current drive\" capability.\n\nWith \\( L \\) assumed constant, a saturated MOSFET can be used as a current source connected between the drain and the source (Fig. 2.17), an important component in analog design. Note that the NMOS current source injects current into ground and the PMOS current source draws current from \\( V_{DD} \\). In other words, only one terminal of each current source is \"floating.\" (It is difficult to design a current source that flows between two arbitrary nodes of a circuit.)\n\n#### Example 2.2\n\nOn a \\( V_{DS}-V_{GS} \\) plane, show the regions of operation of an NMOS transistor.\n\n#### Solution\n\nSince the value of \\( V_{DS} \\) with respect to \\( V_{GS} - V_{TH} \\) determines the region of operation, we draw the line \\( V_{DS} = V_{GS} - V_{TH} \\) in the plane, as shown in Fig. 2.18. If \\( V_{GS} > V_{TH} \\), then the region above the line corresponds to saturation, and that below the line corresponds to the triode region. Note that for a given \\( V_{DS} \\), the device eventually leaves saturation as \\( V_{GS} \\) increases. The minimum allowable \\( V_{DS} \\) for operation in saturation is also called \\( V_{DSat} \\). It is important to bear in mind that \\( V_{DSat} = V_{GS} - V_{TH} \\).\n\nThe distinction between saturation and triode regions can be confusing, especially for PMOS devices. Intuitively, we note that the channel is pinched off if the difference between the gate and drain voltages is not sufficient to create an inversion layer. As depicted conceptually in Fig. 2.19, as \\( V_G - V_D \\) of an NFET drops below \\( V_{TH} \\), pinch-off occurs. Similarly, if \\( V_D - V_G \\) of a PFET is not large enough ( \\( <\\left|V_{THP}\\right| \\)), the device is saturated. Note that this view does not require knowledge of the source voltage. This means that we must know a priori which terminal operates as the drain. The drain is defined as the terminal with a higher (lower) voltage than the source for an NFET (PFET).\n\nFigure 2.19 Conceptual visualization of saturation and triode regions."

    "text": "To establish the correlation between the drain current of a MOSFET and its terminal voltages, we note two key observations.\n\nInitially, consider a semiconductor bar conducting a current $I$ [Fig. 2.9(a)]. Assuming the charge density along the current direction is $Q_{d}$ coulombs per meter and the charge velocity is $v$ meters per second, then the current can be expressed as\n\n$$\nI = Q_{d} \\cdot v \\tag{2.2}\n$$\n\nThis is derived by measuring the total charge passing through a cross-section of the bar per unit time. Given a velocity $v$, all the charge contained within $v$ meters of the bar must traverse the cross-section in one second [Fig. 2.9(b)]. As the charge density is $Q_{d}$, the total charge in $v$ meters equals $Q_{d} \\cdot v$. This principle is instrumental in analyzing semiconductor devices.\n\nSecondly, to apply the aforementioned principle, we must ascertain the mobile charge density in a MOSFET. For this, consider an NFET with its source and drain grounded [Fig. 2.10(a)]. The question arises: what is the charge density in the inversion layer? Since we postulate that inversion begins at $V_{G S}=V_{T H}$, the inversion charge density generated by the gate-oxide capacitance is proportional to $V_{G S}-V_{T H}$. For $V_{G S} \\geq V_{T H}$, any charge deposited on the gate is mirrored by the charge in the channel, resulting in a uniform channel charge density (charge per unit length along the source-drain path) expressed as\n\n$$\nQ_{d} = W C_{o x}(V_{G S}-V_{T H}) \\tag{2.3}\n$$\n\nHere, $C_{o x}$ is multiplied by $W$ to represent the total capacitance per unit length.\n\nNow, assuming the drain voltage is greater than zero [Fig. 2.10(b)], since the channel potential varies from zero at the source to $V_{D}$ at the drain, the local voltage difference between the gate and the channel varies from $V_{G}$ (near the source) to $V_{G}-V_{D}$ (near the drain).

This is also discernible from the characteristics of Fig. 2.11 for small \\( V_{D S} \\): as illustrated in Fig. 2.12, each parabola can be approximated by a straight line. The linear relationship suggests that the path from the source to the drain can be represented by a linear resistor equivalent to:\n\n\\[ R_{o n} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L} (V_{G S} - V_{T H})} \\tag{2.11} \\]\n\nThus, a MOSFET can function as a resistor whose value is dictated by the overdrive voltage [provided \\( V_{D S} \\ll 2(V_{G S} - V_{T H}) \\)]. This is conceptually depicted in Fig. 2.13. In contrast to bipolar transistors, a MOS device may be activated even if it carries no current. With the condition \\( V_{D S} \\ll 2(V_{G S} - V_{T H}) \\), we state that the device operates in the deep triode region.\n\n#### Example 2.1\n\nFor the configuration in Fig. 2.14(a), plot the on-resistance of \\( M_{1} \\) as a function of \\( V_{G} \\). Assume \\( \\mu_{n} C_{o x} = 50 \\mu \\text{A}/\\text{V}^2 \\), \\( W/L = 10 \\), and \\( V_{T H} = 0.3 \\text{V} \\). Note that the drain terminal is open.\n\n#### Solution\n\nWith the drain terminal open, \\( I_{D} = 0 \\) and \\( V_{D S} = 0 \\). Hence, if the device is activated, it operates in the deep triode region. For \\( V_{G} < 1 \\text{V} + V_{T H} \\), \\( M_{1} \\) is deactivated and \\( R_{o n} = \\infty \\). For \\( V_{G} > 1 \\text{V} + V_{T H} \\), we derive:\n\n\\[ R_{o n} = \\frac{1}{50 \\mu \\text{A}/\\text{V}^2 \\times 10 (V_{G} - 1 \\text{V} - 0.3 \\text{V})} \\tag{2.12} \\]\n\nThe result is plotted in Fig. 2.14(b).\n\nMOSFETs acting as controllable resistors are integral in numerous analog circuits. For instance, a voltage-controlled resistor can modulate the frequency of the clock generator in a laptop computer when the system must transition to a power-saving mode. As examined in Chapter 13, MOSFETs also function as switches.\n\nWhen the drain-source voltage in Fig. 2.11 surpasses \\( V_{G S} - V_{T H} \\), the drain current deviates from the parabolic trajectory for \\( V_{D S} > V_{G S} - V_{T H} \\). In reality, as illustrated in Fig. 2.15, \\( I_{D} \\) becomes relatively constant, and we affirm that the device operates in the \"saturation\" region. To grasp this phenomenon, recall from (2.4) that the local density of the inversion-layer charge is proportional to \\( V_{G S} - V(x) - V_{T H} \\). Consequently, if \\( V(x) \\) approaches \\( V_{G S} - V_{T H} \\), then \\( Q_{d}(x) \\) diminishes to zero. In other words, as depicted in Fig. 2.16, if \\( V_{D S} \\) is marginally greater than \\( V_{G S} - V_{T H} \\), the inversion layer terminates at \\( x \\leq L \\), and we affirm that the channel is \"pinched off.\" As \\( V_{D S} \\) increases further, the point at which \\( Q_{d} \\) equals zero gradually shifts towards the source. Thus, at a specific point along the channel, the local potential difference between the gate and the oxide-silicon interface is insufficient to sustain an inversion layer.\n\nWith the pinch-off scenario, we reevaluate (2.7) for a saturated device. Given that \\( Q_{d} \\) is the density of mobile charge, the integral on the left-hand side of (2.7) must be computed from \\( x = 0 \\) to \\( x = L' \\), where \\( L' \\) is the point at which \\( Q_{d} \\) diminishes to zero (e.g., \\( x_{2} \\) in Fig. 2.16), and that on the right from \\( V(x) = 0 \\) to \\( V(x) = V_{G S} - V_{T H} \\). Consequently,\n\n\\[ I_{D} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L'} (V_{G S} - V_{T H})^2 \\tag{2.13} \\]\n\nThis indicates that \\( I_{D} \\) is relatively independent of \\( V_{D S} \\) if \\( L' \\) remains close to \\( L \\). We assert that the device exhibits a \"square-law\" behavior. If \\( I_{D} \\) is known, then \\( V_{G S} \\) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ V_{G S} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 I_{D}}{\\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L'}}} + V_{T H} \\tag{2.14} \\]\n\nIt is crucial to emphasize that for the transistor to persist in saturation (as is the case in many analog circuits), the drain-source voltage must be equal to or exceed the overdrive voltage. For this reason, some literature denotes \\( V_{D, s a t} = V_{G S} - V_{T H} \\), where \\( V_{D, s a t} \\) signifies the minimum \\( V_{D S} \\) required for operation in saturation. As elucidated later in this text, if the signal fluctuations at the drain or the gate cause \\( V_{D S} \\) to drop below \\( V_{G S} - V_{T H} \\), a myriad of undesirable effects transpire. Hence, the selection of the overdrive and, by extension, \\( V_{D, s a t} \\) translates to a specific voltage \"headroom\" for the signal fluctuations in the circuit: the greater the \\( V_{D, s a t} \\), the less headroom is available for the signals.\n\nEquations (2.8) and (2.13) encapsulate the \"large-signal\" behavior of NMOS devices; that is, they can predict the drain current for arbitrary voltages applied to the gate, source, and drain (but only if the device is activated). The nonlinear nature of these equations complicates analysis, prompting us to often revert to linear approximations (\"small-signal\" models) to glean insights into a given circuit's operation, as will be discussed in Sec. 2.4.3.\n\nFor PMOS devices, Eqs. (2.8) and (2.13) are reformulated as:\n\n\\[ I_{D} = -\\mu_{p} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L} [(V_{G S} - V_{T H}) V_{D S} - \\frac{1}{2} V_{D S}^2] \\tag{2.15} \\]\n\nand\n\n\\[ I_{D} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{p} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L'} (V_{G S} - V_{T H})^2 \\tag{2.16} \\]\n\nThe negative sign emerges because we assume that \\( I_{D} \\) flows from the drain to the source, whereas holes flow in the opposite direction. Note that \\( V_{G S} \\), \\( V_{D S} \\), \\( V_{T H} \\), and \\( V_{G S} - V_{T H} \\) are negative for a PMOS transistor that is activated. Since the mobility of holes is roughly half that of electrons, PMOS devices endure reduced \"current drive\" capability.\n\nFigure 2.17 portrays two saturated MOSFETs operating as current sources. An NMOS current source injects current into ground, while a PMOS current source extracts current from \\( V_{D D} \\). In other words, only one terminal of each current source is \"floating.\" (Designing a current source that flows between two arbitrary nodes in a circuit is challenging.)\n\n#### Example 2.2\n\nOn a \\( V_{D S} - V_{G S} \\) plane, delineate the regions of operation of an NMOS transistor.\nimage_name:Figure 2.18\ndescription: The graph in Figure 2.18 is a plot on the \\( V_{DS} - V_{GS} \\) plane, used to illustrate the regions of operation for an NMOS transistor.\n\n1. **Type of Graph and Function:**\n   - This is a two-dimensional plot depicting the relationship between the drain-source voltage (\\( V_{DS} \\)) and the gate-source voltage (\\( V_{GS} \\)) for an NMOS transistor.\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n   - The horizontal axis represents the gate-source voltage (\\( V_{GS} \\)).\n   - The vertical axis represents the drain-source voltage (\\( V_{DS} \\)).\n   - Both axes are conventionally measured in volts.\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n   - The graph is segmented into three regions based on the depicted lines: Off, Saturation, and Triode.\n   - The line \\( V_{DS} = V_{GS} - V_{TH} \\) demarcates the saturation region from the triode region.

    "text": "To establish the relationship between the drain current of a MOSFET and its terminal voltages, we make two observations.\n\nFirst, let's consider a semiconductor bar conducting a current \\( I \\) [Fig. 2.9(a)].

At a velocity \\( v \\), the entire charge confined within \\( v \\) meters of the bar must traverse the cross-section in one second [Fig. 2.9(b)]. Given that the charge density is \\( Q_{d} \\), the cumulative charge within \\( v \\) meters equates to \\( Q_{d} \\cdot v \\). This principle aids in the analysis of semiconductor devices.\n\nOur second observation revolves around ascertaining the mobile charge density within a MOSFET. To this end, we consider an NFET where the source and drain are grounded [Fig. 2.10(a)]. The pivotal query is: what is the charge density in the inversion layer? Provided that the inception of inversion takes place at \\( V_{GS} = V_{TH} \\), the inversion charge density generated by the gate-oxide capacitance is directly proportional to \\( V_{GS} - V_{TH} \\). For \\( V_{GS} \\geq V_{TH} \\), any charge deposited on the gate is reciprocated by an equivalent charge in the channel, yielding a consistent channel charge density (charge per unit length along the source-drain trajectory) expressed as\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\nQ_{d} = W C_{ox} (V_{GS} - V_{TH}) \\tag{2.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( C_{ox} \\) is multiplied by \\( W \\) to denote the total capacitance per unit length.

What happens if the bulk voltage of an NFET drops below the source voltage (Figure 2.22)? Since the S and D junctions remain reverse-biased, we assume that the device continues to operate correctly, but some of its characteristics may change. To understand the effect, suppose Figure 2.22 NMOS device with negative bulk voltage. The image shows an NMOS transistor with a negative bulk voltage (VB < 0).

As $V_{B}$ becomes more negative, more holes are attracted to the substrate connection, leaving a larger negative charge behind; i.e., as depicted in Fig. 2.23, the depletion region becomes wider. Now recall from Eq. (2.1) that the threshold voltage is a function of the total charge in the depletion region because the gate charge must mirror $Q_{d}$ before an inversion layer is formed.

For $V_{X 1}<V_{X}<0, I_{D}$ increases according to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{D}=\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}\\left[V_{G S}-V_{T H 0}-\\gamma\\left(\\sqrt{2 \\Phi_{F}-V_{X}}-\\sqrt{2 \\Phi_{F}}\\right)\\right]^{2} \\tag{2.25}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFig. 2.24(b) shows the resulting behavior.\n\nFor body effect to manifest itself, the bulk potential, $V_{\\text {sub }}$, need not change: if the source voltage varies with respect to $V_{\\text {sub }}$, the same phenomenon occurs. For example, consider the circuit in Fig. 2.25(a), first ignoring body effect. We note that as $V_{\\text {in }}$ varies, $V_{\\text {out }}$ closely follows the input because the drain current remains equal to $I_{1}$. In fact, we can write\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{1}=\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}\\left(V_{\\text {in }}-V_{\\text {out }}-V_{T H}\\right)^{2} \\tag{2.26}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nconcluding that $V_{\\text {in }}-V_{\\text {out }}$ is constant if $I_{1}$ is constant [Fig. 2.25(b)].\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:\n[\nname: M1, type: NMOS, ports: {S: Vout, D: VDD, G: Vin}\nname: I1, type: CurrentSource, value: I1, ports: {Np: Vout, Nn: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit consists of an NMOS transistor and a current source. The NMOS transistor M1 has its source connected to Vout, drain to VDD, and gate to Vin. The current source I1 flows into Vout and out to ground.\n\nimage_name:(b)\ndescription:The graph in Figure 2.25(b) is a time-domain waveform plot depicting the relationship between the input voltage ($V_{in}$) and the output voltage ($V_{out}$) over time. The x-axis represents time ($t$), though no specific units or scales are provided, indicating a qualitative analysis rather than a quantitative one. The y-axis represents voltage, with two distinct lines labeled as $V_{in}$ and $V_{out}$.\n\nBoth $V_{in}$ and $V_{out}$ are shown as straight, parallel lines, suggesting a linear relationship between the input and output voltages. The lines are inclined upwards from left to right, indicating that both voltages are increasing over time. The fact that the lines are parallel suggests that the difference between $V_{in}$ and $V_{out}$ remains constant over the observed time period, implying no phase shift or delay between them.\n\nThis graph likely illustrates a scenario where the body effect is not present, as indicated by the context, allowing $V_{out}$ to follow $V_{in}$ closely without additional voltage drops or shifts. The absence of any markers, gridlines, or specific numerical values suggests the graph is intended to convey the general behavior of the circuit rather than precise measurements.\n\nimage_name:(b)\ndescription:The graph labeled (b) is a time-domain waveform illustrating the behavior of input and output voltages, specifically $V_{in}$ and $V_{out}$, over time. The horizontal axis represents time, denoted as \\( t \\), while the vertical axis represents voltage levels.\n\nIn this graph, $V_{in}$ is depicted as a straight, upward-sloping line, indicating a linear increase in input voltage over time. In contrast, $V_{out}$ follows a similar upward trend but with a noticeable curvature, suggesting that the output voltage increases at a decreasing rate compared to the input voltage. This curvature implies that there is a deviation between $V_{in}$ and $V_{out}$, likely due to some inherent characteristics of the circuit, such as capacitance or resistance, which might cause a lag or attenuation in the output.\n\nThere are no specific numerical values or units provided for the axes, emphasizing that the graph is intended to convey the general relationship and behavior between the input and output voltages rather than precise measurements. The absence of gridlines or markers further supports this qualitative analysis.\n\nOverall, the graph shows that while $V_{out}$ attempts to follow $V_{in}$, it does so with some lag or attenuation, possibly due to the absence of the body effect, as described in the context. The output does not exactly mirror the input, indicating some level of distortion or phase shift, albeit without significant body effect interference.\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 2.25 (a) A circuit in which the source-bulk voltage varies with input level; (b) input and output voltages with no body effect; (c) input and output voltages with body effect.\n\nNow suppose that the substrate is tied to ground and body effect is significant. Then, as $V_{i n}$ and hence $V_{\\text {out }}$ become more positive, the potential difference between the source and the bulk increases, raising the value of $V_{T H}$. Equation (2.26) implies that $V_{i n}-V_{\\text {out }}$ must increase so as to maintain $I_{D}$ constant [Fig. 2.25(c)].\n\nBody effect is usually undesirable. The change in the threshold voltage, e.g., as in Fig. 2.25(a), often complicates the design of analog (and even digital) circuits. Device technologists balance $N_{s u b}$ and $C_{o x}$ to obtain a reasonable value for $\\gamma$.\n\n#### Example 2.5\n\nEquation (2.23) suggests that if $V_{S B}$ becomes negative, then $V_{T H}$ decreases. Is this correct?\n\n#### Solution\n\nYes, it is. If the bulk voltage of an NMOS device rises above its source voltage, $V_{T H}$ falls below $V_{T H 0}$. This observation proves useful in low-voltage design, where the performance of a circuit may suffer due to a high threshold voltage; one can bias the bulk to reduce $V_{T H}$. Unfortunately, this is not straightforward for NFETs because they typically share one substrate, but it can readily be applied to individual PFETs.\n\nChannel-Length Modulation In the analysis of channel pinch-off in Sec. 2.2, we noted that the actual length of the channel gradually decreases as the potential difference between the gate and the drain decreases. In other words, in (2.13), $L^{\\prime}$ is in fact a function of $V_{D S}$. This effect is called \"channel-length modulation.\" Writing $L^{\\prime}=L-\\Delta L$, i.e., $1 / L^{\\prime} \\approx(1+\\Delta L / L) / L$, and assuming a first-order relationship between $\\Delta"

As $V_{B}$ becomes more negative, more holes are drawn to the substrate connection, leaving a larger negative charge; i.e., as depicted in Fig. 2.23, the depletion region broadens. Recall from Eq. (2.1) that the threshold voltage is a function of the total charge in the depletion region since the gate charge must mirror $Q_{d}$ before an inversion layer is created. Thus, as $V_{B}$ decreases and $Q_{d}$ expands, $V_{T H}$ also rises.

For instance, consider the circuit in Fig. 2.25(a), first disregarding the body effect. We note that as $V_{\\text {in }}$ fluctuates, $V_{\\text {out }}$ follows the input closely since the drain current is equal to $I_{1}$. In reality, we can express\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{1}=\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}\\left(V_{\\text {in }}-V_{\\text {out }}-V_{T H}\\right)^{2} \\tag{2.26}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nsuggesting that $V_{\\text {in }}-V_{\\text {out }}$ remains constant if $I_{1}$ is consistent [Fig. 2.25(b)].\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:\n[\nname: M1, type: NMOS, ports: {S: Vout, D: VDD, G: Vin}\nname: I1, type: CurrentSource, value: I1, ports: {Np: Vout, Nn: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit consists of an NMOS transistor and a current source.

In contrast, $V_{out}$ follows a similar upward trend but with a noticeable curve, suggesting that the output voltage increases at a decreasing rate compared to the input voltage. This curve implies a deviation between $V_{in}$ and $V_{out}$, likely due to inherent circuit characteristics, such as capacitance or resistance, which may cause a delay or attenuation in the output.\n\nThere are no specific numerical values or units provided for the axes, emphasizing that the graph is intended to convey the general relationship and behavior between the input and output voltages rather than precise measurements.

When the bulk voltage of an NMOS device surpasses its source voltage, $V_{T H}$ falls below $V_{T H 0}$, which is beneficial for low-voltage design. Regrettably, this is not easily applicable to NFETs because they typically share a common substrate, but it can be conveniently applied to PFETs.\n\nChannel-Length Modulation In Sec. 2.2, we noted that the actual channel length diminishes as the potential difference between the gate and the drain diminishes.

This effect is termed \"channel-length modulation.\" Expressing $L^{\\prime}=L-\\Delta L$, implying $1 / L^{\\prime} \\approx(1+\\Delta L / L) / L$, and assuming a first-order relationship between $\\Delta L / L$ and $V_{D S}$, such as $\\Delta L / L=\\lambda V_{D S}$, we have, in saturation,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{D} \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}\\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\\right)^{2}\\left(1+\\lambda V_{D S}\\right) \\tag{2.27}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the \"channel-length modulation coefficient.\" Demonstrated in Fig. 2.26, this phenomenon leads to a non-zero slope in the $I_{D} / V_{D S}$ characteristic and, consequently, a non-ideal current source between D and S in saturation.

    "text": "---\n\nIn our examination of the MOSFET structure, we have employed several simplifying assumptions that, in many cases, do not accurately represent analog circuit behavior. This section delineates three second-order effects that are critical for our upcoming circuit analysis discussions. Further studies of additional phenomena encountered in nanometer-scale devices are addressed in Chapter 17.\n\nIn our examination of Figure 2.10, an implicit assumption was made that the transistor's bulk and source regions were grounded. What occurs when the bulk voltage of an NFET diminishes to a level below that of the source voltage, as depicted in Figure 2.22? Given that the source and drain junctions remain in reverse bias, we infer that the device continues to function correctly, albeit with certain alterations to its characteristics. To appreciate this impact, consider the illustration of an NMOS device with a negative bulk voltage in Figure 2.22. The source is connected to ground, the drain to VD, the gate to VG, and the body to a voltage VB that is negative.\n\nFigure 2.22 presents a cross-sectional view of an NMOS transistor, demonstrating how varying bulk voltages influence the device.\n\n**Component and Structure Identification:**\n- The diagrams reveal the structure of an NMOS transistor, with key regions identified:\n- **p-substrate:** The foundational layer of the transistor.\n- **n+ regions:** The source and drain areas, heavily doped with n-type material.\n- **p+ region:** A heavily doped p-type area, potentially representing a body or bulk connection.\n- **Gate (VG):** Located above the channel, separated by an insulating layer.\n\n**Connections and Interaction Details:**\n- The source is linked to ground (GND).\n- The drain is connected to VD.\n- The gate is associated with VG.\n- The body or bulk is depicted in two scenarios:\n  - In the left diagram, the bulk voltage (VB) is zero.\n  - In the right diagram, the bulk voltage (VB) is negative.\n\n**Labeling, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- **Qd:** Signifies the depletion charge region beneath the gate.\n- The left diagram illustrates a smaller depletion region with VB = 0, whereas the right diagram shows an expanded depletion region when VB is negative.\n- The diagrams showcase how a negative bulk voltage expands the depletion region by drawing more holes toward the substrate, augmenting the negative charge that remains.\n- The presence of the gate voltage (VG) is indicated by a voltage source symbol marked with positive and negative terminals.\n\nThese diagrams collectively explain how alterations in the bulk voltage modify the depletion region within an NMOS transistor, a vital aspect for comprehending its electrical properties and behavior.\n\nFor a detailed exploration of the variation in the depletion region charge with bulk voltage, refer to Figure 2.23, which presents cross-sectional diagrams of an NMOS transistor. These diagrams are labeled with relevant voltages and components to enhance comprehension.\n\nIn our subsequent analysis, we consider the drain current as the voltage Vx varies from negative infinity to zero, assuming a threshold voltage of 0.3 V, a body-effect coefficient of 0.4 V^1/2, and a 0.7 V effective potential. The resulting circuit diagram illustrates the NMOS transistor with connections to ground, VD, VG, and a voltage source for Vx. \n\nThe drain current's dependence on the source-bulk potential is then plotted, demonstrating the exponential increase as Vx approaches zero from a negative value. The graph shows the transition from an off state to an on state, indicating the influence of the threshold voltage on transistor operation.\n\nChannel-Length Modulation When analyzing channel pinch-off in Section 2.2, we observed that the channel length progressively diminishes as the voltage difference between the gate and drain decreases. This observation leads to the inclusion of channel-length modulation in Equation 2.13, which accounts for the length dependency on VDS. This effect, termed \"channel-length modulation,\" results in a non-zero slope in the ID/VDS characteristic, suggesting a non-ideal current source in saturation.\n\nIn our nanometer-scale design considerations, we note that transistor imperfections and deviations from square-law behavior are pronounced. Figure 2.26 illustrates the actual I-V characteristics of an NFET with a given width/length ratio and gate-source voltage range, contrasting these characteristics with those of a square-law device.\n\nSubthreshold Conduction Our initial analysis of the MOSFET assumed an abrupt transition to off state as VGS falls below VTH. However, reality reveals that a \"weak\" inversion layer persists and current flows when VGS is approximately VTH. For VGS below VTH, ID remains finite but follows an exponential dependence on VGS. Known as \"subthreshold conduction,\" this effect is expressed as ID = I0 * exp(VGS/ξVT) and is significant in low-power and analog circuit design.\n\nVoltage Limitations MOSFETs can experience undesirable effects when terminal voltage differences surpass certain thresholds, leading to potential damage or altered characteristics. High gate-source voltages can cause gate oxide breakdown, while excessive drain-source voltages can lead to punchthrough, as discussed in further detail in Chapter 17."

Additional phenomena pertinent to nanometer-scale devices are explored in Chapter 17.\n\n**Body Effect** \nIn the analysis depicted in Figure 2.10, it was implicitly assumed that both the bulk and the source of the transistor were grounded. But what are the implications if the bulk voltage of an NFET drops below the source voltage, as shown in Figure 2.22? Given that the source and drain junctions remain reverse-biased, we can infer that the device should continue to function correctly, albeit with some altered characteristics. To grasp the impact of this effect, let's consider...\n\n[Image Description: Figure 2.22 shows an NMOS transistor with a negative bulk voltage.

As $V_{B}$ becomes more negative, more holes are attracted to the substrate connection, leaving a larger negative charge behind; i.e., as depicted in Fig. 2.23, the depletion region becomes wider. Now recall from Eq. (2.1) that the threshold voltage is a function of the total charge in the depletion region because the gate charge must mirror $Q_{d}$ before an inversion layer is formed. Thus, as $V_{B}$ drops and $Q_{d}$ increases, $V_{T H}$ also increases. This phenomenon is termed the \"body effect\" or the \"back-gate effect.\"\n\nIt can be demonstrated that with body effect,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{T H}=V_{T H 0}+\\gamma\\left(\\sqrt{2 \\Phi_{F}+V_{S B}}-\\sqrt{\\left|2 \\Phi_{F}\\right|}\\right) \\tag{2.23}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $V_{T H 0}$ is given by $(2.1), \\gamma=\\sqrt{2 q \\epsilon_{s i} N_{s u b}} / C_{o x}$ denotes the body-effect coefficient, and $V_{S B}$ is the source-bulk potential difference [1]. The value of $\\gamma$ typically lies in the range of 0.3 to $0.4 \\mathrm{~V}^{1 / 2}$.\n\n#### Example 2.4\n\nIn Figure 2.24(a), plot the drain current if $V_{X}$ varies from $-\\infty$ to 0 .

That is,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n1.2 \\mathrm{~V}=0.3+0.4\\left(\\sqrt{0.7-V_{X 1}}-\\sqrt{0.7}\\right) \\tag{2.24}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand hence $V_{X 1}=-8.83 \\mathrm{~V}$.

For example, consider the circuit in Fig. 2.25(a), first ignoring body effect. We note that as $V_{\\text {in }}$ varies, $V_{\\text {out }}$ closely follows the input because the drain current remains equal to $I_{1}$. In fact, we can write\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{1}=\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}\\left(V_{\\text {in }}-V_{\\text {out }}-V_{T H}\\right)^{2} \\tag{2.26}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nconcluding that $V_{\\text {in }}-V_{\\text {out }}$ is constant if $I_{1}$ is constant [Fig. 2.25(b)].\n[Image Description: The circuit comprises an NMOS transistor and a current source. The NMOS transistor M1 has its source connected to Vout, drain to VDD, and gate to Vin. The current source I1 flows into Vout and out to ground.]\n\n[Image Description: The graph in Figure 2.25(b) is a time-domain waveform plot depicting the relationship between the input voltage ($V_{in}$) and the output voltage ($V_{out}$) over time. The x-axis represents time ($t$), though no specific units or scales are provided, indicating a qualitative analysis rather than a quantitative one. The y-axis represents voltage, with two distinct lines labeled as $V_{in}$ and $V_{out}$.]\n\nBoth $V_{in}$ and $V_{out}$ are shown as straight, parallel lines, suggesting a linear relationship between the input and output voltages. The lines are inclined upwards from left to right, indicating that both voltages are increasing over time. The fact that the lines are parallel suggests that the difference between $V_{in}$ and $V_{out}$ remains constant over the observed time period, implying no phase shift or delay between them.\n\nThis graph likely illustrates a scenario where the body effect is not present, as indicated by the context, allowing $V_{out}$ to follow $V_{in}$ closely without additional voltage drops or shifts. The absence of any markers, gridlines, or specific numerical values suggests the graph is intended to convey the general behavior of the circuit rather than precise measurements.\n\n[Image Description: The graph labeled (b) is a time-domain waveform illustrating the behavior of input and output voltages, specifically $V_{in}$ and $V_{out}$, over time. The horizontal axis represents time, denoted as \\( t \\), while the vertical axis represents voltage levels.]\n\nIn this graph, $V_{in}$ is depicted as a straight, upward-sloping line, indicating a linear increase in input voltage over time. In contrast, $V_{out}$ follows a similar upward trend but with a noticeable curvature, suggesting that the output voltage increases at a decreasing rate compared to the input voltage. This curvature implies that there is a deviation between $V_{in}$ and $V_{out}$, likely due to some inherent characteristics of the circuit, such as capacitance or resistance, which might cause a lag or attenuation in the output.\n\nThere are no specific numerical values or units provided for the axes, emphasizing that the graph is intended to convey the general relationship and behavior between the input and output voltages rather than precise measurements. The absence of gridlines or markers further supports this qualitative analysis.\n\nOverall, the graph shows that while $V_{out}$ attempts to follow $V_{in}$, it does so with some lag or attenuation, possibly due to the absence of the body effect, as described in the context. The output does not exactly mirror the input, indicating some level of distortion or phase shift, albeit without significant body effect interference.\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 2.25 (a) A circuit in which the source-bulk voltage varies with input level; (b) input and output voltages with no body effect; (c) input and output voltages with body effect.\n\nNow suppose that the substrate is tied to ground and body effect is significant. Then, as $V_{i n}$ and hence $V_{\\text {out }}$ become more positive, the potential difference between the source and the bulk increases, raising the value of $V_{T H}$. Equation (2.26) implies that $V_{i n}-V_{\\text {out }}$ must increase so as to maintain $I_{D}$ constant [Fig. 2.25(c)].\n\nBody effect is usually undesirable. The change in the threshold voltage, e.g., as in Fig. 2.25(a), often complicates the design of analog (and even digital) circuits. Device technologists balance $N_{s u b}$ and $C_{o x}$ to obtain a reasonable value for $\\gamma$.\n\n#### Example 2.5\n\nEquation (2.23) suggests that if $V_{S B}$ becomes negative, then $V_{T H}$ decreases. Is this correct?\n\n#### Solution\n\nYes, it is. If the bulk voltage of an NMOS device rises above its source voltage, $V_{T H}$ falls below $V_{T H 0}$. This observation proves useful in low-voltage design, where the performance of a circuit may suffer due to a high threshold voltage; one can bias the bulk to reduce $V_{T H}$. Unfortunately, this is not straightforward for NFETs because they typically share one substrate, but it can readily be applied to individual PFETs.\n\n**Channel-Length Modulation**\nIn the analysis of channel pinch-off in Sec. 2.2, we noted that the actual length of the channel gradually decreases as the potential difference between the gate and the drain decreases. In other words, in (2.13), $L^{\\prime}$ is in fact a function of $V_{D S}$. This effect is called \"channel-length modulation.\" Writing $L^{\\prime}=L-\\Delta L$, i.e., $1 / L^{\\prime} \\approx(1+\\Delta L / L) / L$, and assuming a first-order relationship between $\\Delta L / L$ and $V_{D S}$, such as $\\Delta L / L=\\lambda V_{D S}$, we have, in saturation,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{D} \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}\\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\\right)^{2}\\left(1+\\lambda V_{D S}\\right) \\tag{2.27}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the \"channel-length modulation coefficient.\" Illustrated in Fig. 2.26, this phenomenon results in a nonzero slope in the $I_{D} / V_{D S}$ characteristic and hence a nonideal current source between D and S in saturation.

    "text": "Our examination of the Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) structure has involved several simplifying assumptions, not all of which are applicable to analog circuits. This section delves into three significant second-order effects that are crucial for our subsequent circuit analyses. Additional phenomena related to nanometer devices are explored in Chapter 17.\n\n**Body Effect** When analyzing Figure 2.10, we implicitly assumed that the transistor's bulk and source were grounded. However, what are the implications if the bulk voltage of an NFET drops below the source voltage (Figure 2.22)? As the S and D junctions remain reverse-biased, the device is expected to continue functioning, albeit with some altered characteristics. To explore this effect, consider the scenario depicted in Figure 2.22, where an NMOS transistor has a negative bulk voltage (VB < 0). The source is connected to ground, the drain to VD, the gate to VG, and the body to a negative voltage VB.\n\n**Identification of Components and Structure:** The diagrams illustrate an NMOS transistor structure with key regions labeled: the p-substrate as the base layer, n+ regions representing the source and drain, a p+ region indicating a body or bulk connection, and the gate (VG) positioned above the channel, separated by an insulating layer.\n\n**Connections and Interactions:** The source is connected to ground (GND), the drain to a voltage source labeled VD, the gate to a voltage source labeled VG, and the body or bulk connection is depicted in two scenarios: with VB = 0 in the left diagram and with a negative VB in the right diagram.\n\n**Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:** Qd represents the depletion charge region under the gate. The left diagram shows a smaller depletion region with VB = 0, while the right diagram shows a wider depletion region when VB is negative. The diagrams illustrate how a negative bulk voltage increases the depletion region by attracting more holes to the substrate, thereby increasing the negative charge left behind. The presence of the gate voltage (VG) is indicated by a voltage source symbol with positive and negative terminals.\n\n**Overall Explanation:** The diagrams provide a visual explanation of how varying the bulk voltage affects the depletion region in an NMOS transistor, which is crucial for understanding its electrical characteristics and behavior.\n\n**Figure 2.23 Variation of Depletion Region Charge with Bulk Voltage** The image depicts two cross-sectional diagrams of an NMOS transistor, illustrating the variation of the depletion region charge with changes in bulk voltage (VB). The diagrams are labeled with key voltages and components to aid understanding.\n\n**Left Diagram (VB = 0):** The NMOS transistor is built on a p-type substrate with p+ and n+ regions representing the source and drain, respectively. A gate is placed above the channel, separated by an insulating layer. The gate voltage (VG) is applied, but no inversion layer is formed as VG is less than the threshold voltage (VTH). The depletion region (Qd) is visible under the gate, indicated by a few negative charges. The bulk voltage (VB) is set to 0, indicating no additional charge is attracted to the substrate.\n\n**Right Diagram (VB < 0):** The structure is similar to the left diagram with the same components. The bulk voltage (VB) is negative, attracting more holes to the substrate connection. This results in a wider depletion region (Qd), as indicated by an increased number of negative charges under the gate. The gate voltage (VG) remains applied, but still no inversion layer forms since VG is less than VTH.\n\n**Overall Illustration:** These diagrams illustrate how the depletion region widens as the bulk voltage becomes more negative, highlighting the impact on the NMOS transistor's electrical characteristics.\n\n**Figure 2.23 Variation of Depletion Region Charge with Bulk Voltage** $V_{S}=V_{D}=0$, and $V_{G}$ is somewhat less than $V_{T H}$, so that a depletion region is formed under the gate but no inversion layer exists. As $V_{B}$ becomes more negative, more holes are attracted to the substrate connection, leaving a larger negative charge behind; i.e., as depicted in Figure 2.23, the depletion region becomes wider. Now recall from Eq. (2.1) that the threshold voltage is a function of the total charge in the depletion region because the gate charge must mirror $Q_{d}$ before an inversion layer is formed. Thus, as $V_{B}$ drops and $Q_{d}$ increases, $V_{T H}$ also increases. This phenomenon is called the \"body effect\" or the \"back-gate effect.\"\n\n**Equation (2.23)** The equation for the threshold voltage with body effect is given by:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{T H}=V_{T H 0}+\\gamma\\left(\\sqrt{2 \\Phi_{F}+V_{S B}}-\\sqrt{\\left|2 \\Phi_{F}\\right|}\\right) \\tag{2.23}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $V_{T H 0}$ is given by (2.1), $\\gamma=\\sqrt{2 q \\epsilon_{s i} N_{s u b}} / C_{o x}$ denotes the body-effect coefficient, and $V_{S B}$ is the source-bulk potential difference.\n\n**Example 2.4** In Figure 2.24(a), plot the drain current if $V_{X}$ varies from $-\\infty$ to 0 . Assume $V_{T H 0}=0.3 \\mathrm{~V}, \\gamma=0.4 \\mathrm{~V}^{1 / 2}$, and $2 \\Phi_{F}=0.7 \\mathrm{~V}$.\n\n**Solution** If $V_{X}$ is sufficiently negative, the threshold voltage of $M_{1}$ exceeds 1.2 V and the device is off. That is,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n1.2 \\mathrm{~V}=0.3+0.4\\left(\\sqrt{0.7-V_{X 1}}-\\sqrt{0.7}\\right) \\tag{2.24}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand hence $V_{X 1}=-8.83 \\mathrm{~V}$. For $V_{X 1}<V_{X}<0, I_{D}$ increases according to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{D}=\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}\\left[V_{G S}-V_{T H 0}-\\gamma\\left(\\sqrt{2 \\Phi_{F}-V_{X}}-\\sqrt{2 \\Phi_{F}}\\right)\\right]^{2} \\tag{2.25}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFigure 2.24(b) shows the resulting behavior.\n\n**Body Effect in Circuit Design** For body effect to manifest itself, the bulk potential, $V_{\\text {sub }}$, need not change: if the source voltage varies with respect to $V_{\\text {sub }}$, the same phenomenon occurs. For example, consider the circuit in Figure 2.25(a), first ignoring body effect. We note that as $V_{\\text {in }}$ varies, $V_{\\text {out }}$ closely follows the input because the drain current remains equal to $I_{1}$. In fact, we can write\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{1}=\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}\\left(V_{\\text {in }}-V_{\\text {out }}-V_{T H}\\right)^{2} \\tag{2.26}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nconcluding that $V_{\\text {in }}-V_{\\text {out }}$ is constant if $I_{1}$ is constant [Figure 2.25(b)].\n\n**Now suppose that the substrate is tied to ground and body effect is significant.** Then, as $V_{i n}$ and hence $V_{\\text {out }}$ become more positive, the potential difference between the source and the bulk increases, raising the value of $V_{T H}$. Equation (2.26) implies that $V_{i n}-V_{\\text {out }}$ must increase so as to maintain $I_{D}$ constant [Figure 2.25(c)].\n\n**Unwanted Body Effect** Body effect is usually undesirable. The change in the threshold voltage, e.g., as in Figure 2.25(a), often complicates the design of analog (and even digital) circuits. Device technologists balance $N_{s u b}$ and $C_{o x}$ to obtain a reasonable value for $\\gamma$.\n\n**Example 2.5** Equation (2.23) suggests that if $V_{S B}$ becomes negative, then $V_{T H}$ decreases. Is this correct?\n\n**Solution** Yes, it is. If the bulk voltage of an NMOS device rises above its source voltage, $V_{T H}$ falls below $V_{T H 0}$. This observation proves useful in low-voltage design, where the performance of a circuit may suffer due to a high threshold voltage; one can bias the bulk to reduce $V_{T H}$. Unfortunately, this is not straightforward for NFETs because they typically share one substrate, but it can readily be applied to individual PFETs.\n\n**Channel-Length Modulation** In the analysis of channel pinch-off in Sec. 2.2, we noted that the actual length of the channel gradually decreases as the potential difference between the gate and the drain decreases. In other words, in (2.13), $L^{\\prime}$ is in fact a function of $V_{D S}$. This effect is called \"channel-length modulation.\" Writing $L^{\\prime}=L-\\Delta L$, i.e., $1 / L^{\\prime} \\approx(1+\\Delta L / L) / L$, and assuming a first-order relationship between $\\Delta L / L$ and $V_{D S}$, such as $\\Delta L / L=\\lambda V_{D S}$, we have, in saturation,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{D} \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}\\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\\right)^{2}\\left(1+\\lambda V_{D S}\\right) \\tag{2.27}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the \"channel-length modulation coefficient.\" Illustrated in Figure 2.26, this phenomenon results in a nonzero slope in the $I_{D} / V_{D S}$ characteristic and hence a nonideal current source between D and S in saturation. The parameter $\\lambda$ represents the relative variation in length for a given increment in $V_{D S}$. Thus, for longer channels, $\\lambda$ is smaller.\n\n**Example 2.6** Is there channel-length modulation in the triode region?\n\n**Solution** No, there is not. In the triode region, the channel continuously stretches from the source to the drain, experiencing no pinch-off. Thus, the drain voltage does not modulate the length of the channel.\n\n**Discrepancy in Equations** The reader may then observe a discontinuity in the equations as the device goes from the triode region to saturation:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{D, t r i} & =\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}\\left[2\\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\\right) V_{D S}-V_{D S}^{2}\\right]  \\tag{2.28}\\\\\nI_{D, s a t} & =\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}\\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\\right)^{2}\\left(1+\\lambda V_{D S}\\right) \\tag{2.29}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe former yields $(1 / 2) \\mu_{n} C_{o x} W / L\\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\\right)^{2}$ at the edge of the triode region, whereas the latter exhibits an additional factor of $1+\\lambda V_{D S}$. This discrepancy is removed in more complex models of MOSFETs (Chapter 17).\n\n**Modified Transconductance Equations** With channel-length modulation, some of the expressions derived for $g_{m}$ must be modified. Equations (2.18) and (2.19) are respectively rewritten as\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ng_{m} & =\\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}\\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\\right)\\left(1+\\lambda V_{D S}\\right)  \\tag{2.30}\\\\\n& =\\sqrt{2 \\mu_{n} C_{o x}(W / L) I_{D}\\left(1+\\lambda V_{D S}\\right)} \\tag{2.31}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhile Eq. (2.20) remains unchanged.\n\n**Nanometer Design Notes** Nanometer transistors suffer from various imperfections and markedly depart from square-law behavior. Shown below are the actual I-V characteristics of an NFET with $W / L=5 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} / 40 \\mathrm{~nm}$ for $V_{G S}=0.3 \\mathrm{~V} \\cdots 0.8 \\mathrm{~V}$. Also plotted are the characteristics of a square-law device of the same dimensions. Despite our best efforts to match the latter device to the former, we still observe significant differences.\n\n**Example 2.7** Keeping all other parameters constant, plot the $I_{D} / V_{D S}$ characteristic of a MOSFET for $L=L_{1}$ and $L=2 L_{1}$.\n\n**Solution** Writing\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{D}=\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}\\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\\right)^{2}\\left(1+\\lambda V_{D S}\\right) \\tag{2.32}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand $\\lambda \\propto 1 / L$, we note that if the length is doubled, the slope of $I_{D}$ vs. $V_{D S}$ is divided by four because $\\partial I_{D} / \\partial V_{D S} \\propto$ $\\lambda / L \\propto 1 / L^{2}$ (Figure 2.27). (This is true only if $V_{G S}-V_{T H}$ is constant.) For a given gate-source overdrive, a larger $L$ gives a more ideal current source while degrading the current capability of the device. Thus, $W$ may need to be increased proportionally. In fact, if we double $W$ to restore $I_{D}$ to its original value, the slope also doubles. In other words, for a required drain current and a given overdrive, doubling the length reduces the slope by a factor of 2.\n\n**Figure 2.27 Effect of Doubling Channel Length** The graph illustrates the effect of doubling the channel length on the drain current ($I_{D}$) versus drain-source voltage ($V_{DS}$) characteristics of a MOSFET. This is a plot with $I_{D}$ on the vertical axis and $V_{DS}$ on the horizontal axis. The axes are not labeled with specific units, but $I_{D}$ is typically measured in amperes (A) and $V_{DS}$ in volts (V).\n\n**The graph presents two curves:** one for a channel length $L = L_1$ and another for a doubled channel length $L = 2L_1$. Both curves start from the origin, indicating that the drain current is zero when the drain-source voltage is zero.\n\n**As $V_{DS}$ increases:** both curves initially rise sharply, indicating a rapid increase in drain current. However, the curve for $L = L_1$ rises more steeply than the curve for $L = 2L_1$. This suggests that a shorter channel length allows for a higher rate of increase in current as $V_{DS}$ increases.\n\n**As the curves continue:** they both begin to flatten, indicating that the current approaches a saturation point where increases in $V_{DS}$ result in smaller increases in $I_{D}$. The $L = L_1$ curve reaches a higher saturation current than the $L = 2L_1$ curve, demonstrating that a longer channel length reduces the drain current for a given $V_{DS}$.\n\n**Dotted lines are used to indicate the differences in current levels:** between the two curves at a given $V_{DS}$, emphasizing the reduction in current capability with increased channel length. This behavior aligns with the discussion in the context provided, which states that doubling the channel length reduces the slope of the $I_{D}$ vs. $V_{DS}$ characteristics, thereby degrading the current capability of the device.\n\n**Figure 2.27 Effect of Doubling Channel Length** The linear approximation $\\Delta L / L \\propto V_{D S}$ becomes less accurate in short-channel transistors, resulting in a variable slope in the saturated $I_{D} / V_{D S}$ characteristics. We return to this issue in Chapter 17.\n\n**Dependence of $I_{D}$ on $V_{D S}$** The dependence of $I_{D}$ upon $V_{D S}$ in saturation may suggest that the bias current of a MOSFET can be defined by the proper choice of the drain-source voltage, allowing freedom in the choice of $V_{G S}-V_{T H}$. However, since the dependence on $V_{D S}$ is much weaker, the drain-source voltage is not used to set the current. That is, we always consider $V_{G S}-V_{T H}$ as the current-defining parameter. The effect of $V_{D S}$ on $I_{D}$ is usually considered an error, and it is studied in Chapter 5.\n\n**Subthreshold Conduction** In our analysis of the MOSFET, we have assumed that the device turns off abruptly as $V_{G S}$ drops below $V_{T H}$. In reality, for $V_{G S} \\approx V_{T H}$, a \"weak\" inversion layer still exists, and some current flows from D to S. Even for $V_{G S}<V_{T H}$, $I_{D}$ is finite but exhibits an exponential dependence on $V_{G S}[2,3]$. Called \"subthreshold conduction"

As $V_{B}$ becomes more negative, more holes are attracted to the substrate connection, leaving a larger negative charge behind; i.e., as depicted in Fig. 2.23, the depletion region becomes wider. Now recall from Eq. (2.1) that the threshold voltage is a function of the total charge in the depletion region because the gate charge must mirror $Q_{d}$ before an inversion layer is formed.

The NMOS transistor M1 has its source connected to Vout, drain to VDD, and gate to Vin. The current source I1 flows into Vout and out to ground.\n\nImage Description: The graph in Figure 2.25(b) is a time-domain waveform plot depicting the relationship between the input voltage ($V_{in}$) and the output voltage ($V_{out}$) over time. The x-axis represents time ($t$), though no specific units or scales are provided, indicating a qualitative analysis rather than a quantitative one. The y-axis represents voltage, with two distinct lines labeled as $V_{in}$ and $V_{out}$.\n\nBoth $V_{in}$ and $V_{out}$ are shown as straight, parallel lines, suggesting a linear relationship between the input and output voltages. The lines are inclined upwards from left to right, indicating that both voltages are increasing over time. The fact that the lines are parallel suggests that the difference between $V_{in}$ and $V_{out}$ remains constant over the observed time period, implying no phase shift or delay between them.\n\nThis graph likely illustrates a scenario where the body effect is not present, as indicated by the context, allowing $V_{out}$ to follow $V_{in}$ closely without additional voltage drops or shifts. The absence of any markers, gridlines, or specific numerical values suggests the graph is intended to convey the general behavior of the circuit rather than precise measurements.\n\nImage Description: The graph labeled (b) is a time-domain waveform illustrating the behavior of input and output voltages, specifically $V_{in}$ and $V_{out}$, over time. The horizontal axis represents time, denoted as \\( t \\), while the vertical axis represents voltage levels.\n\nIn this graph, $V_{in}$ is depicted as a straight, upward-sloping line, indicating a linear increase in input voltage over time. In contrast, $V_{out}$ follows a similar upward trend but with a noticeable curvature, suggesting that the output voltage increases at a decreasing rate compared to the input voltage. This curvature implies that there is a deviation between $V_{in}$ and $V_{out}$, likely due to some inherent characteristics of the circuit, such as capacitance or resistance, which might cause a lag or attenuation in the output.\n\nThere are no specific numerical values or units provided for the axes, emphasizing that the graph is intended to convey the general relationship and behavior between the input and output voltages rather than precise measurements. The absence of gridlines or markers further supports this qualitative analysis.\n\nOverall, the graph shows that while $V_{out}$ attempts to follow $V_{in}$, it does so with some lag or attenuation, possibly due to the absence of the body effect, as described in the context. The output does not exactly mirror the input, indicating some level of distortion or phase shift, albeit without significant body effect interference.\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 2.25 (a) A circuit in which the source-bulk voltage varies with input level; (b) input and output voltages with no body effect; (c) input and output voltages with body effect.\n\nNow suppose that the substrate is tied to ground and body effect is significant. Then, as $V_{i n}$ and hence $V_{\\text {out }}$ become more positive, the potential difference between the source and the bulk increases, raising the value of $V_{T H}$. Equation (2.26) implies that $V_{i n}-V_{\\text {out }}$ must increase so as to maintain $I_{D}$ constant [Fig. 2.25(c)].\n\nBody effect is usually undesirable. The change in the threshold voltage, e.g., as in Fig. 2.25(a), often complicates the design of analog (and even digital) circuits.

Is this correct?\n\nSolution\n\nYes, it is. If the bulk voltage of an NMOS device rises above its source voltage, $V_{T H}$ falls below $V_{T H 0}$. This observation proves useful in low-voltage design, where the performance of a circuit may suffer due to a high threshold voltage; one can bias the bulk to reduce $V_{T H}$.

This effect is called \"channel-length modulation.\" Writing $L^{\\prime}=L-\\Delta L$, i.e., $1 / L^{\\prime} \\approx(1+\\Delta L / L) / L$, and assuming a first-order relationship between $\\Delta L / L$ and $V_{D S}$, such as $\\Delta L / L=\\lambda V_{D S}$, we have, in saturation,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{D} \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}\\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\\right)^{2}\\left(1+\\lambda V_{D S}\\right) \\tag{2.27}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the \"channel-length modulation coefficient.\" Illustrated in Fig. 2.26, this phenomenon results in a nonzero slope in the $I_{D} / V_{D S}$ characteristic and hence a nonideal current source between D and S in saturation. The parameter $\\lambda$ represents the relative variation in length for a given increment in $V_{D S}$. Thus, for longer channels, $\\lambda$ is smaller.\n\nImage Description: The graph in Figure 2.26 is a plot representing the drain current ($I_D$) versus the drain-source voltage ($V_{DS}$) for a MOSFET transistor, illustrating the effect of channel-length modulation in the saturation region.\n\n1.

    "text": "Our examination of the Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) structure to this point has involved several simplifying assumptions, not all of which are applicable in many analog circuits. In this section, we will discuss three second-order effects that are crucial for our subsequent circuit analyses. Other phenomena present in nanometer devices are examined in Chapter 17.\n\n**Body Effect**\nIn our analysis of Figure 2.10, we implicitly assumed that the bulk and the source of the transistor were grounded. But what occurs if the bulk voltage of an N-type MOS (NFET) falls below the source voltage (Figure 2.22)? Given that the source and drain junctions remain reverse-biased, we can infer that the device will continue to operate correctly, but some of its characteristics may alter. To comprehend this effect, consider\n\nThe image in Figure 2.22 depicts an NMOS transistor with a negative bulk voltage. The source is connected to ground, the drain to VD, the gate to VG, and the body to a negative voltage VB.\n\nFigure 2.22 NMOS device with negative bulk voltage.\n\nThe diagrams illustrate two cross-sectional views of an NMOS transistor, depicting the effects of varying bulk voltages on the device.\n\n**Identification of Components and Structure:**\n- The diagrams showcase an NMOS transistor structure with key areas labeled:\n- **p-substrate:** The foundational layer of the transistor.\n- **n+ regions:** The source and drain regions, heavily doped with n-type material.\n- **p+ region:** A heavily doped p-type region, potentially indicating a body or bulk connection.\n- **Gate (VG):** Situated above the channel, separated by an insulating layer.\n\n**Connections and Interactions:**\n- The source is connected to ground (GND).\n- The drain is connected to a voltage source labeled VD.\n- The gate is connected to a voltage source labeled VG.\n- The body or bulk connection is depicted in two scenarios:\n- In the left diagram, the bulk voltage (VB) is zero.\n- In the right diagram, the bulk voltage (VB) is negative.\n\n**Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- **Qd:** Denotes the depletion charge region under the gate.\n- The left diagram displays a smaller depletion region with VB = 0, whereas the right diagram shows a broader depletion region when VB is negative.\n- The diagrams illustrate how a negative bulk voltage expands the depletion region by attracting more holes to the substrate, consequently increasing the negative charge left behind.\n- The presence of the gate voltage (VG) is indicated by a voltage source symbol with positive and negative terminals.\n\nOverall, the diagrams visually explain how altering the bulk voltage impacts the depletion region in an NMOS transistor, which is vital for understanding its electrical characteristics and behavior.\n\nFigure 2.22 NMOS device with negative bulk voltage.\n\nFigure 2.23 illustrates the variation of the depletion region charge with changes in bulk voltage (VB). The diagrams are labeled with key voltages and components to aid understanding.\n\n**Left Diagram (VB = 0):**\n1. **Components and Structure:**\n- The NMOS transistor is constructed on a p-type substrate.\n- It includes p+ and n+ regions representing the source and drain, respectively.\n- A gate is placed above the channel, separated by an insulating layer.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- The gate voltage (VG) is applied, but no inversion layer is formed as VG is less than the threshold voltage (VTH).\n- The depletion region (Qd) is visible under the gate, indicated by a few negative charges.\n- The bulk voltage (VB) is set to 0, indicating no additional charge is attracted to the substrate.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- The p-substrate and the n+ source/drain regions are clearly labeled.\n- The depletion region is marked as Qd.\n\n**Right Diagram (VB < 0):**\n1. **Components and Structure:**\n- Similar structure as the left diagram with the same components.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- The bulk voltage (VB) is negative, attracting more holes to the substrate connection.\n- This results in a wider depletion region (Qd), as indicated by an increased number of negative charges under the gate.\n- The gate voltage (VG) remains applied, but still no inversion layer forms since VG is less than VTH.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- The diagram clearly shows the effect of a negative bulk voltage on the depletion region width.\n- The p-substrate and n+ regions are labeled similarly to the left diagram.\n\nOverall, these diagrams illustrate how the depletion region widens as the bulk voltage becomes more negative, highlighting the impact on the NMOS transistor's electrical characteristics.\n\nFigure 2.23 Variation of depletion region charge with bulk voltage.\n\nAssuming $V_{S}=V_{D}=0$, and $V_{G}$ is slightly less than $V_{T H}$, a depletion region is formed under the gate, but no inversion layer exists. As $V_{B}$ becomes more negative, more holes are attracted to the substrate connection, leaving a larger negative charge behind; that is, as depicted in Figure 2.23, the depletion region becomes wider. Now recall from Equation (2.1) that the threshold voltage is a function of the total charge in the depletion region because the gate charge must mirror $Q_{d}$ before an inversion layer is formed. Thus, as $V_{B}$ drops and $Q_{d}$ increases, $V_{T H}$ also increases. This phenomenon is known as the \"body effect\" or the \"back-gate effect.\"\n\nIt can be demonstrated that with the body effect,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{T H}=V_{T H 0}+\\gamma\\left(\\sqrt{2 \\Phi_{F}+V_{S B}}-\\sqrt{\\left|2 \\Phi_{F}\\right|}\\right) \\tag{2.23}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $V_{T H 0}$ is given by (2.1), $\\gamma=\\sqrt{2 q \\epsilon_{s i} N_{s u b}} / C_{o x}$ represents the body-effect coefficient, and $V_{S B}$ is the source-bulk potential difference [1]. The value of $\\gamma$ typically lies between the range of 0.3 to $0.4 \\mathrm{~V}^{1 / 2}$.\n\n#### Example 2.4\n\nIn Figure 2.24(a), plot the drain current if $V_{X}$ varies from $-\\infty$ to 0 . Assume $V_{T H 0}=0.3 \\mathrm{~V}, \\gamma=0.4 \\mathrm{~V}^{1 / 2}$, and $2 \\Phi_{F}=0.7 \\mathrm{~V}$.\nThe circuit consists of an NMOS transistor M1 with the gate connected to a node labeled g1, the drain connected to a node labeled d1, and the source connected to ground. There is a voltage source of 2V connected between node d1 and ground. The voltage Vx is applied to the source-bulk potential of M1.\n\nFigure 2.24\n\n#### Solution\n\nIf $V_{X}$ is sufficiently negative, the threshold voltage of $M_{1}$ exceeds 1.2 V, and the device is off. That is,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n1.2 \\mathrm{~V}=0.3+0.4\\left(\\sqrt{0.7-V_{X 1}}-\\sqrt{0.7}\\right) \\tag{2.24}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand hence $V_{X 1}=-8.83 \\mathrm{~V}$. For $V_{X 1}<V_{X}<0, I_{D}$ increases according to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{D}=\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}\\left[V_{G S}-V_{T H 0}-\\gamma\\left(\\sqrt{2 \\Phi_{F}-V_{X}}-\\sqrt{2 \\Phi_{F}}\\right)\\right]^{2} \\tag{2.25}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFigure 2.24(b) shows the resulting behavior.\n\nFor the body effect to manifest, the bulk potential, $V_{\\text {sub }}$, need not change: if the source voltage varies with respect to $V_{\\text {sub }}$, the same phenomenon occurs. For instance, consider the circuit in Figure 2.25(a), first ignoring the body effect. We note that as $V_{\\text {in }}$ varies, $V_{\\text {out }}$ closely follows the input because the drain current remains equal to $I_{1}$. In fact, we can write\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{1}=\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}\\left(V_{\\text {in }}-V_{\\text {out }}-V_{T H}\\right)^{2} \\tag{2.26}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nconcluding that $V_{\\text {in }}-V_{\\text {out }}$ is constant if $I_{1}$ is constant [Figure 2.25(b)].\nThe circuit consists of an NMOS transistor and a current source. The NMOS transistor M1 has its source connected to Vout, drain to VDD, and gate to Vin. The current source I1 flows into Vout and out to ground.\n\nFigure 2.25 (a) A circuit in which the source-bulk voltage varies with input level; (b) input and output voltages with no body effect; (c) input and output voltages with body effect.\n\nNow suppose that the substrate is tied to ground and the body effect is significant. Then, as $V_{i n}$ and hence $V_{\\text {out }}$ become more positive, the potential difference between the source and the bulk increases, raising the value of $V_{T H}$. Equation (2.26) implies that $V_{i n}-V_{\\text {out }}$ must increase so as to maintain $I_{D}$ constant [Figure 2.25(c)].\n\nThe body effect is usually undesirable. The change in the threshold voltage, e.g., as in Figure 2.25(a), often complicates the design of analog (and even digital) circuits. Device technologists balance $N_{s u b}$ and $C_{o x}$ to obtain a reasonable value for $\\gamma$.\n\n#### Example 2.5\n\nEquation (2.23) suggests that if $V_{S B}$ becomes negative, then $V_{T H}$ decreases. Is this correct?\n\n#### Solution\n\nYes, it is. If the bulk voltage of an NMOS device rises above its source voltage, $V_{T H}$ falls below $V_{T H 0}$. This observation is useful in low-voltage design, where the performance of a circuit may suffer due to a high threshold voltage; one can bias the bulk to reduce $V_{T H}$. Unfortunately, this is not straightforward for NFETs because they typically share one substrate, but it can readily be applied to individual PFETs.\n\n**Channel-Length Modulation**\nIn our analysis of channel pinch-off in Sec. 2.2, we noted that the actual length of the channel gradually decreases as the potential difference between the gate and the drain decreases. In other words, in (2.13), $L^{\\prime}$ is indeed a function of $V_{D S}$. This effect is called \"channel-length modulation.\" Writing $L^{\\prime}=L-\\Delta L$, i.e., $1 / L^{\\prime} \\approx(1+\\Delta L / L) / L$, and assuming a first-order relationship between $\\Delta L / L$ and $V_{D S}$, such as $\\Delta L / L=\\lambda V_{D S}$, we have, in saturation,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{D} \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}\\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\\right)^{2}\\left(1+\\lambda V_{D S}\\right) \\tag{2.27}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the \"channel-length modulation coefficient.\" As illustrated in Figure 2.26, this phenomenon results in a nonzero slope in the $I_{D} / V_{D S}$ characteristic and hence a nonideal current source between D and S in saturation. The parameter $\\lambda$ represents the relative variation in length for a given increment in $V_{D S}$. Thus, for longer channels, $\\lambda$ is smaller.\n\nFigure 2.26 Finite saturation region slope resulting from channel-length modulation.\n\n#### Example 2.6\n\nIs there channel-length modulation in the triode region?\n\n#### Solution\n\nNo, there is not. In the triode region, the channel continuously stretches from the source to the drain, experiencing no pinch-off. Thus, the drain voltage does not modulate the length of the channel.\n\nThe reader may then observe a discontinuity in the equations as the device goes from the triode region to saturation:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{D, t r i} & =\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}\\left[2\\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\\right) V_{D S}-V_{D S}^{2}\\right]  \\tag{2.28}\\\\\nI_{D, s a t} & =\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}\\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\\right)^{2}\\left(1+\\lambda V_{D S}\\right) \\tag{2.29}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe former yields $(1 / 2) \\mu_{n} C_{o x} W / L\\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\\right)^{2}$ at the edge of the triode region, whereas the latter exhibits an additional factor of $1+\\lambda V_{D S}$. This discrepancy is removed in more complex models of MOSFETs (Chapter 17).\n\nWith channel-length modulation, some of the expressions derived for $g_{m}$ must be modified. Equations (2.18) and (2.19) are respectively rewritten as\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ng_{m} & =\\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}\\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\\right)\\left(1+\\lambda V_{D S}\\right)  \\tag{2.30}\\\\\n& =\\sqrt{2 \\mu_{n} C_{o x}(W / L) I_{D}\\left(1+\\lambda V_{D S}\\right)} \\tag{2.31}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhile Eq. (2.20) remains unchanged.\n\n#### Nanometer Design Notes\n\nNanometer transistors suffer from various imperfections and significantly deviate from square-law behavior. Shown below are the actual I-V characteristics of an NFET with $W / L=5 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} / 40 \\mathrm{~nm}$ for $V_{G S}=0.3 \\mathrm{~V} \\cdots 0.8 \\mathrm{~V}$. Also plotted are the characteristics of a square-law device of the same dimensions. Despite our best efforts to match the latter device to the former, we still observe significant differences.\n\nThe graph titled \"I-V characteristics\" illustrates the drain current ($I_D$) versus the drain-source voltage ($V_{DS}$) for an NFET with dimensions $W / L = 5 \\mu m / 40 nm$. The $I_D$ is measured in milliamperes (mA) and is plotted on the vertical axis, while $V_{DS}$ is measured in volts (V). The graph uses a linear scale for both axes, with $I_D$ ranging from 0 to 3.5 mA and $V_{DS}$ ranging from 0 to 1 V.\n\nThe graph features multiple curves, each representing different gate-source voltages ($V_{GS}$) ranging from 0.3 V to 0.8 V. The curves show the behavior of the NFET under different $V_{GS}$ values. The general trend observed is that as $V_{GS}$ increases, the drain current $I_D$ also increases for a given $V_{DS}$. This is indicative of the transistor entering the saturation region at higher $V_{DS}$ values.\n\nThe curves start at the origin (0,0) and rise sharply initially, indicating a rapid increase in current with increasing voltage, which then tapers off, showing a slower rate of increase in current as the device approaches saturation. This behavior deviates from the ideal square-law characteristics, as noted in the context, due to the imperfections in nanometer-scale transistors.\n\nKey features include the initial steep slope of each curve, which becomes more pronounced with higher $V_{GS}$ values, and the eventual flattening of the curves as they approach saturation. These characteristics highlight the non-linear behavior of the device under varying gate-source voltages. The graph is marked with gridlines at regular intervals to aid in reading specific values, though no specific data points are annotated.\n\n#### Example 2.7\nKeeping all other parameters constant, plot the $I_{D} / V_{D S}$ characteristic of a MOSFET for $L=L_{1}$ and $L=2 L_{1}$.\n\n#### Solution\n\nWriting\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nI_{D}=\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}\\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\\right)^{2}\\left(1+\\lambda V_{D S}\\right) \\tag{2.32}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand $\\lambda \\propto 1 / L$, we note that if the length is doubled, the slope of $I_{D}$ vs. $V_{D S}$ is divided by four because $\\partial I_{D} / \\partial V_{D S} \\propto$ $\\lambda / L \\propto 1 / L^{2}$ (Figure 2.27). (This is true only if $V_{G S}-V_{T H}$ is constant.) For a given gate-source overdrive, a larger $L$ gives a more ideal current source while degrading the current capability of the device. Thus, $W$ may need to be increased proportionally. In fact, if we double $W$ to restore $I_{D}$ to its original value, the slope also doubles. In other words,"

This diagram is a simplified representation focusing on the capacitance aspects of the junction.\n\n#### Nanometer Design Notes\n\nNew generations of CMOS technology incorporate the \"FinFET\" structure. Unlike the conventional \"planar\" device, the FinFET extends in the third dimension. As shown below, it consists of an \\(n^{+}\\) wall (resembling a shark's fin) and a gate that wraps around the wall. The transistor carries current from the source to the drain on the surfaces of the fin. Owing to the tight confinement of the electric field between the two vertical walls of the gate, the FinFET exhibits less channel-length modulation and subthreshold leakage. But where do the S/D contacts land? What other issues do we face in FinFETs? We return to these questions later in this book.\n\nConsidering the physical structure in Fig. 2.32(a), we identify the following: (1) the oxide capacitance between the gate and the channel, \\(C_{1}=W L C_{o x}\\); (2) the depletion capacitance between the channel and the substrate, \\(C_{2}=$ \\(W L \\sqrt{q \\epsilon_{s i} N_{s u b} /\\left(4 \\Phi_{F}\\right)}\\); and (3) the capacitance due to the overlap of the gate poly with the source and drain areas, \\(C_{3}\\) and \\(C_{4}\\). Owing to fringing electric field lines, \\(C_{3}\\) and \\(C_{4}\\) cannot be simply written as \\(W L_{D} C_{o x}\\), and are usually obtained by more elaborate calculations. The overlap capacitance per unit width is denoted by \\(C_{o v}\\) and expressed in \\(\\mathrm{F} / \\mathrm{m}\\) (or \\(\\mathrm{fF} / \\mu \\mathrm{m}\\)). We simply multiply \\(C_{o v}\\) by \\(W\\) to find the gate-source and gate-drain overlap capacitances. (4) The junction capacitance between the source/drain areas and the substrate. As shown in Fig. 2.32(b), this last capacitance is decomposed into two components: the bottom-plate capacitance associated with the bottom of the junction, \\(C_{j}\\), and the sidewall capacitance due to the perimeter of the junction, \\(C_{j s w}\\). The distinction is necessary because different transistor geometries yield different area and perimeter values for the S/D junctions. We specify \\(C_{j}\\) and \\(C_{j s w}\\) as capacitance per unit area (in \\(\\mathrm{F} / \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\)) and unit length (in \\(\\mathrm{F} / \\mathrm{m}\\)), respectively. Thus, \\(C_{j}\\) is multiplied by the S/D area, and \\(C_{j s w}\\) by the S/D perimeter. Note that each junction capacitance can be expressed as \\(C_{j}=C_{j 0} /\\left[1+V_{R} /\\left(\\Phi_{B}\\right)\\right]^{m}\\), where \\(V_{R}\\) is the reverse voltage across the junction, \\(\\Phi_{B}\\) is the junction built-in potential, and \\(m\\) is a power typically in the range of 0.3 and 0.4.\n\n#### Example 2.10\n\nCalculate the source and drain junction capacitances of the two structures shown in Fig. 2.33.\n\n#### Solution\n\nFor the transistor in Fig. 2.33(a), we have\n\n$$\nC_{D B}=C_{S B}=W E C_{j}+2(W+E) C_{j s w}\n$$\n\nwhereas for that in Fig. 2.33(b),\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nC_{D B} & =\\frac{W}{2} E C_{j}+2\\left(\\frac{W}{2}+E\\right) C_{j s w}\\\\\nC_{S B} & =2\\left[\\frac{W}{2} E C_{j}+2\\left(\\frac{W}{2}+E\\right) C_{j s w}\\right]\\\\\n& =W E C_{j}+2(W+2 E) C_{j s w}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nCalled a \"folded\" structure, the geometry in Fig. 2.33(b) exhibits substantially less drain junction capacitance than that in Fig. 2.33(a) while providing the same \\(W / L\\).\n\nIn the above calculations, we have assumed that the total source or drain perimeter, \\(2(W+E)\\), is multiplied by \\(C_{j s w}\\). In reality, the capacitance of the inner sidewall (under the gate) may be different from that of the other sidewalls. Nonetheless, we typically assume that all four sides have the same \\(C_{j s w}\\). The error resulting from this assumption is negligible because each node in a circuit is connected to a number of other device capacitances as well.\n\nWe now derive the capacitances between terminals of a MOSFET in different regions of operation. If the device is off, \\(C_{G D}=C_{G S}=C_{o v} W\\), and the gate-bulk capacitance consists of the series combination of the gate-oxide capacitance and the depletion-region capacitance [Fig. 2.32(a)], i.e., \\(C_{G B}=\\left(W L C_{o x}\\right) C_{d} /\\left(W L C_{o x}+C_{d}\\right)\\), where \\(L\\) is the effective length, \\(C_{d}=W L \\sqrt{q \\epsilon_{s i} N_{s u b} /\\left(4 \\Phi_{F}\\right)}\\), and\n\n[^7]\\(\\epsilon_{s i}=\\epsilon_{r, s i} \\times \\epsilon_{0}=11.8 \\times\\left(8.85 \\times 10^{-14}\\right) \\mathrm{F} / \\mathrm{cm}\\). The value of \\(C_{S B}\\) and \\(C_{D B}\\) is a function of the source and drain voltages with respect to the substrate.\n\nIf the device is in the deep triode region, i.e., if \\(S\\) and \\(D\\) have approximately equal voltages, then the gate-channel capacitance, \\(W L C_{o x}\\), is divided equally between the gate and source terminals and the gate and drain terminals (Fig. 2.34). This is because a change of \\(\\Delta V\\) in the gate voltage draws equal amounts of charge from S and D. Thus, \\(C_{G D}=C_{G S}=W L C_{o x} / 2+W C_{o v}\\).\n\nLet us now consider \\(C_{G D}\\) and \\(C_{G S}\\). If in saturation, a MOSFET exhibits a gate-drain capacitance roughly equal to \\(W C_{o v}\\). As for \\(C_{G S}\\), we note that the potential difference between the gate and the channel varies from \\(V_{G S}\\) at the source to \\(V_{T H}\\) at the pinch-off point, resulting in a nonuniform vertical electric field in the gate oxide as we travel from the source to the drain. It can be proved that the equivalent capacitance of this structure, excluding the gate-source overlap capacitance, equals \\((2/3)WLC C_{o x}\\). Thus, \\(C_{G S}=2 W L_{e f f} C_{o x} / 3+W C_{o v}\\). The behavior of \\(C_{G D}\\) and \\(C_{G S}\\) in different regions of operation is plotted in Fig. 2.34. Note that the above equations do not provide a smooth transition from one region of operation to another, creating convergence difficulties in simulation programs. This issue is revisited in Chapter 17.\n\nThe gate-bulk capacitance is usually neglected in the triode and saturation regions because the inversion layer acts as a \"shield\" between the gate and the bulk. In other words, if the gate voltage varies, the charge is supplied by the source and the drain rather than the bulk.\n\nExample 2.11\nSketch the capacitances of \\(M_{1}\\) in Fig. 2.35 as \\(V_{X}\\) varies from zero to 3 V. Assume that \\(V_{T H}=0.3 \\mathrm{~V}\\) and \\(\\lambda=\\gamma=0\\).\n\n#### Solution\n\nTo avoid confusion, we label the three terminals as shown in Fig. 2.35 and denote the bulk by \\(B\\). For \\(V_{X} \\approx 0\\), \\(M_{1}\\) is in the triode region, \\(C_{E N} \\approx C_{E F}=(1 / 2) W L C_{o x}+W C_{o v}\\), and \\(C_{F B}\\) is maximum. The value of \\(C_{N B}\\) is independent of \\(V_{X}\\). As \\(V_{X}\\) exceeds 1 V, the role of the source and drain is exchanged [Fig. 2.36(a)], eventually bringing \\(M_{1}\\) out of the triode region for \\(V_{X} \\geq 2 \\mathrm{~V}-0.3 \\mathrm{~V}\\). The variation of the capacitances is plotted in Figs. 2.36(b) and (c).\n\nThe graph labeled \"(b)\" is a plot of capacitance values versus voltage, specifically the voltage \\(V_X\\) in volts (V). The y-axis represents capacitance, with specific values shown for \\(C_{EN}\\) and \\(C_{EF}\\).

Unlike the conventional \"planar\" device, the FinFET extends in the third dimension. As shown below, it consists of an $n^{+}$ wall (resembling a shark's fin) and a gate that wraps around the wall. The transistor carries current from the source to the drain on the surfaces of the fin. Owing to the tight confinement of the electric field between the two vertical walls of the gate, the FinFET exhibits less channel-length modulation and subthreshold leakage. But where do the S/D contacts land? What other issues do we face in FinFETs? We return to these questions later in this book.\n\nThe image labeled as Fig. 2.32(a) depicts the structural diagram of a FinFET (Fin Field-Effect Transistor). It features several key components and characteristics:\n\n1. Components and Structure:\n- **n+ Fin:** The central element of the diagram is the n+ doped fin, which resembles a shark's fin. This fin acts as the channel through which current flows from the source (S) to the drain (D).\n- **Gate (G):** The gate is shown wrapping around the fin, providing a three-dimensional control over the channel. This wrap-around gate is a defining feature of the FinFET architecture, allowing for better electrostatic control compared to planar transistors.\n- **Oxide Layer:** An oxide layer is present between the gate and the fin, serving as the gate dielectric. This layer is crucial for the gate's ability to control the channel.\n- **Source (S) and Drain (D):** These are the regions where current enters and exits the fin, respectively. They are marked on the diagram as n+ regions on either side of the fin.\n- **Substrate:** The entire structure is built on a substrate, which is indicated at the base of the diagram.\n\n2. Connections and Interactions:\n- The current flows vertically along the surfaces of the fin from the source to the drain. The gate's electric field controls this flow, modulating the channel conductivity.\n- The tight confinement of the electric field between the vertical walls of the gate reduces channel-length modulation and subthreshold leakage, enhancing the performance of the FinFET.\n\n3. Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:\n- The diagram includes labels such as 'S/D Fin', 'Oxide', 'n+', 'G', 'S', 'D', and 'Substrate', which help in identifying the components and understanding their roles.\n- The S/D Fin label indicates the combined source/drain fin structure, while the annotations n+ denote heavily doped regions essential for the creation of source and drain contacts.\n\nOverall, the diagram effectively illustrates the unique three-dimensional structure of the FinFET, highlighting its components and operational principles.\n\nConsidering the physical structure in Fig. 2.32(a), we identify the following: (1) the oxide capacitance between the gate and the channel, $C_{1}=W L C_{o x}$; (2) the depletion capacitance between the channel and the substrate, $C_{2}=$ $W L \\sqrt{q \\epsilon_{s i} N_{s u b} /\\left(4 \\Phi_{F}\\right)}$; and (3) the capacitance due to the overlap of the gate poly with the source and drain areas, $C_{3}$ and $C_{4}$. Owing to fringing electric field lines, $C_{3}$ and $C_{4}$ cannot be simply written as $W L_{D} C_{o x}$, and are usually obtained by more elaborate calculations. The overlap capacitance per unit width is denoted by $C_{o v}$ and expressed in $\\mathrm{F} / \\mathrm{m}$ (or $\\mathrm{fF} / \\mu \\mathrm{m}$ ). We simply multiply $C_{o v}$ by $W$ to find the gate-source and gate-drain overlap capacitances. (4) The junction capacitance between the source/drain areas and the substrate. As shown in Fig. 2.32(b), this last capacitance is decomposed into two components: the bottom-plate capacitance associated with the bottom of the junction, $C_{j}$, and the sidewall capacitance due to the perimeter of the junction, $C_{j s w}$. The distinction is necessary because different transistor geometries yield different area and perimeter values for the S/D junctions. We specify $C_{j}$ and $C_{j s w}$ as capacitance per unit area (in $\\mathrm{F} / \\mathrm{m}^{2}$ ) and unit length (in $\\mathrm{F} / \\mathrm{m}$ ), respectively. Thus, $C_{j}$ is multiplied by the S/D area, and $C_{j s w}$ by the S/D perimeter. Note that each junction capacitance can be expressed as $C_{j}=C_{j 0} /\\left[1+V_{R} /\\left(\\Phi_{B}\\right)\\right]^{m}$, where $V_{R}$ is the reverse voltage across the junction, $\\Phi_{B}$ is the junction built-in potential, and $m$ is a power typically in the range of 0.3 and 0.4 .\n\nExample 2.10\nCalculate the source and drain junction capacitances of the two structures shown in Fig. 2.33.\n\nThe image labeled \"Fig. 2.33(a)\" depicts a schematic diagram of a transistor layout. This layout shows a top-down view of the transistor structure with the following components and features:\n\n1. Components and Structure:\n- The diagram illustrates a rectangular layout with a central vertical strip representing the gate region.\n- To the left and right of this central strip are shaded areas indicating the source and drain regions.\n- The width of the transistor is labeled as 'W', and the extension of the gate over the source or drain is labeled as 'E'.\n\n2. Connections and Interactions:\n- The source and drain terminals are positioned on opposite ends of the structure. The source terminal is at the bottom, while the drain terminal is at the top.\n- The diagram suggests a direct path for current flow between the source and drain through the gate-controlled channel.\n\n3. Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:\n- The layout includes annotations for the dimensions 'W' and 'E', indicating the width of the transistor and the overlap of the gate, respectively.\n- The schematic representation at the bottom left corner shows a simplified symbol of the transistor with three terminals, representing the source, drain, and gate.\n\nThis layout is typical for a planar MOSFET, where the gate length is determined by the vertical dimension in the diagram, and the gate width is the horizontal dimension. The overlap 'E' is crucial for calculating the junction capacitances as specified in the context.\n\nThe circuit shown in Fig. 2.33(b) is a folded NMOS structure with shared source and gate nodes between two transistors M1 and M2. The source terminals are connected to node s1s2, the drain terminals are connected to node d1d2, and the gate terminals are connected to node g1g2.\n\nSolution\n\nFor the transistor in Fig. 2.33(a), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{D B}=C_{S B}=W E C_{j}+2(W+E) C_{j s w} \\tag{2.40}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhereas for that in Fig. 2.33(b),\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nC_{D B} & =\\frac{W}{2} E C_{j}+2\\left(\\frac{W}{2}+E\\right) C_{j s w}  \\tag{2.41}\\\\\nC_{S B} & =2\\left[\\frac{W}{2} E C_{j}+2\\left(\\frac{W}{2}+E\\right) C_{j s w}\\right]  \\tag{2.42}\\\\\n& =W E C_{j}+2(W+2 E) C_{j s w} \\tag{2.43}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nCalled a \"folded\" structure, the geometry in Fig. 2.33(b) exhibits substantially less drain junction capacitance than that in Fig. 2.33(a) while providing the same $W / L$.\n\nIn the above calculations, we have assumed that the total source or drain perimeter, $2(W+E)$, is multiplied by $C_{j s w}$. In reality, the capacitance of the inner sidewall (under the gate) may be different from that of the other sidewalls. ${ }^{9}$ Nonetheless, we typically assume that all four sides have the same $C_{j s w}$. The error resulting from this assumption is negligible because each node in a circuit is connected to a number of other device capacitances as well.\n\nWe now derive the capacitances between terminals of a MOSFET in different regions of operation. If the device is off, $C_{G D}=C_{G S}=C_{o v} W$, and the gate-bulk capacitance consists of the series combination of the gate-oxide capacitance and the depletion-region capacitance [Fig. 2.32(a)], i.e., $C_{G B}=\\left(W L C_{o x}\\right) C_{d} /\\left(W L C_{o x}+C_{d}\\right)$, where $L$ is the effective length, $C_{d}=W L \\sqrt{q \\epsilon_{s i} N_{s u b} /\\left(4 \\Phi_{F}\\right)}$, and\n\n[^7]$\\epsilon_{s i}=\\epsilon_{r, s i} \\times \\epsilon_{0}=11.8 \\times\\left(8.85 \\times 10^{-14}\\right) \\mathrm{F} / \\mathrm{cm}$. The value of $C_{S B}$ and $C_{D B}$ is a function of the source and drain voltages with respect to the substrate.\n\nIf the device is in the deep triode region, i.e., if $S$ and $D$ have approximately equal voltages, then the gate-channel capacitance, $W L C_{o x}$, is divided equally between the gate and source terminals and the gate and drain terminals (Fig. 2.34). This is because a change of $\\Delta V$ in the gate voltage draws equal amounts of charge from S and D . Thus, $C_{G D}=C_{G S}=W L C_{o x} / 2+W C_{o v}$.\n\nFigure 2.34 Variation of gate-source and gate-drain capacitances versus V_GS\n\nThe graph in Figure 2.34 illustrates the variation of gate-source capacitance ($C_{GS}$) and gate-drain capacitance ($C_{GD}$) as functions of the gate-source voltage ($V_{GS}$).\n\n**Type of Graph and Function:**\n- This is a plot showing capacitance versus gate-source voltage, a common type of graph used in semiconductor device analysis to depict how capacitance values change with varying $V_{GS}$.\n\n**Axes Labels and Units:**\n- The x-axis represents the gate-source voltage, $V_{GS}$, with no specific units marked but typically measured in volts.\n- The y-axis represents the capacitance values, with no specific units marked, but typically measured in farads.\n- The graph uses a linear scale for both axes.\n\n**Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- As $V_{GS}$ increases from 0, the graph shows an initial constant level of capacitance at $W C_{ov}$ when the device is in the \"Off\" state.\n- Upon reaching the threshold voltage $V_{TH}$, $C_{GS}$ begins to increase sharply, indicating the onset of conduction.\n- As $V_{GS}$ continues to increase, the capacitance reaches a saturation level at $\\frac{2}{3} W L C_{ox} + W C_{ov}$.\n- Beyond this point, as $V_{GS}$ approaches $V_D + V_{TH}$, the capacitance transitions to the triode region, stabilizing at $\\frac{W L C_{ox}}{2} + W C_{ov}$.\n\n**Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The graph identifies three distinct regions: \"Off,\" \"Saturation,\" and \"Triode.\"\n- The transition between these regions is marked by significant changes in capacitance.\n- The saturation region shows a plateau, indicating a stable capacitance value over a range of $V_{GS}$ values.\n\n**Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- The graph is annotated with key capacitance values at different operating regions:\n- Off region: $W C_{ov}$\n- Saturation region: $\\frac{2}{3} W L C_{ox} + W C_{ov}$\n- Triode region: $\\frac{W L C_{ox}}{2} + W C_{ov}$\n- Vertical dashed lines indicate the transition points at $V_{TH}$ and $V_D + V_{TH}$.\n\nThis graph effectively shows how the capacitance between the gate-source and gate-drain changes with the gate-source voltage, highlighting the behavior of the device in different operational regions.\n\nLet us now consider $C_{G D}$ and $C_{G S}$. If in saturation, a MOSFET exhibits a gate-drain capacitance roughly equal to $W C_{o v}$. As for $C_{G S}$, we note that the potential difference between the gate and the channel varies from $V_{G S}$ at the source to $V_{T H}$ at the pinch-off point, resulting in a nonuniform vertical electric field in the gate oxide as we travel from the source to the drain. It can be proved that the equivalent capacitance of this structure, excluding the gate-source overlap capacitance, equals (2/3)WLC $C_{o x}$ [1]. Thus, $C_{G S}=2 W L_{e f f} C_{o x} / 3+W C_{o v}$. The behavior of $C_{G D}$ and $C_{G S}$ in different regions of operation is plotted in Fig. 2.34.

However, in many analog circuits, the device-related capacitances must also be considered to forecast high-frequency behavior.\n\nWe anticipate that a capacitance exists between every pair of the four terminals of a MOSFET (Fig. 2.31). Furthermore, the magnitude of these capacitances may vary depending on the transistor's bias conditions.\n\nThe diagram illustrates the various capacitances associated with a MOSFET, highlighting the capacitances between each pair of the four terminals: gate, drain, source, and body.\n\n1. **Component and Structure Identification:**\n- The diagram depicts a MOSFET with its source (S), drain (D), gate (G), and bulk (B) terminals.\n- Several capacitances are labeled, indicating their positions between these terminals: \\(C_{GS}\\) (gate-source capacitance), \\(C_{GD}\\) (gate-drain capacitance), \\(C_{DB}\\) (drain-bulk capacitance), \\(C_{SB}\\) (source-bulk capacitance), and \\(C_{GB}\\) (gate-bulk capacitance).\n- The cross-sectional view highlights the MOSFET structure, including the inversion layer, depletion layer, and the \\(n^+\\) regions.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- The capacitive elements are depicted as parallel lines between the terminals, indicating the potential for charge storage and the influence of these capacitances on the device's behavior.\n- The inversion layer and depletion layer are shown to interact with the \\(p\\)-substrate and \\(n^+\\) regions, affecting the capacitance values.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- The diagram includes annotations for each capacitance \\(C_1\\) to \\(C_6\\), which represent different components of the total capacitance seen by the gate.\n- The \\(L_D\\) notation indicates the lateral diffusion length of the \\(n^+\\) regions.\n- The lower part of the diagram provides a simplified representation of the MOSFET structure, with the \\(p\\)-substrate and \\(n^+\\) regions clearly marked.\n\nOverall, this diagram serves to explain the distribution and impact of capacitances within a MOSFET, which are crucial for understanding its high-frequency behavior.\n\nThe image labeled as Figure 2.32 (b) illustrates the decomposition of source/drain (S/D) junction capacitance into its components within a MOSFET structure.

Unlike the conventional \"planar\" device, the FinFET extends in the third dimension. As shown below, it consists of an $n^{+}$ wall (resembling a shark's fin) and a gate that wraps around the wall. The transistor carries current from the source to the drain on the surfaces of the fin. Owing to the tight confinement of the electric field between the two vertical walls of the gate, the FinFET exhibits less channel-length modulation and subthreshold leakage. But where do the S/D contacts land? What other issues do we face in FinFETs? We return to these questions later in this book.\n\nThe image labeled as Fig. 2.32(a) depicts the structural diagram of a FinFET (Fin Field-Effect Transistor). It features several key components and characteristics:\n\n1. **Components and Structure:**\n- **n+ Fin:** The central element of the diagram is the n+ doped fin, which resembles a shark's fin. This fin acts as the channel through which current flows from the source (S) to the drain (D).\n- **Gate (G):** The gate is shown wrapping around the fin, providing a three-dimensional control over the channel. This wrap-around gate is a defining feature of the FinFET architecture, allowing for better electrostatic control compared to planar transistors.\n- **Oxide Layer:** An oxide layer is present between the gate and the fin, serving as the gate dielectric. This layer is crucial for the gate's ability to control the channel.\n- **Source (S) and Drain (D):** These are the regions where current enters and exits the fin, respectively. They are marked on the diagram as n+ regions on either side of the fin.\n- **Substrate:** The entire structure is built on a substrate, which is indicated at the base of the diagram.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n- The current flows vertically along the surfaces of the fin from the source to the drain. The gate's electric field controls this flow, modulating the channel conductivity.\n- The tight confinement of the electric field between the vertical walls of the gate reduces channel-length modulation and subthreshold leakage, enhancing the performance of the FinFET.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n- The diagram includes labels such as 'S/D Fin', 'Oxide', 'n+', 'G', 'S', 'D', and 'Substrate', which help in identifying the components and understanding their roles.\n- The S/D Fin label indicates the combined source/drain fin structure, while the annotations n+ denote heavily doped regions essential for the creation of source and drain contacts.\n\nOverall, the diagram effectively illustrates the unique three-dimensional structure of the FinFET, highlighting its components and operational principles.\n\nConsidering the physical structure in Fig. 2.32(a), we identify the following: (1) the oxide capacitance between the gate and the channel, $C_{1}=W L C_{o x}$; (2) the depletion capacitance between the channel and the substrate, $C_{2}=$ $W L \\sqrt{q \\epsilon_{s i} N_{s u b} /\\left(4 \\Phi_{F}\\right)}$; and (3) the capacitance due to the overlap of the gate poly with the source and drain areas, $C_{3}$ and $C_{4}$. Owing to fringing electric field lines, $C_{3}$ and $C_{4}$ cannot be simply written as $W L_{D} C_{o x}$, and are usually obtained by more elaborate calculations. The overlap capacitance per unit width is denoted by $C_{o v}$ and expressed in $\\mathrm{F} / \\mathrm{m}$ (or $\\mathrm{fF} / \\mu \\mathrm{m}$ ). We simply multiply $C_{o v}$ by $W$ to find the gate-source and gate-drain overlap capacitances. (4) The junction capacitance between the source/drain areas and the substrate. As shown in Fig. 2.32(b), this last capacitance is decomposed into two components: the bottom-plate capacitance associated with the bottom of the junction, $C_{j}$, and the sidewall capacitance due to the perimeter of the junction, $C_{j s w}$. The distinction is necessary because different transistor geometries yield different area and perimeter values for the S/D junctions. We specify $C_{j}$ and $C_{j s w}$ as capacitance per unit area (in $\\mathrm{F} / \\mathrm{m}^{2}$ ) and unit length (in $\\mathrm{F} / \\mathrm{m}$ ), respectively. Thus, $C_{j}$ is multiplied by the S/D area, and $C_{j s w}$ by the S/D perimeter. Note that each junction capacitance can be expressed as $C_{j}=C_{j 0} /\\left[1+V_{R} /\\left(\\Phi_{B}\\right)\\right]^{m}$, where $V_{R}$ is the reverse voltage across the junction, $\\Phi_{B}$ is the junction built-in potential, and $m$ is a power typically in the range of 0.3 and 0.4 .\n\n#### Example 2.10\n\nCalculate the source and drain junction capacitances of the two structures shown in Fig. 2.33.\n\nThe circuit shown in Fig. 2.33(b) is a folded NMOS structure with shared source and gate nodes between two transistors M1 and M2. The source terminals are connected to node s1s2, the drain terminals are connected to node d1d2, and the gate terminals are connected to node g1g2.\n\n#### Solution\n\nFor the transistor in Fig. 2.33(a), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nC_{D B}=C_{S B}=W E C_{j}+2(W+E) C_{j s w} \\tag{2.40}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhereas for that in Fig. 2.33(b),\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nC_{D B} & =\\frac{W}{2} E C_{j}+2\\left(\\frac{W}{2}+E\\right) C_{j s w}  \\tag{2.41}\\\\\nC_{S B} & =2\\left[\\frac{W}{2} E C_{j}+2\\left(\\frac{W}{2}+E\\right) C_{j s w}\\right]  \\tag{2.42}\\\\\n& =W E C_{j}+2(W+2 E) C_{j s w} \\tag{2.43}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nCalled a \"folded\" structure, the geometry in Fig. 2.33(b) exhibits substantially less drain junction capacitance than that in Fig. 2.33(a) while providing the same $W / L$.\n\nIn the above calculations, we have assumed that the total source or drain perimeter, $2(W+E)$, is multiplied by $C_{j s w}$. In reality, the capacitance of the inner sidewall (under the gate) may be different from that of the other sidewalls. ${ }^{9}$ Nonetheless, we typically assume that all four sides have the same $C_{j s w}$. The error resulting from this assumption is negligible because each node in a circuit is connected to a number of other device capacitances as well.\n\nWe now derive the capacitances between terminals of a MOSFET in different regions of operation. If the device is off, $C_{G D}=C_{G S}=C_{o v} W$, and the gate-bulk capacitance consists of the series combination of the gate-oxide capacitance and the depletion-region capacitance [Fig. 2.32(a)], i.e., $C_{G B}=\\left(W L C_{o x}\\right) C_{d} /\\left(W L C_{o x}+C_{d}\\right)$, where $L$ is the effective length, $C_{d}=W L \\sqrt{q \\epsilon_{s i} N_{s u b} /\\left(4 \\Phi_{F}\\right)}$, and\n\n[^7]$\\epsilon_{s i}=\\epsilon_{r, s i} \\times \\epsilon_{0}=11.8 \\times\\left(8.85 \\times 10^{-14}\\right) \\mathrm{F} / \\mathrm{cm}$. The value of $C_{S B}$ and $C_{D B}$ is a function of the source and drain voltages with respect to the substrate.\n\nIf the device is in the deep triode region, i.e., if $S$ and $D$ have approximately equal voltages, then the gate-channel capacitance, $W L C_{o x}$, is divided equally between the gate and source terminals and the gate and drain terminals (Fig. 2.34). This is because a change of $\\Delta V$ in the gate voltage draws equal amounts of charge from S and D . Thus, $C_{G D}=C_{G S}=W L C_{o x} / 2+W C_{o v}$.\nimage_name:Figure 2.34 Variation of gate-source and gate-drain capacitances versus V_GS\ndescription:\n[\nname: M1, type: NMOS, ports: {S: GND, D: VD, G: VG}\nname: VG, type: VoltageSource, value: VG, ports: {Np: VG, Nn: GND}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit includes an NMOS transistor M1 and a voltage source VG.

If in saturation, a MOSFET exhibits a gate-drain capacitance roughly equal to $W C_{o v}$. As for $C_{G S}$, we note that the potential difference between the gate and the channel varies from $V_{G S}$ at the source to $V_{T H}$ at the pinch-off point, resulting in a nonuniform vertical electric field in the gate oxide as we travel from the source to the drain. It can be proved that the equivalent capacitance of this structure, excluding the gate-source overlap capacitance, equals (2/3)WLC $C_{o x}$ [1]. Thus, $C_{G S}=2 W L_{e f f} C_{o x} / 3+W C_{o v}$. The behavior of $C_{G D}$ and $C_{G S}$ in different regions of operation is plotted in Fig. 2.34. Note that the above equations do not provide a smooth transition from one region of operation to another, creating convergence difficulties in simulation programs. This issue is revisited in Chapter 17.\n\nThe gate-bulk capacitance is usually neglected in the triode and saturation regions because the inversion layer acts as a \"shield\" between the gate and the bulk. In other words, if the gate voltage varies, the charge is supplied by the source and the drain rather than the bulk.\n\nExample 2.11\nSketch the capacitances of $M_{1}$ in Fig. 2.35 as $V_{X}$ varies from zero to 3 V .

In reality, the capacitance of the inner sidewall (under the gate) may be different from that of the other sidewalls. Nonetheless, we typically assume that all four sides have the same \\(C_{jsw}\\). The error resulting from this assumption is negligible because each node in a circuit is connected to a number of other device capacitances as well.\n\nWe now derive the capacitances between terminals of a MOSFET in different regions of operation.

This is because a change of \\(\\Delta V\\) in the gate voltage draws equal amounts of charge from S and D. Thus, \\(C_{GD}=C_{GS}=W L C_{ox} / 2+W C_{ov}\\).\n\nThe graph in Figure 2.34 illustrates the variation of gate-source capacitance (\\(C_{GS}\\)) and gate-drain capacitance (\\(C_{GD}\\)) as functions of the gate-source voltage (\\(V_{GS}\\)).\n\n**Type of Graph and Function:**\n- This is a plot showing capacitance versus gate-source voltage, a common type of graph used in semiconductor device analysis to depict how capacitance values change with varying \\(V_{GS}\\).\n\n**Axes Labels and Units:**\n- The x-axis represents the gate-source voltage, \\(V_{GS}\\), with no specific units marked but typically measured in volts.\n- The y-axis represents the capacitance values, with no specific units marked, but typically measured in farads.\n- The graph uses a linear scale for both axes.\n\n**Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- As \\(V_{GS}\\) increases from 0, the graph shows an initial constant level of capacitance at \\(W C_{ov}\\) when the device is in the \"Off\" state.\n- Upon reaching the threshold voltage \\(V_{TH}\\), \\(C_{GS}\\) begins to increase sharply, indicating the onset of conduction.\n- As \\(V_{GS}\\) continues to increase, the capacitance reaches a saturation level at \\(\\frac{2}{3} W L C_{ox} + W C_{ov}\\).\n- Beyond this point, as \\(V_{GS}\\) approaches \\(V_D + V_{TH}\\), the capacitance transitions to the triode region, stabilizing at \\(\\frac{W L C_{ox}}{2} + W C_{ov}\\).\n\n**Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The graph identifies three distinct regions: \"Off,\" \"Saturation,\" and \"Triode.\"\n- The transition between these regions is marked by significant changes in capacitance.\n- The saturation region shows a plateau, indicating a stable capacitance value over a range of \\(V_{GS}\\) values.\n\n**Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- The graph is annotated with key capacitance values at different operating regions:\n  - Off region: \\(W C_{ov}\\)\n  - Saturation region: \\(\\frac{2}{3} W L C_{ox} + W C_{ov}\\)\n  - Triode region: \\(\\frac{W L C_{ox}}{2} + W C_{ov}\\)\n- Vertical dashed lines indicate the transition points at \\(V_{TH}\\) and \\(V_D + V_{TH}\\).\n\nThis graph effectively shows how the capacitance between the gate-source and gate-drain changes with the gate-source voltage, highlighting the behavior of the device in different operational regions.\n\nFigure 2.34 Variation of gate-source and gate-drain capacitances versus \\(V_{GS}\\).\n\nLet us now consider \\(C_{GD}\\) and \\(C_{GS}\\). If in saturation, a MOSFET exhibits a gate-drain capacitance roughly equal to \\(W C_{ov}\\). As for \\(C_{GS}\\), we note that the potential difference between the gate and the channel varies from \\(V_{GS}\\) at the source to \\(V_{TH}\\) at the pinch-off point, resulting in a nonuniform vertical electric field in the gate oxide as we travel from the source to the drain. It can be proved that the equivalent capacitance of this structure, excluding the gate-source overlap capacitance, equals \\((2/3)WLC_{ox}\\) [1]. Thus, \\(C_{GS}=2 W L_{eff} C_{ox} / 3+W C_{ov}\\). The behavior of \\(C_{GD}\\) and \\(C_{GS}\\) in different regions of operation is plotted in Fig. 2.34. Note that the above equations do not provide a smooth transition from one region of operation to another, creating convergence difficulties in simulation programs. This issue is revisited in Chapter 17.\n\nThe gate-bulk capacitance is usually neglected in the triode and saturation regions because the inversion layer acts as a \"shield\" between the gate and the bulk. In other words, if the gate voltage varies, the charge is supplied by the source and the drain rather than the bulk.\n\nExample 2.11\nSketch the capacitances of \\(M_{1}\\) in Fig. 2.35 as \\(V_{X}\\) varies from zero to 3 V.

    "text": "The foundational quadratic I/V relationships established earlier, along with adjustments for body effect and channel-length modulation, offer insight into the low-frequency behavior of CMOS circuits. However, in numerous analog circuits, it is essential to consider the capacitances linked to the devices to predict the high-frequency behavior as well.\n\nWe anticipate the presence of capacitance between every pair of the four terminals of a MOSFET (Fig. 2.31). Furthermore, the value of each capacitance may vary depending on the transistor's bias conditions.\n\nThe diagram in Fig. 2.31 illustrates the various capacitances associated with a MOSFET, emphasizing the capacitances between each pair of the four terminals: gate, drain, source, and body.\n\nThe image labeled \"(a)\" offers a detailed schematic representation of MOS device capacitances. It depicts a cross-sectional view of a MOSFET, focusing on the capacitances between different terminals.\n\nThe image labeled as Figure 2.32 (b) demonstrates the decomposition of source/drain (S/D) junction capacitance into its components within a MOSFET structure. This diagram is a simplified representation focusing on the capacitance aspects of the junction.\n\nNew generations of CMOS technology incorporate the \"FinFET\" structure. Unlike the conventional \"planar\" device, the FinFET extends in the third dimension. As shown below, it consists of an n+ wall (resembling a shark's fin) and a gate that wraps around the wall. The transistor carries current from the source to the drain on the surfaces of the fin. Owing to the tight confinement of the electric field between the two vertical walls of the gate, the FinFET exhibits less channel-length modulation and subthreshold leakage. But where do the S/D contacts land? What other issues do we face in FinFETs? We return to these questions later in this book.\n\nConsidering the physical structure in Fig. 2.32(a), we identify the following: (1) the oxide capacitance between the gate and the channel, C1=WLCo x; (2) the depletion capacitance between the channel and the substrate, C2=WL√(qϵsiNsub/(4ΦF)); and (3) the capacitance due to the overlap of the gate poly with the source and drain areas, C3 and C4. Owing to fringing electric field lines, C3 and C4 cannot be simply written as WLD Co x, and are usually obtained by more elaborate calculations. The overlap capacitance per unit width is denoted by Cov and expressed in F/m (or fF/µm). We simply multiply Cov by W to find the gate-source and gate-drain overlap capacitances. (4) The junction capacitance between the source/drain areas and the substrate. As shown in Fig. 2.32(b), this last capacitance is decomposed into two components: the bottom-plate capacitance associated with the bottom of the junction, Cj, and the sidewall capacitance due to the perimeter of the junction, Cjsw. The distinction is necessary because different transistor geometries yield different area and perimeter values for the S/D junctions. We specify Cj and Cjsw as capacitance per unit area (in F/m^2) and unit length (in F/m), respectively. Thus, Cj is multiplied by the S/D area, and Cjsw by the S/D perimeter. Note that each junction capacitance can be expressed as Cj=Cj0/[1+VR/(ΦB)]^m, where VR is the reverse voltage across the junction, ΦB is the junction built-in potential, and m is a power typically in the range of 0.3 and 0.4.\n\nExample 2.10\n\nCalculate the source and drain junction capacitances of the two structures shown in Fig. 2.33.\n\nThe circuit shown in Fig. 2.33(b) is a folded NMOS structure with shared source and gate nodes between two transistors M1 and M2. The source terminals are connected to node s1s2, the drain terminals are connected to node d1d2, and the gate terminals are connected to node g1g2.\n\nFor the transistor in Fig. 2.33(a), we have\n\n$$\nC_{D B}=C_{S B}=W E C_{j}+2(W+E) C_{j s w} \\tag{2.40}\n$$\n\nwhereas for that in Fig. 2.33(b),\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nC_{D B} & =\\frac{W}{2} E C_{j}+2\\left(\\frac{W}{2}+E\\right) C_{j s w}  \\tag{2.41}\\\\\nC_{S B} & =2\\left[\\frac{W}{2} E C_{j}+2\\left(\\frac{W}{2}+E\\right) C_{j s w}\\right]  \\tag{2.42}\\\\\n& =W E C_{j}+2(W+2 E) C_{j s w} \\tag{2.43}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nCalled a \"folded\" structure, the geometry in Fig. 2.33(b) exhibits substantially less drain junction capacitance than that in Fig. 2.33(a) while providing the same W/L.\n\nIn the above calculations, we have assumed that the total source or drain perimeter, 2(W+E), is multiplied by Cjsw. In reality, the capacitance of the inner sidewall (under the gate) may be different from that of the other sidewalls. Nonetheless, we typically assume that all four sides have the same Cjsw. The error resulting from this assumption is negligible because each node in a circuit is connected to a number of other device capacitances as well.\n\nWe now derive the capacitances between terminals of a MOSFET in different regions of operation. If the device is off, CGD=CGS=CovW, and the gate-bulk capacitance consists of the series combination of the gate-oxide capacitance and the depletion-region capacitance [Fig. 2.32(a)], i.e., CGB=(WLCox)Cd/(WLCox+Cd), where L is the effective length, Cd=WL√(qϵsiNsub/(4ΦF)), and\n\n[^7]ϵsi=ϵr,si×ϵ0=11.8×(8.85×10^-14) F/cm. The value of CSB and CDB is a function of the source and drain voltages with respect to the substrate.\n\nIf the device is in the deep triode region, i.e., if S and D have approximately equal voltages, then the gate-channel capacitance, WLCox, is divided equally between the gate and source terminals and the gate and drain terminals (Fig. 2.34). This is because a change of ΔV in the gate voltage draws equal amounts of charge from S and D. Thus, CGD=CGS=WLCox/2+W Cov.\n\nThe gate-bulk capacitance is usually neglected in the triode and saturation regions because the inversion layer acts as a \"shield\" between the gate and the bulk. In other words, if the gate voltage varies, the charge is supplied by the source and the drain rather than the bulk.\n\nExample 2.11\nSketch the capacitances of M1 in Fig. 2.35 as VX varies from zero to 3 V.

As VX exceeds 1 V, the role of the source and drain is exchanged [Fig. 2.36(a)], eventually bringing M1 out of the triode region for VX≥2 V−0.3 V.

    "text": "The large-signal model of MOSFETs, characterized by equations (2.8) and (2.9) in conjunction with the voltage-dependent capacitances, is critical for analyzing circuits where the signal significantly alters the bias points, especially when nonlinear effects are significant. In contrast, when the bias conditions are only slightly perturbed, a \"small-signal\" model, which is an approximation of the large-signal model around the operating point, can be used to simplify calculations. As many analog circuits use MOSFETs biased in the saturation region, we derive the corresponding small-signal model here. For transistors used as switches, a linear resistor, as given by (2.11), in conjunction with device capacitances, serves as a rough small-signal equivalent.\n\nTo derive the small-signal model, we introduce a small increment in one bias parameter and calculate the resulting increment in other bias parameters. Specifically, we apply certain bias voltages to the device terminals, increment the potential difference between two of the terminals while other terminal voltages remain constant, and measure the resulting change in all terminal currents. If we change the voltage between two terminals by ΔV and measure a current change of ΔI in some branch, we can model the effect by a voltage-dependent current source. Let us apply a change to the gate-source voltage, ΔV=VGS, where VGS is a small-signal quantity. The drain current therefore changes by gmVGS and is modeled by a voltage-dependent current source tied between the drain and source terminals [Fig. 2.37(a)]. The gate current is very small and its change is negligible, thus requiring no representation here. The result is the small-signal model of an ideal MOSFET—the model that an analog designer applies to most devices in a circuit at first glance.\n\nDue to channel-length modulation, the drain current also varies with the drain-source voltage. This effect can be modeled by a voltage-dependent current source [Fig. 2.37(b)], but a current source whose value linearly depends on the voltage across it is equivalent to a linear resistor [Fig. 2.37(c)] (why?). Tied between D and S, the resistor is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nr_{O} & =\\frac{\\partial V_{D S}}{\\partial I_{D}}  \\tag{2.44}\\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{\\partial I_{D} / \\partial V_{D S}}  \\tag{2.45}\\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}\\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\\right)^{2} \\cdot \\lambda} \\tag{2.46}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere it is assumed that λVDS ≪ 1. As seen throughout this book, the output resistance, rO, affects the performance of many analog circuits. For example, rO limits the maximum voltage gain of most amplifiers.\n\nRecall that the bulk potential influences the threshold voltage and hence the gate-source overdrive. As demonstrated in Example 2.3, with all other terminals held at a constant voltage, the drain current is a function of the bulk voltage. That is, the bulk behaves as a second gate. Modeling this dependence by a current source connected between D and S [Fig. 2.37(d)], we write the value as gmbVBS, where gmb=∂ID/∂VBS. In the saturation region, gmb can be expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ng_{m b} & =\\frac{\\partial I_{D}}{\\partial V_{B S}}  \\tag{2.49}\\\\\n& =\\mu_{n} C_{o x} \\frac{W}{L}\\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{\\partial V_{T H}}{\\partial V_{B S}}\\right)  \\tag{2.50}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nWe also have\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\partial V_{T H}}{\\partial V_{B S}} & =-\\frac{\\partial V_{T H}}{\\partial V_{S B}}  \\tag{2.51}\\\\\n& =-\\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\left(2 \\Phi_{F}+V_{S B}\\right)^{-1 / 2}  \\tag{2.52}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ng_{m b} & =g_{m} \\frac{\\gamma}{2 \\sqrt{2 \\Phi_{F}+V_{S B}}}  \\tag{2.53}\\\\\n& =\\eta g_{m}  \\tag{2.54}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere η=gmb/gm and is typically around 0.25. As expected, gmb is proportional to γ. Equation (2.53) also suggests that the incremental body effect becomes less pronounced as VSB increases. Note that gmVGS and gmbVBS have the same polarity, i.e., raising the gate voltage has the same effect as raising the bulk potential.\n\nThe model in Fig. 2.37(d) is adequate for most low-frequency small-signal analyses. In reality, each terminal of a MOSFET exhibits a finite ohmic resistance resulting from the resistivity of the material (and the contacts), but proper layout can minimize such resistances. For example, consider the two structures of Fig. 2.33, repeated in Fig. 2.38 along with the gate distributed resistance. We note that folding reduces the gate resistance by a factor of four.\n\nShown in Fig. 2.39, the complete small-signal model includes the device capacitances as well. The value of each capacitance is calculated according to the equations derived in Sec. 2.4.2. The reader may wonder how a complex circuit is analyzed intuitively if each transistor must be replaced by the model of Fig. 2.39. The first step is to determine the simplest device model that can represent the role of each transistor with reasonable accuracy. We provide some guidelines for this task at the end of Chapter 3.\n\nExample 2.12\nSketch gm and gmb of M1 in Fig. 2.40 as a function of the bias current I1.\n\n#### Solution\n\nSince gm=√(2 μn Cox(W/L) ID), we have gm ∝ √I1. The dependence of gmb upon I1 is less straightforward. As I1 increases, VX decreases, and so does VSB.\n\nPMOS Small-Signal Model\nThe derivation of the small-signal model seeks changes in the terminal currents due to changes in the terminal voltage differences. As such, this derivation yields exactly the same model for PMOS devices as for NMOS devices. For example, consider the arrangement shown in Fig. 2.41(a), where the voltage source V1 is changed by a small amount and the change in ID is measured (while M1 remains in saturation). Suppose V1 becomes more positive, making VGS more negative. Since the transistor now has a greater overdrive, it carries a higher current, and hence ID becomes more negative. (Recall that ID, in the direction shown here, is negative because the actual current of holes flows from the source to the drain.) Thus, a negative ΔVGS leads to a negative ΔID. Conversely, a positive ΔVGS produces a positive ΔID, as is the case for an NMOS device.\n\nIn our circuit diagrams, we usually draw the PMOS devices with their source terminals on top and their drain terminals on the bottom because the former are at a more positive voltage. This practice may cause confusion in drawing small-signal models. Let us draw the small-signal equivalent of the above circuit, assuming no channel-length modulation. Depicted in Fig. 2.41(b), the model shows the voltage-dependent current source pointing upward, giving the (wrong) impression that the direction of the current in the PMOS model is the opposite of that in the NMOS model. The reader is cautioned to avoid this confusion and bear in mind that the small-signal models of NMOS and PMOS transistors are identical.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, in this book we assume that the bulk of all NFETs is tied to the most negative supply (usually the ground) and that of PFETs to the most positive supply (usually VDD)."

Note that $g_{m} V_{G S}$ and $g_{m b} V_{B S}$ have the same polarity, i.e., raising the gate voltage has the same effect as raising the bulk potential.\n\nThe model in Fig. 2.37(d) is adequate for most low-frequency small-signal analyses. In reality, each terminal of a MOSFET exhibits a finite ohmic resistance due to the resistivity of the material (and the contacts), but proper layout can minimize such resistances. For example, consider the two structures of Fig. 2.33, repeated in Fig. 2.38 along with the gate distributed resistance. We note that folding reduces the gate resistance by a factor of four.\n[Image descriptions and extra information for the circuit diagrams are provided here.]\n\nFigure 2.38 Reduction of gate resistance by folding.\n\nShown in Fig. 2.39, the complete small-signal model includes the device capacitances as well. The value of each capacitance is calculated according to the equations derived in Sec. 2.4.2. The reader may wonder how a complex circuit is analyzed intuitively if each transistor must be replaced by the model of Fig. 2.39. The first step is to determine the simplest device model that can represent the role of each transistor with reasonable accuracy. We provide some guidelines for this task at the end of Chapter 3.\n[Image descriptions and extra information for the circuit diagrams are provided here.]\n\nExample 2.12\nSketch $g_{m}$ and $g_{m b}$ of $M_{1}$ in Fig. 2.40 as a function of the bias current $I_{1}$.\n\n#### Solution\n\nSince $g_{m}=\\sqrt{2 \\mu_{n} C_{o x}(W / L) I_{D}}$, we have $g_{m} \\propto \\sqrt{I_{1}}$. The dependence of $g_{m b}$ upon $I_{1}$ is less straightforward. As $I_{1}$ increases, $V_{X}$ decreases, and so does $V_{S B}$.\n[Image descriptions and extra information for the circuit diagrams are provided here.]\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 2.40\n\nPMOS Small-Signal Model The derivation of the small-signal model seeks changes in the terminal currents due to changes in the terminal voltage differences. As such, this derivation yields exactly the same model for PMOS devices as for NMOS devices. For example, consider the arrangement shown in Fig. 2.41(a), where the voltage source $V_{1}$ is changed by a small amount and the change in $I_{D}$ is measured (while $M_{1}$ remains in saturation). Suppose $V_{1}$ becomes more positive, making $V_{G S}$ more negative. Since the transistor now has a greater overdrive, it carries a higher current, and hence $I_{D}$ becomes more negative. (Recall that $I_{D}$, in the direction shown here, is negative because the actual current of holes flows from the source to the drain.) Thus, a negative $\\Delta V_{G S}$ leads to a negative $\\Delta I_{D}$. Conversely, a positive $\\Delta V_{G S}$ produces a positive $\\Delta I_{D}$, as is the case for an NMOS device.\n[Image descriptions and extra information for the circuit diagrams are provided here.]\n\nFigure 2.41 (a) Small-signal test of a PMOS device, and (b) small-signal model.\n\nIn our circuit diagrams, we usually draw the PMOS devices with their source terminals on top and their drain terminals on the bottom because the former are at a more positive voltage. This practice may cause confusion in drawing small-signal models. Let us draw the small-signal equivalent of the above circuit, assuming no channel-length modulation. Depicted in Fig. 2.41(b), the model shows the voltage-dependent current source pointing upward, giving the (wrong) impression that the direction of the current in the PMOS model is the opposite of that in the NMOS model. The reader is cautioned to avoid this confusion and bear in mind that the small-signal models of NMOS and PMOS transistors are identical.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, in this book we assume that the bulk of all NFETs is tied to the most negative supply (usually the ground) and that of PFETs to the most positive supply (usually $V_{D D}$ )."
