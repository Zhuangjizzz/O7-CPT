In Fig. 3.74(a), the PMOS-NMOS combination performs this function by using a PMOS transistor (M1) as the input device and an NMOS transistor (M2) as the cascode device. The input voltage (Vin) is applied to the gate of M1, and the output voltage (Vout) is taken across the resistor RD. The bias voltage (Vb) controls the gate of M2, allowing current to flow from VDD through M1 and M2 to ground, thus achieving the same functionality as a traditional cascode but with different transistor types."

This higher output impedance leads to a higher voltage gain, as voltage gain is directly related to the output impedance. The configuration enhances the circuit's performance by providing better amplification, making it suitable for applications requiring high gain. However, it is important to note that while a high output impedance increases gain, it may also affect the circuit's speed, which can be mitigated by proper feedback loop design as mentioned in Chapter 8."
