# CHAPTER 4 Differential Amplifiers

The differential amplifier is among the most important circuit inventions, dating back to the vacuum tube era. Offering many useful properties, differential operation has become the de facto choice in today's high-performance analog and mixed-signal circuits.

This chapter deals with the analysis and design of CMOS differential amplifiers. Following a review of single-ended and differential operation, we describe the basic differential pair and analyze both the large-signal and the small-signal behavior. Next, we introduce the concept of common-mode rejection and formulate it for differential amplifiers. We then study differential pairs with diode-connected and current-source loads as well as differential cascode stages. Finally, we describe the Gilbert cell.

## 4.1 ■ Single-Ended and Differential Operation

A "single-ended" signal is defined as one that is measured with respect to a fixed potential, usually the ground [Fig. 4.1(a)]. A differential signal is defined as one that is measured between two nodes that have equal and opposite signal excursions around a fixed potential [Fig. 4.1(b)]. In the strict sense, the two nodes must also exhibit equal impedances to that potential. The "center" potential in differential signaling is called the "common-mode" (CM) level. It is helpful to view the CM level as the bias value of the voltages, i.e., the value in the absence of signals.

The specification of signal swings in a differential system can be confusing. Suppose each singleended output in Fig. 4.1(b) has a peak amplitude of $V_{0}$. Then, the single-ended peak-to-peak swing is $2 V_{0}$ and the differential peak-to-peak swing is $4 V_{0}$. For example, if the voltage at $X$ (with respect to ground) is $V_{0} \cos \omega t+V_{C M}$ and that at $Y$ is $-V_{0} \cos \omega t+V_{C M}$, then the peak-to-peak swing of $V_{X}-V_{Y}$ $\left(=2 V_{0} \cos \omega t\right)$ is $4 V_{0}$. It is therefore not surprising that a circuit with a supply voltage of 1 V can deliver a peak-to-peak differential swing of 1.6 V .

An important advantage of differential operation over single-ended signaling is higher immunity to "environmental" noise. Consider the example depicted in Fig. 4.2, where two adjacent lines in a circuit carry a small, sensitive signal and a large clock waveform. Due to capacitive coupling between the lines, transitions on line $L_{2}$ corrupt the signal on line $L_{1}$. Now suppose, as shown in Fig. 4.2(b), the sensitive signal is distributed as two equal and opposite phases. If the clock line is placed midway between the two, the transitions disturb the differential phases by equal amounts, leaving the difference intact. Since the common-mode level of the two phases is disturbed, but the differential output is not corrupted, we say that this arrangement "rejects" common-mode noise. ${ }^{1}$

Another example of common-mode rejection occurs with noisy supply voltages. In the CS stage of Fig. 4.3(a), if $V_{D D}$ varies by $\Delta V$, then $V_{\text {out }}$ changes by approximately the same amount, i.e., the output is quite susceptible to noise on $V_{D D}$. Now consider the circuit in Fig. 4.3(b). Here, if the circuit is symmetric, noise on $V_{D D}$ affects $V_{X}$ and $V_{Y}$, but not $V_{X}-V_{Y}=V_{\text {out }}$. Thus, the circuit of Fig. 4.3(b) is much more robust in dealing with supply noise.

Figure 4.3 Effect of supply noise on (a) a single-ended circuit and (b) a differential circuit.
Thus far, we have seen the importance of employing differential paths for sensitive signals ("victims"). It is also beneficial to employ differential distribution for noisy lines ("aggressors"). For example, suppose the clock signal of Fig. 4.2 is distributed in differential form on two lines (Fig. 4.4). Then, with perfect symmetry, the components coupled from $C K$ and $\overline{C K}$ to the signal line cancel each other.

Figure 4.4 Reduction of coupled noise by differential operation.

#### Example 4.1

If differential victims or differential aggressors improve the overall noise immunity, can we choose differential phases for both victims and aggressors?

#### Solution

Yes, we can. Let us consider the arrangement shown in Fig. 4.5(a), where the differential victims are surrounded by the differential aggressors. Unfortunately, in this case, $V_{\text {out }}^{+}-V_{\text {out }}^{-}$is corrupted because $V_{\text {out }}^{+}$and $V_{\text {out }}^{-}$experience opposite jumps.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-102.jpg?height=452&width=1310&top_left_y=1167&top_left_x=380)

Figure 4.5

Now, suppose we modify the routing as depicted in Fig. 4.5(b), where $V_{\text {out }}^{+}\left(V_{\text {out }}^{-}\right)$is adjacent to $C K(\overline{C K})$ for half of the distance and to $\overline{C K}(C K)$ for the other half. In this case, the couplings from $C K$ and $\overline{C K}$ cancel each other. Interestingly, $V_{\text {out }}^{+}$and $V_{\text {out }}^{-}$are free from the coupling-and so is their difference. This geometry is an example of "twisted pairs."

Another useful property of differential signaling is the increase in maximum achievable voltage swings. In the circuit of Fig. 4.3, for example, the maximum output swing at $X$ or $Y$ is equal to $V_{D D}-\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\right)$, whereas for $V_{X}-V_{Y}$, the peak-to-peak swing is equal to $2\left[V_{D D}-\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\right)\right]$. Other advantages of differential circuits over their single-ended counterparts include simpler biasing and higher linearity (Chapter 14).

While differential circuits may occupy about twice as much area as single-ended alternatives, in practice this is a minor drawback. The numerous advantages of differential operation by far outweigh the possible increase in the area.

## 4.2 ■ Basic Differential Pair

How do we amplify a differential signal? As suggested by the observations in the previous section, we may incorporate two identical single-ended signal paths to process the two phases [Fig. 4.6(a)]. Here, two differential inputs, $V_{i n 1}$ and $V_{i n 2}$, having a certain CM level, $V_{i n, C M}$, are applied to the gates. The outputs are also differential and swing around the output CM level, $V_{\text {out }, C M}$. Such a circuit indeed offers some of the advantages of differential signaling: high rejection of supply noise, higher output swings, etc. But what happens if $V_{i n 1}$ and $V_{i n 2}$ experience a large common-mode disturbance or simply do not have a well-defined common-mode dc level? As the input CM level, $V_{i n, C M}$, changes, so do the bias currents of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$, thus varying both the transconductance of the devices and the output CM level. The variation of the transconductance, in turn, leads to a change in the small-signal gain, while the departure of the output CM level from its ideal value lowers the maximum allowable output swings. For example, as shown in Fig. 4.6(b), if the input CM level is excessively low, the minimum values of $V_{i n 1}$ and $V_{i n 2}$ may in fact turn off $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$, leading to severe clipping at the output. Thus, it is important that the bias currents of the devices have minimal dependence on the input CM level.

Figure 4.7 Basic differential pair.
A simple modification can resolve the above issue. Shown in Fig. 4.7, the "differential pair" ${ }^{2}$ employs a current source $I_{S S}$ to make $I_{D 1}+I_{D 2}$ independent of $V_{i n, C M}$. Thus, if $V_{i n 1}=V_{i n 2}$, the bias current of

[^16]each transistor equals $I_{S S} / 2$ and the output common-mode level is $V_{D D}-R_{D} I_{S S} / 2$. It is instructive to study the large-signal behavior of the circuit for both differential and common-mode input variations. In the large-signal study, we neglect channel-length modulation and body effect.

### 4.2.1 Qualitative Analysis

Let us assume that in Fig. 4.7, $V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}$ varies from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$. If $V_{i n 1}$ is much more negative than $V_{\text {in2 }}, M_{1}$ is off, $M_{2}$ is on, and $I_{D 2}=I_{S S}$. Thus, $V_{\text {out } 1}=V_{D D}$ and $V_{\text {out } 2}=V_{D D}-R_{D} I_{S S}$. As $V_{i n 1}$ is brought closer to $V_{i n 2}, M_{1}$ gradually turns on, drawing a fraction of $I_{S S}$ from $R_{D 1}$ and hence lowering $V_{\text {out } 1}$. Since $I_{D 1}+I_{D 2}=I_{S S}$, the drain current of $M_{2}$ falls and $V_{\text {out } 2}$ rises. As shown in Fig. 4.8(a), for $V_{\text {in } 1}=V_{\text {in } 2}$, we have $V_{\text {out } 1}=V_{\text {out } 2}=V_{D D}-R_{D} I_{S S} / 2$, which is the output CM level. As $V_{\text {in } 1}$ becomes more positive than $V_{\text {in2 }}, M_{1}$ carries a greater current than does $M_{2}$ and $V_{\text {out } 1}$ drops below $V_{\text {out } 2}$. For sufficiently large $V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}, M_{1}$ "hogs" all of $I_{S S}$, turning $M_{2}$ off. As a result, $V_{\text {out } 1}=V_{D D}-R_{D} I_{S S}$ and $V_{\text {out } 2}=V_{D D}$. Figure 4.8 also plots $V_{\text {out } 1}-V_{\text {out } 2}$ versus $V_{\text {in } 1}-V_{\text {in } 2}$. Note that the circuit contains three differential quantities: $V_{i n 1}-V_{\text {in } 2}, V_{\text {out } 1}-V_{\text {out } 2}$, and $I_{D 1}-I_{D 2}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-104.jpg?height=442&width=1322&top_left_y=883&top_left_x=371)

Figure 4.8 Differential input-output characteristics of a differential pair.

The foregoing analysis reveals two important attributes of the differential pair. First, the maximum and minimum levels at the output are well-defined ( $V_{D D}$ and $V_{D D}-R_{D} I_{S S}$, respectively) and independent of the input CM level. Second, as proved later, the small-signal gain (the slope of $V_{\text {out } 1}-V_{\text {out } 2}$ versus $V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}$ ) is maximum for $V_{i n 1}=V_{i n 2}$, gradually falling to zero as $\left|V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}\right|$ increases. In other words, the circuit becomes more nonlinear as the input voltage swing increases. For $V_{i n 1}=V_{i n 2}$, we say that the circuit is in "equilibrium."

Now let us consider the common-mode behavior of the circuit. As mentioned earlier, the role of the tail current source is to suppress the effect of input CM level variations on the operation of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ and the output level. Does this mean that $V_{i n, C M}$ can assume arbitrarily low or high values? To answer this question, we set $V_{i n 1}=V_{i n 2}=V_{i n, C M}$ and vary $V_{i n, C M}$ from 0 to $V_{D D}$. Figure 4.9(a) shows the circuit with $I_{S S}$ implemented by an NFET. Note that the symmetry of the pair requires that $V_{\text {out } 1}=V_{\text {out } 2}$.

What happens if $V_{i n, C M}=0$ ? Since the gate potential of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ is not more positive than their source potential, both devices are off, yielding $I_{D 3}=0$. This indicates that $M_{3}$ operates in the deep triode region because $V_{b}$ is high enough to create an inversion layer in the transistor. With $I_{D 1}=I_{D 2}=0$, the circuit is incapable of signal amplification, $V_{\text {out } 1}=V_{\text {out } 2}=V_{D D}$, and $V_{P}=0$.

Now suppose $V_{i n, C M}$ becomes more positive. Modeling $M_{3}$ by a resistor as in Fig. 4.9(b), we note that $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ turn on if $V_{i n, C M} \geq V_{T H}$. Beyond this point, $I_{D 1}$ and $I_{D 2}$ continue to increase, and $V_{P}$ also rises [Fig. 4.9(c)]. In a sense, $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ constitute a source follower, forcing $V_{P}$ to track $V_{i n, C M}$. For a sufficiently high $V_{i n, C M}$, the drain-source voltage of $M_{3}$ exceeds $V_{G S 3}-V_{T H 3}$, allowing the device to operate in saturation. The total current through $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ then remains constant. We conclude that for proper operation, $V_{i n, C M} \geq V_{G S 1}+\left(V_{G S 3}-V_{T H 3}\right)$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-105.jpg?height=865&width=1533&top_left_y=218&top_left_x=235)

Figure 4.9 (a) Differential pair sensing an input common-mode change; (b) equivalent circuit if $M_{3}$ operates in the deep triode region; (c) common-mode input-output characteristics.

What happens if $V_{\text {in }, C M}$ rises further? Since $V_{\text {out } 1}$ and $V_{\text {out } 2}$ are relatively constant, we expect that $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ enter the triode region if $V_{\text {in,CM }}>V_{\text {out } 1}+V_{T H}=V_{D D}-R_{D} I_{S S} / 2+V_{T H}$. This sets an upper limit on the input CM level. In summary, the allowable value of $V_{i n, C M}$ is bounded as follows:

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{G S 1}+\left(V_{G S 3}-V_{T H 3}\right) \leq V_{i n, C M} \leq \min \left[V_{D D}-R_{D} \frac{I_{S S}}{2}+V_{T H}, V_{D D}\right] \tag{4.1}
\end{equation*}
$$

Beyond the upper bound, the CM characteristics of Fig. 4.9(c) do not change, but the differential gain drops. ${ }^{3}$

#### Example 4.2

Figure 4.10

#### Solution

As shown in Fig. 4.10, the gain begins to increase as $V_{i n, C M}$ exceeds $V_{T H}$. After the tail current source enters saturation ( $V_{i n, C M}=V_{1}$ ), the gain remains relatively constant. Finally, if $V_{i n, C M}$ is so high that the input transistors enter the triode region $\left(V_{i n, C M}=V_{2}\right)$, the gain begins to fall.

[^17]With our understanding of differential and common-mode behavior of the differential pair, we can now answer another important question: How large can the output voltage swings of a differential pair be? Suppose the circuit is biased with input and output bias levels $V_{i n, C M}$ and $V_{o u t, C M}$, respectively, and $V_{\text {in }, C M}<V_{\text {out }, C M}$. Also, assume that the voltage gain is high, that is, the input swing is much less than the output swing. As illustrated in Fig. 4.11, for $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ to be saturated, each output can go as high as $V_{D D}$ but as low as approximately $V_{i n, C M}-V_{T H}$. In other words, the higher the input CM level, the smaller the allowable output swings. For this reason, it is desirable to choose a relatively low $V_{i n, C M}$, but, of course, no less than $V_{G S 1}+\left(V_{G S 3}-V_{T H 3}\right)$. Such a choice affords a single-ended peak-to-peak output swing of $V_{D D}-\left(V_{G S 1}-V_{T H 1}\right)-\left(V_{G S 3}-V_{T H 3}\right)$ (why?). The reader is encouraged to repeat this analysis if the voltage gain is around unity.

#### Example 4.3

Compare the maximum output voltage swings provided by a CS stage and a differential pair.

#### Nanometer Design Notes

Owing to both severe channel-length modulation and limited supply voltages, the voltage gain of nanometer differential pairs hardly exceeds 5 . In this case, the peak input swing also limits the output swing. As shown below, for a peak input amplitude of $V_{0}$, the minimum allowable output is equal to $V_{i n, C M}+V_{0}-V_{T H}$. This issue arises in any circuit that has a negative gain.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-106.jpg?height=424&width=498&top_left_y=1847&top_left_x=145)

#### Solution

Recall from Chapter 3 that a CS stage (with resistive load) allows an output swing of $V_{D D}$ minus one overdrive $\left(V_{D D}-V_{D, s a t}\right)$. As seen above, with proper choice of the input CM level, a differential pair provides a maximum output swing of $V_{D D}$ minus two overdrives (single-ended) or $2 V_{D D}$ minus four overdrives (differential) $\left(2 V_{D D}-4 V_{D, s a t}\right)$, which is typically quite a lot larger than $V_{D D}-V_{D, s a t}$.

### 4.2.2 Quantitative Analysis

In this section, we quantify both large-signal and small-signal characteristics of MOS differential pairs. We begin with large-signal analysis to arrive at expressions for the plots shown in Fig. 4.8.

Large-Signal Behavior Consider the differential pair shown in Fig. 4.12. Our objective is to determine $V_{\text {out } 1}-V_{\text {out } 2}$ as a function of $V_{\text {in } 1}-V_{\text {in } 2}$. We have $V_{\text {out } 1}=V_{D D}-R_{D 1} I_{D 1}$ and $V_{\text {out } 2}=V_{D D}-R_{D 2} I_{D 2}$, that is, $V_{\text {out } 1}-$ $V_{\text {out } 2}=R_{D 2} I_{D 2}-R_{D 1} I_{D 1}=R_{D}\left(I_{D 2}-I_{D 1}\right)$ if $R_{D 1}=R_{D 2}=R_{D}$. Thus, we simply calculate $I_{D 1}$ and $I_{D 2}$ in terms of $V_{i n 1}$ and $V_{i n 2}$, assuming the circuit is symmetric, $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ are saturated, and $\lambda=0$. Since the voltage at node $P$ is equal to $V_{i n 1}-V_{G S 1}$ and $V_{i n 2}-V_{G S 2}$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}=V_{G S 1}-V_{G S 2} \tag{4.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-107.jpg?height=411&width=498&top_left_y=245&top_left_x=448)

Figure 4.12 Differential pair.
For a square-law device, we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\right)^{2}=\frac{I_{D}}{\frac{1}{2} \mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}} \tag{4.3}
\end{equation*}
$$

and, therefore,

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{G S}=\sqrt{\frac{2 I_{D}}{\mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}}}+V_{T H} \tag{4.4}
\end{equation*}
$$

It follows from (4.2) and (4.4) that

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}=\sqrt{\frac{2 I_{D 1}}{\mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}}}-\sqrt{\frac{2 I_{D 2}}{\mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}}} \tag{4.5}
\end{equation*}
$$

We wish to calculate the differential output current, $I_{D 1}-I_{D 2}$. Squaring the two sides of (4.5) and recognizing that $I_{D 1}+I_{D 2}=I_{S S}$, we obtain

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left(V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}\right)^{2}=\frac{2}{\mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}}\left(I_{S S}-2 \sqrt{I_{D 1} I_{D 2}}\right) \tag{4.6}
\end{equation*}
$$

That is,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{2} \mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}\left(V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}\right)^{2}-I_{S S}=-2 \sqrt{I_{D 1} I_{D 2}} \tag{4.7}
\end{equation*}
$$

Squaring the two sides again and noting that $4 I_{D 1} I_{D 2}=\left(I_{D 1}+I_{D 2}\right)^{2}-\left(I_{D 1}-I_{D 2}\right)^{2}=I_{S S}^{2}-\left(I_{D 1}-I_{D 2}\right)^{2}$, we arrive at

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left(I_{D 1}-I_{D 2}\right)^{2}=-\frac{1}{4}\left(\mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}\right)^{2}\left(V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}\right)^{4}+I_{S S} \mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}\left(V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}\right)^{2} \tag{4.8}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus,

$$
\begin{align*}
I_{D 1}-I_{D 2} & =\frac{1}{2} \mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}\left(V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}\right) \sqrt{\frac{4 I_{S S}}{\mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}}-\left(V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}\right)^{2}}  \tag{4.9}\\
& =\sqrt{\mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L} I_{S S}\left(V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}\right) \sqrt{1-\frac{\mu_{n} C_{o x}(W / L)}{4 I_{S S}}\left(V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}\right)^{2}}} \tag{4.10}
\end{align*}
$$

We can say that $M_{1}, M_{2}$, and the tail operate as a voltage-dependent current source producing $I_{D 1}-I_{D 2}$ according to the above large-signal characteristics. As expected, $I_{D 1}-I_{D 2}$ is an odd function of $V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}$,
falling to zero for $V_{i n 1}=V_{i n 2}$. As $\left|V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}\right|$ increases from zero, $\left|I_{D 1}-I_{D 2}\right|$ increases because the factor preceding the square root rises more rapidly than the argument in the square root drops. ${ }^{4}$

Before examining (4.9) further, it is instructive to calculate the slope of the characteristic, i.e., the equivalent $G_{m}$ of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$. Denoting the differential quantities $I_{D 1}-I_{D 2}$ and $V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}$ by $\Delta I_{D}$ and $\Delta V_{i n}$, respectively, the reader can show that

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial \Delta I_{D}}{\partial \Delta V_{i n}}=\frac{1}{2} \mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L} \frac{\frac{4 I_{S S}}{\mu_{n} C_{o x} W / L}-2 \Delta V_{i n}^{2}}{\sqrt{\frac{4 I_{S S}}{\mu_{n} C_{o x} W / L}-\Delta V_{i n}^{2}}} \tag{4.11}
\end{equation*}
$$

For $\Delta V_{i n}=0, G_{m}$ is maximum (why?) and equal to $\sqrt{\mu_{n} C_{o x}(W / L) I_{S S}}$. Moreover, since $V_{\text {out } 1}-V_{\text {out } 2}=$ $R_{D} \Delta I=-R_{D} G_{m} \Delta V_{i n}$, we can write the small-signal differential voltage gain of the circuit in the equilibrium condition as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|A_{v}\right|=\sqrt{\mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L} I_{S S}} R_{D} \tag{4.12}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since each transistor carries a bias current of $I_{S S} / 2$ in this condition, the factor $\sqrt{\mu_{m} C_{o x}(W / L) I_{S S}}$ is in fact the same as the transconductance of each device, that is, $\left|A_{v}\right|=g_{m} R_{D}$. Equation (4.11) also suggests that $G_{m}$ falls to zero for $\Delta V_{i n}=\sqrt{2 I_{S S} /\left(\mu_{n} C_{o x} W / L\right)}$. As we will see below, this value of $\Delta V_{i n}$ plays an important role in the operation of the circuit.

Let us now examine Eq. (4.9) more closely. If $\left(V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}\right)^{2} \ll 4 I_{S S} /\left[\mu_{n} C_{o x}(W / L)\right]$, then

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{D 1}-I_{D 2}=\sqrt{\mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L} I_{S S}}\left(V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}\right) \tag{4.13}
\end{equation*}
$$

which yields the same equilibrium $G_{m}$ as that obtained above.
But what happens for larger values of $\left|V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}\right|$ ? It appears that the argument in the square root drops to zero for $\Delta V_{i n}=\sqrt{4 I_{S S} /\left(\mu_{n} C_{o x} W / L\right)}$ and $\Delta I_{D}$ crosses zero at two different values of $\Delta V_{i n}$, an effect not predicted by our qualitative analysis in Fig. 4.8. This conclusion, however, is incorrect. To understand why, recall that (4.9) was derived with the assumption that both $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ are on. In reality, as $\Delta V_{i n}$ exceeds a limit, one transistor carries the entire $I_{S S}$, turning off the other. ${ }^{5}$ Denoting this value by $\Delta V_{i n 1}$, we have $I_{D 1}=I_{S S}$ and $\Delta V_{i n 1}=V_{G S 1}-V_{T H}$ because $M_{2}$ is nearly off. It follows that

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V_{i n 1}=\sqrt{\frac{2 I_{S S}}{\mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}}} \tag{4.14}
\end{equation*}
$$

For $\Delta V_{i n}>\Delta V_{i n 1}, M_{2}$ is off and (4.9) and (4.10) do not hold. As mentioned above, $G_{m}$ falls to zero for $\Delta V_{i n}=\Delta V_{i n 1}$. Figure 4.13 plots the behavior.

#### Example 4.4

Plot the output currents of a differential pair versus $\Delta V_{i n}$ as the device width and the tail current vary.

#### Solution

Consider the characteristic shown in Fig. 4.14(a). As $W / L$ increases, $\Delta V_{i n 1}$ decreases, narrowing the input range across which both devices are on [Fig. 4.14(b)]. As $I_{S S}$ increases, both the input range and the output current swing increase [Fig. 4.14(c)]. Intuitively, we expect the circuit to become more linear as $I_{S S}$ increases or $W / L$ decreases.

#### Nanometer Design Notes

Nanometer differential pairs exhibit a similar relation between the equilibrium overdrive and the differential voltage necessary to turn one side off. Plotted below are the output currents of a differential pair with $W / L=5 \mu \mathrm{~m} / 40 \mathrm{~nm}$ and $I_{S S}=0.25 \mathrm{~mA}$ using actual models (black curve) and a square-law model (gray curve). If we define cut-off as when one transistor carries $90 \%$ of the tail current, then the nanometer design also displays approximately a factor of $\sqrt{2}$ between the equilibrium and cut-off voltages.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-109.jpg?height=429&width=529&top_left_y=1886&top_left_x=58)

The value of $\Delta V_{i n 1}$ given by (4.14) in essence represents the maximum differential input that the circuit can "handle." It is possible to relate $\Delta V_{i n 1}$ to the overdrive voltage of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ in equilibrium. For a zero differential input, $I_{D 1}=I_{D 2}=I_{S S} / 2$, yielding

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\right)_{1,2}=\sqrt{\frac{I_{S S}}{\mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}}} \tag{4.15}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus, $\Delta V_{i n 1}$ is equal to $\sqrt{2}$ times the equilibrium overdrive. The point is that increasing $\Delta V_{i n 1}$ to make the circuit more linear inevitably increases the overdrive voltage of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$. For a given $I_{S S}$, this is accomplished only by reducing $W / L$ and hence the transconductance of the transistors, trading small-signal gain for linearity. Alternatively, we can increase $I_{S S}$, but at the cost of power. (What happens to the gain if $I_{S S}$ is increased but $I_{S S} R_{D}$ is kept constant due to headroom constraints?)

#### Example 4.5

Due to a manufacturing defect, the differential signals applied to a differential pair have unequal dc levels (Fig. 4.15). If the peak swing, $V_{0}$, is small and the imbalance, $V_{O S}$, happens to be equal to $\Delta V_{i n 1} / 2=(1 / 2) \sqrt{2 I_{S S} /\left(\mu_{n} C_{o x} W / L\right)}$, sketch the output voltage waveforms and determine the small-signal voltage gain.

Figure 4.15

#### Solution

Let us first study the circuit with only dc inputs that differ by $V_{O S}$. The differential pair senses an imbalance of $V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}=V_{O S}$ and, from Eq. (4.10), generates

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{D 1}-I_{D 2}=\frac{\sqrt{7}}{4} I_{S S} \tag{4.16}
\end{equation*}
$$

That is, $I_{D 1} \approx 0.83 I_{S S}, I_{D 2} \approx 0.17 I_{S S}$ and $V_{X}-V_{Y}=-(\sqrt{7} / 4) I_{S S} R_{D}$.
Now, we recognize from Fig. 4.15(b) that the input dc imbalance biases the transistors away from the highest transconductance, yielding from Eq. (4.11)

$$
\begin{equation*}
G_{m 1}=\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \sqrt{\mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L} I_{S S}} \tag{4.17}
\end{equation*}
$$

This value is about 20\% less than that at equilibrium. The output waveforms are shown in Fig. 4.15(c).

Small-Signal Analysis We now study the small-signal behavior of differential pairs. As depicted in Fig. 4.16, we apply small signals $V_{i n 1}$ and $V_{i n 2}$ and assume that $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ are saturated. What is the differential voltage gain, $\left(V_{\text {out } 1}-V_{\text {out } 2}\right) /\left(V_{\text {in1 }}-V_{\text {in2 }}\right)$ ? Recall from Eq. (4.12) that this quantity equals $\sqrt{\mu_{n} C_{o x} I_{S S} W / L} R_{D}$. Since in the vicinity of equilibrium, each transistor carries approximately $I_{S S} / 2$, this expression reduces to $g_{m} R_{D}$, where $g_{m}$ denotes the transconductance of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$. To arrive at the same result by small-signal analysis, we employ two different methods, each providing insight into the circuit's operation. We assume that $R_{D 1}=R_{D 2}=R_{D}$.

Figure 4.16 Differential pair with small-signal inputs.

Method I The circuit of Fig. 4.16 is driven by two independent signals. Thus, the output can be computed by superposition. (The voltages in this section are small-signal quantities.)

Figure 4.17 (a) Differential pair sensing one input signal; (b) circuit of (a) viewed as a CS stage degenerated by $M_{2}$; (c) equivalent circuit of (b).

Let us set $V_{i n 2}$ to zero and find the effect of $V_{i n 1}$ at $X$ and $Y$ [Fig. 4.17(a)]. To obtain $V_{X}$, we note that $M_{1}$ forms a common-source stage with a degeneration resistance equal to the impedance seen looking into the source of $M_{2}$ [Fig. 4.17(b)]. Neglecting channel-length modulation and body effect, we have $R_{S}=1 / g_{m 2}[$ Fig. 4.17(c) $]$ and

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{V_{X}}{V_{i n 1}}=\frac{-R_{D}}{\frac{1}{g_{m 1}}+\frac{1}{g_{m 2}}} \tag{4.18}
\end{equation*}
$$

To calculate $V_{Y}$, we note that $M_{1}$ drives $M_{2}$ as a source follower and replace $V_{i n 1}$ and $M_{1}$ by a Thevenin equivalent (Fig. 4.18): the Thevenin voltage $V_{T}=V_{i n 1}$ and the resistance $R_{T}=1 / g_{m 1}$. Here, $M_{2}$ operates as a common-gate stage, exhibiting a gain equal to

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{V_{Y}}{V_{i n 1}}=\frac{R_{D}}{\frac{1}{g_{m 2}}+\frac{1}{g_{m 1}}} \tag{4.19}
\end{equation*}
$$

It follows from (4.18) and (4.19) that the overall voltage gain for $V_{i n 1}$ is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left.\left(V_{X}-V_{Y}\right)\right|_{\text {Due to } \operatorname{Vin} 1}=\frac{-2 R_{D}}{\frac{1}{g_{m 1}}+\frac{1}{g_{m 2}}} V_{i n 1} \tag{4.20}
\end{equation*}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-111.jpg?height=474&width=1136&top_left_y=1771&top_left_x=400)

Figure 4.18 Replacing $M_{1}$ by a Thevenin equivalent.
which, for $g_{m 1}=g_{m 2}=g_{m}$, reduces to

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left.\left(V_{X}-V_{Y}\right)\right|_{\text {Due to } V i n 1}=-g_{m} R_{D} V_{i n 1} \tag{4.21}
\end{equation*}
$$

By virtue of symmetry, the effect of $V_{i n 2}$ at $X$ and $Y$ is identical to that of $V_{i n 1}$ except for a change in the polarities:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left.\left(V_{X}-V_{Y}\right)\right|_{\text {Due to } \operatorname{Vin2}}=g_{m} R_{D} V_{i n 2} \tag{4.22}
\end{equation*}
$$

Adding the two sides of (4.21) and (4.22) to perform superposition, we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\left(V_{X}-V_{Y}\right)_{t o t}}{V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}}=-g_{m} R_{D} \tag{4.23}
\end{equation*}
$$

Comparison of (4.21), (4.22), and (4.23) indicates that the magnitude of the differential gain is equal to $g_{m} R_{D}$ regardless of how the inputs are applied: in Figs. 4.17 and 4.18 , the input is applied to only one side, whereas in Fig. 4.16 the input is the difference between two sources. It is also important to recognize that if the output is single-ended, i.e., it is sensed between $X$ or $Y$ and ground, the gain is halved.

#### Example 4.6

Due to a manufacturing error, in the circuit of Fig. 4.19, $M_{2}$ is twice as wide as $M_{1}$. Calculate the small-signal gain if the dc levels of $V_{i n 1}$ and $V_{i n 2}$ are equal.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-112.jpg?height=395&width=482&top_left_y=1224&top_left_x=525)

Figure 4.19

#### Solution

If the gates of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ are at the same dc potential, then $V_{G S 1}=V_{G S 2}$ and $I_{D 2}=2 I_{D 1}=2 I_{S S} / 3$. Thus, $g_{m 1}=\sqrt{2 \mu_{n} C_{o x}(W / L) I_{S S} / 3}$ and $g_{m 2}=\sqrt{2 \mu_{n} C_{o x}(2 W / L)\left(2 I_{S S}\right) / 3}=2 g_{m 1}$. Following the same procedure as above, the reader can show that

$$
\begin{align*}
\left|A_{v}\right| & =\frac{2 R_{D}}{\frac{1}{g_{m 1}}+\frac{1}{2 g_{m 1}}}  \tag{4.24}\\
& =\frac{4}{3} g_{m 1} R_{D} \tag{4.25}
\end{align*}
$$

Note that, for a given $I_{S S}$, this value is lower than the gain of a symmetric differential pair [Eq. (4.23)] because $g_{m 1}$ is smaller. The reader can show that the characteristics of Fig. 4.13 are shifted horizontally, and hence the circuit exhibits an "offset." We utilize this idea in Chapter 14 to linearize differential pairs.

How does the transconductance of a differential pair compare with that of a common-source stage? For a given total bias current, the value of $g_{m}$ in (4.23) is $1 / \sqrt{2}$ times that of a single transistor biased at $I_{S S}$ with the same dimensions. Thus, the total $G_{m}$ is proportionally less.

Method II If a fully-symmetric differential pair senses differential inputs (i.e., the two inputs change by equal and opposite amounts from the equilibrium condition), then the concept of "half circuit" can be applied. We first prove a lemma.

Lemma Consider the symmetric circuit shown in Fig. 4.20(a), where $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$ represent any threeterminal active device. Suppose $V_{i n 1}$ and $V_{i n 2}$ change differentially, the former from $V_{0}$ to $V_{0}+\Delta V_{i n}$ and the latter from $V_{0}$ to $V_{0}-\Delta V_{\text {in }}$ [Fig. 4.20(b)]. Then, if the circuit remains linear, $V_{P}$ does not change. Assume $\lambda=0$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-113.jpg?height=493&width=1425&top_left_y=706&top_left_x=253)

Figure 4.20 Illustration of why node $P$ is a virtual ground.
Proof. The lemma can be proved by invoking symmetry. As long as the operation remains linear, so that the difference between the bias currents of $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$ is negligible, the circuit is symmetric. Thus, $V_{P}$ cannot "favor" the change at one input and "ignore" the other.

From another point of view, the effect of $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$ at node $P$ can be represented by Thevenin equivalents (Fig. 4.21). If $V_{T 1}$ and $V_{T 2}$ change by equal and opposite amounts and $R_{T 1}$ and $R_{T 2}$ are equal, then $V_{P}$ remains constant. We emphasize that this is valid if the changes are small enough that we can assume $R_{T 1}=R_{T 2}$ (e.g., $\left.1 / g_{m 1}=1 / g_{m 2}\right) .{ }^{6}$ This perspective suggests the lemma's validity even if the tail current source is not ideal.

Figure 4.21 Replacing each half of a differential pair by a Thevenin equivalent.

We now offer a more formal proof. Let us assume that $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ have an equilibrium value of $V_{a}$ and change by $\Delta V_{1}$ and $\Delta V_{2}$, respectively [Fig. 4.20 (c)]. The output currents therefore change by $g_{m} \Delta V_{1}$ and $g_{m} \Delta V_{2}$. Since $I_{1}+I_{2}=I_{T}$, we have $g_{m} \Delta V_{1}+g_{m} \Delta V_{2}=0$, i.e., $\Delta V_{1}=-\Delta V_{2}$. We also know that $V_{i n 1}-V_{1}=V_{i n 2}-V_{2}$, and hence $V_{0}+\Delta V_{i n}-\left(V_{a}+\Delta V_{1}\right)=V_{0}-\Delta V_{i n}-\left(V_{a}+\Delta V_{2}\right)$. Consequently, $2 \Delta V_{\text {in }}=\Delta V_{1}-\Delta V_{2}=2 \Delta V_{1}$. In other words, if $V_{i n 1}$ and $V_{i n 2}$ change by $+\Delta V_{i n}$ and $-\Delta V_{i n}$, respectively, then $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ change by the same values, i.e., a differential change in the inputs is simply "absorbed" by $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$. In fact, since $V_{P}=V_{i n 1}-V_{1}$, and since $V_{1}$ exhibits the same change as $V_{i n 1}, V_{P}$ does not change.

[^19]The above lemma greatly simplifies the small-signal analysis of differential amplifiers. As shown in Fig. 4.22, since $V_{P}$ experiences no change, node $P$ can be considered "ac ground" (or a "virtual ground"), and the circuit can be decomposed into two separate halves. We say that we have applied the "half-circuit concept" [1]. We can write $V_{X} / V_{i n 1}=-g_{m} R_{D}$ and $V_{Y} /\left(-V_{i n 1}\right)=-g_{m} R_{D}$, where $V_{i n 1}$ and $-V_{i n 1}$ denote the voltage change on each side. Thus, $\left(V_{X}-V_{Y}\right) /\left(2 V_{i n 1}\right)=-g_{m} R_{D}$.

Figure 4.22 Application of the half-circuit concept.

#### Example 4.7

Calculate the differential gain of the circuit of Fig. 4.22(a) if $\lambda \neq 0$.

#### Solution

Applying the half-circuit concept as illustrated in Fig. 4.23, we have $V_{X} / V_{i n 1}=-g_{m}\left(R_{D} \| r_{O 1}\right)$ and $V_{Y} /\left(-V_{i n 1}\right)=$ $-g_{m}\left(R_{D} \| r_{O 2}\right)$, thus arriving at $\left(V_{X}-V_{Y}\right) /\left(2 V_{i n 1}\right)=-g_{m}\left(R_{D} \| r_{O}\right)$, where $r_{O}=r_{O 1}=r_{O 2}$. Note that Method I would require lengthy calculations here.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-114.jpg?height=352&width=705&top_left_y=1312&top_left_x=413)

Figure 4.23

The half-circuit concept provides a powerful technique for analyzing symmetric differential pairs with fully differential inputs. But what happens if the two inputs are not fully differential [Fig. 4.24(a)]? As depicted in Figs. 4.24(b) and (c), the two inputs $V_{i n 1}$ and $V_{i n 2}$ can be viewed as

$$
\begin{align*}
& V_{i n 1}=\frac{V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}}{2}+\frac{V_{i n 1}+V_{i n 2}}{2}  \tag{4.26}\\
& V_{i n 2}=\frac{V_{i n 2}-V_{i n 1}}{2}+\frac{V_{i n 1}+V_{i n 2}}{2} \tag{4.27}
\end{align*}
$$

Since the second term is common to both inputs, we obtain the equivalent circuit in Fig. 4.24(d), recognizing that the circuit senses a combination of a differential input and a common-mode variation. Therefore, as illustrated in Fig. 4.25, the effect of each type of input can be computed by superposition, with the half-circuit concept applied to the differential-mode operation. We deal with CM analysis in Sec. 4.3.

#### Example 4.8

In the circuit of Fig. 4.22(a), calculate $V_{X}$ and $V_{Y}$ if $V_{i n 1} \neq-V_{i n 2}$ and $\lambda \neq 0$.

#### Solution

For differential-mode operation, we have from Fig. 4.26(a)

$$
\begin{align*}
& V_{X}=-g_{m}\left(R_{D} \| r_{O 1}\right) \frac{V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}}{2}  \tag{4.28}\\
& V_{Y}=-g_{m}\left(R_{D} \| r_{O 2}\right) \frac{V_{i n 2}-V_{i n 1}}{2} \tag{4.29}
\end{align*}
$$

That is,

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{X}-V_{Y}=-g_{m}\left(R_{D} \| r_{O}\right)\left(V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}\right) \tag{4.30}
\end{equation*}
$$

which is to be expected.
For common-mode operation, the circuit reduces to that in Fig. 4.26(b). How much do $V_{X}$ and $V_{Y}$ change as $V_{i n, C M}$ changes? If the circuit is fully symmetric and $I_{S S}$ an ideal current source, the currents drawn by $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ from $R_{D 1}$ and $R_{D 2}$ are exactly equal to $I_{S S} / 2$ and independent of $V_{i n, C M}$. Thus, $V_{X}$ and $V_{Y}$ remain equal to $V_{D D}-R_{D}\left(I_{S S} / 2\right)$ and experience no change as $V_{i n, C M}$ varies. Interestingly, the circuit simply amplifies the difference between $V_{i n 1}$ and $V_{i n 2}$ while eliminating the effect of $V_{i n, C M}$.

### 4.2.3 Degenerated Differential Pair

As with a simple common-source stage, a differential pair can incorporate resistive degeneration to improve its linearity. Shown in Fig. 4.27(a), such a topology softens the nonlinear behavior of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ by $R_{S 1}$ and $R_{S 2}$. This can be seen from the input-output characteristics of Fig. 4.27(b), where, due to degeneration, the differential voltage necessary to turn off one side increases in magnitude. We can
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-116.jpg?height=527&width=1466&top_left_y=1724&top_left_x=304)

Figure 4.27 (a) Degenerated differential pair, and (b) characteristics with and without degeneration.
readily prove this point. Suppose that at $V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2}=\Delta V_{i n 2}, M_{2}$ turns off and $I_{D 1}=I_{S S}$. We then have $V_{G S 2}=V_{T H}$, and hence

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{i n 1}-V_{G S 1}-R_{S} I_{S S}=V_{i n 2}-V_{T H} \tag{4.31}
\end{equation*}
$$

which yields

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{i n 1}-V_{i n 2} & =V_{G S 1}-V_{T H}+R_{S} I_{S S}  \tag{4.32}\\
& =\sqrt{\frac{2 I_{S S}}{\mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}}}+R_{S} I_{S S} \tag{4.33}
\end{align*}
$$

We recognize the first term on the right-hand side as $\Delta V_{i n 1}$ (the input difference necessary for turning off $M_{2}$ if $R_{S}=0$ ). It follows that

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V_{i n 2}-\Delta V_{i n 1}=R_{S} I_{S S} \tag{4.34}
\end{equation*}
$$

suggesting that the linear input range is widened by approximately $\pm R_{S} I_{S S}$.
The small-signal voltage gain of the degenerated differential pair can be obtained by applying the half-circuit concept. The half circuit is simply a degenerated CS stage, exhibiting a gain of

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|A_{v}\right|=\frac{R_{D}}{\frac{1}{g_{m}}+R_{S}} \tag{4.35}
\end{equation*}
$$

if $\lambda=\gamma=0$. The circuit thus trades gain for linearity-as is also observed from the slopes of the characteristics in Fig. 4.27(b). Note that $A_{v}$ is less sensitive to $g_{m}$ variations in this case.

In addition to reducing the gain, the degeneration resistors in Fig. 4.27(a) also consume voltage headroom. In the equilibrium condition, each resistor sustains a voltage drop of $R_{S} I_{S S} / 2$, as if the tail current source itself required this much more headroom. The input common-mode level must therefore be higher by this amount, and so must be the minimum voltage at $X$ or $Y$. In other words, the maximum allowable differential output swing is reduced by $R_{S} I_{S S}$. This issue can be resolved as shown in Fig. 4.28, where the tail current source is split in half, with each half directly tied to a source. In equilibrium, no current flows through the degeneration resistance, and hence no headroom is sacrificed. ${ }^{7}$ Other methods of linearizing differential pairs are described in Chapter 14.

## 4.3 ■ Common-Mode Response

An important attribute of differential amplifiers is their ability to suppress the effect of common-mode perturbations. Example 4.8 portrays an idealized case of common-mode response. In reality, neither is the circuit fully symmetric nor does the current source exhibit an infinite output impedance. As a result, a fraction of the input CM variation appears at the output.

Figure 4.29 (a) Differential pair sensing CM input; (b) simplified version of (a); (c) equivalent circuit of (b).

We first assume that the circuit is symmetric, but the current source has a finite output impedance, $R_{S S}$ [Fig. 4.29(a)]. As $V_{i n, C M}$ changes, so does $V_{P}$, thereby increasing the drain currents of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ and lowering both $V_{X}$ and $V_{Y}$. Owing to symmetry, $V_{X}$ remains equal to $V_{Y}$ and, as depicted in Fig. 4.29(b), the two nodes can be shorted together. Since $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ are now "in parallel," i.e., they share all of their respective terminals, the circuit can be reduced to that in Fig. 4.29(c). Note that the composite device, $M_{1}+M_{2}$, has twice the width and the bias current of each of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ and, therefore, twice their transconductance. The "common-mode gain" of the circuit is thus equal to

$$
\begin{align*}
A_{v, C M} & =\frac{V_{\text {out }}}{V_{\text {in, }, C M}}  \tag{4.36}\\
& =-\frac{R_{D} / 2}{1 /\left(2 g_{m}\right)+R_{S S}} \tag{4.37}
\end{align*}
$$

where $g_{m}$ denotes the transconductance of each of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ and $\lambda=\gamma=0$.
What is the significance of this calculation? In a symmetric circuit, input CM variations disturb the bias points, altering the small-signal gain and possibly limiting the output voltage swings. This can be illustrated by an example.

#### Example 4.9

The circuit of Fig. 4.30 uses a resistor rather than a current source to define a tail current of 1 mA . Assume that $(W / L)_{1,2}=25 / 0.5, \mu_{n} C_{o x}=50 \mu \mathrm{~A} / \mathrm{V}^{2}, V_{T H}=0.6 \mathrm{~V}, \lambda=\gamma=0$, and $V_{D D}=3 \mathrm{~V}$.
(a) What is the required input CM voltage for which $R_{S S}$ sustains 0.5 V ?
(b) Calculate $R_{D}$ for a differential gain of 5 .
(c) What happens at the output if the input CM level is 50 mV higher than the value calculated in (a)?

Figure 4.30

#### Solution

(a) Since $I_{D 1}=I_{D 2}=0.5 \mathrm{~mA}$, we have

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{G S 1}=V_{G S 2} & =\sqrt{\frac{2 I_{D 1}}{\mu_{n} C_{o x} \frac{W}{L}}}+V_{T H}  \tag{4.38}\\
& =1.23 \mathrm{~V} \tag{4.39}
\end{align*}
$$

Thus, $V_{\text {in }, C M}=V_{G S 1}+0.5 \mathrm{~V}=1.73 \mathrm{~V}$. Note that $R_{S S}=500 \Omega$.
(b) The transconductance of each device is $g_{m}=\sqrt{2 \mu_{n} C_{o x}(W / L) I_{D 1}}=1 /(632 \Omega)$, requiring $R_{D}=3.16 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ for a gain of 5 .

Note that the output bias level is equal to $V_{D D}-I_{D 1} R_{D}=1.42 \mathrm{~V}$. Since $V_{i n, C M}=1.73 \mathrm{~V}$ and $V_{T H}=0.6 \mathrm{~V}$, the transistors are 290 mV away from the triode region.
(c) If $V_{i n, C M}$ increases by 50 mV , the equivalent circuit of Fig. 4.29 (c) suggests that $V_{X}$ and $V_{Y}$ drop by

$$
\begin{align*}
\left|\Delta V_{X, Y}\right| & =\Delta V_{i n, C M} \frac{R_{D} / 2}{R_{S S}+1 /\left(2 g_{m}\right)}  \tag{4.40}\\
& =50 \mathrm{mV} \times 1.94  \tag{4.41}\\
& =96.8 \mathrm{mV} \tag{4.42}
\end{align*}
$$

Now, $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ are only 143 mV away from the triode region because the input CM level has increased by 50 mV and the output CM level has decreased by 96.8 mV .

The foregoing discussion indicates that the finite output impedance of the tail current source results in some common-mode gain in a symmetric differential pair. Nonetheless, this is usually a minor concern. More troublesome is the variation of the differential output as a result of a change in $V_{i n, C M}$, an effect that occurs because in reality the circuit is not fully symmetric, i.e., the two sides suffer from slight mismatches during manufacturing. For example, in Fig. 4.29(a), $R_{D 1}$ may not be exactly equal to $R_{D 2}$.

We now study the effect of input common-mode variations if the circuit is asymmetric and the tail current source suffers from a finite output impedance. Suppose, as shown in Fig. 4.31, $R_{D 1}=R_{D}$ and $R_{D 2}=R_{D}+\Delta R_{D}$, where $\Delta R_{D}$ denotes a small mismatch and the circuit is otherwise symmetric. Assume that $\lambda=\gamma=0$ for $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$. What happens to $V_{X}$ and $V_{Y}$ as $V_{i n, C M}$ increases? We recognize that $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ operate as one source follower,

#### Nanometer Design Notes

As a result of the low output impedance of tail current sources in nanometer technologies, a CM level change can "propagate." Plotted below are the output CM levels of two cascaded differential pairs as the main input CM level, $V_{i n, C M}$, increases, revealing a drop in the first and a rise in the second.

raising $V_{P}$ by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V_{P}=\frac{R_{S S}}{R_{S S}+\frac{1}{2 g_{m}}} \Delta V_{i n, C M} \tag{4.43}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ are identical, $I_{D 1}$ and $I_{D 2}$ increase by $\left[g_{m} /\left(1+2 g_{m} R_{S S}\right)\right] \Delta V_{i n, C M}$, but $V_{X}$ and $V_{Y}$ change by different amounts:

$$
\begin{align*}
\Delta V_{X} & =-\Delta V_{i n, C M} \frac{g_{m}}{1+2 g_{m} R_{S S}} R_{D}  \tag{4.44}\\
\Delta V_{Y} & =-\Delta V_{i n, C M} \frac{g_{m}}{1+2 g_{m} R_{S S}}\left(R_{D}+\Delta R_{D}\right) \tag{4.45}
\end{align*}
$$

Thus, a common-mode change at the input introduces a differential component at the output. We say that the circuit exhibits common-mode to differential conversion. This is a critical problem because if the input of a differential pair includes both a differential signal and common-mode noise, the circuit corrupts the amplified differential signal by the input CM change. The effect is illustrated in Fig. 4.32.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-120.jpg?height=460&width=895&top_left_y=1568&top_left_x=587)

Figure 4.32 Effect of CM noise in the presence of resistor mismatch.

In summary, the common-mode response of differential pairs depends on the output impedance of the tail current source and asymmetries in the circuit, manifesting itself through two effects: variation of the output CM level (in the absence of mismatches) and conversion of input common-mode variations to differential components at the output. In analog circuits, the latter effect is much more severe than the
former. For this reason, the common-mode response should usually be studied with mismatches taken into account.

How significant is common-mode to differential conversion? We make two observations. First, as the frequency of the CM disturbance increases, the total capacitance shunting the tail current source introduces larger tail current variations. Thus, even if the output resistance of the current source is high, common-mode to differential conversion becomes significant at high frequencies. Shown in Fig. 4.33, this capacitance arises from the parasitics of the current source itself as well as the source-bulk junctions of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$. Second, the asymmetry in the circuit stems from both the load resistors and the input transistors, the latter contributing a typically much greater mismatch.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-121.jpg?height=446&width=606&top_left_y=658&top_left_x=404)

Figure 4.33 CM response with finite tail capacitance.

Let us study the asymmetry resulting from mismatches between $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ in Fig. 4.34(a). Owing to dimension and threshold voltage mismatches, the two transistors carry slightly different currents and exhibit unequal transconductances. We assume that $\lambda=\gamma=0$. To calculate the small-signal gain from $V_{i n, C M}$ to $X$ and $Y$, we use the equivalent circuit in Fig. 4.34(b), writing $I_{D 1}=g_{m 1}\left(V_{i n, C M}-V_{P}\right)$ and $I_{D 2}=g_{m 2}\left(V_{i n, C M}-V_{P}\right)$. Since $\left(I_{D 1}+I_{D 2}\right) R_{S S}=V_{P}$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left(g_{m 1}+g_{m 2}\right)\left(V_{i n, C M}-V_{P}\right) R_{S S}=V_{P} \tag{4.46}
\end{equation*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{P}=\frac{\left(g_{m 1}+g_{m 2}\right) R_{S S}}{\left(g_{m 1}+g_{m 2}\right) R_{S S}+1} V_{i n, C M} \tag{4.47}
\end{equation*}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-121.jpg?height=518&width=1156&top_left_y=1721&top_left_x=385)

Figure 4.34 (a) Differential pair sensing CM input; (b) equivalent circuit of (a).

We now obtain the output voltages as

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{X} & =-g_{m 1}\left(V_{i n, C M}-V_{P}\right) R_{D}  \tag{4.48}\\
& =\frac{-g_{m 1}}{\left(g_{m 1}+g_{m 2}\right) R_{S S}+1} R_{D} V_{i n, C M} \tag{4.49}
\end{align*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{Y} & =-g_{m 2}\left(V_{i n, C M}-V_{P}\right) R_{D}  \tag{4.50}\\
& =\frac{-g_{m 2}}{\left(g_{m 1}+g_{m 2}\right) R_{S S}+1} R_{D} V_{i n, C M} \tag{4.51}
\end{align*}
$$

The differential component at the output is therefore given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{X}-V_{Y}=-\frac{g_{m 1}-g_{m 2}}{\left(g_{m 1}+g_{m 2}\right) R_{S S}+1} R_{D} V_{i n, C M} \tag{4.52}
\end{equation*}
$$

In other words, the circuit converts input CM variations to a differential error by a factor equal to

$$
\begin{equation*}
A_{C M-D M}=-\frac{\Delta g_{m} R_{D}}{\left(g_{m 1}+g_{m 2}\right) R_{S S}+1} \tag{4.53}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $A_{C M-D M}$ denotes common-mode to differential-mode conversion and $\Delta g_{m}=g_{m 1}-g_{m 2}$.

#### Example 4.10

Two differential pairs are cascaded as shown in Fig. 4.35. Transistors $M_{3}$ and $M_{4}$ suffer from a $g_{m}$ mismatch of $\Delta g_{m}$, the total parasitic capacitance at node $P$ is represented by $C_{P}$, and the circuit is otherwise symmetric. What fraction of the supply noise appears as a differential component at the output? Assume that $\lambda=\gamma=0$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-122.jpg?height=490&width=907&top_left_y=1358&top_left_x=553)

Figure 4.35

#### Solution

Neglecting the capacitance at nodes $A$ and $B$, we note that the supply noise appears at these nodes with no attenuation. Substituting $1 /\left(C_{P} s\right)$ for $R_{S S}$ in (4.53) and taking the magnitude, we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|A_{C M-D M}\right|=\frac{\Delta g_{m} R_{D}}{\sqrt{1+\left(g_{m 3}+g_{m 4}\right)^{2}\left|\frac{1}{C_{P} \omega}\right|^{2}}} \tag{4.54}
\end{equation*}
$$

The key point is that the effect becomes more noticeable as the supply noise frequency, $\omega$, increases.

For a meaningful comparison of differential circuits, the undesirable differential component produced by CM variations must be normalized to the wanted differential output resulting from amplification. We define the "common-mode rejection ratio" (CMRR) as the desired gain divided by the undesired gain:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{CMRR}=\left|\frac{A_{D M}}{A_{C M-D M}}\right| \tag{4.55}
\end{equation*}
$$

If only $g_{m}$ mismatch is considered, the reader can show from the analysis of Fig. 4.17 that

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|A_{D M}\right|=\frac{R_{D}}{2} \frac{g_{m 1}+g_{m 2}+4 g_{m 1} g_{m 2} R_{S S}}{1+\left(g_{m 1}+g_{m 2}\right) R_{S S}} \tag{4.56}
\end{equation*}
$$

and hence

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{CMRR} & =\frac{g_{m 1}+g_{m 2}+4 g_{m 1} g_{m 2} R_{S S}}{2 \Delta g_{m}}  \tag{4.57}\\
& \approx \frac{g_{m}}{\Delta g_{m}}\left(1+2 g_{m} R_{S S}\right) \tag{4.58}
\end{align*}
$$

where $g_{m}$ denotes the mean value, that is, $g_{m}=\left(g_{m 1}+g_{m 2}\right) / 2$. In practice, all mismatches must be taken into account. Note that $2 g_{m} R_{S S} \gg 1$, and hence $\mathrm{CMRR} \approx 2 g_{m}^{2} R_{S S} / \Delta g_{m}$.

#### Example 4.11

Our studies suggest that an ideal tail current source guarantees infinite CM rejection. Is this always true?

#### Solution

Interestingly, it is not. If the two transistors exhibit body-effect mismatch, then the circuit still converts an input CM change to a differential output component even if the tail impedance is infinite. As illustrated in Fig. 4.36, a change in $V_{i n, C M}$ produces a change in $V_{P}$, and hence in $V_{B S}$ of both transistors. If $g_{m b 1} \neq g_{m b 2}$, the change in $I_{D 1}\left(=g_{m b 1} V_{B S 1}\right)$ is not equal to that in $I_{D 2}$, yielding a differential change at the output.

## 4.4 - Differential Pair with MOS Loads

The load of a differential pair need not be implemented by linear resistors. As with the commonsource stages studied in Chapter 3, differential pairs can employ diode-connected or current-source loads (Fig. 4.37). The small-signal differential gain can be derived using the half-circuit concept. For Fig. 4.37(a),

$$
\begin{align*}
A_{v} & =-g_{m N}\left(g_{m P}^{-1}\left\|r_{O N}\right\| r_{O P}\right)  \tag{4.59}\\
& \approx-\frac{g_{m N}}{g_{m P}} \tag{4.60}
\end{align*}
$$

Figure 4.37 Differential pair with (a) diode-connected and (b) current-source loads.
where the subscripts $N$ and $P$ denote NMOS and PMOS, respectively. Expressing $g_{m N}$ and $g_{m P}$ in terms of device dimensions, we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
A_{v} \approx-\sqrt{\frac{\mu_{n}(W / L)_{N}}{\mu_{p}(W / L)_{P}}} \tag{4.61}
\end{equation*}
$$

For Fig. 4.37(b), we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
A_{v}=-g_{m N}\left(r_{O N} \| r_{O P}\right) \tag{4.62}
\end{equation*}
$$

#### Example 4.12

It is possible to obviate the need for $V_{b}$ in the circuit of Fig. 4.37(b) as shown in Fig. 4.38(a), where $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}\left(=R_{1}\right)$ are relatively large. In the absence of signals, $V_{X}=V_{Y}=V_{N}=V_{D D}-\left|V_{G S 3,4}\right|$. That is, $M_{3}$ and $M_{4}$ are "self-biased." Determine the differential voltage gain of this topology.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-124.jpg?height=572&width=790&top_left_y=1353&top_left_x=642)

Figure 4.38

#### Solution

For differential outputs, $V_{N}$ does not change (why?) and can be considered ac ground. Shown in Fig. 4.38(b), the half-circuit yields

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|A_{v}\right|=g_{m 1}\left(r_{O 1}\left\|R_{1}\right\| r_{O 3}\right) \tag{4.63}
\end{equation*}
$$

If the resistors are much greater than $r_{O 1} \| r_{O 3}$, then they negligibly reduce the gain.

In the circuit of Fig. 4.37(a), the diode-connected loads consume voltage headroom, thus creating a trade-off between the output voltage swings, the voltage gain, and the input CM range. Recall from Eq. (3.37) that, for given bias current and input device dimensions, the circuit's gain and the PMOS overdrive voltage scale together. To achieve a higher gain, $(W / L)_{P}$ must decrease, thereby increasing $\left|V_{G S P}-V_{T H P}\right|$ and lowering the CM level at nodes $X$ and $Y$.

In order to alleviate the above difficulty, part of the bias currents of the input transistors can be provided by PMOS current sources. Illustrated in Fig. 4.39(a), the idea is to lower the $g_{m}$ of the load devices by reducing their current rather than their aspect ratio. For example, if the "auxiliary" current sources, $M_{5}$ and $M_{6}$, carry $80 \%$ of the drain current of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$, the current through $M_{3}$ and $M_{4}$ is reduced by a factor of five. For a given $\left|V_{G S P}-V_{T H P}\right|$, this translates to a fivefold reduction in the transconductance of $M_{3}$ and $M_{4}$ because the aspect ratio of the devices can be lowered by the same factor. Thus, the differential gain is now five times that of the case with no PMOS current sources (if $\lambda=0$ ).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-125.jpg?height=444&width=654&top_left_y=772&top_left_x=288)

(b)

Figure 4.39 Addition of current sources to increase the voltage gain with (a) diode-connected loads and (b) resistive loads.

Since the voltage headroom consumed by diode-connected devices cannot be less than $V_{T H}$ (if subthreshold conduction is neglected), the topology of Fig. 4.39(a) allows limited output voltage swings. We therefore prefer the alternative shown in Fig. 4.39(b), where the loads are realized by resistors-and the maximum voltage at each output node is equal to $V_{D D}-\left|V_{G S 3,4}-V_{T H 3,4}\right|$ rather than $V_{D D}-\left|V_{T H 3,4}\right|$. For a given output CM level and $80 \%$ auxiliary currents, $R_{D}$ can be five times as large, yielding a voltage gain of

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|A_{v}\right|=g_{m N}\left(R_{D}\left\|r_{O N}\right\| r_{O P}\right) \tag{4.64}
\end{equation*}
$$

If the PMOS devices are long (and, necessarily, wide), then $r_{O P} \gg r_{O N}$ and the gain is limited by $R_{D} \| r_{O N}$. The circuit of Fig. 4.39(b) approaches that in Fig. 4.37(b) if $R_{D} \rightarrow \infty$, with the PMOS current sources providing all of the bias currents of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$.

The small-signal gain of the differential pair with current-source loads is relatively low-in the range of 5 to 10 in nanometer technologies. How do we increase the voltage gain? Borrowing ideas from the amplifiers in Chapter 3, we increase the output impedance of both the PMOS and the NMOS devices by cascoding, in essence creating a differential version of the cascode stage introduced in Chapter 3. The result is depicted in Fig. 4.40(a). To calculate the gain, we construct the half circuit of Fig. 4.40(b), which is similar to the cascode stage of Fig. 3.70. It follows that

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|A_{v}\right| \approx g_{m 1}\left[\left(g_{m 3} r_{O 3} r_{O 1}\right) \|\left(g_{m 5} r_{O 5} r_{O 7}\right)\right] \tag{4.65}
\end{equation*}
$$

Cascoding therefore increases the differential gain substantially, but at the cost of consuming more voltage headroom. We return to this circuit in Chapter 9.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_28_134d5d788a0919ac264dg-126.jpg?height=680&width=954&top_left_y=234&top_left_x=558)

Figure 4.40 (a) Cascode differential pair; (b) half circuit of (a).

As a final note, we should mention that high-gain fully differential amplifiers require a means of defining the output common-mode level. For example, in Fig. 4.37(b), the output common-mode level is not well-defined, whereas in Fig. 4.37(a), diode-connected transistors define the output CM level as $V_{D D}-V_{G S P}$. We revisit this issue in Chapter 9.

## 4.5 ■ Gilbert Cell

Our study of differential pairs reveals two important aspects of their operation: (1) the small-signal gain of the circuit is a function of the tail current, and (2) the two transistors in a differential pair provide a simple means of steering the tail current to one of two destinations. By combining these two properties, we can develop a versatile building block.

Suppose we wish to construct a differential pair whose gain is varied by a control voltage. This can be accomplished as depicted in Fig. 4.41(a), where the control voltage defines the tail current and hence the gain. In this topology, $A_{v}=V_{\text {out }} / V_{\text {in }}$ varies from zero (if $I_{D 3}=0$ ) to a maximum value given by voltage headroom limitations and device dimensions. This circuit is a simple example of a "variable-gain amplifier" (VGA). VGAs find application in systems where the signal amplitude may experience large variations and hence requires inverse changes in the gain.

Now suppose we seek an amplifier whose gain can be continuously varied from a negative value to a positive value. Consider two differential pairs that amplify the input by opposite gains [Fig. 4.41(b)]. We now have $V_{\text {out } 1} / V_{\text {in }}=-g_{m} R_{D}$ and $V_{\text {out } 2} / V_{\text {in }}=+g_{m} R_{D}$, where $g_{m}$ denotes the transconductance of each transistor in equilibrium. If $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ vary in opposite directions, so do $\left|V_{\text {out } 1} / V_{\text {in }}\right|$ and $\left|V_{\text {out } 2} / V_{\text {in }}\right|$.

But how should $V_{\text {out } 1}$ and $V_{\text {out } 2}$ be combined into a single output? As illustrated in Fig. 4.42(a), the two voltages can be summed, producing $V_{\text {out }}=V_{\text {out } 1}+V_{\text {out } 2}=A_{1} V_{\text {in }}+A_{2} V_{\text {in }}$, where $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ are controlled by $V_{\text {cont } 1}$ and $V_{\text {cont } 2}$, respectively. The actual implementation is in fact quite simple: since $V_{\text {out } 1}=$ $R_{D} I_{D 1}-R_{D} I_{D 2}$ and $V_{\text {out } 2}=R_{D} I_{D 4}-R_{D} I_{D 3}$, we have $V_{\text {out } 1}+V_{\text {out } 2}=R_{D}\left(I_{D 1}+I_{D 4}\right)-R_{D}\left(I_{D 2}+I_{D 3}\right)$. Thus, rather than add $V_{\text {out } 1}$ and $V_{\text {out } 2}$, we simply short the corresponding drain terminals to sum the currents and subsequently generate the output voltage [Fig. 4.42(b)]. Note that if $I_{1}=0$, then $V_{\text {out }}=+g_{m} R_{D}$, and if $I_{2}=0$, then $V_{\text {out }}=-g_{m} R_{D}$. For $I_{1}=I_{2}$, the gain drops to zero.

In the circuit of Fig. 4.42(b), $V_{\text {cont } 1}$ and $V_{\text {cont } 2}$ must change $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ in opposite directions such that the gain of the amplifier changes monotonically. What circuit can vary two currents in opposite directions? A differential pair provides such a characteristic, leading to the topology of Fig. 4.42(c). Note that for a large $\left|V_{\text {cont } 1}-V_{\text {cont } 2}\right|$, all of the tail current is steered to one of the top differential pairs and the gain from $V_{\text {in }}$ to $V_{\text {out }}$ is at its most positive or most negative value. If $V_{\text {cont } 1}=V_{\text {cont } 2}$, the gain is zero. For simplicity, we redraw the circuit as shown in Fig. 4.42(d). Called the "Gilbert cell" [2], this topology is widely used in many analog and communication systems. In a typical design, $M_{1}-M_{4}$ are identical, and so are $M_{5}$ and $M_{6}$.

#### Example 4.13

Explain why the Gilbert cell can operate as an analog voltage multiplier.

#### Solution

Since the gain of the circuit is a function of $V_{\text {cont }}=V_{\text {cont } 1}-V_{\text {cont } 2}$, we have $V_{\text {out }}=V_{\text {in }} \cdot f\left(V_{\text {cont }}\right)$. Expanding $f\left(V_{\text {cont }}\right)$ in a Taylor series and retaining only the first-order term, $\alpha V_{\text {cont }}$, we have $V_{\text {out }}=\alpha V_{\text {in }} V_{\text {cont }}$. Thus, the circuit can multiply voltages. This property accompanies any voltage-controlled variable-gain amplifier.

As with a cascode structure, the Gilbert cell consumes a greater voltage headroom than a simple differential pair does. This is because the two differential pairs $M_{1}-M_{2}$ and $M_{3}-M_{4}$ are "stacked" on top of the control differential pair. To understand this point, suppose the differential input, $V_{i n}$, in Fig. 4.42(d) has a common-mode level $V_{C M, i n}$. Then, $V_{A}=V_{B}=V_{C M, i n}-V_{G S 1}$, where $M_{1}-M_{4}$ are assumed identical. For $M_{5}$ and $M_{6}$ to operate in saturation, the CM level of $V_{c o n t}, V_{C M, c o n t}$, must be such that $V_{C M, \text { cont }} \leq V_{C M, \text { in }}-V_{G S 1}+V_{T H 5,6}$. Since $V_{G S 1}-V_{T H 5,6}$ is roughly equal to one overdrive voltage, we conclude that the control CM level must be lower than the input CM level by at least this value.

In arriving at the Gilbert cell topology, we opted to vary the gain of each differential pair through its tail current, thereby applying the control voltage to the bottom pair and the input signal to the top pairs. Interestingly, the order can be exchanged while still obtaining a VGA. Illustrated in Fig. 4.43(a), the idea is to convert the input voltage to current by means of $M_{5}$ and $M_{6}$ and route the current through $M_{1}-M_{4}$ to the output nodes. If, as shown in Fig. 4.43(b), $V_{\text {cont }}$ is very positive, then only $M_{1}$ and $M_{3}$ are on and $V_{\text {out }}=g_{m 5,6} R_{D} V_{\text {in }}$. Similarly, if $V_{\text {cont }}$ is very negative [Fig. 4.43(c)], then only $M_{2}$ and $M_{4}$ are on and $V_{\text {out }}=-g_{m 5,6} R_{D} V_{\text {in }}$. For a zero differential control voltage, $V_{\text {out }}=0$. The input differential pair may incorporate degeneration to provide a linear voltage-to-current conversion.
