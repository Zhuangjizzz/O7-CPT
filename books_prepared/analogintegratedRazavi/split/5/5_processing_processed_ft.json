The overdrive voltage is sensitive to the supply voltage (V_DD) and the threshold voltage (V_TH), which can vary significantly between wafers. Additionally, both the mobility of electrons (μ_n) and the threshold voltage (V_TH) exhibit temperature dependence, leading to poorly defined output current (I_out). The stability issue is exacerbated when the device is biased with a smaller overdrive voltage to conserve headroom and support larger voltage swings at the drain."

As shown in the equivalent circuit, the voltage change at P can be obtained by considering M1 and M2 as a single transistor (in a source follower configuration) with a transconductance equal to $g_{m1} + g_{m2}$, i.e., $\\Delta V_{P} = \\Delta V_{in, CM} \\frac{R_{SS}}{R_{SS} + \\frac{1}{g_{m1} + g_{m2}}}$ where body effect is neglected. The changes in the drain currents of M1 and M2 are therefore given by $\\Delta I_{D1} = g_{m1} \\left( \\Delta V_{in, CM} - \\Delta V_{P} \\right) = \\frac{\\Delta V_{in, CM}}{R_{SS} + \\frac{1}{g_{m1} + g_{m2}}} \\frac{g_{m1}}{g_{m1} + g_{m2}}$ and $\\Delta I_{D2} = g_{m2} \\left( \\Delta V_{in, CM} - \\Delta V_{P} \\right) = \\frac{\\Delta V_{in, CM}}{R_{SS} + \\frac{1}{g_{m1} + g_{m2}}} \\frac{g_{m2}}{g_{m1} + g_{m2}}$. The change $\\Delta I_{D1}$ multiplied by $\\left( 1 / g_{m3} \\right) \\| r_{O3}$ yields $\\left| \\Delta I_{D4} \\right| = g_{m4} \\left[ \\left( 1 / g_{m3} \\right) \\| r_{O3} \\right] \\Delta I_{D1}$. The difference between this current and $\\Delta I_{D2}$ flows through the output impedance of the circuit, which is equal to $r_{O4}$ because we have neglected the effect of $r_{O1}$ and $r_{O2}$: $\\Delta V_{\\text{out}} = \\left[ \\frac{g_{m1} \\Delta V_{\\text{in,CM}}}{1 + \\left( g_{m1} + g_{m2} \\right) R_{SS}} \\frac{r_{O3}}{r_{O3} + \\frac{1}{g_{m3}}} - \\frac{g_{m2} \\Delta V_{in, CM}}{1 + \\left( g_{m1} + g_{m2} \\right) R_{SS}} \\right] r_{O4} = \\frac{\\Delta V_{in, CM}}{1 + \\left( g_{m1} + g_{m2} \\right) R_{SS}} \\frac{\\left( g_{m1} - g_{m2} \\right) r_{O3} - g_{m2} / g_{m3}}{r_{O3} + \\frac{1}{g_{m3}}} r_{O4}$. If $r_{O3} \\gg 1 / g_{m3}$, we have $\\frac{\\Delta V_{\\text{out}}}{\\Delta V_{\\text{in, CM}}} \\approx \\frac{\\left( g_{m1} - g_{m2} \\right) r_{O3} - g_{m2} / g_{m3}}{1 + \\left( g_{m1} + g_{m2} \\right) R_{SS}}$."

            "value": "Certainly. The resistor Rss plays a crucial role in determining the voltage change at node P, which in turn affects the drain currents $I_{D1}$ and $I_{D2}$. By providing a common source configuration, Rss sets the reference point for the source of M1 and M2. The voltage change at node P, $\\Delta V_{P}$, is influenced by Rss and the combined transconductance of M1 and M2. This voltage change affects the difference in drain currents, which ultimately impacts the output voltage $V_{\\text{out}}$. The presence of Rss ensures that the voltage change is distributed in a way that depends on the transconductances $g_{m1}$ and $g_{m2}$, leading to the observed dependency on $V_{in, CM}$."
