From Fig. 6.48(b), $V_{GS} = V_1 R_S C_F s / (R_S C_F s + 1)$, and the current through $C_F$ is $V_1 / [(C_F s)^{-1} + R_S]$. Using KCL at the drain node, $Z_{\\text{in},0}$ is derived as $Z_{\\text{in},0} = \\frac{R_D (R_S C_F s + 1)}{[R_S (1 + g_m R_D) + R_D] C_F s + 1}$. This shows that $C_B$ affects the input impedance by altering the frequency-dependent behavior of the circuit, leading to a more complex impedance expression."
