    "text": "Remember that a MOS device possesses four capacitances: $C_{G S}, C_{G D}, C_{D B}$, and $C_{S B}$. Consequently, the transfer function of CMOS circuits can quickly become intricate, necessitating approximations to simplify the circuitry. In this section, we present two such simplifying approximations: Miller's theorem and the association of poles with nodes. We remind readers that a two-terminal impedance, $Z$, is defined as $Z=V / I$, where $V$ and $I$ represent the voltage across and the current through the device, respectively. For instance, for a capacitor, $Z=1 /(C s)$. Additionally, the transfer function of a circuit provides the frequency response when $s$ is replaced by $j \\omega$, assuming a sinusoidal input like $A \\cos \\omega t$. For example, $H(j \\omega)=(R C j \\omega+1)^{-1}$ illustrates the magnitude and phase of a basic low-pass filter.\n\nIn this chapter, our primary focus is on the magnitude of the transfer function (with $s=$ $j \\omega$). Figure 6.1 illustrates various examples of magnitude responses. It is also worth noting that, even when calculated precisely, some transfer functions may not offer substantial insights. Therefore, we examine numerous special cases by considering extreme conditions, such as when the load capacitance is either very small or very large.\n\nSeveral fundamental concepts are frequently employed throughout this chapter and warrant a brief review. (1) The magnitude of a complex number $a+j b$ is $\\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}$. (2) Zeros and poles are defined as the roots of the numerator and denominator of the transfer function, respectively.

The scale is logarithmic, common for Bode plots.\n- The horizontal axis represents angular frequency, \\(\\omega\\), typically measured in radians per second, also on a logarithmic scale.\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- The graph displays a peak in magnitude at a specific frequency, indicating the passband of the filter. This is characteristic of a band-pass filter, which allows frequencies within a certain range to pass while attenuating frequencies outside this range.\n- The magnitude increases as the frequency approaches the center of the passband, reaches a peak, and then decreases as the frequency moves away from the passband.\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The peak of the graph represents the center frequency of the band-pass filter, where the gain is highest.\n- The bandwidth of the filter is defined by the range of frequencies over which the magnitude is significantly above the baseline.\n- There are two critical points where the slope changes: one where the magnitude starts increasing towards the peak and another where it starts decreasing after the peak.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- Specific numerical values are not provided in this graph, but key points would include the center frequency and the -3 dB points defining the bandwidth.\n- No additional annotations or reference lines are present in the graph.\nimage_name:(c)\ndescription:The graph labeled (c) is a frequency-response curve representing a high-pass filter.

    "text": "The phenomenon associated with the \"Miller effect,\" initially described by Miller, plays a significant role in the operation of both analog and digital circuits. As outlined in Miller's Theorem, a transformation can occur between two types of circuits depicted in figures 6.2(a) and 6.2(b). This transformation is quantified by the equations $Z_{1} = \\frac{Z}{1-A_{v}}$ and $Z_{2} = \\frac{Z}{1-A_{v}^{-1}}$, where $A_{v}$ represents the voltage gain, expressed as the ratio of $V_{Y}$ to $V_{X}$.\n\nFigures 6.2(a) and 6.2(b) depict circuits that apply Miller's theorem. Figure 6.2(a) features a resistor Z with nodes X and Y, illustrating the initial application of the theorem to a floating impedance. In contrast, figure 6.2(b) shows the equivalent circuit after applying the Miller effect, where the impedance Z is split into grounded impedances Z1 and Z2 at nodes X and Y, respectively.\n\nThe proof of this theorem hinges on the principle that the current flowing through the resistor Z from node X to node Y must remain consistent when transitioning between the two circuits. This ensures that $\\frac{V_{X}-V_{Y}}{Z} = \\frac{V_{X}}{Z_{1}}$, which simplifies to $Z_{1} = \\frac{Z}{1-\\frac{V_{Y}}{V_{X}}}$ and $Z_{2} = \\frac{Z}{1-\\frac{V_{X}}{V_{Y}}}$, demonstrating the conversion of a floating impedance Z into two grounded impedances, a concept that is invaluable for circuit analysis and design.\n\nExamples 6.1 through 6.4 delve into practical applications and issues related to the Miller effect. They illustrate how the input capacitance can be effectively multiplied by a factor of $(1+A)$ due to feedback mechanisms and how the theorem can be incorrectly applied or approximated. These examples also highlight the importance of considering the frequency of interest and the potential inaccuracies that can arise when using the low-frequency value of the voltage gain ratio $V_{Y} / V_{X}$, which is often referred to as \"Miller's approximation.\"\n\nIn conclusion, while Miller's theorem and its approximation are powerful tools in circuit analysis, they come with inherent limitations. These include the potential elimination of zeros, the prediction of additional poles, and the inability to accurately calculate the output impedance. Nonetheless, these techniques continue to provide valuable insights into circuit behavior, especially when dealing with impedances in parallel with the main signal path."

    "text": "An essential occurrence in numerous analog and digital circuits is associated with the \"Miller effect,\" as outlined by John Milller in his theorem. According to Miller's theorem, if the circuit depicted in Fig. 6.2(a) can be transformed into the configuration shown in Fig. 6.2(b), then the impedance values are given by $Z_{1}=$ $Z /\\left(1-A_{v}\\right)$ and $Z_{2}=Z /\\left(1-A_{v}^{-1}\\right)$, where $A_{v}=V_{Y} / V_{X}$.\n\nThe diagram in Fig. 6.2(a) illustrates the application of Miller's theorem, depicting a floating impedance Z connected between nodes X and Y. In contrast, the circuit shown in Fig. 6.2(b) demonstrates the Miller effect by splitting the impedance Z into two grounded impedances, Z1 and Z2, located at nodes X and Y, respectively.\n\nThe proof for this theorem states that the current flowing through Z from X to Y is equal to $\\left(V_{X}-V_{Y}\\right) / Z$. For the two circuits to be equivalent, the same current must flow through Z1. This leads to the equation:\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{X}-V_{Y}}{Z}=\\frac{V_{X}}{Z_{1}}\n$$\n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\n$$\nZ_{1}=\\frac{Z}{1-\\frac{V_{Y}}{V_{X}}}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, we obtain:\n\n$$\nZ_{2}=\\frac{Z}{1-\\frac{V_{X}}{V_{Y}}}\n$$\n\nThis decomposition of a \"floating\" impedance, Z, into two \"grounded\" impedances is valuable for analysis and design purposes.\n\n#### Example 6.1\n\nConsider the circuit depicted in Fig. 6.3(a), where the voltage amplifier has a negative gain of -A and is considered ideal. The task is to calculate the input capacitance of this circuit.\n\nThe circuit in Fig. 6.3(a) is an inverting amplifier configuration that includes a feedback capacitor CF, which introduces the Miller multiplication effect on the input capacitance. Due to the feedback mechanism, the input capacitance is effectively multiplied by a factor of (1+A).\n\nThe circuit in Fig. 6.3(b) represents a feedback configuration utilizing resistors Z1 and Z2 connected to an operational amplifier with a negative gain of -A. Nodes X and Y are connected to the resistors and the amplifier, respectively.\n\nThe circuit in Fig. 6.3(c) is a negative feedback amplifier with a voltage source ΔV applied at the input. The feedback capacitor CF and the input capacitor Cin form a capacitive divider. The op-amp has a negative gain of -A, and the output is -A times the input voltage ΔV. This setup demonstrates the Miller effect in capacitors.\n\n#### Solution\n\nBy applying Miller's theorem to convert the circuit to that shown in Fig. 6.3(b), we obtain $Z=1 /\\left(C_{F} s\\right)$ and $Z_{1}=$ $\\left[1 /\\left(C_{F} s\\right)\\right] /(1+A)$. Therefore, the input capacitance is equal to $C_{F}(1+A)$. This effect is known as \"Miller multiplication\" of the capacitor.\n\nThe reason for multiplying CF by (1+A) can be explained by considering the circuit in Fig. 6.3(c). By applying a voltage step at the input and calculating the charge supplied by the voltage source, we find that a step equal to $\\Delta V$ at X results in a change of $-A \\Delta V$ at Y, yielding a total change of $(1+A) \\Delta V$ in the voltage across CF. Thus, the charge drawn by CF from $V_{i n}$ is equal to $(1+A) C_{F} \\Delta V$, and the equivalent input capacitance is $(1+A) C_{F}$.\n\n#### Example 6.2\n\nA student needs a large capacitor for a filter and decides to utilize the Miller multiplication effect as shown in Fig. 6.4(a). However, there are some issues with this approach.\n\nThe circuit in Fig. 6.4(a) utilizes the Miller effect to multiply the capacitance CF by (A+1). The voltage at node X affects the voltage at node Y through the op-amp, creating a large effective capacitance between Vin and Vout.\n\nThe circuit in Fig. 6.4(b) utilizes an NMOS transistor M1 to manage the feedback path. The output voltage swing at Y is AV0, which is A times the input swing V0 at X. The design aims to leverage Miller multiplication for effective capacitance increase.\n\n#### Solution\n\nThe issues relate to the amplifier's output swing. As exemplified by the implementation in Fig. 6.4(b), if the voltage at X swings by $V_{0}$, then Y must accommodate a swing of $A V_{0}$ without saturating the amplifier. In addition, the dc level in $V_{i n}$ must be compatible with the input of the amplifier.\n\nIt is crucial to understand that (6.2) and (6.3) hold if we know beforehand that the circuit of Fig. 6.2(a) can be converted to that of Fig. 6.2(b). Miller's theorem does not specify the conditions under which this conversion is valid. If the impedance Z forms the only signal path between X and Y, then the conversion is often invalid. An example is shown in Fig. 6.5, where the theorem provides a correct input impedance but an incorrect gain for a simple resistive divider. Nevertheless, Miller's theorem is useful in cases where the impedance Z appears in parallel with the main signal, as shown in Fig. 6.6.\n\n#### Example 6.3\n\nCalculate the input resistance of the circuit shown in Fig. 6.7(a).\n\nThe circuit in Fig. 6.7(a) represents a typical application of Miller's theorem. It includes an NMOS transistor M1 with its source connected to node X, drain to node Y, and gate to the bias voltage Vb. A current source I1 is connected from VDD to node Y. Resistor ro is connected between nodes Y and X, and resistor Rin is connected between node X and ground. This configuration is used to calculate the input resistance of the circuit.\n\nThe circuit in Fig. 6.7(b) is used to calculate the input resistance, applying Miller's theorem. It includes a current source I1 from VDD to node Y, an NMOS transistor M1 with its source at node X, drain at node Y, and gate at bias voltage Vb. Resistors ro/(1-1/Av) and ro/(1-Av) are connected to nodes Y and X respectively. The input resistance is a parallel combination of rO/(1-Av) and 1/(gm+gmb).\n\n#### Solution\n\nThe reader can prove that the voltage gain from X to Y is equal to $1+\\left(g_{m}+g_{m b}\\right) r_{O}$. As shown in Fig. 6.7(b), the input resistance is given by the parallel combination of $r_{O} /\\left(1-A_{v}\\right)$ and $1 /\\left(g_{m}+g_{m b}\\right)$. Since $A_{v}$ is usually greater than unity, $r_{O} /\\left(1-A_{v}\\right)$ is a negative resistance. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$\nR_{i n} =\\frac{r_{O}}{1-\\left[1+\\left(g_{m}+g_{m b}\\right) r_{O}\\right]} \\| \\frac{1}{g_{m}+g_{m b}}\n$$\n\n$$\nR_{i n} =\\frac{-1}{g_{m}+g_{m b}} \\| \\frac{1}{g_{m}+g_{m b}}\n$$\n\n$$\nR_{i n} =\\infty\n$$\n\nThis result is the same as obtained in Chapter 3 (Fig. 3.54) by direct calculation.\n\nIt is important to note that, strictly speaking, the value of $A_{v}=V_{Y} / V_{X}$ in (6.2) and (6.3) must be calculated at the frequency of interest, which can significantly complicate the algebra. To understand this point, let us return to Example 6.1 and assume an amplifier with a finite output resistance. As shown in Fig. 6.8, the equivalent circuit reveals that $V_{Y} \\neq-A V_{X}$ at high frequencies, and hence CF cannot be simply multiplied by $1+A$ to yield the input capacitance. However, in many cases, we use the low-frequency value of $V_{Y} / V_{X}$ to gain insight into the behavior of the circuit. This approach is known as \"Miller's approximation.\"\n\n#### Example 6.4\n\nDetermine the transfer function of the circuit shown in Fig. 6.9(a) using (a) direct analysis and (b) Miller's approximation.\n\nThe circuit in Fig. 6.9(a) is an amplifier with feedback capacitor CF and output resistor Rout. The amplifier has an input at node X and output at node Y, with the output voltage being -AVx. The transfer function analysis involves considering the feedback network and gain change at high frequencies.\n\nThe graph labeled (b) is a Bode plot, which is used to represent the frequency response of a system. The plot is shown on a logarithmic scale for the frequency axis (horizontal axis, denoted as \\( \\omega \\)) and a decibel scale for the magnitude of the transfer function \\( 20 \\log \\left| \\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}}(j\\omega) \\right| \\) on the vertical axis.\n\n1. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n- The horizontal axis is labeled as \\( \\omega \\), representing frequency on a logarithmic scale.\n- The vertical axis is labeled as \\( 20 \\log \\left| \\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}}(j\\omega) \\right| \\), indicating the gain in decibels (dB).\n\n2. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- The plot starts with a flat region at a gain level of \\( A \\) dB, indicating a constant gain at low frequencies.\n- As the frequency increases, the plot shows a downward slope at a rate of \\(-20 \\text{ dB/decade}\\), indicating a reduction in gain.\n- After this slope, the plot flattens out again, reaching a constant gain level at high frequencies.\n\n3. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The point \\( \\omega_p \\) marks the beginning of the slope where the gain starts to decrease.\n- The point \\( \\omega_z \\) marks where the slope ends and the gain stabilizes again.\n- The slope of \\(-20 \\text{ dB/decade}\\) suggests the presence of a single pole in the system.\n\n4. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- The plot is annotated with two significant frequencies: \\( \\omega_p \\) and \\( \\omega_z \\).\n- These points are typically associated with the pole and zero frequencies of the system, respectively.\n\nThis Bode plot effectively illustrates how the gain of the system changes with frequency, highlighting the impact of poles and zeros on the frequency response.\n\nThe circuit in Fig. 6.9(c) shows the equivalent circuit with Miller's approximation applied to CF, resulting in CF/(A+1) at the output.\n\n#### Solution\n\n(a) We note that the current flowing through $R_{S}$ is given by $\\left(V_{i n}-V_{X}\\right) / R_{S}$, yielding a voltage drop across $R_{\\text {out }}$ equal to $\\left(V_{\\text {in }}-V_{X}\\right) R_{\\text {out }} / R_{S}$. It follows that:\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{\\text {in }}-V_{X}}{R_{S}} R_{\\text {out }}-A V_{X}=V_{\\text {out }}\n$$\n\nWe also equate the currents flowing through $R_{S}$ and $C_{F}$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{\\text {in }}-V_{X}}{R_{S}}=\\left(V_{X}-V_{\\text {out }}\\right) C_{F} s\n$$\n\nThe reader can find $V_{X}$ from the first equation and substitute the result in the second, thereby obtaining:\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{\\text {out }}}{V_{\\text {in }}}(s)=\\frac{R_{\\text {out }} C_{F} s-A}{\\left[(A+1) R_{S}+R_{\\text {out }}\\right] C_{F} s+1}\n$$\n\nThe circuit thus exhibits a zero at $\\omega_{z}=A /\\left(R_{\\text {out }} C_{F}\\right)$ and a pole at $\\omega_{p}=-1 /\\left[(A+1) R_{S} C_{F}+R_{\\text {out }} C_{F}\\right]$. Figure 6.9(b) plots the response for the case of $\\left|\\omega_{p}\\right|<\\left|\\omega_{z}\\right|$.\n\n(b) Applying Miller's approximation, we decompose $C_{F}$ into $(1+A) C_{F}$ at the input and $C_{F} /\\left(1+A^{-1}\\right)$ at the output [Fig. 6.9(c)]. Since $V_{\\text {out }} / V_{\\text {in }}=\\left(V_{X} / V_{\\text {in }}\\right)\\left(V_{\\text {out }} / V_{X}\\right)$, we first write $V_{X} / V_{\\text {in }}$ by considering $R_{S}$ and $(1+A) C_{F}$ as a voltage divider:\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{X}}{V_{\\text {in }}}=\\frac{\\frac{1}{(1+A) C_{F} s}}{\\frac{1}{(1+A) C_{F} s}+R_{S}}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{X}}{V_{\\text {in }}}=\\frac{1}{(1+A) R_{S} C_{F} s+1}\n$$\n\nAs for $V_{\\text {out }} / V_{X}$, we first amplify $V_{X}$ by $-A$ and subject the result to the output voltage divider:\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{\\text {out }}}{V_{X}}=\\frac{-A}{\\frac{1}{1+A^{-1}} C_{F} R_{\\text {out }} s+1}\n$$\n\nTherefore:\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{\\text {out }}}{V_{\\text {in }}}(s)=\\frac{-A}{\\left[(1+A) R_{S} C_{F} s+1\\right]\\left(\\frac{1}{1+A^{-1}} C_{F} R_{\\text {out }} s+1\\right)}\n$$\n\nUnfortunately, Miller's approximation has eliminated the zero and predicted two poles for the circuit! Despite these shortcomings, Miller's approximation can provide intuition in many cases.\n\nIt is important to note that if Miller's theorem is used to obtain the input-output transfer function, it cannot be used simultaneously to calculate the output impedance. To derive the transfer function, we apply a voltage source to the input of the circuit, obtaining a value for $V_{Y} / V_{X}$ in Fig. 6.2(a). On the other hand, to determine the output impedance, we must apply a voltage source to the output of the circuit, obtaining a value for $V_{X} / V_{Y}$ that may not be equal to the inverse of the $V_{Y} / V_{X}$ measured in the first test. For example, the circuit of Fig. 6.7 (b) may suggest that the output impedance is equal to:\n\n$$\nR_{\\text {out }}=\\frac{r_{O}}{1-1 / A_{v}}\n$$\n\n$$\nR_{\\text {out }}=\\frac{r_{O}}{1-\\left[1+\\left(g_{m}+g_{m b}\\right) r_{O}\\right]^{-1}}\n$$\n\n$$\nR_{\\text {out }}=\\frac{1}{g_{m}+g_{m b}}+r_{O}\n$$\n\nwhereas the actual value is equal to $r_{O}$ (if X is grounded). Other subtleties of Miller's theorem are described in the Appendix C.\n\nIn summary, Miller's approximation divides a floating impedance by the low-frequency gain and faces the following limitations: (1) it may eliminate zeros, (2) it may predict additional poles, and (3) it does not correctly compute the \"output\" impedance."

According to the theorem, if the circuit depicted in Fig. 6.2(a) can be transformed into the configuration shown in Fig. 6.2(b), then the impedance values are determined by the equations $Z_{1}=$ $Z /\\left(1-A_{v}\\right)$ and $Z_{2}=Z /\\left(1-A_{v}^{-1}\\right)$, with $A_{v}$ representing the voltage gain $V_{Y} / V_{X}$.\n\nFig. 6.2(a) illustrates a floating impedance Z situated between nodes X and Y. In contrast, Fig. 6.2(b) demonstrates the Miller effect by splitting the impedance Z into two grounded impedances, Z1 and Z2, located at nodes X and Y, respectively.\n\nMiller's theorem is instrumental in simplifying the analysis and design of circuits. For instance, if we have a circuit with a voltage amplifier featuring a negative gain of -A and ideal characteristics, as depicted in Fig. 6.3(a), we can employ Miller's theorem to calculate the circuit's input capacitance.\n\nIn the context of Fig. 6.3(b), the impedance Z is transformed into Z1 and Z2, with Z1 being equal to $Z/(1+A)$. This demonstrates the \"Miller multiplication\" of the capacitor, effectively increasing the input capacitance by a factor of (1+A).\n\nHowever, the application of Miller's theorem is not without its nuances. For example, in Fig. 6.4(a), a student attempts to use the Miller effect to achieve a large capacitor value for a filter. The challenge here lies in the amplifier's output swing and the need to prevent saturation, as well as ensuring that the dc level of $V_{i n}$ is compatible with the amplifier's input.\n\nMiller's theorem is particularly useful when the impedance Z is in parallel with the main signal path, as shown in Fig. 6.6. This configuration allows for accurate gain calculation. However, if Z is the sole signal path between nodes X and Y, as in Fig. 6.5, the theorem may yield incorrect results.\n\nAnother important consideration is that the value of $A_{v}$ in the equations must be determined at the frequency of interest. At high frequencies, the gain may change, as depicted in Fig. 6.8, where the amplifier's finite output resistance affects the voltage gain.\n\nDespite these complexities, Miller's theorem remains a powerful tool in circuit analysis, providing valuable insights into the behavior of circuits, especially when used in conjunction with frequency domain analysis techniques such as Bode plots, as shown in Fig. 6.9(b)."

Fig. 6.2(b) shows the application of the Miller effect, splitting the impedance Z into two grounded impedances Z1 and Z2 at nodes X and Y, respectively.\n\nThe proof of this theorem involves demonstrating that the current flowing through Z from X to Y is equal to $\\left(V_{X}-V_{Y}\\right) / Z$. For the two circuits to be equivalent, the same current must flow through $Z_{1}$. This leads to the equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{V_{X}-V_{Y}}{Z}=\\frac{V_{X}}{Z_{1}} \\tag{6.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nZ_{1}=\\frac{Z}{1-\\frac{V_{Y}}{V_{X}}} \\tag{6.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSimilarly,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nZ_{2}=\\frac{Z}{1-\\frac{V_{X}}{V_{Y}}} \\tag{6.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis decomposition of a \"floating\" impedance, $Z$, into two \"grounded\" impedances is valuable for analysis and design purposes.\n\n#### Example 6.1\n\nConsider the circuit shown in Fig. 6.3(a), where the voltage amplifier has a negative gain equal to $-A$ and is otherwise ideal. Calculate the input capacitance of the circuit.\n\nIn Fig. 6.3(a), the circuit is an inverting amplifier configuration with a feedback capacitor CF, which introduces Miller multiplication of the input capacitance. The input capacitance is effectively multiplied by the factor (1+A) due to the feedback mechanism. Fig. 6.3(b) represents a feedback configuration using resistors Z1 and Z2 connected to an operational amplifier with negative gain -A. The nodes X and Y are connected to the resistors and the amplifier. Fig. 6.3(c) is a negative feedback amplifier with a voltage source ΔV applied at the input. The feedback capacitor CF and the input capacitor Cin form a capacitive divider. The op-amp has a negative gain of -A, and the output is -A times the input voltage ΔV. This setup demonstrates the Miller effect in capacitors.\n\nUsing Miller's theorem to convert the circuit to that shown in Fig. 6.3(b), we have $Z=1 /\\left(C_{F} s\\right)$ and $Z_{1}=$ $\\left[1 /\\left(C_{F} s\\right)\\right] /(1+A)$. That is, the input capacitance is equal to $C_{F}(1+A)$. We call this effect \"Miller multiplication\" of the capacitor.\n\n#### Example 6.2\n\nA student needs a large capacitor for a filter and decides to utilize the Miller multiplication of [Fig. 6.4(a)]. Explain the issues in this approach.\n\nIn Fig. 6.4(a), the circuit utilizes the Miller effect to multiply the capacitance CF by (A+1). The voltage at node X affects the voltage at node Y through the op-amp, creating a large effective capacitance between Vin and Vout. Fig. 6.4(b) utilizes an NMOS transistor M1 to manage the feedback path. The output voltage swing at Y is AV0, which is A times the input swing V0 at X. The design aims to leverage Miller multiplication for effective capacitance increase.\n\nThe issues relate to the amplifier, particularly to its output swing. As exemplified by the implementation in Fig. 6.4(b), if the voltage at $X$ swings by $V_{0}$, then $Y$ must accommodate a swing of $A V_{0}$ without saturating the amplifier. In addition, the dc level in $V_{i n}$ must be compatible with the input of the amplifier.\n\nIt is important to understand that (6.2) and (6.3) hold if we know a priori that the circuit of Fig. 6.2(a) can be converted to that of Fig. 6.2(b). That is, Miller's theorem does not stipulate the conditions under which this conversion is valid. If the impedance $Z$ forms the only signal path between $X$ and $Y$, then the conversion is often invalid. Illustrated in Fig. 6.5 for a simple resistive divider, the theorem gives a correct input impedance but an incorrect gain. Nevertheless, Miller's theorem proves useful in cases where the impedance $Z$ appears in parallel with the main signal (Fig. 6.6).\n\n#### Example 6.3\n\nCalculate the input resistance of the circuit shown in Fig. 6.7(a).\n\nIn Fig. 6.7(a), the circuit represents a typical application of Miller's theorem. It includes an NMOS transistor M1 with its source connected to node X, drain to node Y, and gate to the bias voltage Vb. A current source I1 is connected from VDD to node Y. Resistor ro is connected between nodes Y and X, and resistor Rin is connected between node X and ground. This configuration is used to calculate the input resistance of the circuit.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 6.7(b), the input resistance is given by the parallel combination of $r_{O} /\\left(1-A_{v}\\right)$ and $1 /\\left(g_{m}+g_{m b}\\right)$. Since $A_{v}$ is usually greater than unity, $r_{O} /\\left(1-A_{v}\\right)$ is a negative resistance. We therefore have\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nR_{i n} & =\\frac{r_{O}}{1-\\left[1+\\left(g_{m}+g_{m b}\\right) r_{O}\\right]} \\| \\frac{1}{g_{m}+g_{m b}}  \\tag{6.4}\\\\\n& =\\frac{-1}{g_{m}+g_{m b}} \\| \\frac{1}{g_{m}+g_{m b}}  \\tag{6.5}\\\\\n& =\\infty \\tag{6.6}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis is the same result as obtained in Chapter 3 (Fig. 3.54) by direct calculation.\n\nWe should also mention that, strictly speaking, the value of $A_{v}=V_{Y} / V_{X}$ in (6.2) and (6.3) must be calculated at the frequency of interest, complicating the algebra significantly. To understand this point, let us return to Example 6.1 and assume an amplifier with a finite output resistance. Depicted in Fig. 6.8, the equivalent circuit reveals that $V_{Y} \\neq-A V_{X}$ at high frequencies, and hence $C_{F}$ cannot be simply multiplied by $1+A$ to yield the input capacitance. However, in many cases we use the low-frequency value of $V_{Y} / V_{X}$ to gain insight into the behavior of the circuit. We call this approach \"Miller's approximation.\"\n\n#### Example 6.4\n\nDetermine the transfer function of the circuit shown in Fig. 6.9(a) using (a) direct analysis and (b) Miller's approximation.\n\nIn Fig. 6.9(a), the circuit is an amplifier with feedback capacitor CF and output resistor Rout. The amplifier has an input at node X and output at node Y, with the output voltage being -AVx. The transfer function analysis involves considering the feedback network and gain change at high frequencies. Fig. 6.9(b) is a Bode plot, which is used to represent the frequency response of a system. The plot is shown on a logarithmic scale for the frequency axis (horizontal axis, denoted as \\( \\omega \\)) and a decibel scale for the magnitude of the transfer function \\( 20 \\log \\left| \\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}}(j\\omega) \\right| \\) on the vertical axis.\n\n1. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n- The horizontal axis is labeled as \\( \\omega \\), representing frequency on a logarithmic scale.\n- The vertical axis is labeled as \\( 20 \\log \\left| \\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}}(j\\omega) \\right| \\), indicating the gain in decibels (dB).\n\n2. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- The plot starts with a flat region at a gain level of \\( A \\) dB, indicating a constant gain at low frequencies.\n- As the frequency increases, the plot shows a downward slope at a rate of \\(-20 \\text{ dB/decade}\\), indicating a reduction in gain.\n- After this slope, the plot flattens out again, reaching a constant gain level at high frequencies.\n\n3. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The point \\( \\omega_p \\) marks the beginning of the slope where the gain starts to decrease.\n- The point \\( \\omega_z \\) marks where the slope ends and the gain stabilizes again.\n- The slope of \\(-20 \\text{ dB/decade}\\) suggests the presence of a single pole in the system.\n\n4. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- The plot is annotated with two significant frequencies: \\( \\omega_p \\) and \\( \\omega_z \\).\n- These points are typically associated with the pole and zero frequencies of the system, respectively.\n\nThis Bode plot effectively illustrates how the gain of the system changes with frequency, highlighting the impact of poles and zeros on the frequency response. Fig. 6.9(c) shows the equivalent circuit with Miller's approximation applied to CF, resulting in CF/(A+1) at the output.\n\n(a) We note that the current flowing through $R_{S}$ is given by $\\left(V_{i n}-V_{X}\\right) / R_{S}$, yielding a voltage drop across $R_{\\text {out }}$ equal to $\\left(V_{\\text {in }}-V_{X}\\right) R_{\\text {out }} / R_{S}$.

The circuit represents a typical application of Miller's theorem. The input resistance is given by the parallel combination of $r_O / (1 - A_v)$ and $1 / (g_m + g_{mb})$. Since $A_v$ is usually greater than unity, $r_O / (1 - A_v)$ is a negative resistance. This leads to an infinite input resistance, which is the same result obtained in Chapter 3 by direct calculation.\n\nExample 6.4 involves determining the transfer function of a circuit using both direct analysis and Miller's approximation.

This theorem states that if the circuit depicted in Fig. 6.2(a) can be transformed into the configuration shown in Fig. 6.2(b), then the impedances can be expressed as \\( Z_{1}=\\frac{Z}{1-A_{v}} \\) and \\( Z_{2}=\\frac{Z}{1-A_{v}^{-1}} \\), with \\( A_{v} \\) being the voltage gain ratio \\( \\frac{V_{Y}}{V_{X}} \\).\n\nIn the circuit representation (a), we observe a resistor Z with its terminals connected between nodes X and Y. In contrast, circuit (b) demonstrates the Miller effect's application, splitting the impedance Z into two grounded resistors, Z1 and Z2, situated at nodes X and Y, respectively.\n\nFig. 6.2 illustrates the application of the Miller effect on a floating impedance. The proof involves analyzing the current flowing through Z from X to Y, which is given by \\( \\frac{V_{X}-V_{Y}}{Z} \\). For the two circuits to be equivalent, this current must also pass through Z1, leading to the equations that define Z1 and Z2.\n\nExample 6.1 delves into a circuit where a voltage amplifier with a negative gain of -A is connected to a feedback capacitor CF, effectively increasing the input capacitance. The Miller effect, in this case, multiplies the input capacitance by the factor (1+A).\n\nExample 6.2 explores a scenario where a student attempts to use the Miller effect to obtain a large capacitor value for a filter. However, this approach is problematic due to issues related to the amplifier's output swing and the need for compatibility with the amplifier's input dc level.\n\nMiller's theorem is particularly useful when the impedance Z is in parallel with the main signal path, as demonstrated in Fig. 6.6. However, it is crucial to understand the theorem's limitations and when it can be appropriately applied. An example of improper application is shown in Fig. 6.5, where the theorem provides an incorrect gain when used in a simple resistive divider.\n\nExample 6.3 calculates the input resistance of a circuit that includes an NMOS transistor and a current source. Miller's theorem is employed here to analyze the input resistance, which is found to be infinite under certain conditions.\n\nExample 6.4 determines the transfer function of a circuit with a feedback capacitor and an output resistor. Miller's approximation is used to simplify the analysis, although it comes with the caveat that it may eliminate zeros and predict additional poles that do not actually exist in the circuit.\n\nLastly, it is important to note that Miller's theorem, when used for transfer function analysis, cannot be simultaneously applied to calculate the output impedance. This limitation and other subtleties are discussed in further detail in Appendix C."

    "text": "A pivotal concept in analog and digital circuits is the \"Miller effect,\" named after the theorem proposed by Miller. According to Miller's theorem, if the circuit in Fig. 6.2(a) can be transformed into the circuit in Fig. 6.2(b), then the impedances $Z_{1}$ and $Z_{2}$ can be expressed as $Z_{1} = Z / (1 - A_{v})$ and $Z_{2} = Z / (1 - A_{v}^{-1})$, where $A_{v} = V_{Y} / V_{X}$.\n\nFig. 6.2(a) depicts a circuit with a resistor Z connected between nodes X and Y. The circuit in Fig. 6.2(b) shows the same resistor Z split into two grounded resistors, Z1 and Z2, connected to nodes X and Y, respectively.\n\nProof of this theorem involves analyzing the current flowing through the resistor Z from node X to node Y, which is equal to $(V_{X} - V_{Y}) / Z$. For the two circuits to be equivalent, the same current must flow through Z1. This leads to the equations:\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{X} - V_{Y}}{Z} = \\frac{V_{X}}{Z_{1}} \\tag{6.1}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nZ_{1} = \\frac{Z}{1 - \\frac{V_{Y}}{V_{X}}} \\tag{6.2}\n$$\n\nSimilarly,\n\n$$\nZ_{2} = \\frac{Z}{1 - \\frac{V_{X}}{V_{Y}}} \\tag{6.3}\n$$\n\nThis decomposition of a \"floating\" impedance Z into two \"grounded\" impedances is valuable in circuit analysis and design.\n\nExample 6.1 considers a circuit with a voltage amplifier having a negative gain -A and a feedback capacitor CF. The input capacitance is effectively multiplied by the factor (1+A) due to the feedback mechanism.\n\nExample 6.2 discusses the limitations of using Miller multiplication to achieve a large capacitor value in a circuit.\n\nExample 6.3 calculates the input resistance of a circuit using Miller's theorem.\n\nExample 6.4 determines the transfer function of a circuit using both direct analysis and Miller's approximation.\n\nMiller's theorem is a powerful tool in circuit analysis, but it has limitations. It may eliminate zeros, predict additional poles, and does not correctly compute the \"output\" impedance. Nevertheless, it provides valuable insights in many cases."

    "text": "The Miller effect, a concept introduced by Miller, is a critical phenomenon present in both analog and digital circuits. Miller's theorem posits that if a circuit configuration, depicted in Fig. 6.2(a), can be transformed into the configuration shown in Fig. 6.2(b), then the impedance values $Z_{1}$ and $Z_{2}$ can be expressed as $Z_{1} = Z / (1 - A_{v})$ and $Z_{2} = Z / (1 - A_{v}^{-1})$, where $A_{v} = V_{Y} / V_{X}$. These configurations represent a floating impedance Z between nodes X and Y, and its decomposition into grounded impedances Z1 and Z2, respectively.\n\nThe theorem is demonstrated by the current equality through the impedance Z, which is $(V_{X} - V_{Y}) / Z$. For the circuits to be equivalent, the same current must flow through $Z_{1}$, leading to the equations $Z_{1} = Z / (1 - V_{Y} / V_{X})$ and $Z_{2} = Z / (1 - V_{X} / V_{Y})$. This decomposition of a \"floating\" impedance Z into two \"grounded\" impedances is beneficial for both analysis and design purposes.\n\nExamples and further applications of Miller's theorem illustrate its utility in various circuit configurations, such as inverting amplifiers with feedback capacitors, where the input capacitance is effectively multiplied by the factor (1+A) due to the feedback mechanism. This effect is known as \"Miller multiplication.\"\n\nHowever, the application of Miller's theorem has its limitations. It may not be valid when the impedance Z constitutes the sole signal path between nodes X and Y. Moreover, the theorem does not inherently provide the conditions under which the conversion from the circuit of Fig. 6.2(a) to Fig. 6.2(b) is valid. In cases where the impedance Z is in parallel with the main signal path, as in an inverting amplifier configuration, Miller's theorem is typically applicable.\n\nAn important consideration is that the values of $A_{v}$ in the equations for $Z_{1}$ and $Z_{2}$ must be calculated at the frequency of interest, which can complicate the algebra involved. Despite these complexities, Miller's theorem remains a powerful tool for understanding and designing circuits, even when used in conjunction with the \"Miller's approximation,\" which can provide useful insights despite its limitations."

    "text": "The common-source configuration is known for its high input impedance and voltage gain capabilities, with a minimal voltage headroom requirement, making it extensively utilized in analog circuits. Its frequency response is a critical aspect of interest.\n\nIn Figure 6.13(a), a common-source stage is depicted, powered by a finite source resistance, denoted as $R_{S}$. We identify the circuit's capacitances, observing that $C_{G S}$ and $C_{D B}$ are grounded, while $C_{G D}$ connects the input to the output. In practical scenarios, the circuit also drives a load capacitance, which can be consolidated with $C_{D B}$.\n\nThe circuit depicted is a common-source amplifier stage that incorporates parasitic capacitances $C_{G S}$, $C_{G D}$, and $C_{D B}$, with the NMOS transistor $M1$ operating in saturation. The circuit drives a load capacitance that is merged with $C_{D B}$.\n\nFigure 6.13(b) presents a high-frequency model of a common-source amplifier utilizing Miller's approximation. Here, the NMOS transistor $M1$ is in saturation, driven by the input voltage $Vin$, with the output measured across the load resistor $RD$.

The total capacitance from node $X$ to ground is the sum of $C_{G S}$ and the Miller multiplication of $C_{G D}$, expressed as $C_{G S}+\\left(1-A_{v}\\right) C_{G D}$, where $A_{v}=-g_{m} R_{D}$. This determines the magnitude of the \"input\" pole as follows:\n\n$$\n\\omega_{i n}=\\frac{1}{R_{S}\\left[C_{G S}+\\left(1+g_{m} R_{D}\\right) C_{G D}\\right]}\n$$\n\nAt the output node, the total capacitance to ground is $C_{D B}$ plus the Miller effect of $C_{G D}$, or $C_{D B}+\\left(1-A_{v}^{-1}\\right) C_{G D}$, which approximates to $C_{D B}+C_{G D}$ if $\\left.A_{v} \\gg 1\\right)$.

It includes an NMOS transistor $M1$, a resistor $RD$, and capacitors $CGD$, $CDB$, and $CGS$. The node labeled 'd1' is the output node connected to the drain of $M1$ and the resistor $RD$.\n\nIf $R_{S}$ is relatively large, another approximation of the output pole can be derived by simplifying the circuit as shown in Figure 6.14, neglecting the effect of $R_{S}$. The reader can verify that:\n\n$$\nZ_{X}=\\frac{1}{C_{e q} s} \\|\\left(\\frac{C_{G D}+C_{G S}}{C_{G D}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{g_{m 1}}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $C_{e q}=C_{G D} C_{G S} /\\left(C_{G D}+C_{G S}\\right)$.

Alternatively, the values of $\\omega_{\\text {in }}$ and $\\omega_{\\text {out }}$ could be expressed with a negative sign, leading to a denominator of $\\left(1-s / \\omega_{\\text {in }}\\right)\\left(1-s / \\omega_{\\text {out }}\\right)$. However, this book adopts the former notation. The transfer function is then:\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{\\text {out }}}{V_{\\text {in }}}(s)=\\frac{-g_{m} R_{D}}{\\left(1+\\frac{s}{\\omega_{\\text {in }}}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{s}{\\omega_{\\text {out }}}\\right)}\n$$\n\nThe primary shortcoming of this estimation is the omission of zeros in the circuit. Another issue arises from approximating the amplifier's gain by $-g_{m} R_{D}$, whereas in reality, the gain varies with frequency, for instance, due to the capacitance at the output node.\n\nFor an exact transfer function analysis, we employ the equivalent circuit shown in Figure 6.15, summing the currents at each node:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{V_{X}-V_{\\text {in }}}{R_{S}}+V_{X} C_{G S} s+\\left(V_{X}-V_{\\text {out }}\\right) C_{G D} s & =0\\\\\n\\left(V_{\\text {out }}-V_{X}\\right) C_{G D} s+g_{m} V_{X}+V_{\\text {out }}\\left(\\frac{1}{R_{D}}+C_{D B} S\\right) & =0\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nFrom the second equation, $V_{X}$ is derived as:\n\n$$\nV_{X}=-\\frac{V_{\\text {out }}\\left(C_{G D} s+\\frac{1}{R_{D}}+C_{D B} s\\right)}{g_{m}-C_{G D} s}\n$$\n\nSubstituting this into the first equation yields:\n\n$$\n-V_{\\text {out }} \\frac{\\left[R_{S}^{-1}+\\left(C_{G S}+C_{G D}\\right) s\\right]\\left[R_{D}^{-1}+\\left(C_{G D}+C_{D B}\\right) s\\right]}{g_{m}-C_{G D} s}-V_{\\text {out }} C_{G D} s=\\frac{V_{\\text {in }}}{R_{S}}\n$$\n\nThus, the transfer function is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{\\text {out }}}{V_{\\text {in }}}(s)=\\frac{\\left(C_{G D} s-g_{m}\\right) R_{D}}{R_{S} R_{D} \\xi s^{2}+\\left[R_{S}\\left(1+g_{m} R_{D}\\right) C_{G D}+R_{S} C_{G S}+R_{D}\\left(C_{G D}+C_{D B}\\right)\\right] s+1}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\xi=C_{G S} C_{G D}+C_{G S} C_{D B}+C_{G D} C_{D B}$. Notably, the transfer function is second order despite the presence of three capacitors, as they form a \"loop,\" allowing only two independent initial conditions and resulting in a second-order differential equation for the time response.\n\n#### Example 6.6\n\nA student considers only $C_{G D}$ in Figure 6.13(a) to achieve a one-pole response, reasoning that the voltage gain decreases by 3 dB (a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$) at the pole frequency. The student suggests a better approximation of the Miller effect by multiplying $C_{G D}$ by $1+g_{m} R_{D} \\sqrt{2}$. Explain the flaw in this reasoning.\n\n#### Solution\n\nBy setting $C_{G S}$ and $C_{D B}$ to zero, we obtain:\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{\\text {out }}}{V_{\\text {in }}}(s)=\\frac{\\left(C_{G D} s-g_{m}\\right) R_{D}}{\\frac{s}{\\omega_{0}}+1}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\omega_{0}=R_{S}\\left(1+g_{m} R_{D}\\right) C_{G D}+R_{D} C_{G D}$. We observe that $C_{G D}$ is indeed multiplied by $1+g_{m} R_{D}$ in this exact analysis. The flaw in the student's argument lies in the fact that although the voltage gain in Figure 6.13(a) does fall by $\\sqrt{2}$ at $\\omega_{0}$, this gain refers to the ratio from $V_{\\text {in }}$ to $V_{\\text {out }}$, not the gain observed by $C_{G D}$. The reader can derive the transfer function from node $X$ to $V_{\\text {out }}$ as:\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{\\text {out }}}{V_{\\text {X}}}(s)=\\frac{\\left(C_{G D} s-g_{m}\\right) R_{D}}{R_{D} C_{G D}+1}\n$$\n\nThis reveals that the gain begins to decrease at a higher frequency, specifically at $1 /\\left(R_{D} C_{G D}\\right)$. Therefore, the multiplication of $C_{G D}$ by $1+g_{m} R_{D}$ remains justified.\n\nFurther analysis of Equation (6.30) reveals several interesting insights about the circuit. Assuming $\\left|\\omega_{p 1}\\right| \\ll\\left|\\omega_{p 2}\\right|$, we can derive intuitive expressions for the two poles, $\\omega_{p 1}$ and $\\omega_{p 2}$, under the \"dominant pole\" approximation. This approximation yields the dominant pole as:\n\n$$\n\\omega_{p 1}=\\frac{1}{R_{S}\\left(1+g_{m} R_{D}\\right) C_{G D}+R_{S} C_{G S}+R_{D}\\left(C_{G D}+C_{D B}\\right)}\n$$\n\nComparing this with the \"input\" pole from Equation (6.21), the only difference arises from the term $R_{D}\\left(C_{G D}+C_{D B}\\right)$, which may be insignificant in some cases. The key takeaway is that the intuitive approach of associating a pole with the input node provides a rough estimate with minimal effort. Additionally, the Miller multiplication of $C_{G D}$ by the low-frequency gain of the amplifier is relatively accurate in this scenario. However, it is crucial to verify that $\\omega_{p 1} \\ll \\omega_{p 2}$ for a given set of values.\n\nOther special cases, such as $C_{G D}=0$ and $R_{D}=\\infty$, are also worth exploring.\n\n#### Example 6.7\n\nThe circuit in Figure 6.16(a) represents a special case where $R_{D} \\rightarrow \\infty$. Calculate the transfer function (with $\\lambda=0$) and explain why the Miller effect diminishes as $C_{D B}$ (or the load capacitance) increases.\n\n#### Solution\n\nUsing Equation (6.30) and letting $R_{D}$ approach infinity, we get:\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{\\text {out }}}{V_{\\text {in }}}(s)=\\frac{C_{G D} s-g_{m}}{R_{S} \\xi s^{2}+\\left[g_{m} R_{S} C_{G D}+\\left(C_{G D}+C_{D B}\\right)\\right] s}\n$$\n\nAs expected, the circuit exhibits two poles—one at the origin due to the infinite dc gain [Figure 6.16(b)]. The magnitude of the other pole is:\n\n$$\n\\omega_{p 2} \\approx \\frac{\\left(1+g_{m} R_{S}\\right) C_{G D}+C_{D B}}{R_{S}\\left(C_{G D} C_{G S}+C_{G S} C_{D B}+C_{G D} C_{D B}\\right)}\n$$\n\nFor a large $C_{D B}$, this expression simplifies to:\n\n$$\n\\omega_{p 2} \\approx \\frac{1}{R_{S}\\left(C_{G S}+C_{G D}\\right)}\n$$\n\nindicating that $C_{G D}$ experiences no Miller multiplication. This occurs because, with a large $C_{D B}$, the voltage gain from node $X$ to the output starts to decrease even at low frequencies. Consequently, for frequencies close to $\\left[R_{S}\\left(C_{G S}+C_{G D}\\right)\\right]^{-1}$, the effective gain is quite small, making $C_{G D}\\left(1-A_{v}\\right) \\approx C_{G D}$. This scenario exemplifies a case where the application of the Miller effect using low-frequency gain does not yield a reasonable estimate.\n\nApplying the dominant pole approximation to Equation (6.30), we can estimate the second pole of the CS stage in Figure 6.13(a). Since the coefficient of $s^{2}$ is equal to $\\left(\\omega_{p 1} \\omega_{p 2}\\right)^{-1}$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\omega_{p 2} =\\frac{R_{S}\\left(1+g_{m} R_{D}\\right) C_{G D}+R_{S} C_{G S}+R_{D}\\left(C_{G D}+C_{D B}\\right)}{R_{S} R_{D}\\left(C_{G S} C_{G D}+C_{G S} C_{D B}+C_{G D} C_{D B}\\right)}\n$$\n\nIt is important to emphasize that these results hold only if $\\omega_{p 1} \\ll \\omega_{p 2}$.\n\nIn a special case where $C_{G S} \\gg\\left(1+g_{m} R_{D}\\right) C_{G D}+R_{D}\\left(C_{G D}+C_{D B}\\right) / R_{S}$, we find:\n\n$$\n\\omega_{p 2} \\approx \\frac{1}{R_{D}\\left(C_{G D}+C_{D B}\\right)}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as Equation (6.22). Hence, the \"output\" pole approach is valid only if $C_{G S}$ dominates the response.\n\nThe transfer function of Equation (6.30) also exhibits a zero given by $\\omega_{z}=+g_{m} / C_{G D}$, an effect not accounted for by Miller's approximation and Equation (6.25). This zero, located in the right half-plane, arises from the direct coupling of the input to the output through $C_{G D}$. As illustrated in Figure 6.17, $C_{G D}$ provides a feedforward path that conducts the input signal to the output at very high frequencies, resulting in a frequency response slope less negative than $-40 \\mathrm{~dB} / \\mathrm{dec}$. However, as explained in Chapter 10, this zero shifts to lower frequencies in cases where a capacitor is deliberately added between the gate and the drain, introducing additional complexities.\n\n#### Example 6.8\n\nWe have seen that signals traveling through two paths within an amplifier may cancel each other at a specific frequency, creating a zero in the transfer function (Figure 6.19). Can this occur if $H_{1}(s)$ and $H_{2}(s)$ are first-order low-pass circuits?\n\n#### Solution\n\nBy modeling $H_{1}(s)$ as $A_{1} /\\left(1+s / \\omega_{p 1}\\right)$ and $H_{2}(s)$ as $A_{2} /\\left(1+s / \\omega_{p 2}\\right)$, we obtain:\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{\\text {out }}}{V_{\\text {in }}}(s)=\\frac{\\left(\\frac{A_{1}}{\\omega_{p 2}}+\\frac{A_{2}}{\\omega_{p"

We identify all the capacitances within the circuit, observing that $C_{G S}$ and $C_{D B}$ are grounded capacitances, whereas $C_{G D}$ is positioned between the input and output.

Simplifying the circuit as shown in Fig. 6.14, where the effect of \\( R_{S} \\) is neglected, we can prove that:\n\n$$\nZ_{X}=\\frac{1}{C_{e q} s} \\|\\left(\\frac{C_{G D}+C_{G S}}{C_{G D}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{g_{m 1}}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere \\( C_{e q}=C_{G D} C_{G S} /\\left(C_{G D}+C_{G S}\\right) \\). Thus, the output pole is roughly equal to:\n\n$$\n\\omega_{\\text {out }}=\\frac{1}{\\left[R_{D} \\|\\left(\\frac{C_{G D}+C_{G S}}{C_{G D}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{g_{m 1}}\\right)\\right]\\left(C_{e q}+C_{D B}\\right)}\n$$\n\nThe transfer function is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{\\text {out }}}{V_{\\text {in }}}(s)=\\frac{-g_{m} R_{D}}{\\left(1+\\frac{s}{\\omega_{\\text {in }}}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{s}{\\omega_{\\text {out }}}\\right)}\n$$\n\nThe primary error in this estimation is that we have not considered the existence of zeros in the circuit. Another concern stems from approximating the gain of the amplifier by \\( -g_{m} R_{D} \\) whereas in reality the gain varies with frequency (for example, due to the capacitance at the output node).\n\nUsing the equivalent circuit depicted in Fig. 6.15, we can sum the currents at each node:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{V_{X}-V_{\\text {in }}}{R_{S}}+V_{X} C_{G S} s+\\left(V_{X}-V_{\\text {out }}\\right) C_{G D} s & =0\\\\\n\\left(V_{\\text {out }}-V_{X}\\right) C_{G D} s+g_{m} V_{X}+V_{\\text {out }}\\left(\\frac{1}{R_{D}}+C_{D B} S\\right) & =0\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nFrom the second equation, \\( V_{X} \\) is obtained as:\n\n$$\nV_{X}=-\\frac{V_{\\text {out }}\\left(C_{G D} s+\\frac{1}{R_{D}}+C_{D B} s\\right)}{g_{m}-C_{G D} s}\n$$\n\nwhich, upon substitution in the first equation, yields:\n\n$$\n-V_{\\text {out }} \\frac{\\left[R_{S}^{-1}+\\left(C_{G S}+C_{G D}\\right) s\\right]\\left[R_{D}^{-1}+\\left(C_{G D}+C_{D B}\\right) s\\right]}{g_{m}-C_{G D} s}-V_{\\text {out }} C_{G D} s=\\frac{V_{\\text {in }}}{R_{S}}\n$$\n\nThus:\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{\\text {out }}}{V_{\\text {in }}}(s)=\\frac{\\left(C_{G D} s-g_{m}\\right) R_{D}}{R_{S} R_{D} \\xi s^{2}+\\left[R_{S}\\left(1+g_{m} R_{D}\\right) C_{G D}+R_{S} C_{G S}+R_{D}\\left(C_{G D}+C_{D B}\\right)\\right] s+1}\n$$\n\nwhere \\( \\xi=C_{G S} C_{G D}+C_{G S} C_{D B}+C_{G D} C_{D B} \\). Note that the transfer function is of second order even though the circuit contains three capacitors. This is because the capacitors form a \"loop,\" allowing only two independent initial conditions in the circuit and hence yielding a second-order differential equation for the time response."

Why does $C_{G S}$ disappear here? This is because, in the absence of channel-length modulation and body effect, the voltage gain from the gate to the source is equal to unity. Since a change of $\\Delta V$ at the gate translates to an equal change at the source (Fig. 6.23), no current flows through $C_{G S}$. Consequently, $C_{G S}$ contributes neither a zero nor a pole. We say $C_{G S}$ is \"bootstrapped\" by the source follower. With $\\lambda, \\gamma>0$, the output change is less than $\\Delta V$, requiring some change in the voltage across $C_{G S}$.\n\nFigure 6.23 Bootstrapping of $C_{G S}$ in a source follower.\n\nIf the two poles of (6.51) are assumed far apart, then the lower one has a magnitude of:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\omega_{p 1} & \\approx \\frac{g_{m}}{g_{m} R_{S} C_{G D}+C_{L}+C_{G S}}  \\tag{6.55}\\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{R_{S} C_{G D}+\\frac{C_{L}+C_{G S}}{g_{m}}} \\tag{6.56}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nAlso, if $R_{S}=0$, then $\\omega_{p 1}=g_{m} /\\left(C_{L}+C_{G S}\\right)$ —as expected.\n\nLet us now calculate the input impedance of the circuit, noting that $C_{G D}$ simply shunts the input and can be ignored initially. Shown in Fig. 6.24, the equivalent circuit includes body effect, but channel-length modulation can also be added by replacing $1 / g_{m b}$ with $\\left(1 / g_{m b}\\right) \\| r_{O}$. The small-signal gate-source voltage of $M_{1}$ is equal to $I_{X} /\\left(C_{G S} s\\right)$, giving a source current of $g_{m} I_{X} /\\left(C_{G S} s\\right)$. Starting from the input and adding the voltages, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{X}=\\frac{I_{X}}{C_{G S} s}+\\left(I_{X}+\\frac{g_{m} I_{X}}{C_{G S} s}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{g_{m b}} \\| \\frac{1}{C_{L} s}\\right) \\tag{6.57}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nthat is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nZ_{i n}=\\frac{1}{C_{G S} S}+\\left(1+\\frac{g_{m}}{C_{G S} S}\\right) \\frac{1}{g_{m b}+C_{L} S} \\tag{6.58}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWe consider some special cases. First, if $g_{m b}=0$ and $C_{L}=0$, then $Z_{i n}=\\infty$, because $C_{G S}$ is entirely bootstrapped by the source follower and draws no current from the input. Second, at relatively low frequencies, $g_{m b} \\gg\\left|C_{L} s\\right|$ and:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nZ_{i n} \\approx \\frac{1}{C_{G S} S}\\left(1+\\frac{g_{m}}{g_{m b}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{g_{m b}} \\tag{6.59}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nindicating that the equivalent input capacitance is equal to $C_{G S} g_{m b} /\\left(g_{m}+g_{m b}\\right)$ and hence quite less than $C_{G S}$. In other words, the overall input capacitance is equal to $C_{G D}$ plus a fraction of $C_{G S}$-again because of bootstrapping.\n\n#### Example 6.12\n\nApply Miller's approximation to the above circuit if $C_{L}=0$.\n\n#### Solution\n\nAs illustrated in Fig. 6.25, the low-frequency gain from the gate to the source is equal to $\\left(1 / g_{m b}\\right) /\\left[\\left(1 / g_{m}\\right)+\\right.$ $\\left.\\left(1 / g_{m b}\\right)\\right]=g_{m} /\\left(g_{m}+g_{m b}\\right)$. The Miller multiplication of $C_{G S}$ at the input is thus equal to $C_{G S}\\left[1-g_{m} /\\left(g_{m}+g_{m b}\\right)\\right]=$ $C_{G S} g_{m b} /\\left(g_{m}+g_{m b}\\right)$.\n\nAt high frequencies, $g_{m b} \\ll\\left|C_{L} s\\right|$ and:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nZ_{i n} \\approx \\frac{1}{C_{G S} s}+\\frac{1}{C_{L} S}+\\frac{g_{m}}{C_{G S} C_{L} s^{2}} \\tag{6.60}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor a given $s=j \\omega$, the input impedance consists of the series combination of capacitors $C_{G S}$ and $C_{L}$ and a negative resistance equal to $-g_{m} /\\left(C_{G S} C_{L} \\omega^{2}\\right)$ (Fig. 6.26). The negative resistance property can be utilized in oscillators (Chapter 15). It is important to bear in mind that a source follower driving a load capacitance exhibits a negative input resistance, possibly causing instability.\n\nFigure 6.26 Negative resistance seen at the input of a source follower.\n\n#### Example 6.13\n\nNeglecting channel-length modulation and body effect, calculate the transfer function of the circuit shown in Fig. 6.27(a).\n\n#### Solution\n\nLet us first identify all of the capacitances in the circuit. At node $X, C_{G D 1}$ and $C_{D B 2}$ are connected to ground and $C_{G S 1}$ and $C_{G D 2}$ to $Y$. At node $Y, C_{S B 1}, C_{G S 2}$, and $C_{L}$ are connected to ground. Similar to the source follower of Fig. 6.22(b), this circuit has three capacitances in a loop and hence a second-order transfer function. Using the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 6.27(b), where $C_{X}=C_{G D 1}+C_{D B 2}, C_{X Y}=C_{G S 1}+C_{G D 2}$, and $C_{Y}=C_{S B 1}+C_{G S 2}+C_{L}$, we have $V_{1} C_{X Y} s+g_{m 1} V_{1}=V_{\\text {out }} C_{Y} s$, and hence $V_{1}=V_{\\text {out }} C_{Y} s /\\left(C_{X Y} s+g_{m 1}\\right)$. Also, since $V_{2}=V_{\\text {out }}$, the summation of currents at node $X$ gives:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left(V_{1}+V_{\\text {out }}\\right) C_{X} s+g_{m 2} V_{\\text {out }}+V_{1} C_{X Y} s=\\frac{V_{\\text {in }}-V_{1}-V_{\\text {out }}}{R_{S}} \\tag{6.61}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSubstituting for $V_{1}$ and simplifying the result, we obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{V_{\\text {out }}}{V_{\\text {in }}}(s)=\\frac{g_{m 1}+C_{X Y} s}{R_{S} \\xi s^{2}+\\left[C_{Y}+g_{m 1} R_{S} C_{X}+\\left(1+g_{m 2} R_{S}\\right) C_{X Y}\\right] s+g_{m 1}\\left(1+g_{m 2} R_{S}\\right)} \\tag{6.62}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\xi=C_{X} C_{Y}+C_{X} C_{X Y}+C_{Y} C_{X Y}$. As expected, (6.62) reduces to a form similar to (6.51) for $g_{m 2}=0$.\n\nThe output impedance of source followers is also of interest. In Fig. 6.22(a), the body effect and $C_{S B}$ simply yield an impedance in parallel with the output. Ignoring this impedance and neglecting $C_{G D}$, we note from the equivalent circuit of Fig. 6.28(a) that $V_{1} C_{G S} s+g_{m} V_{1}=-I_{X}$. Also, $V_{1} C_{G S} s R_{S}+V_{1}=-V_{X}$.\n\nFigure 6.28 Calculation of source follower output impedance.\n\nDividing both sides of these equations gives:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nZ_{\\text {out }} & =\\frac{V_{X}}{I_{X}}  \\tag{6.63}\\\\\n& =\\frac{R_{S} C_{G S} s+1}{g_{m}+C_{G S} s} \\tag{6.64}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIt is instructive to examine the magnitude of this impedance as a function of frequency. At low frequencies, $Z_{\\text {out }} \\approx 1 / g_{m}$, as expected. At very high frequencies, $Z_{\\text {out }} \\approx R_{S}$ (because $C_{G S}$ shorts the gate and the source). We therefore surmise that $\\left|Z_{\\text {out }}\\right|$ varies as shown in Figs. 6.28(b) or (c). Which one of these variations is more realistic? Operating as buffers, source followers must lower the output impedance, i.e., $1 / g_{m}<R_{S}$. For this reason, the characteristic shown in Fig. 6.28(c) occurs more commonly than that in Fig. 6.28(b).\n\nThe behavior illustrated in Fig. 6.28(c) reveals an important attribute of source followers. Since the output impedance increases with frequency, we postulate that it contains an inductive component. To confirm this guess, we represent $Z_{\\text {out }}$ by a first-order passive network, noting that $Z_{\\text {out }}$ equals $1 / g_{m}$ at $\\omega=0$ and $R_{S}$ at $\\omega=\\infty$. The network can therefore be realized as shown in Fig. 6.29 because $Z_{1}$ equals $R_{2}$ at $\\omega=0$ and $R_{1}+R_{2}$ at $\\omega=\\infty$. In other words, $Z_{1}=Z_{\\text {out }}$ if three conditions hold: $R_{2}=1 / g_{m}$, $R_{1}=R_{S}-1 / g_{m}$, and $L$ is chosen properly.\n\nFigure 6.29 Equivalent output impedance of a source follower.\n\nTo calculate $L$, we can simply obtain an expression for $Z_{1}$ in terms of the three components in Fig. 6.29 and equate the result to $Z_{\\text {out }}$ found above. Alternatively, since $R_{2}$ is a series component of $Z_{1}$, we can subtract its value from $Z_{\\text {out }}$, thereby obtaining an expression for the parallel combination of $R_{1}$ and $L$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nZ_{\\text {out }}-\\frac{1}{g_{m}}=\\frac{C_{G S} S\\left(R_{S}-\\frac{1}{g_{m}}\\right)}{g_{m}+C_{G S} s} \\tag{6.65}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nInverting the result to obtain the admittance of the parallel circuit, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{1}{Z_{\\text {out }}-\\frac{1}{g_{m}}}=\\frac{1}{R_{S}-\\frac{1}{g_{m}}}+\\frac{1}{\\frac{C_{G S} S}{g_{m}}\\left(R_{S}-\\frac{1}{g_{m}}\\right)} \\tag{6.66}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWe can thus identify the first term on the right-hand side as the inverse of $R_{1}$ and the second term as the inverse of an impedance equal to $\\left(C_{G S} s / g_{m}\\right)\\left(R_{S}-1 / g_{m}\\right)$, i.e., an inductor with the value:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nL=\\frac{C_{G S}}{g_{m}}\\left(R_{S}-\\frac{1}{g_{m}}\\right) \\tag{6.67}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nNote that $C_{G S} / g_{m}$ is approximately equal to $\\omega_{T}=2 \\pi f_{T}$.\n\n#### Example 6.14\n\nCan we construct a (two-terminal) inductor from a source follower?\n\n#### Solution\n\nYes, we can. Called an \"active inductor,\" such a structure is shown in Fig. 6.30(a), providing an inductance of $\\left(C_{G S 2} / g_{m 2}\\right)\\left(R_{S}-1 / g_{m 2}\\right)$. But the inductor is not ideal because it also incurs a parallel resistance equal to $R_{1}=$ $R_{S}=1 / g_{m 2}$ and a series resistance equal to $1 /"
