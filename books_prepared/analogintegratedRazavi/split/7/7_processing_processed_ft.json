The noise, depicted as a smaller jagged waveform, indicates that even though the signal is amplified, there is an inherent noise component introduced during the amplification process. This affects the output signal by reducing the signal-to-noise ratio, potentially degrading the quality of the signal. Understanding this noise component is crucial for designing amplifiers that minimize noise impact and maintain signal integrity."

This suggests that the amplifier is designed to handle audio frequencies effectively while minimizing noise at higher frequencies. The roll-off beyond 1 MHz indicates a low-pass filter behavior, attenuating higher frequency noise, which helps in maintaining a better signal-to-noise ratio within the desired frequency range."
