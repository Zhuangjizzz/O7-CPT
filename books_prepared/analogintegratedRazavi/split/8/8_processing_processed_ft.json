Given the circuit in Fig. 8.33(a), which includes a small resistor $r$ in the output current path and an amplifier $A_{1}$ that subtracts its output from $V_{R E F}$, how can we calculate the output current and impedance of this circuit? Assume $\\left|Z_{L}\\right| \\ll r_{O}$ (the output resistance of $M_{1}$). Here is the netlist: [name: VREF, type: VoltageSource, value: VREF, ports: {Np: VREF, Nn: GND}, name: A1, type: OpAmp, ports: {InP: VREF, InN: g1, OutP: d1, OutN: '}, name: M1, type: NMOS, ports: {S: GND, D: d1, G: g1}, name: ZL, type: Resistor, value: ZL, ports: {N1: x1, N2: d1}, name: Vt, type: VoltageSource, value: Vt, ports: {Np: Vt, Nn: GND'}]. The function of the circuit is to maintain a constant output current $I_{out}$ by comparing $V_{R E F}$ with the voltage across $r$ using $A_{1}$, and $M_{1}$ controls the output current path."

Therefore, $I_{out} = \\left(V_{R E F} / A_{1}\\right) / r$. This means the current through the resistor $r$ is controlled to match the reference voltage divided by the gain of the amplifier and the resistance value."

The changes in input and output impedances further contribute to better current control, making the circuit suitable for applications requiring precise and stable current amplification."

The loop gain is calculated using the formula $\\text{Loop Gain} = \\left(\\frac{Y}{W}\\right)^{-1} - 1$, where $Y$ is the output signal and $W$ is the injected signal. This method is particularly useful for analyzing the stability and performance of the feedback system. However, its limitation is that it assumes a unilateral loop, which may not be accurate for non-unilateral or multiloop circuits. In such cases, different injection points can yield different loop gains, complicating the analysis."
