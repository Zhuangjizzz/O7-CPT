We begin with the power budget, allocating 3 mA to $M_{9}$ and the remaining $330 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$ to $M_{b 1}$ and $M_{b 2}$. Thus, each cascode branch of the op amp carries a current of 1.5 mA. Next, we consider the required output swings. Each of nodes $X$ and $Y$ must be able to swing by $1.5 \\mathrm{~V}_{p p}$ without driving $M_{3}-M_{6}$ into the triode region. With a 3-V supply, therefore, the total voltage available for $M_{9}$ and each cascode branch is equal to 1.5 V, i.e., $\\left|V_{O D 7}\\right|+\\left|V_{O D 5}\\right|+V_{O D 3}+V_{O D 1}+V_{O D 9}=1.5 \\mathrm{~V}$. Since $M_{9}$ carries the largest current, we choose $V_{O D 9} \\approx 0.5 \\mathrm{~V}$, leaving 1 V for the four transistors in the cascode. Moreover, since $M_{5}-M_{8}$ suffer from low mobility, we allocate an overdrive of approximately 300 mV to each, obtaining 400 mV for $V_{O D 1}+V_{O D 3}$. As an initial guess, $V_{O D 1}=V_{O D 3}=200 \\mathrm{mV}$. With the bias current and overdrive voltage of each transistor known, we can easily determine the aspect ratios from $I_{D}=(1 / 2) \\mu C_{o x}(W / L)\\left(V_{G S}-V_{T H}\\right)^{2}$ or simulated I/V characteristics. To minimize the device capacitances, we choose the minimum length for each transistor, obtaining a corresponding width. We then have $(W / L)_{1-4}=1250$, and $(W / L)_{5-8}=1111$, and $(W / L)_{9}=400$. The design has thus far satisfied the swing, power dissipation, and supply voltage specifications.

Doubling the (effective) length and width of each of these transistors in fact doubles their $g_{m} r_{O}$ because $g_{m}$ remains constant while $r_{O}$ increases by a factor of 2.

Main Components: - Stage 1 (High Gain): This block is responsible for providing a high gain to the input signal. It is the first stage in the op amp configuration and processes the input voltage, denoted as \\( V_{in} \\). - Stage 2 (High Swing): This block follows Stage 1 and is designed to allow large output voltage swings. It processes the amplified signal from Stage 1 and outputs it as \\( V_{out} \\). 2. Flow of Information or Control: - The input signal \\( V_{in} \\) is fed into Stage 1, where it undergoes amplification. - The amplified signal from Stage 1 is then directed to Stage 2, which is optimized for high output swings. - The final output, \\( V_{out} \\), is taken from Stage 2. 3. Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators: - The diagram clearly labels the input and output ports as \\( V_{in} \\) and \\( V_{out} \\), respectively. - The stages are marked with their primary functions: 'High Gain' for Stage 1 and 'High Swing' for Stage 2. 4. Overall System Function: - The primary function of this two-stage op amp system is to separately handle high gain and large output swings.

It consists of a differential pair with PMOS transistors M1 and M2 at the top and NMOS transistors M9 and M10 at the bottom. The outputs are Vout1 and Vout2, and the resistance between node P and ground is determined by the parallel combination of M7 and M8. The student observes the output waveforms shown in a time-domain waveform graph illustrating the step response of the circuit. The x-axis represents time (t), while the y-axis represents voltage levels, specifically Vout1, Vout2, and the common-mode voltage VCM. The time axis is marked with two significant points, t1 and t2, which are indicated by vertical dashed lines. Initially, at time t1, both output voltages start from a common point but diverge as time progresses. Vout1 increases, while Vout2 decreases, indicating an asymmetric change in the output voltages. The common-mode voltage VCM is depicted as a dotted line and exhibits a change in its level between t1 and t2.

This is due to the difference in the characteristics of the two types of transistors, with PMOS generally having lower flicker noise."
