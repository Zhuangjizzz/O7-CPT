    "text": "We explore the key design aspects of operational amplifiers (op amps) and discuss their significance in various applications. Using the differential cascode circuit as a case study, we analyze its structure and components. This circuit employs both NMOS and PMOS transistors to achieve high gain and enhanced speed, incorporating current mirrors for biasing, as indicated by voltages Vb1, Vb2, and Vb3. The current source Iss provides a constant bias current. The input signals are Vip and Vin, with the output signals being Voutp and Voutn.\n\nThe open-loop gain of an op amp is crucial for the precision of the feedback system utilizing the op amp. The required gain can vary significantly depending on the application. A trade-off often exists between gain, speed, and output voltage swing. For example, in a circuit designed for a nominal gain of 10, the minimum open-loop gain needed to maintain a gain error of 1% is determined. This example highlights the importance of high open-loop gain in suppressing nonlinearity.\n\nThe small-signal bandwidth of op amps is another critical parameter, particularly in high-frequency applications. The gain roll-off with frequency is analyzed using a Bode plot, illustrating the decrease in gain as frequency increases. The unity-gain frequency (fu) and the 3-dB frequency (f3-dB) are key points that define the bandwidth and frequency response of the amplifier.\n\nSettling time is another important consideration in op amp design. An example demonstrates how to calculate the time required for the output voltage to reach within 1% of its final value, given a specific unity-gain bandwidth and closed-loop gain.\n\nPositive feedback can lead to instability in op amp circuits, as shown in another example where the inverting and non-inverting inputs are mistakenly swapped. This results in a pole in the right half-plane and an exponential growth of the output voltage with time.\n\nLarge-signal behavior is also crucial in many applications, where op amps must handle large transient signals. Nonlinear phenomena can significantly impact the circuit's performance, necessitating careful simulations to characterize the behavior.\n\nOutput swing is another significant consideration, with many systems requiring large voltage swings to accommodate a wide range of signal amplitudes. Fully differential op amps have become popular due to their ability to generate complementary outputs, effectively doubling the available swing.\n\nLinearity is a critical issue in op amp design, with open-loop op amps exhibiting substantial nonlinearity. Approaches such as using fully differential implementations and allowing sufficient open-loop gain can help address this issue.\n\nNoise and offset are also important factors, determining the minimum signal level that can be processed with reasonable quality. A trade-off often exists between noise and output swing.\n\nFinally, supply rejection is a critical parameter, particularly in mixed-signal systems where op amps may be connected to noisy digital supply lines. Fully differential topologies are preferred in such scenarios due to their improved performance in the presence of supply noise."

The input signals are Vip and Vin, while the output signals are Voutp and Voutn.\n\nFigure 9.1 Cascode op amp.\n\nGain: The open-loop gain of an operational amplifier dictates the accuracy of the feedback system that utilizes it. It has been noted that the necessary gain can differ by up to four orders of magnitude depending on the application. With parameters such as speed and output voltage variations in consideration, the minimum required gain must be established. As detailed in Chapter 14, a high open-loop gain is also essential for suppressing nonlinearity.\n\n#### Example 9.1\n\nThe circuit shown in Figure 9.2 is designed for a target gain of 10, which means \\(1+R_{1} / R_{2}=10\\). Calculate the smallest possible value of \\(A_{1}\\) for a gain inaccuracy of \\(1 \\%\\).\nimage_name:Figure 9.2\ndescription:\n[\nname: A1, type: OpAmp, value: A1, ports: {InP: Vin, InN: InN(A1), OutP: Vout, OutN: '}\nname: R1, type: Resistor, value: R1, ports: {N1: Vout, N2: InN(A1)}\nname: R2, type: Resistor, value: R2, ports: {N1: InN(A1), N2: GND'}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit is a non-inverting amplifier with feedback resistors R1 and R2 establishing the gain. The input is Vin, and the output is Vout. The inverting input of the op-amp is connected to the node formed by R1 and R2.\n\nFigure 9.2\n\n#### Solution\n\nThe closed-loop gain is derived from Chapter 8 as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{V_{\\text {out }}}{V_{\\text {in }}} & =\\frac{A_{1}}{1+\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} A_{1}}  \\tag{9.1}\\\\\n& =\\frac{R_{1}+R_{2}}{R_{2}} \\frac{A_{1}}{\\frac{R_{1}+R_{2}}{R_{2}}+A_{1}} \\tag{9.2}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nAssuming \\(A_{1} \\gg 10\\), we approximate equation (9.2) to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{V_{\\text {out }}}{V_{\\text {in }}} \\approx\\left(1+\\frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{R_{1}+R_{2}}{R_{2}} \\frac{1}{A_{1}}\\right) \\tag{9.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe term \\(\\left(R_{1}+R_{2}\\right) /\\left(R_{2} A_{1}\\right)=\\left(1+R_{1} / R_{2}\\right) / A_{1}\\) signifies the relative gain error. To achieve a gain error below \\(1 \\%\\), it is necessary that \\(A_{1}>1000\\).\n\nComparing the circuit of Figure 9.2 to an open-loop configuration like that in Figure 9.3 is insightful. Although a nominal gain of \\(g_{m} R_{D}=10\\) can be obtained with a common-source stage, ensuring an error less than \\(1 \\%\\)\nis very challenging.

The input voltage Vin governs the NMOS, and the output voltage Vout is taken across the drain resistor RD.\n\nFigure 9.3 Simple common-source stage.\n\nSmall-Signal Bandwidth: The high-frequency performance of operational amplifiers is crucial for numerous applications. For instance, as the frequency of operation escalates, the open-loop gain starts to diminish, leading to increased errors in the feedback system (Fig. 9.4). The small-signal bandwidth is generally defined as the \"unitygain\" frequency, \\(f_{u}\\), which can reach several gigahertz in modern CMOS op amps. The \\(3-\\mathrm{dB}\\) frequency, \\(f_{3-\\mathrm{dB}}\\), may also be mentioned to simplify the prediction of the closed-loop frequency response.\nimage_name:Figure 9.4\ndescription:The graph in Figure 9.4 is a Bode plot, demonstrating the change in gain of an operational amplifier relative to frequency.\n\n1. **Graph Type and Function:**\n- This graph is a Bode plot, depicting the magnitude of gain in decibels (dB) versus frequency on a logarithmic scale.\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n- The vertical axis denotes the gain in decibels, denoted as \\(20 \\log |A_v|\\). The horizontal axis denotes frequency, labeled as \\(f\\), on a logarithmic scale.\n- The frequency axis has significant markers at \\(f_{3-\\mathrm{dB}}\\) and \\(f_{u}\\), signifying key frequencies.\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- The graph exhibits a consistent gain at lower frequencies, with a subsequent decrease in gain as frequency increases. This is characteristic of a single-pole amplifier.\n- The gain commences to decrease at the \\(f_{3-\\mathrm{dB}}\\) point, indicating where the gain has reduced by 3 dB from its low-frequency level.\n- The roll-off persists until it reaches the unity-gain frequency \\(f_{u}\\), at which the gain is 0 dB.\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The \\(f_{3-\\mathrm{dB}}\\) frequency is a pivotal point where the gain begins to decline significantly.\n- The unity-gain frequency \\(f_{u}\\) is shown on the frequency axis, indicating the frequency where the gain curve intersects the 0 dB line.\n- The slope of the roll-off beyond \\(f_{3-\\mathrm{dB}}\\) is usually -20 dB/decade, indicative of a single-pole system.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- The graph features a dashed vertical line at \\(f_{3-\\mathrm{dB}}\\) to emphasize the -3 dB point.\n- The unity-gain frequency \\(f_{u}\\) is marked on the frequency axis, indicating the point where the gain curve crosses the 0 dB line.\n\nFigure 9.4 Gain roll-off with frequency.\n\n#### Example 9.2\n\nIn the circuit of Figure 9.5, assuming the op amp is a single-pole voltage amplifier, if \\(V_{i n}\\) is a small step, compute the duration needed for the output voltage to be within \\(1 \\%\\)\nof its ultimate value. Determine the minimum unity-gain bandwidth that the op amp must have if the settling time should be less than 5 ns, given that the low-frequency gain is much greater than unity.\nimage_name:Figure 9.5\ndescription:\n[\nname: Vin, type: VoltageSource, ports: {Np: Vin, Nn: GND}\nname: R1, type: Resistor, value: R1, ports: {N1: Vout, N2: InN(As)}\nname: R2, type: Resistor, value: R2, ports: {N1: InN(As), N2: GND}\nname: A(s), type: OpAmp, value: A(s), ports: {InP: Vin, InN: InN(As), OutP: Vout}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit is a feedback amplifier with a single-pole op amp. The input is Vin, and the output is Vout. The op amp amplifies the signal with feedback resistors R1 and R2. The graph illustrates the step response of the output voltage Vout with respect to the input voltage Vin.\nimage_name:Figure 9.4\ndescription:The graph in Figure 9.4 is a Bode plot illustrating the gain roll-off of an operational amplifier in relation to frequency. This kind of graph is used to examine the frequency response of a system.\n\n1. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n- The horizontal axis represents frequency, typically measured in hertz (Hz), and is displayed on a logarithmic scale. This facilitates the visualization of a wide range of frequencies on the same plot.\n- The vertical axis represents gain, measured in decibels (dB).\n\n2. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- The graph displays a decreasing trend in gain as frequency increases, which is typical of a low-pass filter response.\n- The gain starts at a high level at low frequencies and decreases at higher frequencies.\n\n3. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The -3 dB point, known as the cutoff frequency \\(f_{3-\\mathrm{dB}}\\), is marked on the graph. This point denotes where the gain has dropped by 3 dB from its maximum value at low frequencies.\n- The unity-gain frequency \\(f_{u}\\) is also indicated. This is the frequency where the gain curve crosses the 0 dB line, indicating that the output signal is equal in amplitude to the input signal.\n\n4. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- Annotations highlight the critical frequencies, such as \\(f_{3-\\mathrm{dB}}\\) and \\(f_{u}\\), which are essential for understanding the bandwidth and stability of the amplifier.\n\nIn summary, this Bode plot presents a clear picture of how the gain of the operational amplifier decreases with rising frequency, marking important frequency points that are vital for designing and analyzing amplifier circuits.\n\nFigure 9.5\n\n#### Solution\n\nGiven\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left(V_{\\text {in }}-V_{\\text {out }} \\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}\\right) A(s)=V_{\\text {out }} \\tag{9.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwe obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{V_{\\text {out }}}{V_{\\text {in }}}(s)=\\frac{A(s)}{1+\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} A(s)} \\tag{9.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor a one-pole system, \\(A(s)=A_{0} /\\left(1+s / \\omega_{0}\\right)\\), where \\(\\omega_{0}\\) is the \\(3-\\mathrm{dB}\\) bandwidth and \\(A_{0} \\omega_{0}\\) the unity-gain bandwidth. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{V_{\\text {out }}}{V_{\\text {in }}}(s) & =\\frac{A_{0}}{1+\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} A_{0}+\\frac{s}{\\omega_{0}}}  \\tag{9.6}\\\\\n& =\\frac{\\frac{A_{0}}{1+\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} A_{0}}}{1+\\frac{S}{\\left(1+\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} A_{0}\\right) \\omega_{0}}} \\tag{9.7}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis indicates that the closed-loop amplifier is also a one-pole system with a time constant of\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\tau=\\frac{1}{\\left(1+\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} A_{0}\\right) \\omega_{0}} \\tag{9.8}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince the quantity \\(R_{2} A_{0} /\\left(R_{1}+R_{2}\\right)\\) is the low-frequency loop gain and is usually much greater than unity, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\tau \\approx\\left(1+\\frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}}\\right) \\frac{1}{A_{0} \\omega_{0}} \\tag{9.9}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe output step response for \\(V_{i n}=a u(t)\\) can now be expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {out }}(t) \\approx a\\left(1+\\frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}}\\right)\\left(1-\\exp \\frac{-t}{\\tau}\\right) u(t) \\tag{9.10}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwith the final value \\(V_{F} \\approx a\\left(1+R_{1} / R_{2}\\right)\\). For \\(1 \\%\\)\nsettling, \\(V_{\\text {out }}=0.99 V_{F}\\), and hence\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n1-\\exp \\frac{-t_{1 \\%}}{\\tau}=0.99 \\tag{9.11}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nyielding \\(t_{1 \\%}=\\tau \\ln 100 \\approx 4.6 \\tau\\). For a \\(1 \\%\\)\nsettling of 5 ns, \\(\\tau \\approx 1.09 \\mathrm{~ns}\\), and from equation (9.9), \\(A_{0} \\omega_{0} \\approx\\left(1+R_{1} / R_{2}\\right) / \\tau=9.21\\) \\(\\mathrm{Grad} / \\mathrm{s}(1.47 \\mathrm{GHz})\\).\n\nThe essential point in this example is that the bandwidth is influenced by both the required settling accuracy (e.g., \\(V_{\\text {out }}=0.99 V_{F}\\)) and the closed-loop gain \\(\\left(1+R_{1} / R_{2}\\right)\\).\n\n#### Example 9.3\n\nA student mistakenly interchanges the inverting and non-inverting inputs of the op amp in Figure 9.5. Explain how the circuit functions.\n\n#### Solution\n\nPositive feedback can destabilize the circuit. For a one-pole op amp, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left(V_{\\text {out }} \\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}-V_{\\text {in }}\\right) \\frac{A_{0}}{1+\\frac{s}{\\omega_{0}}}=V_{\\text {out }} \\tag{9.12}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand hence\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{V_{\\text {out }}}{V_{\\text {in }}}(s)=\\frac{\\frac{A_{0}}{1-\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} A_{0}}}{1-\\frac{s}{\\left(1+\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} A_{0}\\right) \\omega_{0}}} \\tag{9.13}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nNotably, the closed-loop amplifier contains a pole in the right half plane, resulting in a step response that grows exponentially over time:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{\\text {out }}(t) \\approx a\\left(1+\\frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}}\\right)\\left(\\exp \\frac{t}{\\tau}-1\\right) u(t) \\tag{9.14}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis exponential growth continues until the op amp output reaches saturation.\n\nLarge-Signal Behavior: In numerous contemporary applications, op amps need to operate with substantial transient signals. Under such circumstances, nonlinear phenomena make it challenging to characterize the speed based solely on small-signal attributes such as the open-loop response depicted in Figure 9.4. For instance, suppose the feedback circuit in Figure 9.5 integrates a realistic op amp (i.e., with finite output impedance) and is driving a substantial load capacitance. What happens to the circuit if a 1-V step is applied at the input? Since the output voltage cannot change instantaneously, the voltage difference sensed by the op amp itself at \\(t \\geq 0\\) is equal to 1 V. Such a significant difference momentarily drives the op amp into a nonlinear operating region. ("

    "text": "In this section, we discuss various operational amplifier design parameters, explaining their significance and where they might be crucial. Focusing on the differential cascode circuit, we examine its structure and operation. The circuit, depicted in Figure 9.1, is a differential cascode operational amplifier that leverages both NMOS and PMOS transistors to achieve high gain and enhanced speed. It incorporates current mirrors for biasing, as indicated by Vb1, Vb2, and Vb3 voltages, and a constant bias current provided by Iss. The input signals are Vip and Vin, while the output signals are Voutp and Voutn.\n\nThe voltages Vb1-Vb3 are generated using the current mirror techniques detailed in Chapter 5. The open-loop gain of an op amp is a key factor in the precision of feedback systems that utilize the op amp. Depending on the application, the required gain can vary significantly. Balancing parameters such as speed and output voltage swings, the minimum required gain must be known. As discussed in Chapter 14, a high open-loop gain is often necessary to suppress nonlinearity.\n\nWe explore an example of a circuit designed for a nominal gain of 10, as shown in Figure 9.2. The goal is to determine the minimum value of A1 to achieve a gain error of 1%. The circuit is a non-inverting amplifier with feedback resistors R1 and R2 determining the gain. The input is at Vin, and the output is at Vout. The inverting input of the op-amp is connected to the junction of R1 and R2.\n\nTo solve this, we use the closed-loop gain formula derived in Chapter 8. Assuming A1 is much greater than 10, we approximate the gain expression and find that A1 must be greater than 1000 to achieve a gain error less than 1%.\n\nComparing this circuit with an open-loop implementation, such as the one in Figure 9.3, we observe that while a nominal gain of gmRD=10 can be achieved by a common-source stage, guaranteeing an error less than 1% is extremely difficult. Variations in transistor parameters and resistor values typically result in an error greater than 20%.\n\nWe also delve into the small-signal bandwidth of op amps, which is vital in many applications. As the frequency of operation increases, the open-loop gain begins to decrease, leading to larger errors in the feedback system. The small-signal bandwidth is usually defined as the unity-gain frequency, fu, which can reach several gigahertz in modern CMOS op amps. The 3-dB frequency, f3-dB, is also specified to facilitate prediction of the closed-loop frequency response.\n\nWe present another example where we calculate the time required for the output voltage to reach within 1% of its final value for a given circuit with a single-pole voltage amplifier. We also determine the unity-gain bandwidth required for the op amp to achieve a settling time of less than 5 ns.\n\nIn addition, we explore the behavior of the circuit when the inverting and non-inverting inputs of the op amp are mistakenly swapped. This can lead to positive feedback and potential instability, as the closed-loop amplifier may exhibit a pole in the right half-plane, causing the output to grow exponentially with time.\n\nFurthermore, we discuss the large-signal behavior of op amps, which becomes relevant when dealing with large transient signals. Nonlinear phenomena can complicate the characterization of speed based solely on small-signal properties. As an example, we consider the behavior of a circuit when a large load capacitance is driven by a realistic op amp with finite output impedance.\n\nThe need for large output swings is another important consideration in op amp design. Fully differential op amps have become popular due to their ability to generate complementary outputs, effectively doubling the available swing. However, achieving large swings often comes at the cost of device size, bias currents, and speed.\n\nLinearity is a significant concern for open-loop op amps, which exhibit substantial nonlinearity. This can be addressed by using fully differential implementations to suppress even-order harmonics and ensuring sufficient open-loop gain for the closed-loop feedback system to achieve adequate linearity.\n\nNoise and offset are also critical parameters that determine the minimum signal level that can be processed with reasonable quality. In typical op amp topologies, multiple devices contribute to noise and offset, requiring careful design considerations.\n\nLastly, we discuss the importance of supply rejection in op amps, especially in mixed-signal systems where they may be connected to noisy digital supply lines. Fully differential topologies are preferred due to their superior performance in the presence of supply noise."

    "text": "In this section, we delve into the various op amp design parameters, elucidating their significance and the scenarios where they are crucial. For our exploration, we'll focus on the differential cascode circuit, exemplified in Figure 9.1.\n\nFigure 9.1 Cascode op amp\nThe depicted circuit is a differential cascode operational amplifier, leveraging a mix of NMOS and PMOS transistors to realize high gain and enhanced speed. It incorporates current mirrors for biasing, as indicated by the voltages Vb1, Vb2, and Vb3. A constant bias current is supplied by the current source Iss. The input signals are Vip and Vin, while the output signals are Voutp and Voutn.\n\nMoving on to the gain aspect, the open-loop gain of an op amp is instrumental in determining the precision of the feedback system it's a part of. As previously mentioned, the necessary gain can vary by four orders of magnitude, depending on the application. Considering the trade-offs with speed and output voltage swings, it is imperative to know the minimum required gain. As discussed in Chapter 14, a high open-loop gain may also be essential to mitigate nonlinearity.\n\n#### Example 9.1\n\nConsider the circuit in Figure 9.2, which is designed for a nominal gain of 10, i.e., \\(1+R_{1} / R_{2}=10\\). Determine the minimum value of \\(A_{1}\\) for a gain error of \\(1 \\% \\).\n\nFigure 9.2\nThis circuit represents a non-inverting amplifier with feedback resistors \\(R_{1}\\) and \\(R_{2}\\) that establish the gain. The input signal is Vin, and the output is Vout. The inverting input of the op-amp connects to the junction of \\(R_{1}\\) and \\(R_{2}\\).\n\n#### Solution\n\nThe closed-loop gain, as derived in Chapter 8, is as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{V_{\\text {out }}}{V_{\\text {in }}} = \\frac{A_{1}}{1+\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} A_{1}} \\tag{9.1}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{V_{\\text {out }}}{V_{\\text {in }}} = \\frac{R_{1}+R_{2}}{R_{2}} \\frac{A_{1}}{\\frac{R_{1}+R_{2}}{R_{2}}+A_{1}} \\tag{9.2}\n\\]\n\nAssuming \\(A_{1} \\gg 10\\), we approximate (9.2) as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{V_{\\text {out }}}{V_{\\text {in }}} \\approx \\left(1+\\frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{R_{1}+R_{2}}{R_{2}} \\frac{1}{A_{1}}\\right) \\tag{9.3}\n\\]\n\nThe term \\(\\left(R_{1}+R_{2}\\right) /\\left(R_{2} A_{1}\\right)=\\left(1+R_{1} / R_{2}\\right) / A_{1}\\) represents the relative gain error. To achieve a gain error less than \\(1 \\% \\), we must have \\(A_{1}>1000\\).\n\nFor comparison, let's consider an open-loop implementation, such as that in Figure 9.3. While achieving a nominal gain of \\(g_{m} R_{D}=10\\) through a common-source stage is feasible, ensuring an error less than \\(1 \\% \\) is highly challenging. Variations in transistor mobility, gate-oxide thickness, and resistor value typically result in an error greater than \\(20 \\% \\).\n\nFigure 9.3 Simple common-source stage\nThis is a simple common-source amplifier circuit using an NMOS transistor. The input voltage Vin governs the NMOS, and the output voltage Vout is measured across the drain resistor RD.\n\nFigure 9.3 Simple common-source stage.\n\nNow, let's discuss the small-signal bandwidth. The high-frequency behavior of op amps is crucial in numerous applications. As the frequency of operation increases, the open-loop gain starts to decline, introducing larger errors in the feedback system. The small-signal bandwidth is often defined as the \"unity-gain\" frequency, \\(f_{u}\\), which can reach several gigahertz in contemporary CMOS op amps. The \\(3-\\mathrm{dB}\\) frequency, \\(f_{3-\\mathrm{dB}}\\), may also be specified to facilitate the prediction of the closed-loop frequency response.\n\nFigure 9.4 Gain roll-off with frequency\nThis Bode plot illustrates the gain roll-off of an operational amplifier with respect to frequency. It is a graphical tool used to analyze the frequency response of a system.\n\n1. **Type of Graph and Function:**\n   This is a Bode plot, displaying the magnitude of gain in decibels (dB) against frequency on a logarithmic scale.\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n   The vertical axis represents gain in decibels, denoted as \\(20 \\log |A_v|\\). The horizontal axis represents frequency, labeled as \\(f\\), on a logarithmic scale.\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n   The graph exhibits a constant gain at lower frequencies, followed by a decrease in gain as frequency increases. This is characteristic of a single-pole amplifier.\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n   The \\(f_{3-\\mathrm{dB}}\\) frequency is a critical point where the gain begins to衰减 significantly. The unity-gain frequency \\(f_{u}\\) is where the gain equals 1 (0 dB), marking the bandwidth of the amplifier.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n   The graph includes a dashed vertical line at \\(f_{3-\\mathrm{dB}}\\) to emphasize the -3 dB point. The unity-gain frequency \\(f_{u}\\) is indicated on the frequency axis, denoting the point where the gain curve intersects the 0 dB line.\n\nFigure 9.4 Gain roll-off with frequency.\n\n#### Example 9.2\n\nConsider the circuit in Figure 9.5, assuming the op amp is a single-pole voltage amplifier. If \\(V_{i n}\\) is a small step, calculate the time required for the output voltage to reach within \\(1 \\%\\) of its final value. What unity-gain bandwidth must the op amp provide if \\(1+R_{1} / R_{2} \\approx 10\\) and the settling time is to be less than 5 ns? For simplicity, assume that the low-frequency gain is much greater than unity.\n\nFigure 9.5\nThis circuit represents a feedback amplifier with a single-pole op amp. The input is Vin, and the output is Vout. The op amp amplifies the signal with feedback resistors \\(R_{1}\\) and \\(R_{2}\\). The graph depicts the step response of the output voltage Vout in relation to the input voltage Vin.\n\nFigure 9.5\n\n#### Solution\n\nGiven\n\n\\[\n\\left(V_{\\text {in }}-V_{\\text {out }} \\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}\\right) A(s)=V_{\\text {out }} \\tag{9.4}\n\\]\n\nwe have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{V_{\\text {out }}}{V_{\\text {in }}}(s)=\\frac{A(s)}{1+\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} A(s)} \\tag{9.5}\n\\]\n\nFor a one-pole system, \\(A(s)=A_{0} /\\left(1+s / \\omega_{0}\\right)\\), where \\(\\omega_{0}\\) is the \\(3-\\mathrm{dB}\\) bandwidth and \\(A_{0} \\omega_{0}\\) is the unity-gain bandwidth. Thus,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{V_{\\text {out }}}{V_{\\text {in }}}(s)=\\frac{A_{0}}{1+\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} A_{0}+\\frac{s}{\\omega_{0}}} \\tag{9.6}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{V_{\\text {out }}}{V_{\\text {in }}}(s)=\\frac{\\frac{A_{0}}{1+\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} A_{0}}}{1+\\frac{S}{\\left(1+\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} A_{0}\\right) \\omega_{0}}} \\tag{9.7}\n\\]\n\nThis indicates that the closed-loop amplifier is also a one-pole system with a time constant equal to\n\n\\[\n\\tau=\\frac{1}{\\left(1+\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} A_{0}\\right) \\omega_{0}} \\tag{9.8}\n\\]\n\nConsidering that the quantity \\(R_{2} A_{0} /\\left(R_{1}+R_{2}\\right)\\) is the low-frequency loop gain and typically much greater than unity, we have\n\n\\[\n\\tau \\approx \\left(1+\\frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}}\\right) \\frac{1}{A_{0} \\omega_{0}} \\tag{9.9}\n\\]\n\nThe output step response for \\(V_{i n}=a u(t)\\) can now be expressed as\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text {out }}(t) \\approx a\\left(1+\\frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}}\\right)\\left(1-\\exp \\frac{-t}{\\tau}\\right) u(t) \\tag{9.10}\n\\]\n\nwith the final value \\(V_{F} \\approx a\\left(1+R_{1} / R_{2}\\right)\\). For \\(1 \\%\\) settling, \\(V_{\\text {out }}=0.99 V_{F}\\), and hence\n\n\\[\n1-\\exp \\frac{-t_{1 \\%}}{\\tau}=0.99 \\tag{9.11}\n\\]\n\nyielding \\(t_{1 \\%}=\\tau \\ln 100 \\approx 4.6 \\tau\\). For a \\(1 \\%\\) settling of \\(5 \\mathrm{~ns}\\), \\(\\tau \\approx 1.09 \\mathrm{~ns}\\), and from (9.9), \\(A_{0} \\omega_{0} \\approx \\left(1+R_{1} / R_{2}\\right) / \\tau=9.21 \\mathrm{Grad} / \\mathrm{s}(1.47 \\mathrm{GHz})\\).\n\nThe key point in this example is that the bandwidth is influenced by both the required settling accuracy (e.g., \\(V_{\\text {out }}=0.99 V_{F}\\)) and the closed-loop gain \\(\\left(1+R_{1} / R_{2}\\right)\\).\n\n#### Example 9.3\n\nImagine a student mistakenly swaps the inverting and non-inverting inputs of the op amp in Figure 9.5. How does the circuit behave?\n\n#### Solution\n\nPositive feedback can destabilize the circuit. For a one-pole op amp, we have\n\n\\[\n\\left(V_{\\text {out }} \\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}-V_{\\text {in }}\\right) \\frac{A_{0}}{1+\\frac{s}{\\omega_{0}}}=V_{\\text {out }} \\tag{9.12}\n\\]\n\nand hence\n\n\\[\n\\frac{V_{\\text {out }}}{V_{\\text {in }}}(s)=\\frac{\\frac{A_{0}}{1-\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} A_{0}}}{1-\\frac{s}{\\left(1+\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} A_{0}\\right) \\omega_{0}}} \\tag{9.13}\n\\]\n\nInterestingly, the closed-loop amplifier now possesses a pole in the right half plane, exhibiting a step response that grows exponentially with time:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text {out }}(t) \\approx a\\left(1+\\frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}}\\right)\\left(\\exp \\frac{t}{\\tau}-1\\right) u(t) \\tag{9.14}\n\\]\n\nThis growth continues until the op amp output saturates.\n\nWhen it comes to large-signal behavior, many modern applications require op amps to handle large transient signals. Under such conditions, nonlinear phenomena render it difficult to characterize speed solely based on small-signal properties, such as the open-loop response in Figure 9.4. For instance, consider the feedback circuit in Figure 9.5, incorporating a realistic op amp (with finite output impedance) driving a large load capacitance. How does the circuit behave when a 1-V step is applied at the input? Since the output voltage cannot change instantaneously, the voltage difference sensed by the op amp itself at \\(t \\geq 0\\) is equal to 1 V. Such a large difference momentarily drives the op amp into a nonlinear region of operation.\n\nAs explained in Sec. 9.9, the large-signal behavior is typically complex, necessitating careful simulations.\n\nThe requirement for large output swings is crucial in many systems that employ op amps. For example, a high-quality microphone sensing the music produced by an orchestra may generate instantaneous voltages that vary by more than four orders of magnitude, necessitating subsequent amplifiers and filters to handle large swings (and/or achieve low noise).\n\nThe demand for large output swings has made fully differential op amps increasingly popular. Similar to the circuits described in Chapter 4, these op amps produce \"complementary\" outputs, effectively doubling the available swing. However, as mentioned in Chapters 3 and 4 and further explained in this chapter, the maximum voltage swing is traded off against device size and bias currents, ultimately affecting speed. Achieving large swings is a primary challenge in contemporary op amp design.\n\nLinearity is another critical aspect. Open-loop op amps are prone to significant nonlinearity. For example, in the circuit of Figure 9.1, the input pair \\(M_{1}-M_{2}\\) exhibits a nonlinear relationship between its differential drain current and input voltage. To address this issue, as explained in Chapter 14, two approaches are employed: using fully differential implementations to suppress even-order harmonics and allowing sufficient open-loop gain for the closed-loop feedback system to achieve acceptable linearity. It is worth noting that in many feedback circuits, the linearity requirement, rather than the gain error requirement, dictates the choice of open-loop gain.\n\nNoise and offset are additional concerns. The input noise and offset of op amps determine the minimum signal level that can be processed with reasonable quality. In a typical op amp topology, several devices contribute noise and offset, requiring larger dimensions or bias currents. For instance, in the circuit of Figure 9.1, \\(M_{1}-M_{2}\\) and \\(M_{7}-M_{8}\\) contribute the most.\n\nA trade-off between noise and output swing also exists. For a given bias current, as the overdrive voltage of \\(M_{7}\\) and \\(M_{8}\\) in Figure 9.1 is reduced to allow larger swings at the output, their transconductance increases, leading to higher drain noise current.\n\nSupply rejection is another important consideration. Op amps are frequently used in mixed-signal systems and may be connected to noisy digital supply lines. Therefore, their performance in the presence of supply noise, particularly as the noise frequency increases, is crucial. For this reason, fully differential topologies are often preferred."

    "text": "The differential amplifiers analyzed in Chapters 4 and 5 are essentially op amps. Figure 9.6 illustrates two topologies with outputs that are either single-ended or differential. The low-frequency, small-signal gain of these circuits is expressed as $g_{m N}\\left(r_{O N} \\| r_{O P}\\right)$, with the subscripts $N$ and $P$ denoting NMOS and PMOS transistors, respectively. In nanometer technologies, this value rarely surpasses 10. The bandwidth is typically governed by the load capacitance, $C_{L}$. It's important to note that the circuit shown in Figure 9.6(a) features a mirror pole (as discussed in Chapter 6), whereas the circuit in Figure 9.6(b) does not, which is a significant distinction affecting the stability of feedback systems that utilize these topologies (as covered in Chapter 10).\n\nFor Figure 9.6(a), the circuit depicted is a straightforward op-amp topology that includes NMOS transistors M1 and M2, PMOS transistors M3 and M4, and a load capacitor CL. The current source ISS is responsible for biasing. This circuit is subject to noise from transistors M1 through M4. The low-frequency gain is determined by the transconductance and output resistances of the NMOS and PMOS transistors. The bandwidth is influenced by the load capacitance CL. This topology exhibits a mirror pole, which has implications for the stability of feedback systems.\n\nFigure 9.6(b) presents a differential amplifier that has two NMOS input transistors (M1 and M2) and two PMOS load transistors (M3 and M4). The circuit has two capacitive loads (CL) at the outputs Vout1 and Vout2. The current source ISS provides the biasing current for the NMOS pair.\n\nIn both circuits of Figure 9.6, noise contributions from $M_{1}-M_{4}$ are present, as detailed in Chapter 7. Notably, in all op amp topologies, at least four devices contribute to the input noise: two input transistors and two \"load\" transistors.\n\n#### Example 9.4\n\nDetermine the input common-mode voltage range and the closed-loop output impedance for the unity-gain buffer shown in Figure 9.7.\n\nFigure 9.7 depicts a unity-gain buffer, which is a specific operational amplifier configuration. The diagram consists of two primary sections: a symbolic representation of the op-amp on the left and a detailed transistor-level representation on the right.\n\n1. **Main Components:**\n- **Operational Amplifier (A1):** The op-amp is shown on the left with its inverting and non-inverting inputs labeled as \\( V_{in} \\) and \\( V_{out} \\), respectively. The output is also labeled \\( V_{out} \\).\n- **Transistors:** On the right, a transistor-level representation is shown with four MOSFETs labeled \\( M_1, M_2, M_3, \\) and \\( M_4 \\). These transistors form the core of the buffer circuit.\n- **Current Source (I_SS):** A current source labeled \\( I_{SS} \\) is connected to the source of \\( M_1 \\) and \\( M_2 \\), providing biasing current to the NMOS pair.\n\n2. **Flow of Information or Control:**\n- **Input Signal (\\( V_{in} \\)):** The input voltage \\( V_{in} \\) is applied to the gate of transistor \\( M_1 \\).\n- **Output Signal (\\( V_{out} \\)):** The output voltage \\( V_{out} \\) is taken from the drain of transistor \\( M_2 \\) and is fed back to the inverting input of the op-amp, forming a feedback loop.\n- **Transistor Connections:**\n- \\( M_1 \\) and \\( M_2 \\) are NMOS transistors forming a differential pair.\n- \\( M_3 \\) and \\( M_4 \\) are PMOS transistors acting as active loads.\n- **Feedback Loop:** The output \\( V_{out} \\) is connected back to the inverting input of the op-amp, ensuring unity gain.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n- **Voltage Supply (\\( V_{DD} = 1V \\)):** The circuit is powered by a supply voltage \\( V_{DD} \\) of 1V.\n- **Transistor Annotations:** The gates of \\( M_3 \\) and \\( M_4 \\) are labeled \\( \\chi_1 \\), indicating control or biasing signals.\n\n4. **Overall System Function:**\n- The unity-gain buffer is designed to provide a high input impedance and low output impedance, effectively isolating the input from the output. The feedback loop ensures that the output voltage \\( V_{out} \\) closely follows the input voltage \\( V_{in} \\), achieving a gain of one. This configuration is useful for buffering signals without amplifying them, maintaining signal integrity across different stages of a circuit.\n\nFor Figure 9.6, the circuit shown is a basic op-amp topology with a differential pair (M1, M2) and active loads (M3, M4). The current source Iss provides biasing current. The op-amp A1 is configured as a unity-gain buffer with feedback from Vout to the inverting input.\n\n#### Solution\n\nThe minimum allowable input voltage is equal to $V_{I S S}+V_{G S 1}$, where $V_{I S S}$ is the voltage required across the current source. The maximum voltage is given by the level that places $M_{1}$ at the edge of the triode region: $V_{i n, \\max }=$ $V_{D D}-\\left|V_{G S 3}\\right|+V_{T H 1}$. For example, if each device (including the current source) has a threshold voltage of 0.3 V and an overdrive of 0.1 V , then $V_{\\text {in,min }}=0.1+0.1+0.3=0.5 \\mathrm{~V}$ and $V_{i n, \\max }=1-(0.1+0.3)+0.3=0.9 \\mathrm{~V}$. Thus, the input CM range equals 0.4 V with a $1-\\mathrm{V}$ supply.\n\nSince the circuit employs voltage feedback at the output, the output impedance is equal to the open-loop value, $r_{O P} \\| r_{O N}$, divided by one plus the loop gain, $1+g_{m N}\\left(r_{O P} \\| r_{O N}\\right)$. In other words, for large open-loop gain, the closed-loop output impedance is approximately equal to $\\left(r_{O P} \\| r_{O N}\\right) /\\left[g_{m N}\\left(r_{O P} \\| r_{O N}\\right)\\right]=1 / g_{m N}$.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the closed-loop output impedance is relatively independent of the open-loop output impedance. This is an important observation, allowing us to design high-gain op amps by increasing the open-loop output impedance while still achieving a relatively low closed-loop output impedance. We also observe that, if driving a load capacitance of $C_{L}$, the op amp incurs a closed-loop output pole approximately given by $g_{m N} / C_{L}$.\n\nTo achieve a high gain, the differential cascode topologies of Chapters 4 and 5 can be used. Shown in Figs. 9.8(a) and (b) for single-ended and differential output generation, respectively, such circuits display a gain on the order of $g_{m N}\\left[\\left(g_{m N} r_{O N}^{2}\\right) \\|\\left(g_{m P} r_{O P}^{2}\\right)\\right]$, but at the cost of output swing and additional poles. These configurations are also called \"telescopic\" cascode op amps to distinguish them from another cascode op amp described below. The circuit providing a single-ended output suffers from a mirror pole at node $X$ (and a pole at $Y$ ), creating stability issues (Chapter 10).\n\nAs calculated in Chapter 4 , the output swings of telescopic op amps are relatively limited. In the fully differential version of Fig. 9.8(b), for example, the output swing is given by $2\\left[V_{D D}-\\left(V_{O D 1}+V_{O D 3}+\\right.\\right.$ $\\left.\\left.V_{I S S}+\\left|V_{O D 5}\\right|+\\left|V_{O D 7}\\right|\\right)\\right]$, where $V_{O D j}$ denotes the overdrive voltage of $M_{j}$ and $V_{I S S}$ the minimum allowable voltage across $I_{S S}$. We must recognize the three conditions necessary for allowing this much swing: (1) the input CM level, $V_{i n, C M}$, is chosen low enough and equal to $V_{G S 1}+V_{I S S}$, (2) $V_{b 1}$ is also chosen low enough and equal to $V_{G S 3}+\\left(V_{i n, C M}-V_{T H 1}\\right)$, placing $M_{1}$ at the edge of saturation, and (3) $V_{b 2}$ is chosen high enough and equal to $V_{D D}-\\left|V_{O D 7}\\right|-\\left|V_{G S 5}\\right|$, placing $M_{7}$ at the edge of saturation. Thus, $V_{i n, C M}$ (and $V_{b 1}$ and $V_{b 2}$ ) must be controlled tightly, a serious issue.\n\nAnother drawback of telescopic cascodes is the difficulty in shorting their inputs and outputs, e.g., to implement a unity-gain buffer similar to the circuit of Fig. 9.7. To understand the issue, let us consider the unity-gain feedback topology shown in Fig. 9.9. Under what conditions are both $M_{2}$ and $M_{4}$ in saturation? We must have $V_{\\text {out }} \\leq V_{X}+V_{T H 2}$ and $V_{\\text {out }} \\geq V_{b}-V_{T H 4}$. Since $V_{X}=V_{b}-V_{G S 4}, V_{b}-V_{T H 4} \\leq$ $V_{\\text {out }} \\leq V_{b}-V_{G S 4}+V_{T H 2}$. Depicted in Fig. 9.9, this voltage range is simply equal to $V_{\\max }-V_{\\min }=$ $V_{T H 4}-\\left(V_{G S 4}-V_{T H 2}\\right)$ (one threshold minus one overdrive), maximized by minimizing the overdrive of $M_{4}$ but always less than $V_{T H 2}$.\n\nFor Figure 9.9, the circuit is a telescopic cascode operational amplifier with input and output shorted. It consists of NMOS transistors M1, M2, M3, and M4, and PMOS transistors M5, M6, M7, and M8. The current source Iss provides biasing for the circuit. The allowable output voltage range is determined by the threshold and overdrive voltages of M4 and M2.\n\nThe graph labeled \"Allowable Range\" is a voltage range diagram associated with a telescopic cascode operational amplifier circuit. The diagram visually represents the permissible output voltage range for which the transistors $M_2$ and $M_4$ operate in saturation.\n\nThis is a range diagram, not a traditional function graph like a Bode plot or time-domain waveform. It illustrates the relationship between different voltage levels in the circuit.\n\nThe diagram does not have explicit axes like a typical graph; instead, it uses horizontal and vertical lines to denote specific voltage levels. The vertical dimension represents voltage levels, but no specific units or scales are marked, as it is a conceptual diagram.\n\nThe diagram shows a vertical range of voltages. It indicates that the allowable range for $V_{\\text{out}}$ is between $V_b - V_{TH4}$ and $V_b$. This range ensures that both $M_2$ and $M_4$ remain in saturation.\n\nKey features include:\n- **Top Boundary:** $V_b$ - This is the maximum voltage level for the output.\n- **Bottom Boundary:** $V_b - V_{TH4}$ - This is the minimum voltage level for the output.\n- **Allowable Range:** The shaded area between these two boundaries represents the range within which $V_{\\text{out}}$ can vary while keeping the transistors in saturation.\n- **Offset:** The distance from $V_b$ to the lower boundary is $V_{TH4}$, which indicates the threshold voltage for $M_4$.\n- **Sub-range:** Within the allowable range, there is a smaller range marked by $V_{GS4} - V_{TH2}$, which indicates the overdrive voltage for $M_4$."

These transistors form the core of the buffer circuit.\n- **Current Source (I_SS):** A current source labeled \\( I_{SS} \\) is connected to the source of \\( M_1 \\) and \\( M_2 \\), providing biasing current to the NMOS pair.\n\n2. **Flow of Information or Control:**\n- **Input Signal (\\( V_{in} \\)):** The input voltage \\( V_{in} \\) is applied to the gate of transistor \\( M_1 \\).\n- **Output Signal (\\( V_{out} \\)):** The output voltage \\( V_{out} \\) is taken from the drain of transistor \\( M_2 \\) and is fed back to the inverting input of the op-amp, forming a feedback loop.\n- **Transistor Connections:**\n- \\( M_1 \\) and \\( M_2 \\) are NMOS transistors forming a differential pair.\n- \\( M_3 \\) and \\( M_4 \\) are PMOS transistors acting as active loads.\n- **Feedback Loop:** The output \\( V_{out} \\) is connected back to the inverting input of the op-amp, ensuring unity gain.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n- **Voltage Supply (\\( V_{DD} = 1V \\)):** The circuit is powered by a supply voltage \\( V_{DD} \\) of 1V.\n- **Transistor Annotations:** The gates of \\( M_3 \\) and \\( M_4 \\) are labeled \\( \\chi_1 \\), indicating control or biasing signals.\n\n4. **Overall System Function:**\n- The unity-gain buffer is designed to offer a high input impedance and low output impedance, effectively isolating the input from the output. The feedback loop ensures that the output voltage \\( V_{out} \\) closely follows the input voltage \\( V_{in} \\), achieving a gain of one. This configuration is beneficial for buffering signals without amplifying them, preserving signal integrity across different stages of a circuit.\n\nFigure 9.7\n\n#### Solution\n\nThe minimum allowable input voltage is equal to $V_{I S S}+V_{G S 1}$, where $V_{I S S}$ is the voltage required across the current source. The maximum voltage is determined by the level that places $M_{1}$ at the edge of the triode region: $V_{i n, \\max }=$ $V_{D D}-\\left|V_{G S 3}\\right|+V_{T H 1}$. For instance, if each device (including the current source) has a threshold voltage of 0.3 V and an overdrive of 0.1 V, then $V_{\\text {in,min }}=0.1+0.1+0.3=0.5 \\mathrm{~V}$ and $V_{i n, \\max }=1-(0.1+0.3)+0.3=0.9 \\mathrm{~V}$. Consequently, the input CM range equals 0.4 V with a $1-\\mathrm{V}$ supply.\n\nSince the circuit employs voltage feedback at the output, the output impedance is equal to the open-loop value, $r_{O P} \\| r_{O N}$, divided by one plus the loop gain, $1+g_{m N}\\left(r_{O P} \\| r_{O N}\\right)$. In simpler terms, for large open-loop gain, the closed-loop output impedance is approximately equal to $\\left(r_{O P} \\| r_{O N}\\right) /\\left[g_{m N}\\left(r_{O P} \\| r_{O N}\\right)\\right]=1 / g_{m N}$.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the closed-loop output impedance is relatively independent of the open-loop output impedance. This is a significant observation, allowing us to design high-gain op amps by increasing the open-loop output impedance while still achieving a relatively low closed-loop output impedance. Additionally, we observe that, if driving a load capacitance of $C_{L}$, the op amp incurs a closed-loop output pole approximately given by $g_{m N} / C_{L}$.\n\nTo achieve a high gain, the differential cascode topologies of Chapters 4 and 5 can be employed. As shown in Figures\nFigure 9.8(a) and (b) for generating single-ended and differential outputs, respectively, such circuits exhibit a gain on the order of $g_{m N}\\left[\\left(g_{m N} r_{O N}^{2}\\right) \\|\\left(g_{m P} r_{O P}^{2}\\right)\\right]$, but at the expense of output swing and additional poles. These configurations are also referred to as \"telescopic\" cascode op amps to differentiate them from another cascode op amp described below. The circuit providing a single-ended output is affected by a mirror pole at node $X$ (and a pole at $Y$), introducing stability concerns (Chapter 10).\n\nAs calculated in Chapter 4, the output swings of telescopic op amps are relatively limited. In the fully differential version of Figure 9.8(b), for example, the output swing is given by $2\\left[V_{D D}-\\left(V_{O D 1}+V_{O D 3}+\\right.\\right.$ $\\left.\\left.V_{I S S}+\\left|V_{O D 5}\\right|+\\left|V_{O D 7}\\right|\\right)\\right]$, where $V_{O D j}$ denotes the overdrive voltage of $M_{j}$ and $V_{I S S}$ the minimum allowable voltage across $I_{S S}$. We must recognize the three conditions necessary for allowing this much swing: (1) the input CM level, $V_{i n, C M}$, is chosen low enough and equal to $V_{G S 1}+V_{I S S}$, (2) $V_{b 1}$ is also chosen low enough and equal to $V_{G S 3}+\\left(V_{i n, C M}-V_{T H 1}\\right)$, placing $M_{1}$ at the edge of saturation, and (3) $V_{b 2}$ is chosen high enough and equal to $V_{D D}-\\left|V_{O D 7}\\right|-\\left|V_{G S 5}\\right|$, placing $M_{7}$ at the edge of saturation. Thus, $V_{i n, C M}$ (and $V_{b 1}$ and $V_{b 2}$) must be tightly controlled, presenting a significant issue.\n\nAnother drawback of telescopic cascodes is the challenge in shorting their inputs and outputs, e.g., to implement a unity-gain buffer similar to the circuit of Figure 9.7. To understand the issue, let us consider the unity-gain feedback topology shown in Figure 9.9. Under what conditions are both $M_{2}$ and $M_{4}$ in saturation? We must have $V_{\\text {out }} \\leq V_{X}+V_{T H 2}$ and $V_{\\text {out }} \\geq V_{b}-V_{T H 4}$. Since $V_{X}=V_{b}-V_{G S 4}, V_{b}-V_{T H 4} \\leq$ $V_{\\text {out }} \\leq V_{b}-V_{G S 4}+V_{T H 2}$. Depicted in Figure 9.9, this voltage range is simply equal to $V_{\\max }-V_{\\min }=$ $V_{T H 4}-\\left(V_{G S 4}-V_{T H 2}\\right)$ (one threshold minus one overdrive), maximized by minimizing the overdrive of $M_{4}$ but always less than $V_{T H 2}$.\n\nThe text descriptions of Figure 9.9 and the \"Allowable Range\" graph depict a telescopic cascode operational amplifier with input and output shorted. It consists of NMOS transistors M1, M2, M3, and M4, and PMOS transistors M5, M6, M7, and M8. The current source Iss provides biasing for the circuit. The allowable output voltage range is determined by the threshold and overdrive voltages of M4 and M2.\n\nThe graph labeled \"Allowable Range\" is a voltage range diagram associated with a telescopic cascode operational amplifier circuit. The diagram visually represents the permissible output voltage range for which the transistors $M_2$ and $M_4$ operate in saturation.\n\nType of Graph:\nThis is a range diagram, not a traditional function graph like a Bode plot or time-domain waveform. It illustrates the relationship between different voltage levels in the circuit.\n\nAxes Labels and Units:\nThe diagram does not have explicit axes like a typical graph; instead, it uses horizontal and vertical lines to denote specific voltage levels. The vertical dimension represents voltage levels, but no specific units or scales are marked, as it is a conceptual diagram.\n\nOverall Behavior and Trends:\nThe diagram shows a vertical range of voltages. It indicates that the allowable range for $V_{\\text{out}}$ is between $V_b - V_{TH4}$ and $V_b$. This range ensures that both $M_2$ and $M_4$ remain in saturation.\n\nKey Features and Technical Details:\n- **Top Boundary:** $V_b$ - This is the maximum voltage level for the output.\n- **Bottom Boundary:** $V_b - V_{TH4}$ - This is the minimum voltage level for the output.\n- **Allowable Range:** The shaded area between these two boundaries represents the range within which $V_{\\text{out}}$ can vary while keeping the transistors in saturation.\n- **Offset:** The distance from $V_b$ to the lower boundary is $V_{TH4}$, which indicates the threshold voltage for $M_4$.\n- **Sub-range:** Within the allowable range, there is a smaller range marked by $V_{GS4} - V_{TH2}$, which indicates the overdrive voltage for $M_4$."

    "text": "---[Rephrased Text]---\n\nAll differential amplifiers analyzed in Chapters 4 and 5 can be categorized as operational amplifiers (op amps). Figure 9.6 illustrates two such configurations with single-ended and differential outputs. Both circuits have a small-signal, low-frequency gain of $g_{m N}(r_{O N} \\| r_{O P})$, where the subscripts $N$ and $P$ denote NMOS and PMOS, respectively. This value rarely surpasses 10 in nanometer technologies. The bandwidth is typically governed by the load capacitance, $C_{L}$. It is worth noting that the circuit in Fig. 9.6(a) exhibits a mirror pole (as discussed in Chapter 6), whereas the circuit in Fig. 9.6(b) does not. This distinction is crucial for the stability of feedback systems employing these configurations (as further explained in Chapter 10).\n\nFigure 9.6(a) depicts a simple op-amp topology with NMOS transistors M1 and M2, PMOS transistors M3 and M4, and a load capacitor CL. The current source ISS provides biasing. The circuit is susceptible to noise contributions from transistors M1 to M4. The low-frequency gain is determined by the transconductance and output resistances of the NMOS and PMOS transistors. The bandwidth is influenced by the load capacitance CL. This topology exhibits a mirror pole, affecting the stability of feedback systems.\n\nFigure 9.6(b) shows a differential amplifier with two NMOS input transistors (M1 and M2) and two PMOS load transistors (M3 and M4). The circuit has two capacitive loads (CL) at the outputs Vout1 and Vout2. The current source ISS provides biasing current to the NMOS pair.\n\nThe circuits in Figure 9.6 are subject to noise contributions from $M_{1}-M_{4}$, as detailed in Chapter 7. Notably, in all op-amp topologies, at least four devices contribute to the input noise: two input transistors and two \"load\" transistors.\n\n#### Example 9.4\n\nCalculate the input common-mode voltage range and the closed-loop output impedance of the unity-gain buffer shown in Fig. 9.7.\n\nFigure 9.7 illustrates a unity-gain buffer, a type of operational amplifier configuration. The diagram consists of two main sections: a symbolic representation of the op-amp on the left and a detailed transistor-level implementation on the right.\n\n1. **Main Components:**\n- **Operational Amplifier (A1):** On the left side, the op-amp is depicted with its inverting and non-inverting inputs labeled as \\( V_{in} \\) and \\( V_{out} \\), respectively. The output is also labeled \\( V_{out} \\).\n- **Transistors:** The right side shows a transistor-level implementation with four MOSFETs labeled \\( M_1, M_2, M_3, \\) and \\( M_4 \\). These transistors form the core of the buffer circuit.\n- **Current Source (I_SS):** A current source labeled \\( I_{SS} \\) is connected to the source of \\( M_1 \\) and \\( M_2 \\), providing biasing current to the NMOS pair.\n\n2. **Flow of Information or Control:**\n- **Input Signal (\\( V_{in} \\)):** The input voltage \\( V_{in} \\) is applied to the gate of transistor \\( M_1 \\).\n- **Output Signal (\\( V_{out} \\)):** The output voltage \\( V_{out} \\) is taken from the drain of transistor \\( M_2 \\) and is fed back to the inverting input of the op-amp, forming a feedback loop.\n- **Transistor Connections:**\n- \\( M_1 \\) and \\( M_2 \\) are NMOS transistors forming a differential pair.\n- \\( M_3 \\) and \\( M_4 \\) are PMOS transistors acting as active loads.\n- **Feedback Loop:** The output \\( V_{out} \\) is connected back to the inverting input of the op-amp, ensuring unity gain.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n- **Voltage Supply (\\( V_{DD} = 1V \\)):** The circuit is powered by a supply voltage \\( V_{DD} \\) of 1V.\n- **Transistor Annotations:** The gates of \\( M_3 \\) and \\( M_4 \\) are labeled \\( \\chi_1 \\), indicating control or biasing signals.\n\n4. **Overall System Function:**\n- The unity-gain buffer is designed to provide a high input impedance and low output impedance, effectively isolating the input from the output. The feedback loop ensures that the output voltage \\( V_{out} \\) closely follows the input voltage \\( V_{in} \\), achieving a gain of one. This configuration is useful for buffering signals without amplifying them, maintaining signal integrity across different stages of a circuit.\n\nFigure 9.7\n\n#### Solution\n\nThe minimum allowable input voltage is equal to $V_{I S S}+V_{G S 1}$, where $V_{I S S}$ is the voltage required across the current source. The maximum voltage is given by the level that places $M_{1}$ at the edge of the triode region: $V_{i n, \\max }=$ $V_{D D}-\\left|V_{G S 3}\\right|+V_{T H 1}$. For example, if each device (including the current source) has a threshold voltage of 0.3 V and an overdrive of 0.1 V , then $V_{\\text {in,min }}=0.1+0.1+0.3=0.5 \\mathrm{~V}$ and $V_{i n, \\max }=1-(0.1+0.3)+0.3=0.9 \\mathrm{~V}$. Thus, the input CM range equals 0.4 V with a $1-\\mathrm{V}$ supply.\n\nSince the circuit employs voltage feedback at the output, the output impedance is equal to the open-loop value, $r_{O P} \\| r_{O N}$, divided by one plus the loop gain, $1+g_{m N}(r_{O P} \\| r_{O N})$. In other words, for large open-loop gain, the closed-loop output impedance is approximately equal to $\\left(r_{O P} \\| r_{O N}\\right) /\\left[g_{m N}(r_{O P} \\| r_{O N})\\right]=1 / g_{m N}$.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the closed-loop output impedance is relatively independent of the open-loop output impedance. This is an important observation, allowing us to design high-gain op amps by increasing the open-loop output impedance while still achieving a relatively low closed-loop output impedance. We also observe that, if driving a load capacitance of $C_{L}$, the op amp incurs a closed-loop output pole approximately given by $g_{m N} / C_{L}$.\n\nIn order to achieve a high gain, the differential cascode topologies of Chapters 4 and 5 can be used. Shown in Figs. 9.8(a) and (b) for single-ended and differential output generation, respectively, such circuits display a gain on the order of $g_{m N}[(g_{m N} r_{O N}^{2}) \\| (g_{m P} r_{O P}^{2})]$, but at the cost of output swing and additional poles. These configurations are also called \"telescopic\" cascode op amps to distinguish them from another cascode op amp described below. The circuit providing a single-ended output suffers from a mirror pole at node $X$ (and a pole at $Y$ ), creating stability issues (Chapter 10).\n\nAs calculated in Chapter 4, the output swings of telescopic op amps are relatively limited. In the fully differential version of Fig. 9.8(b), for example, the output swing is given by $2[V_{D D}-(V_{O D 1}+V_{O D 3}+V_{I S S}+\\left|V_{O D 5}\\right|+\\left|V_{O D 7}\\right|)]$, where $V_{O D j}$ denotes the overdrive voltage of $M_{j}$ and $V_{I S S}$ the minimum allowable voltage across $I_{S S}$. We must recognize the three conditions necessary for allowing this much swing: (1) the input CM level, $V_{i n, C M}$, is chosen low enough and equal to $V_{G S 1}+V_{I S S}$, (2) $V_{b 1}$ is also chosen low enough and equal to $V_{G S 3}+(V_{i n, C M}-V_{T H 1})$, placing $M_{1}$ at the edge of saturation, and (3) $V_{b 2}$ is chosen high enough and equal to $V_{D D}-\\left|V_{O D 7}\\right|-\\left|V_{G S 5}\\right|$, placing $M_{7}$ at the edge of saturation. Thus, $V_{i n, C M}$ (and $V_{b 1}$ and $V_{b 2}$ ) must be controlled tightly, a serious issue.\n\nAnother drawback of telescopic cascodes is the difficulty in shorting their inputs and outputs, e.g., to implement a unity-gain buffer similar to the circuit of Fig. 9.7. To understand the issue, let us consider the unity-gain feedback topology shown in Fig. 9.9. Under what conditions are both $M_{2}$ and $M_{4}$ in saturation? We must have $V_{\\text {out }} \\leq V_{X}+V_{T H 2}$ and $V_{\\text {out }} \\geq V_{b}-V_{T H 4}$. Since $V_{X}=V_{b}-V_{G S 4}, V_{b}-V_{T H 4} \\leq$ $V_{\\text {out }} \\leq V_{b}-V_{G S 4}+V_{T H 2}$. Depicted in Fig. 9.9, this voltage range is simply equal to $V_{\\max }-V_{\\min }=$ $V_{T H 4}-(V_{G S 4}-V_{T H 2})$ (one threshold minus one overdrive), maximized by minimizing the overdrive of $M_{4}$ but always less than $V_{T H 2}$.\n\nFigure 9.9\n\nThe circuit is a telescopic cascode operational amplifier with input and output shorted. It consists of NMOS transistors M1, M2, M3, and M4, and PMOS transistors M5, M6, M7, and M8. The current source Iss provides biasing for the circuit.
