As an electrical engineer, you can contribute to this ongoing technological evolution by enhancing existing systems and innovating new ones to meet the evolving needs of society.\n\nAs you begin your study of circuit analysis, it's essential to understand its place within the broader scope of electrical engineering. We start by providing an overview of electrical engineering, discussing an engineering perspective relevant to circuit analysis, and reviewing the international system of units.\n\nWe then outline the fundamentals of circuit analysis. Following this, we introduce the concepts of voltage and current, and subsequently discuss an ideal basic circuit element and the necessity of a polarity reference system. The chapter concludes by exploring the relationship between current, voltage, power, and energy.\n\nPractical Perspective\n\nBalancing Power\n\nA critical skill you will develop is the ability to verify your circuit design and analysis results using the tools from this text. A common verification method is power balancing in the circuit. The linear circuits we study have no net power, meaning the sum of the power associated with each component must equal zero. If the total power is zero, the power is said to be balanced; if not, errors in the calculations need to be identified.\n\nAs an example, consider a simplified model for electricity distribution in a typical home, as illustrated below. (Note: A more detailed model will be explored in the Practical Perspective for Chapter 9.) Components labeled a and b represent the electrical source. Components c, $d$, and e are the wires delivering current from the source to various home devices. Components f, g, and h represent devices like lamps, televisions, hair dryers, and refrigerators that consume power.\n\nAfter introducing voltage, current, power, and energy, we will analyze this circuit model in detail and use power balancing to verify the accuracy of our analysis.\nimage_name:romakoma / Shutterstock\ndescription:The image is divided into two main sections. On the left, a photograph shows a modern, well-lit house under a twilight sky, featuring multiple gables, large windows, and decorative lighting that accentuates its architectural details.

Over the past century and a half, electrical engineers have been pivotal in developing systems that have transformed how people live and work. Examples include satellite communication links, telephones, digital computers, televisions, medical diagnostic and surgical equipment, assembly-line robots, and electrical power tools—all integral to modern technological society. As an electrical engineer, you can contribute to this ongoing technological revolution by enhancing existing systems and innovating new ones to meet the evolving needs of society.\n\nAs you begin your study of circuit analysis, it's essential to understand its place within the broader scope of electrical engineering. We start by providing an overview of electrical engineering, discussing an engineering perspective relevant to circuit analysis, and reviewing the international system of units.\n\nWe then outline the fundamentals of circuit analysis. Subsequently, we introduce the concepts of voltage and current, followed by a discussion on the ideal basic element and the necessity of a polarity reference system. The chapter concludes by exploring the relationship between current, voltage, power, and energy.\n\nPractical Perspective\n\nBalancing Power\n\nA critical skill you will develop is the ability to verify your circuit design and analysis results using the tools from this text. A common verification method is balancing the power in a circuit. The linear circuits we study have no net power, meaning the sum of power for each component must equal zero. If the total power is zero, the power is considered balanced; if not, errors in the calculations must be identified.\n\nAs an example, we will examine a simple model for electricity distribution in a typical home, as depicted below. (Note: A more detailed model will be explored in the Practical Perspective for Chapter 9.) Components labeled a and b represent the electrical source. Components c, $d$, and e are the wires conveying electrical current from the source to various home devices. Components f, g, and h represent devices like lamps, televisions, hair dryers, and refrigerators that consume power.\n\nOnce we cover voltage, current, power, and energy, we will analyze this circuit model in detail and use power balancing to validate the analysis results.\nimage_name:romakoma / Shutterstock\ndescription:The image is divided into two main sections.

This field merges the principles of natural phenomena as described by physicists with the mathematical tools used by mathematicians to manipulate these phenomena, ultimately creating systems that fulfill practical requirements. Electrical systems are ubiquitous in our daily lives, present in homes, educational institutions, workplaces, and transportation across the globe. This section introduces examples from the five primary categories of electrical systems:\n\n- communication systems\n- computer systems\n- control systems\n- power systems\n- signal-processing systems\n\nWe also discuss how electrical engineers examine and create these systems.\n\nCommunication systems are those that produce, transmit, and disseminate information. Notable examples include television equipment, such as cameras, transmitters, receivers, and video recorders; radio telescopes used for cosmic exploration; satellite systems capturing images of distant planets and Earth; radar systems guiding aircraft flights; and telephone networks.\n\nFigure 1.1 illustrates the key components of a contemporary telephone network. Starting from the left, within a telephone, a microphone converts sound waves into electrical signals. These signals then travel to a switching center, where they are mixed with the signals from numerous other telephones. The combined signals depart the switching center, with their format varying based on the distance they need to travel. In our example, they are conveyed via underground coaxial cables to a microwave transmission station. Here, the signals are converted to microwave frequencies and transmitted through a transmission antenna, over air and space, via a communication satellite, to a receiving antenna. The microwave receiving station converts the microwave signals into a form suitable for continued transmission, possibly as light pulses through fiber-optic cables. Upon reaching the second switching center, the combined signals are separated and directed to the correct telephones. An earphone then serves as a speaker, converting the electrical signals back into sound waves. Throughout the process, electric circuits manipulate the signals. Designing, constructing, and operating these circuits to ensure high-quality connections for the hundreds of thousands of simultaneous calls presents significant challenges.\n\nComputer systems utilize electrical signals to process a wide range of information, from word processing to mathematical calculations. These systems vary in size and power from pocket calculators to personal computers and supercomputers capable of handling complex tasks like processing weather data and simulating the chemical interactions of complex organic molecules. They include networks of microcircuits, or integrated circuits—tiny assemblages of hundreds, thousands, or millions of electrical components often operating at close to the speed of light and within the constraints of thermodynamic laws.\n\nControl systems use electrical signals to manage processes. Instances include the regulation of temperatures, pressures, and flow rates in oil refineries; the fuel-air mixture in fuel-injected automobile engines; elevator mechanisms including motors, doors, and lights; and the locks in the Panama Canal. The autopilot and autolanding systems that assist in the navigation and landing of airplanes are also prime examples of control systems.\n\nPower systems are responsible for the generation and distribution of electric power. As the backbone of our technology-driven society, electric power is typically produced on a large scale by nuclear, hydroelectric, and thermal (coal-, oil-, or gas-powered) generators. It is distributed through a network of conductors that span across the nation. A significant challenge in designing and maintaining such a system is to ensure ample redundancy and control so that the failure of any equipment does not result in entire cities, states, or regions being without power.\n\nSignal-processing systems operate on electrical signals that represent information. They transform these signals and the information they carry into a more suitable form. There are various approaches to processing these signals. For instance, image-processing systems gather vast amounts of data from orbiting weather satellites, reduce the volume of data to a manageable size, and convert the remaining information into video images for evening news broadcasts. A computerized tomography (CT) scan is another example of an image-processing system, utilizing signals generated by an X-ray machine to produce images like those shown in Fig. 1.2. Though the original X-ray signals are of limited use to a physician, when processed into a recognizable image, they can be invaluable for diagnosing illnesses and injuries.\n\nThe engineering disciplines involved in designing and operating these five types of systems interact extensively. Communications engineers employ digital computers to manage the flow of information, with computers incorporating control systems and vice versa. Power systems demand extensive communication systems for the safe and reliable operation of components, potentially spanning continents. Signal-processing systems may involve communication links, computers, and control systems.\n\nA prime illustration of the interplay among these systems is a commercial airplane, such as the one depicted in Fig. 1.3. A sophisticated communication system enables pilots and air traffic controllers to monitor the airplane's location, allowing the controller to establish safe flight paths for nearby aircraft and enabling pilots to maintain their designated route. On the most modern commercial airplanes, an onboard computer system manages engine functions, executes navigation and flight control systems, and generates video information displays in the cockpit. A complex control system in the cockpit uses commands to adjust the airplane's position and speed, delivering the necessary signals to the engines and control surfaces to ensure safe flight and adherence to the intended flight path. The aircraft must have its own power system to remain airborne and supply the electrical power needed for cabin lights, coffee preparation, and movie playback. Signal-processing systems reduce noise in air traffic communications and convert information about the plane's location into a more comprehensible video display for the cockpit. Engineering challenges are vast in the design and integration of these systems into a cohesive unit. For instance, these systems must operate under widely varying and unpredictable environmental conditions. The paramount engineering challenge is to incorporate sufficient redundancy in the designs to ensure passengers safely and promptly reach their destinations.\n\nWhile electrical engineers may focus on a specific domain, they must also have knowledge in related areas that intersect with their area of expertise. This interaction is what makes electrical engineering a challenging and engaging profession. The core of engineering lies in making things function effectively, allowing engineers to employ any technique from any field that aids in accomplishing their objectives.\n\nCircuit Theory\n\nIn the multifaceted field of electrical engineering, one might question if there is any commonality among its various branches. The answer is yes—electric circuits. An electric circuit is a mathematical representation that approximates the behavior of a real electrical system. Therefore, it forms a crucial foundation for understanding how to design and operate systems as discussed earlier. The models, mathematical methodologies, and terminology of circuit theory will provide the intellectual framework for your future engineering endeavors.\n\nThe term \"electric circuit\" is often used to describe both an actual electrical system and the model that represents it. In this text, when we refer to an electric circuit, we are always referring to a model unless specified otherwise. It is the modeling aspect of circuit theory that has extensive applications across different engineering disciplines.\n\nCircuit theory is a specific instance of electromagnetic field theory: the investigation of stationary and moving electric charges. While a more general field theory might seem like an appropriate starting point for examining electric signals, its application is not only complex but also requires advanced mathematics. Thus, a course in electromagnetic field theory is not a prerequisite for comprehending the material in this book. We do, however, assume that you have completed an introductory physics course that covered electrical and magnetic phenomena.\n\nThree fundamental assumptions allow us to utilize circuit theory instead of electromagnetic field theory to study physical systems represented by an electric circuit. These assumptions are:\n\n1. Electrical effects occur instantaneously throughout a system. We can assume this because electric signals travel at or near the speed of light. Thus, if the system is physically small, electric signals move through it so quickly that they can be considered to affect every point simultaneously. Such a system is called a lumped-parameter system.\n\n2. The net charge on every component in the system is always zero. This means no component can accumulate a net excess of charge, although some components, as you will learn later, can store equal but opposite separated charges.\n\n3. There is no magnetic coupling between the components in a system. We will demonstrate later that magnetic coupling can exist within a component.\n\nThese are the only assumptions. Using circuit theory offers simple solutions to problems that would become intractably complex if electromagnetic field theory were employed. These benefits are so significant that engineers sometimes purposefully design electrical systems to ensure these assumptions are met. The significance of assumptions 2 and 3 will become clearer once we introduce the fundamental circuit elements and the rules for analyzing interconnected elements.\n\nHowever, we must closely examine assumption 1. The question is, \"How small does a physical system need to be to qualify as a lumped-parameter system?\" We can address this question by considering that electric signals propagate as wave phenomena. If the wavelength of the signal is much larger than the physical dimensions of the system, it is a lumped-parameter system. The wavelength λ is the velocity divided by the frequency f of the signal; that is, λ=c/f. The frequency f is measured in hertz (Hz). For instance, power systems in the United States operate at 60 Hz. If we use the speed of light (c=3 x 10^8 m/s) as the propagation velocity, the wavelength is 5 x 10^6 m. If the power system of interest is physically smaller than this wavelength, it can be represented as a lumped-parameter system and analyzed using circuit theory. How small is small enough? A good rule is the 1/10th rule: If the dimension of the system is 1/10th (or smaller) of the wavelength, it is a lumped-parameter system. Therefore, as long as the physical dimension of the power system is less than 5 x 10^5 m, it can be treated as a lumped-parameter system.\n\nOn the other hand, the propagation frequency of radio signals is around 10^9 Hz, resulting in a wavelength of 0.3 m. Using the 1/10th rule, the physical dimensions of a communication system that sends or receives radio signals must be less than 3 cm to qualify as a lumped-parameter system. Whenever the relevant physical dimensions of a system under study are close to the wavelength of its signals, electromagnetic field theory must be used to analyze the system. Throughout this book, we study circuits derived from lumped-parameter systems.\n\nProblem Solving\n\nAs a practicing engineer, you will encounter problems that have not yet been solved. Whether you are attempting to enhance the performance of an existing system or developing a new one, you will be dealing with unsolved challenges. As a student, however, much of your focus will be on the analysis of problems that have already been resolved. By examining past solutions, and by solving similar homework and examination problems independently, you will develop the skills necessary to tackle the unsolved problems you will face in your engineering career.\n\nGeneral problem-solving procedures are outlined here. Many of these procedures involve contemplating and organizing your solution strategy before performing calculations.\n\n1. Determine what is known and what needs to be determined. In problem solving, it is essential to know your destination before selecting a route. What is the problem asking you to solve or determine? Sometimes the goal is apparent; other times, you may need to rephrase the problem, create lists or tables of known and unknown information, or clarify your objective.\n\nThe problem statement may include irrelevant information that needs to be excluded before proceeding. Alternatively, it might lack information or present complexities beyond your current solution methods. In such cases, you may need to make assumptions to fill in gaps or simplify the problem. Be prepared to revisit supposedly extraneous information and/or your assumptions if your calculations encounter difficulties or produce an unfeasible answer.\n2. Draw a circuit diagram or another visual representation. Converting a verbal problem description into a visual model can be a helpful step in solving the problem. If a circuit diagram is already present, you might need to add details to it, such as labels, values, or reference directions. You may also choose to redraw the circuit in a simpler, equivalent form. Later in this text, you will learn methods to create such simplified equivalent circuits.\n3. Consider multiple solution methods and decide on the best approach. This course will equip you with a variety of analytical tools, some of which may be effective on a given problem. However, one method may result in fewer equations to solve than another, or it may require algebra instead of calculus to reach a solution. Such efficiencies can significantly streamline calculations if anticipated. Having an alternative method in mind provides a backup if the first attempt stalls.\n4. Compute the solution. Your planning up to this point should help you select an appropriate analytical method and the correct equations for the problem. Now comes the process of solving these equations. Methods such as paper-and-pencil, calculator, and computer-based approaches are all viable for circuit analysis calculations. Efficiency and your instructor's preferences will determine the appropriate tools to use.\n5. Apply creativity. If your solution appears incorrect or if calculations seem endless without progress, it is advisable to pause and consider other options. You may need to revisit your assumptions or switch to a different solution method. Alternatively, you may need to adopt a less conventional problem-solving approach, such as working backward from the solution. This text provides answers to all Assessment Problems and many Chapter Problems so that you may work backward if you encounter difficulties. In the real world, you won't have solutions provided in advance, but you may have a desired outcome in mind to guide your approach. Other creative problem-solving methods include drawing parallels with problems you have successfully resolved, following your instincts or hunches about how to proceed, and temporarily stepping away from the problem to revisit it later.\n6. Verify your solution. Assess whether the solution you have obtained is reasonable. Does the magnitude of the answer seem appropriate? Is the solution feasible physically? You may opt to solve the problem again using a different method. This will not only confirm the accuracy of your original answer but also enhance your intuition about the most efficient solution methods for various types of problems. In practical scenarios, safety-critical designs are always validated through multiple independent means. Developing the habit of verifying your answers is beneficial both as a student and as a practicing engineer.\n\nThese problem-solving steps should not be considered a one-size-fits-all solution to every problem in this or any other course. You may need to skip, rearrange, or elaborate on certain steps to solve a specific problem. Use these steps as a guide to cultivate a problem-solving approach that works for you.\n```\nThe rephrased text:\n```\nThe domain of electrical engineering encompasses the study and advancement of systems designed to produce, convey, and interpret electrical signals.

Designing each system and integrating them into a coherent whole presents engineering challenges, especially ensuring redundancy for safe and timely travel.\n\nElectrical engineers, while specializing in one area, must also understand related fields due to the interconnected nature of these systems, contributing to the profession's complexity and excitement. Engineering focuses on functionality, allowing engineers to use any technique that aids in achieving their goals.\n\nCircuit theory serves as a foundational element across all branches of electrical engineering. An electric circuit is a mathematical model representing an electrical system's behavior, providing a basis for learning system design and operation. Circuit theory is a subset of electromagnetic field theory, dealing with static and moving electric charges. However, circuit theory simplifies the analysis of systems by making three key assumptions: electrical effects occur instantaneously, net charge on components is zero, and there is no magnetic coupling between components.\n\nThe size of a system relative to the wavelength of the signals it handles determines whether it can be treated as a lumped-parameter system, suitable for analysis using circuit theory. If the system's dimensions are small compared to the signal wavelength, circuit theory can be applied. For instance, power systems operating at 60 Hz in the United States have a wavelength of 5 x 10^6 m, meaning systems smaller than 5 x 10^5 m can be analyzed as lumped-parameter systems using circuit theory.\n\nProblem-solving in engineering involves dealing with unsolved issues, whether improving existing systems or creating new ones. As students, focusing on solved problems helps develop the skills needed to tackle real-world challenges. General problem-solving procedures include identifying given and unknown information, sketching visual models, considering multiple solution methods, calculating solutions, using creativity when stuck, and testing solutions for validity.\n\nThese steps serve as a guideline rather than a strict recipe, allowing engineers to develop a problem-solving style that suits them, adapting and modifying the approach as needed for different problems."

It merges the physicist's understanding of natural phenomena with the mathematician's methods to shape these models into practical systems. These electrical systems are ubiquitous in our daily lives, present in homes, schools, workplaces, and transportation. We'll start by showcasing examples from the five primary categories of electrical systems:\n\n- Communication systems\n- Computer systems\n- Control systems\n- Power systems\n- Signal-processing systems\n\nWe'll also explain how electrical engineers analyze and design these systems. Communication systems are responsible for generating, transmitting, and distributing information.

On the left side of the figure, within a telephone, a microphone converts sound waves into electric signals. These signals are transmitted to a switching center, where they're combined with signals from other telephones. The combined signals leave the switching center; their form depends on the distance they must travel. In our example, they're sent through underground coaxial cables to a microwave transmission station. Here, the signals are transformed into microwave frequencies and broadcast from a transmission antenna through air and space, via a communications satellite, to a receiving antenna. The microwave receiving station translates the microwave signals into a form suitable for further transmission, perhaps as light pulses through fiber-optic cable. On arrival at the second switching center, the combined signals are separated, and each is routed to the appropriate telephone, where an earphone acts as a speaker to convert the received electric signals back into sound waves. At each stage of the process, electric circuits operate on the signals. Imagine the challenge involved in designing, building, and operating each circuit in a way that guarantees that all of the hundreds of thousands of simultaneous calls have high-quality connections.\n\nComputer systems use electric signals to process information ranging from word processing to mathematical computations. Systems range in size and power from pocket calculators to personal computers to supercomputers that perform complex tasks such as processing weather data and modeling chemical interactions of complex organic molecules. These systems include networks of microcircuits, or integrated circuits-postage-stampsized assemblies of hundreds, thousands, or millions of electrical components that often operate at speeds and power levels close to fundamental physical limits, including the speed of light and the thermodynamic laws.\n\nControl systems use electric signals to regulate processes. Examples include the control of temperatures, pressures, and flow rates in an oil refinery; the fuel-air mixture in a fuel-injected automobile engine; mechanisms such as the motors, doors, and lights in elevators; and the locks in the Panama Canal. The autopilot and autolanding systems that help to fly and land airplanes are also familiar control systems.\n\nPower systems generate and distribute electric power. Electric power, which is the foundation of our technology-based society, usually is generated in large quantities by nuclear, hydroelectric, and thermal (coal-, oil-, or gas-fired) generators. Power is distributed by a grid of conductors that crisscross the country. A major challenge in designing and operating such a system is to provide sufficient redundancy and control so that failure of any piece of equipment does not leave a city, state, or region completely without power.\n\nSignal-processing systems act on electric signals that represent information. They transform the signals and the information contained in them into a more suitable form. There are many different ways to process the signals and their information. For example, image-processing systems gather massive quantities of data from orbiting weather satellites, reduce the amount of data to a manageable level, and transform the remaining data into a video image for the evening news broadcast. A computerized tomography (CT) scan is another example of an image-processing system. It takes signals generated by a special X-ray machine and transforms them into an image such as the one in Fig. 1.2. Although the original X-ray signals are of little use to a physician, once they are processed into a recognizable image the information they contain can be used in the diagnosis of disease and injury.\n\nConsiderable interaction takes place among the engineering disciplines involved in designing and operating these five classes of systems. Thus communications engineers use digital computers to control the flow of information. Computers contain control systems, and control systems contain computers. Power systems require extensive communications systems to coordinate safely and reliably the operation of components, which may be spread across a continent. A signal-processing system may involve a communications link, a computer, and a control system.\n\nA good example of the interaction among systems is a commercial airplane, such as the one shown in Fig. 1.3. A sophisticated communications system enables the pilot and the air traffic controller to monitor the plane's location, permitting the air traffic controller to design a safe flight path for all of the nearby aircraft and enabling the pilot to keep the plane on its designated path. On the newest commercial airplanes, an onboard computer system is used for managing engine functions, implementing the navigation and flight control systems, and generating video information screens in the cockpit. A complex control system uses cockpit commands to adjust the position and speed of the airplane, producing the appropriate signals to the engines and the control surfaces (such as the wing flaps, ailerons, and rudder) to ensure the plane remains safely airborne and on the desired flight path. The plane must have its own power system to stay aloft and to provide and distribute the electric power needed to keep the cabin lights on, make the coffee, and show the movie. Signal-processing systems reduce the noise in air traffic communications and transform information about the plane's location into the more meaningful form of a video display in the cockpit. Engineering challenges abound in the design of each of these systems and their integration into a coherent whole. For example, these systems must operate in widely varying and unpredictable environmental conditions. Perhaps the most important engineering challenge is to guarantee that sufficient redundancy is incorporated in the designs to ensure that passengers arrive safely and on time at their desired destinations.\n\nAlthough electrical engineers may be interested primarily in one area, they must also be knowledgeable in other areas that interact with this area of interest. This interaction is part of what makes electrical engineering a challenging and exciting profession. The emphasis in engineering is on making things work, so an engineer is free to acquire and use any technique, from any field, that helps to get the job done.\n\nCircuit Theory\n\nIn a field as diverse as electrical engineering, you might well ask whether all of its branches have anything in common. The answer is yes-electric circuits. An electric circuit is a mathematical model that approximates the behavior of an actual electrical system. As such, it provides an important foundation for learning-in your later courses and as a practicing engineer-the details of how to design and operate systems such as those just described. The models, the mathematical techniques, and the language of circuit theory will form the intellectual framework for your future engineering endeavors.\n\nNote that the term electric circuit is commonly used to refer to an actual electrical system as well as to the model that represents it. In this text, when we talk about an electric circuit, we always mean a model, unless otherwise stated. It is the modeling aspect of circuit theory that has broad applications across engineering disciplines.\n\nCircuit theory is a special case of electromagnetic field theory: the study of static and moving electric charges. Although generalized field theory might seem to be an appropriate starting point for investigating electric signals, its application is not only cumbersome but also requires the use of advanced mathematics. Consequently, a course in electromagnetic field theory is not a prerequisite to understanding the material in this book. We do, however, assume that you have had an introductory physics course in which electrical and magnetic phenomena were discussed.\n\nThree basic assumptions permit us to use circuit theory, rather than electromagnetic field theory, to study a physical system represented by an electric circuit. These assumptions are as follows:\n\n1. Electrical effects happen instantaneously throughout a system. We can make this assumption because we know that electric signals travel at or near the speed of light. Thus, if the system is physically small, electric signals move through it so quickly that we can consider them to affect every point in the system simultaneously. A system that is small enough so that we can make this assumption is called a lumped-parameter system.\n2. The net charge on every component in the system is always zero. Thus no component can collect a net excess of charge, although some components, as you will learn later, can hold equal but opposite separated charges.\n3. There is no magnetic coupling between the components in a system. As we demonstrate later, magnetic coupling can occur within a component.\n\nThat's it; there are no other assumptions. Using circuit theory provides simple solutions (of sufficient accuracy) to problems that would become hopelessly complicated if we were to use electromagnetic field theory. These benefits are so great that engineers sometimes specifically design electrical systems to ensure that these assumptions are met. The importance of assumptions 2 and 3 becomes apparent after we introduce the basic circuit elements and the rules for analyzing interconnected elements.\n\nHowever, we need to take a closer look at assumption 1. The question is, \"How small does a physical system have to be to qualify as a lumpedparameter system?\" We can get a quantitative handle on the question by noting that electric signals propagate by wave phenomena. If the wavelength of the signal is large compared to the physical dimensions of the system, we have a lumped-parameter system. The wavelength $\\lambda$ is the velocity divided by the repetition rate, or frequency, of the signal; that is, $\\lambda=c / f$. The frequency $f$ is measured in hertz $(\\mathrm{Hz})$. For example, power systems in the United States operate at 60 Hz . If we use the speed of light $\\left(c=3 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}\\right)$ as the velocity of propagation, the wavelength is $5 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{~m}$. If the power system of interest is physically smaller than this wavelength, we can represent it as a lumped-parameter system and use circuit theory to analyze its behavior. How do we define smaller? A good rule is the rule of $1 / 10$ th: If the dimension of the system is $1 / 10$ th (or smaller) of the dimension of the wavelength, you have a lumped-parameter system. Thus, as long as the physical dimension of the power system is less than $5 \\times 10^{5} \\mathrm{~m}$, we can treat it as a lumped-parameter system.\n\nOn the other hand, the propagation frequency of radio signals is on the order of $10^{9} \\mathrm{~Hz}$. Thus the wavelength is 0.3 m . Using the rule of $1 / 10$ th, the relevant dimensions of a communication system that sends or receives radio signals must be less than 3 cm to qualify as a lumped-parameter system. Whenever any of the pertinent physical dimensions of a system under study approaches the wavelength of its signals, we must use electromagnetic field theory to analyze that system. Throughout this book we study circuits derived from lumped-parameter systems.\n\nProblem Solving\n\nAs a practicing engineer, you will not be asked to solve problems that have already been solved. Whether you are trying to improve the performance of an existing system or creating a new system, you will be working on unsolved problems. As a student, however, you will devote much of your attention to the discussion of problems already solved. By reading about and discussing how these problems were solved in the past, and by solving related homework and exam problems on your own, you will begin to develop the skills to successfully attack the unsolved problems you'll face as a practicing engineer.\n\nSome general problem-solving procedures are presented here. Many of them pertain to thinking about and organizing your solution strategy before proceeding with calculations.\n\n1. Identify what's given and what's to be found. In problem solving, you need to know your destination before you can select a route for getting there. What is the problem asking you to solve or find? Sometimes the goal of the problem is obvious; other times you may need to paraphrase or make lists or tables of known and unknown information to see your objective.\n\nThe problem statement may contain extraneous information that you need to weed out before proceeding. On the other hand, it may offer incomplete information or more complexities than can be handled given the solution methods at your disposal. In that case, you'll need to make assumptions to fill in the missing information or simplify the problem context. Be prepared to circle back and reconsider supposedly extraneous information and/or your assumptions if your calculations get bogged down or produce an answer that doesn't seem to make sense.\n2. Sketch a circuit diagram or other visual model. Translating a verbal problem description into a visual model is often a useful step in the solution process. If a circuit diagram is already provided, you may need to add information to it, such as labels, values, or reference directions. You may also want to redraw the circuit in a simpler, but equivalent, form. Later in this text you will learn the methods for developing such simplified equivalent circuits.\n3. Think of several solution methods and decide on a way of choosing among them. This course will help you build a collection of analytical tools, several of which may work on a given problem. But one method may produce fewer equations to be solved than another, or it may require only algebra instead of calculus to reach a solution. Such efficiencies, if you can anticipate them, can streamline your calculations considerably. Having an alternative method in mind also gives you a path to pursue if your first solution attempt bogs down.\n4. Calculate a solution. Your planning up to this point should have helped you identify a good analytical method and the correct equations for the problem. Now comes the solution of those equations. Paper-and-pencil, calculator, and computer methods are all available for performing the actual calculations of circuit analysis. Efficiency and your instructor's preferences will dictate which tools you should use.\n5. Use your creativity. If you suspect that your answer is off base or if the calculations seem to go on and on without moving you toward a solution, you should pause and consider alternatives. You may need to revisit your assumptions or select a different solution method. Or, you may need to take a less-conventional problem-solving approach, such as working backward from a solution. This text provides answers to all of the Assessment Problems and many of the Chapter Problems so that you may work backward when you get stuck. In the real world, you won't be given answers in advance, but you may have a desired problem outcome in mind from which you can work backward. Other creative approaches include allowing yourself to see parallels with other types of problems you've successfully solved, following your intuition or hunches about how to proceed, and simply setting the problem aside temporarily and coming back to it later.\n6. Test your solution. Ask yourself whether the solution you've obtained makes sense. Does the magnitude of the answer seem reasonable? Is the solution physically realizable? You may want to go further and rework the problem via an alternative method. Doing so will not only test the validity of your original answer, but will also help you develop your intuition about the most efficient solution methods for various kinds of problems. In the real world, safetycritical designs are always checked by several independent means. Getting into the habit of checking your answers will benefit you as a student and as a practicing engineer.\n\nThese problem-solving steps cannot be used as a recipe to solve every problem in this or any other course. You may need to skip, change the order of, or elaborate on certain steps to solve a particular problem. Use these steps as a guideline to develop a problem-solving style that works for you."

The wavelength $\\lambda$ is the velocity divided by the repetition rate, or frequency, of the signal; that is, $\\lambda=c / f$. The frequency $f$ is measured in hertz $(\\mathrm{Hz})$. For example, power systems in the United States operate at 60 Hz . If we use the speed of light $\\left(c=3 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}\\right)$ as the velocity of propagation, the wavelength is $5 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{~m}$. If the power system of interest is physically smaller than this wavelength, we can represent it as a lumped-parameter system and use circuit theory to analyze its behavior. How do we define smaller? A good rule is the rule of $1 / 10$ th: If the dimension of the system is $1 / 10$ th (or smaller) of the dimension of the wavelength, you have a lumped-parameter system. Thus, as long as the physical dimension of the power system is less than $5 \\times 10^{5} \\mathrm{~m}$, we can treat it as a lumped-parameter system.\n\nOn the other hand, the propagation frequency of radio signals is on the order of $10^{9} \\mathrm{~Hz}$. Thus the wavelength is 0.3 m . Using the rule of $1 / 10$ th, the relevant dimensions of a communication system that sends or receives radio signals must be less than 3 cm to qualify as a lumped-parameter system. Whenever any of the pertinent physical dimensions of a system under study approaches the wavelength of its signals, we must use electromagnetic field theory to analyze that system. Throughout this book we study circuits derived from lumped-parameter systems.\n\nProblem Solving\n\nAs a practicing engineer, you will not be asked to solve problems that have already been solved. Whether you are trying to improve the performance of an existing system or creating a new system, you will be working on unsolved problems. As a student, however, you will devote much of your attention to the discussion of problems already solved. By reading about and discussing how these problems were solved in the past, and by solving related homework and exam problems on your own, you will begin to develop the skills to successfully attack the unsolved problems you'll face as a practicing engineer.\n\nSome general problem-solving procedures are presented here. Many of them pertain to thinking about and organizing your solution strategy before proceeding with calculations.\n\n1. Identify what's given and what's to be found. In problem solving, you need to know your destination before you can select a route for getting there. What is the problem asking you to solve or find? Sometimes the goal of the problem is obvious; other times you may need to paraphrase or make lists or tables of known and unknown information to see your objective.\n\nThe problem statement may contain extraneous information that you need to weed out before proceeding. On the other hand, it may offer incomplete information or more complexities than can be handled given the solution methods at your disposal. In that case, you'll need to make assumptions to fill in the missing information or simplify the problem context. Be prepared to circle back and reconsider supposedly extraneous information and/or your assumptions if your calculations get bogged down or produce an answer that doesn't seem to make sense.\n2. Sketch a circuit diagram or other visual model. Translating a verbal problem description into a visual model is often a useful step in the solution process. If a circuit diagram is already provided, you may need to add information to it, such as labels, values, or reference directions. You may also want to redraw the circuit in a simpler, but equivalent, form. Later in this text you will learn the methods for developing such simplified equivalent circuits.\n3. Think of several solution methods and decide on a way of choosing among them. This course will help you build a collection of analytical tools, several of which may work on a given problem. But one method may produce fewer equations to be solved than another, or it may require only algebra instead of calculus to reach a solution. Such efficiencies, if you can anticipate them, can streamline your calculations considerably. Having an alternative method in mind also gives you a path to pursue if your first solution attempt bogs down.\n4. Calculate a solution. Your planning up to this point should have helped you identify a good analytical method and the correct equations for the problem. Now comes the solution of those equations. Paper-and-pencil, calculator, and computer methods are all available for performing the actual calculations of circuit analysis. Efficiency and your instructor's preferences will dictate which tools you should use.\n5. Use your creativity. If you suspect that your answer is off base or if the calculations seem to go on and on without moving you toward a solution, you should pause and consider alternatives. You may need to revisit your assumptions or select a different solution method. Or, you may need to take a less-conventional problem-solving approach, such as working backward from a solution. This text provides answers to all of the Assessment Problems and many of the Chapter Problems so that you may work backward when you get stuck. In the real world, you won't be given answers in advance, but you may have a desired problem outcome in mind from which you can work backward. Other creative approaches include allowing yourself to see parallels with other types of problems you've successfully solved, following your intuition or hunches about how to proceed, and simply setting the problem aside temporarily and coming back to it later.\n6. Test your solution. Ask yourself whether the solution you've obtained makes sense. Does the magnitude of the answer seem reasonable? Is the solution physically realizable? You may want to go further and rework the problem via an alternative method. Doing so will not only test the validity of your original answer, but will also help you develop your intuition about the most efficient solution methods for various kinds of problems. In the real world, safetycritical designs are always checked by several independent means. Getting into the habit of checking your answers will benefit you as a student and as a practicing engineer.\n\nThese problem-solving steps cannot be used as a recipe to solve every problem in this or any other course. You may need to skip, change the order of, or elaborate on certain steps to solve a particular problem. Use these steps as a guideline to develop a problem-solving style that works for you."

The field merges the physicist's understanding of natural occurrences with the mathematician's expertise in manipulating these models to build practical solutions.

Electric circuits operate on the signals at each stage, presenting a significant challenge in designing and operating each circuit to ensure high-quality connections for simultaneous calls.\n\nComputer systems use electric signals to process information, ranging from word processing to mathematical computations. These systems vary in size and power, from pocket calculators to supercomputers that perform complex tasks such as processing weather data and modeling chemical interactions. They consist of networks of microcircuits or integrated circuits, which often operate at speeds and power levels close to fundamental physical limits.\n\nControl systems use electric signals to regulate processes, such as temperature, pressure, and flow rate in an oil refinery, fuel-air mixture in a fuel-injected automobile engine, mechanisms in elevators, and locks in the Panama Canal. Autopilot and autolanding systems in airplanes are also examples of control systems.\n\nPower systems generate and distribute electric power, usually generated in large quantities by nuclear, hydroelectric, and thermal generators. Power is distributed through a grid of conductors that span the country. Designing and operating such systems require providing sufficient redundancy and control to prevent equipment failure from causing widespread power outages.\n\nSignal-processing systems act on electric signals that represent information, transforming them into a more suitable form. Image-processing systems, for example, gather data from weather satellites, reduce the data to a manageable level, and transform it into video images for news broadcasts. A CT scan is another example of an image-processing system, taking signals from a special X-ray machine and transforming them into diagnostic images.\n\nThe engineering disciplines involved in designing and operating these systems interact significantly. Communications engineers use digital computers to control information flow, and computers contain control systems. Power systems require extensive communications systems to coordinate the operation of components. A signal-processing system may involve a communications link, a computer, and a control system.\n\nA commercial airplane exemplifies the interaction among systems. A sophisticated communications system enables pilots and air traffic controllers to monitor the plane's location and ensure safe flight paths. Onboard computer systems manage engine functions, navigation, and flight control systems. A complex control system adjusts the plane's position and speed, ensuring safe flight. The plane also has its own power system to provide electric power for cabin lights, coffee, and in-flight entertainment. Signal-processing systems reduce noise in air traffic communications and transform location information into video displays in the cockpit. Designing these systems and integrating them into a coherent whole presents engineering challenges, particularly ensuring sufficient redundancy for safe and timely passenger travel.\n\nElectrical engineers specialize in one area but must also be knowledgeable in related fields. This interaction makes electrical engineering a challenging and exciting profession, focusing on making things work and using techniques from any field to achieve this goal.\n\nCircuit Theory\n\nElectrical engineering's various branches share a common foundation: electric circuits. An electric circuit is a mathematical model that approximates the behavior of an actual electrical system, providing an essential foundation for learning how to design and operate systems. The models, mathematical techniques, and language of circuit theory form the intellectual framework for engineering endeavors.\n\nElectric circuits are used to refer to both actual electrical systems and their models. In this text, an electric circuit refers to a model unless otherwise stated. Circuit theory's modeling aspect has broad applications across engineering disciplines.\n\nCircuit theory is a special case of electromagnetic field theory, which studies static and moving electric charges. Although electromagnetic field theory might seem like a logical starting point for investigating electric signals, its application is complex and requires advanced mathematics. An introductory physics course discussing electrical and magnetic phenomena is sufficient to understand the material in this book.\n\nThree assumptions allow us to use circuit theory to study a physical system represented by an electric circuit:\n\n1. Electrical effects happen instantaneously throughout a system. This assumption is valid because electric signals travel at or near the speed of light. If the system is physically small, electric signals move through it quickly, affecting every point simultaneously. Such a system is called a lumped-parameter system.\n2. The net charge on every component in the system is always zero. No component can accumulate a net excess of charge, although some components can hold equal but opposite separated charges.\n3. There is no magnetic coupling between the components in a system. Magnetic coupling can occur within a component.\n\nUsing circuit theory provides simple solutions (of sufficient accuracy) to problems that would become overly complex if solved using electromagnetic field theory. Engineers sometimes design electrical systems to ensure these assumptions are met. The importance of assumptions 2 and 3 becomes apparent after introducing basic circuit elements and rules for analyzing interconnected elements.\n\nWe need to examine assumption 1 more closely. The question is, \"How small does a physical system have to be to qualify as a lumped-parameter system?\" Electric signals propagate by wave phenomena. If the wavelength of the signal is large compared to the physical dimensions of the system, we have a lumped-parameter system. The wavelength λ is the velocity divided by the repetition rate or frequency of the signal, i.e., λ=c / f. The frequency f is measured in hertz (Hz). For example, power systems in the United States operate at 60 Hz. Using the speed of light (c=3 x 10^8 m/s) as the velocity of propagation, the wavelength is 5 x 10^6 m. If the power system of interest is physically smaller than this wavelength, we can represent it as a lumped-parameter system and use circuit theory to analyze its behavior. A good rule is the rule of 1/10th: If the dimension of the system is 1/10th (or smaller) of the dimension of the wavelength, you have a lumped-parameter system. Thus, as long as the physical dimension of the power system is less than 5 x 10^5 m, we can treat it as a lumped-parameter system.\n\nOn the other hand, the propagation frequency of radio signals is on the order of 10^9 Hz. Thus the wavelength is 0.3 m. Using the rule of 1/10th, the relevant dimensions of a communication system that sends or receives radio signals must be less than 3 cm to qualify as a lumped-parameter system. Whenever any of the pertinent physical dimensions of a system under study approaches the wavelength of its signals, we must use electromagnetic field theory to analyze that system. Throughout this book, we study circuits derived from lumped-parameter systems.\n\nProblem Solving\n\nAs a practicing engineer, you will not be asked to solve problems that have already been solved.

Contemporary engineering is a multifaceted discipline where collaborative teams of engineers converge on projects, and effective communication of their findings hinges on the uniformity of measurement units.

Standard prefixes corresponding to powers of 10, as delineated in Table 1.3, are then appended to the basic unit. All these prefixes are valid, but engineers typically favor those corresponding to powers divisible by 3; hence, centi, deci, deka, and hecto are seldom used. Moreover, engineers often choose the prefix that situates the base number within the 1 to 1000 range. For instance, if a time calculation yields $10^{-5} \\mathrm{~s}$, or 0.00001 s, most engineers would express this as $10 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$, translating to $10^{-5} = 10 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{~s}$, rather than 0.01 ms or $10,000,000 \\mathrm{ps}$.\n\nTABLE 1.2 Derived Units in SI\n\n| Quantity | Unit Name (Symbol) | Formula |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Frequency | hertz $(\\mathrm{Hz})$ | $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ |\n| Force | newton $(\\mathrm{N})$ | $\\mathrm{kg} \\cdot \\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$ |\n| Energy or work | joule $(\\mathrm{J})$ | $\\mathrm{N} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}$ |\n| Power | watt $(\\mathrm{W})$ | $\\mathrm{J} / \\mathrm{s}$ |\n| Electric charge | $\\operatorname{coulomb}(\\mathrm{C})$ | $\\mathrm{A} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}$ |\n| Electric potential | $\\operatorname{volt}(\\mathrm{V})$ | $\\mathrm{J} / \\mathrm{C}$ |\n| Electric resistance | ohm $(\\Omega)$ | $\\mathrm{V} / \\mathrm{A}$ |\n| Electric conductance | $\\operatorname{siemens}(\\mathrm{S})$ | $\\mathrm{A} / \\mathrm{V}$ |\n| Electric capacitance | farad $(\\mathrm{F})$ | $\\mathrm{C} / \\mathrm{V}$ |\n| Magnetic flux | weber $(\\mathrm{Wb})$ | $\\mathrm{V} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}$ |\n| Inductance | henry $(\\mathrm{H})$ | $\\mathrm{Wb} / \\mathrm{A}$ |\n\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 330, 2008 Edition, Natl.

    "text": "An optimal fundamental circuit element possesses three characteristics: (1) it features two terminals for connecting to other circuit components; (2) it is mathematically characterized by current and/or voltage; and (3) it cannot be broken down into simpler elements. The term \"ideal\" signifies that such a basic circuit element does not exist as a tangible physical component. Nevertheless, as discussed in Section 1.3, ideal elements can be combined to model real devices and systems. The term \"basic\" indicates that the circuit element cannot be further simplified or divided into other elements. Thus, these basic circuit elements serve as the foundational building blocks for constructing circuit models, but they themselves cannot be modeled using any other type of element.\n\nFigure 1.5 illustrates an ideal basic circuit element. The blank box signifies that we are not specifying the type of circuit element at this point. In this figure, the voltage across the box's terminals is represented by $v$, and the current through the element is denoted by $i$. The voltage polarity reference is indicated by the plus and minus signs, while the current reference direction is shown by the arrow next to the current. The interpretation of these references based on positive or negative values of $v$ and $i$ is outlined in Table 1.4. Note that, algebraically, the concept of positive charge flowing in one direction is equivalent to negative charge flowing in the opposite direction.\n\nThe assignment of reference polarity for voltage and reference direction for current is entirely arbitrary. However, once these references are set, all subsequent equations must align with the chosen references. The most widely adopted sign convention for these references is the passive sign convention, which we employ throughout this book. The passive sign convention is defined as follows:\n\nWhen the reference direction for current in an element aligns with the reference voltage drop across the element (as depicted in Fig. 1.5), use a positive sign in any expression relating voltage to current. Otherwise, use a negative sign.\n\nWe apply this sign convention in all subsequent analyses. Our rationale for introducing it before discussing the various types of basic circuit elements is to emphasize that the selection of polarity references and the adoption of the passive sign convention are independent of the basic elements and their interconnections.

    "text": "In circuit analysis, the consideration of power and energy figures prominently. This is due, in part, to the fact that while voltage and current are fundamental in the study and development of electrical systems, the system's actual output is often non-electrical. This non-electrical output is conveniently represented using units of power or energy. Moreover, practical devices have limits to the power they can handle, necessitating that voltage and current calculations alone are inadequate during the design phase.\n\nThe relationship between power and energy is closely tied to voltage and current, with power calculations also serving to demonstrate the passive sign convention. As per fundamental physics, power is the rate at which energy is either expended or absorbed over time. For instance, a water pump with a 75 kW rating can deliver more volume of water per second than one with a 7.5 kW rating. Mathematically, the energy per unit time is represented as a derivative, as shown:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np=\\frac{d w}{d t} \\tag{1.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\np & =\\text { the power in watts } \\\\\nw & =\\text { the energy in joules } \\\\\ni & =\\text { the time in seconds. }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, 1 W is equivalent to $1 \\mathrm{~J} / \\mathrm{s}$.\n\nThe power associated with the flow of charge can be derived directly from the definitions of voltage and current given in Eqs. 1.1 and 1.2. Using the derived relationship, we have:\n\n$$\np=\\frac{d w}{d t}=\\left(\\frac{d w}{d q}\\right)\\left(\\frac{d q}{d t}\\right)\n$$\n\nThis leads to:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np=v i \\tag{1.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\np & =\\text { the power in watts, } \\\\\nv & =\\text { the voltage in volts, } \\\\\ni & =\\text { the current in amperes. }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nEquation 1.4 indicates that the power associated with a basic circuit component is simply the product of the current through the component and the voltage across it. Consequently, power is a quantity associated with a pair of terminals, and it is essential to be able to discern from calculations whether power is being delivered to or extracted from the terminals. This information is derived from the correct application and interpretation of the passive sign convention.\n\nWhen employing the passive sign convention, Eq. 1.4 is correct if the reference direction for the current aligns with the reference voltage drop across the terminals. If not, Eq. 1.4 must be adjusted with a negative sign. In other words, if the current reference is in the direction of a reference voltage rise across the terminals, the power expression becomes:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np=-v i \\tag{1.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe algebraic sign of power is based on the movement of charge through voltage drops and rises. As positive charges pass through a voltage drop, they lose energy, and as they move through a voltage rise, they gain energy. Figure 1.6 encapsulates the relationship between the voltage and current polarity references and the power expression.\n\nIn Figure 1.6, the diagram labeled (a) illustrates a basic electrical circuit component as a box with two terminals, numbered 1 and 2. This diagram emphasizes the relationship between current, voltage, and power. Key aspects of the diagram are:\n\n1. **Main Components:**\n   - The diagram features a box symbolizing an electrical component or system with two terminals.\n   - The terminals are numbered 1 and 2, signifying input and output connections.\n\n2. **Flow of Information or Control:**\n   - Current (i) enters the box at terminal 1 and exits at terminal 2, as indicated by an arrow.\n   - Voltage (v) is applied across the terminals, with the positive side at terminal 1 and the negative side at terminal 2.\n   - The current direction and voltage polarity align, indicating current enters through the positive voltage terminal.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n   - Voltage is marked with a plus (+) at terminal 1 and a minus (-) at terminal 2, signifying polarity.\n   - Current is labeled with an arrow pointing from terminal 1 to terminal 2.\n   - The power expression is given as \\( p = vi \\), suggesting that power is being delivered to the circuit within the box as the product of voltage and current is positive.\n\n4. **Overall System Function:**\n   - This configuration represents a scenario where power is delivered to the component within the box. The alignment of current direction and voltage polarity results in positive power, indicating energy is being supplied to the system, which is typical of a load receiving power.\n\nSimilarly, Figure 1.6(b) and (c) depict systems where the current flows into the positive terminal of a two-terminal element, and the voltage across the terminals is labeled with a positive sign on the same side as the current entry. These configurations indicate that the power expression for this setup is \\( p = -vi \\), signifying that power is being extracted from the circuit.\n\nFigure 1.6(d) illustrates the relationship between voltage polarity, current direction, and the power expression in an electrical circuit. The diagram consists of a simple block representing a circuit element with two terminals labeled 1 and 2. Key components and functions are:\n\n1. **Main Components:**\n   - **Circuit Element Block:** A grey box with two terminals labeled 1 and 2, symbolizing a generic circuit component.\n\n2. **Flow of Information or Control:**\n   - **Voltage (v):** The voltage across the terminals is shown with the positive sign at terminal 2 (where the current enters) and the negative sign at terminal 1.\n   - **Current (i):** The current direction is indicated by an arrow pointing from terminal 1 to terminal 2.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n   - The voltage and current are labeled with their respective symbols (v and i), and the current direction is indicated by an arrow.\n   - The power expression for this configuration is \\( p = vi \\), indicating power delivery to the circuit element.\n\n4. **Overall System Function:**\n   - This diagram represents a scenario where the current flows into the positive voltage terminal. The positive power calculated in \\( p = vi \\) indicates power delivery to the circuit element.\n\nFigure 1.6 summarizes the relationship between the polarity references for voltage and current and the power expression.\n\nThe rule for interpreting the algebraic sign of power is now clear: If the power is positive (i.e., \\( p > 0 \\)), power is being delivered to the circuit inside the box. If the power is negative (i.e., \\( p < 0 \\)), power is being extracted from the circuit inside the box.\n\nAn example demonstrates this principle with numerical values. Consider the following scenario:\n\nGiven the polarity references in Figure 1.6(b) and calculated values for current and voltage:\n\n$$\ni=4 \\mathrm{~A} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad v=-10 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nThe power associated with the terminal pair 1,2 is calculated as:\n\n$$\np=-(-10)(4)=40 \\mathrm{~W}\n$$\n\nThis indicates that the circuit inside the box is absorbing 40 W.\n\nAn alternative approach to the problem, considering the polarity references in Figure 1.6(c), yields the same result, further confirming that the circuit inside the box is absorbing 40 W.\n\nExample 1.3 demonstrates the relationship between voltage, current, power, and energy for an ideal basic circuit element, using the passive sign convention. This example shows the application of the passive sign convention and the interpretation of power in circuit analysis.\n\n## Assessment Problems\n\nObjective 3 involves understanding and using the definitions of power and energy. Objective 4 is about being able to use the passive sign convention. Problem 1.5 asks to specify the values of \\(v\\) and \\(i\\) for the polarity references shown in Figures 1.6(a)-(d), state whether the circuit inside the box is absorbing or delivering power, and calculate the power absorbed.\n\nAnswer: For Figures 1.6(a)-(d):\n- Circuit 1.6(a): \\(v=-20 \\mathrm{~V}, i=-4 \\mathrm{~A}\\); circuit 1.6(b): \\(v=-20 \\mathrm{~V}, i=4 \\mathrm{~A}\\); circuit 1.6(c): \\(v=20 \\mathrm{~V}, i=-4 \\mathrm{~A}\\); circuit 1.6(d): \\(v=20 \\mathrm{~V}, i=4 \\mathrm{~A}\\).\n- The circuit inside the box is absorbing power in all cases.\n- The power absorbed is 80 W in all scenarios.\n\nProblem 1.6 asks to find the time when the power delivered to the circuit element is maximum, the maximum value of power, and the total energy delivered.\n\nAnswer: \n- The maximum power is at 2 ms.\n- The maximum power value is 649.6 mW.\n- The total energy delivered is 2.4 mJ.\n\nProblem 1.7 involves calculating the power (in megawatts) at the Oregon end of a high-voltage direct-current (dc) transmission line and stating the direction of power flow.\n\nAnswer: The power at the Oregon end of the line is 1440 MW, and the direction of power flow is from Celilo, Oregon, to Sylmar, California.\n\n## Practical Perspective\n\nThe chapter also discusses practical applications, such as the power distribution to a typical home. By analyzing the voltages and currents and applying the passive sign convention, one can determine the power associated with each component and ensure that the power balance is achieved.\n\nIn Table 1.4, voltage and current values for a circuit in Figure 1.7 are provided. Using these values and the passive sign convention, the power associated with each component is calculated. The analysis of the power for each component and the balance of total power supplied and absorbed can identify errors in the circuit if any. This practical example emphasizes the importance of accurately applying circuit analysis principles in real-world scenarios."

Ensure the revised text retains the original meaning and length. Your response should consist solely of the rephrased text.\n---[Context Provided]---\nThe rephrased text:\n```\nIn the realm of circuit analysis, power and energy computations hold significant importance. A key factor is that while voltage and current are instrumental in the study and design of electrical systems, the actual output of the system is typically non-electrical, and this output is conveniently described using power or energy metrics. Furthermore, all real-world devices have limits on the maximum power they can handle. Consequently, during the design phase, voltage and current calculations alone are inadequate.\n\nWe subsequently connect power and energy to voltage and current while simultaneously employing power calculations to exemplify the passive sign convention. Recall from the fundamentals of physics that power represents the rate at which energy is consumed or absorbed over time. (A 75 kW water pump can deliver more water per second than a 7.5 kW pump.) Mathematically, energy per unit time is represented as a derivative, as shown:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np=\\frac{d w}{d t} \\tag{1.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\np & =\\text { the power in watts } \\\\\nw & =\\text { the energy in joules } \\\\\ni & =\\text { the time in seconds. }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHence, 1 W is equal to 1 J/s.\n\nThe power associated with the movement of charge is directly derived from the definitions of voltage and current as stated in Eqs. 1.1 and 1.2, which yields\n\n$$\np=\\frac{d w}{d t}=\\left(\\frac{d w}{d q}\\right)\\left(\\frac{d q}{d t}\\right)\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np=v i \\tag{1.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\np & =\\text { the power in watts, } \\\\\nv & =\\text { the voltage in volts, } \\\\\ni & =\\text { the current in amperes. }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nEquation 1.4 illustrates that the power associated with a fundamental circuit component is merely the product of the current flowing through the component and the voltage applied across it. Consequently, power is a quantity associated with a pair of terminals, and it is essential to discern from our calculations whether power is being supplied to or extracted from the terminals. This insight is derived from the proper application and interpretation of the passive sign convention.\n\nBy adhering to the passive sign convention, Eq. 1.4 is accurate if the reference direction for the current aligns with the reference voltage drop across the terminals. Conversely, Eq. 1.4 must be expressed with a negative sign. In other words, if the current reference flows in the direction of a voltage rise across the terminals, the power expression becomes\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np=-v i \\tag{1.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe algebraic sign of power is determined by the movement of charge through voltage drops and rises. When positive charges traverse a voltage drop, they lose energy, and when they traverse a voltage rise, they gain energy. Figure 1.6 summarizes the relationship between the polarity references for voltage and current and the expression for power.\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:Figure (a) depicts a block diagram labeled \"(a)\" that illustrates a basic electrical circuit component, symbolized as a box with two terminals, numbered 1 and 2. The diagram's primary objective is to demonstrate the relationship among current, voltage, and power.\n\n1. **Principal Components:**\n- The diagram comprises a single box that symbolizes an electrical component or system, featuring two terminals identified as 1 and 2.\n- The terminals are marked numerically, with 1 and 2 signifying input and output connections.\n\n2. **Information or Control Flow:**\n- The current (i) is depicted entering the box at terminal 1 and exiting at terminal 2, with the direction indicated by an arrow.\n- The voltage (v) is applied across the terminals, with the positive side connected to terminal 1 and the negative side to terminal 2.\n- The alignment of current direction and voltage polarity indicates that the current enters the positive voltage terminal.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n- The voltage is marked with a plus (+) sign at terminal 1 and a minus (-) sign at terminal 2, indicating the polarity.\n- The current is marked with an arrow pointing from terminal 1 to terminal 2.\n- The power expression is given as \\( p = vi \\), indicating that power is being delivered to the circuit within the box because the product of voltage and current is positive.\n\n4. **Overall System Function:**\n- This configuration represents a situation where power is being supplied to the component inside the box. The alignment of current direction and voltage polarity suggests positive power, signifying energy supply to the system. This is a standard representation of a load receiving power.\nimage_name:(b)\ndescription:Figure (b) in Figure 1.6 presents a system where the current (i) flows into the positive terminal of a two-terminal element, and the voltage (v) across the terminals is marked with a positive sign on the same side as the current entry. This configuration signifies that the power expression for this setup is \\( p = -vi \\).\n\nMain Components:\n1. **Two-Terminal Element:**\n- The diagram features a block symbolizing an electrical component with two terminals labeled 1 and 2. The specific function of the component is not detailed, but it could represent any general two-terminal device, such as a resistor, capacitor, or battery.\n\nFlow of Information or Control:\n- **Current Flow (i):** The current is depicted entering terminal 1 of the block and exiting terminal 2. The direction of the current is indicated by an arrow pointing towards the block.\n- **Voltage (v):** The voltage across the terminals is indicated with a positive sign at terminal 1 (where the current enters) and a negative sign at terminal 2.\n\nLabels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:\n- The diagram is annotated with the expression \\( p = -vi \\), indicating the power is negative, meaning power is being extracted from the circuit within the box.\n- Terminals are labeled as 1 and 2 for reference.\n\nOverall System Function:\n- The primary function of this diagram is to exhibit the relationship between current direction, voltage polarity, and power calculation in a two-terminal element. In this configuration, since the power \\( p = -vi \\), it implies that the circuit within the block is delivering power to an external circuit or load. This is a common scenario for a power supply or energy source that supplies power to the rest of the circuit.\nimage_name:(c)\ndescription:Figure (c) illustrates a system block diagram labeled \"(c)\" that depicts a simple electrical circuit with a focus on the voltage polarity and the direction of current flow, which influences the power calculation.\n\n1. **Main Components:**\n- The diagram includes a rectangular block symbolizing a circuit element with two terminals labeled \"1\" and \"2.\"\n- Voltage and current are the main depicted elements, with specific polarity and direction.\n\n2. **Flow of Information or Control:**\n- The voltage across the terminals is labeled with a negative sign at the top and a positive sign at the bottom, indicating a voltage rise from terminal 2 to terminal 1.\n- The current \"i\" is shown flowing into terminal 1 and out of terminal 2, represented by an arrow pointing from left to right.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n- The voltage is denoted by \"v\" with polarity indicators showing a negative to positive rise.\n- The current \"i\" is indicated with an arrow and labeled accordingly.\n- The power expression for this configuration is given as \\( p = -vi \\), reflecting the relationship between voltage polarity and current direction.\n\n4. **Overall System Function:**\n- This configuration highlights the scenario where power is being extracted from the circuit inside the box. The negative sign in the power expression \\( p = -vi \\) suggests that the direction of current and the polarity of voltage result in energy being drawn from the circuit element. This aligns with the rule that if the power is negative, energy is being extracted from the circuit.\nimage_name:(d)\ndescription:Figure (d) illustrates the relationship between voltage polarity, current direction, and power expression in an electrical circuit. The diagram features a simple block representing a circuit element with two terminals labeled 1 and 2. The key components and their functions are as follows:\n\n1. **Main Components:**\n- **Circuit Element Block:** A grey box with two terminals labeled 1 and 2, representing a generic circuit component.\n\n2. **Flow of Information or Control:**\n- **Voltage (v):** The voltage across the terminals is indicated by the polarity signs. In this diagram, the positive sign is at terminal 2, and the negative sign is at terminal 1, meaning the voltage rises from terminal 1 to terminal 2.\n- **Current (i):** The current direction is shown by an arrow pointing from terminal 1 to terminal 2. This indicates that the current flows into terminal 1 and out of terminal 2.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n- **Polarity and Direction:** The voltage and current are labeled with their respective symbols (v and i), and the direction of current flow is indicated by an arrow.\n- **Power Expression:** The expression for power in this configuration is given as \\( p = vi \\), suggesting that power is being delivered to the circuit element (since p is positive).\n\n4. **Overall System Function:**\n- The primary function of this diagram is to illustrate how the polarity of voltage and the direction of current affect the calculation of power in a circuit. In this specific configuration, with the voltage rising from terminal 1 to 2 and current flowing in the same direction, the power calculated is positive, indicating power delivery to the circuit element. This aligns with the rule that when both voltage rise and current flow are in the same direction, power is delivered to the component.\n\n\nFigure 1.6 $\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}$ Polarity references and the expression for power.\n\nWe can now present the rule for interpreting the algebraic sign of power:\n\nIf the power is positive (i.e., \\(p>0\\)), power is being delivered to the circuit inside the box. If the power is negative (i.e., \\(p<0\\)), power is being extracted from the circuit inside the box.\n\nFor instance, suppose that we have chosen the polarity references shown in Fig. 1.6(b). Assume further that our calculations for the current and voltage yield the following numerical results:\n\n$$\ni=4 \\mathrm{~A} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad v=-10 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nThen the power associated with the terminal pair 1,2 is\n\n$$\np=-(-10)(4)=40 \\mathrm{~W}\n$$\n\nThus, the circuit inside the box is absorbing 40 W .\nTo take this analysis a step further, assume that a colleague is solving the same problem but has chosen the reference polarities shown in Fig. 1.6(c).

    "text": "Power and energy computations play a crucial role in the analysis of electrical circuits. A primary rationale for this is that while voltage and current are instrumental in the study and development of electrical systems, the system's practical output is often non-electrical and can be more conveniently described in terms of power or energy. Moreover, practical devices have a finite capacity for handling power. Hence, voltage and current calculations alone are inadequate for circuit design.\n\nThe relationship between power and energy is intertwined with voltage and current, and power calculations are employed to exemplify the passive sign convention. Recalling fundamental physics, power represents the rate at which energy is either consumed or produced. For instance, a water pump rated at 75 kW can deliver more water per second than one rated at 7.5 kW. Mathematically, energy per unit time can be represented as a derivative, as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np=\\frac{d w}{d t} \\tag{1.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHere, \\( p \\) denotes power in watts, \\( w \\) represents energy in joules, and \\( i \\) signifies time in seconds. Consequently, 1 W is equal to \\( 1 \\mathrm{~J} / \\mathrm{s} \\).\n\nThe power associated with charge flow directly follows from the definitions of voltage and current. This relationship is derived from Eqs. 1.1 and 1.2, resulting in:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np=\\frac{d w}{d t}=\\left(\\frac{d w}{d q}\\right)\\left(\\frac{d q}{d t}\\right)\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np=v i \\tag{1.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere \\( p \\) is power in watts, \\( v \\) is voltage in volts, and \\( i \\) is current in amperes. Equation 1.4 indicates that the power associated with a fundamental circuit component is simply the product of the current through it and the voltage across it. Therefore, power is a measure related to a pair of terminals, and it is necessary to determine from the calculations whether power is being delivered to or extracted from the terminals. This information is derived from the correct application and interpretation of the passive sign convention.\n\nUsing the passive sign convention, Eq. 1.4 is accurate if the current reference direction aligns with the reference voltage drop across the terminals. If not, Eq. 1.4 must be written with a negative sign. Put differently, if the current reference is in the direction of a reference voltage rise across the terminals, the power expression becomes:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np=-v i \\tag{1.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe algebraic sign of power is determined by the movement of charge through voltage drops and rises. As positive charges move through a voltage drop, they lose energy, and as they move through a voltage rise, they gain energy. Figure 1.6 illustrates the relationship between voltage and current polarity references and the power expression.\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:A system block diagram identified as \"(a)\" shows a basic electrical circuit component depicted as a box with two terminals marked as 1 and 2. The diagram aims to demonstrate the interrelation among current, voltage, and power.\n\n1. **Main Components:**\n- The diagram features a solitary box symbolizing an electrical component or system connected by two terminals, numbered 1 and 2.\n\n2. **Flow of Information or Control:**\n- Current (i) enters the box through terminal 1 and exits at terminal 2, with an arrow indicating the direction.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n- Voltage polarity is shown with a negative sign at terminal 1 and a positive sign at terminal 2.\n- The power expression is \\( p = vi \\), indicating power delivery to the circuit within the box as the product of voltage and current is positive.\n\n4. **Overall System Function:**\n- The configuration signifies power delivery to the circuit inside the box. The alignment of current direction and voltage polarity suggests positive power, meaning energy is being supplied to the system, characteristic of a load receiving power.\nimage_name:(b)\ndescription:Diagram (b) in Figure 1.6 portrays a system where the current (i) flows into the positive terminal of a two-terminal component, and the voltage (v) across the terminals is marked with a positive sign at the same side as the current entry. This setup suggests the power expression for the system is \\( p = -vi \\).\n\nMain Components:\n1. **Two-Terminal Element:**\n- The diagram displays a block representing an electrical component with two terminals labeled 1 and 2, indicating an unspecified function, such as a resistor, capacitor, or battery.\n\n2. **Flow of Information or Control:**\n- Current (i) enters terminal 1 and exits terminal 2, indicated by an arrow, with current entering the block from terminal 1.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n- The power expression \\( p = -vi \\) is shown, indicating negative power, implying power is being extracted from the circuit inside the box.\n- Terminals are labeled as 1 and 2 for identification.\n\n4. **Overall System Function:**\n- The diagram demonstrates the relationship between current direction, voltage polarity, and power calculation in a two-terminal element. Since the power \\( p = -vi \\), it implies that the circuit within the block is supplying power to an external circuit or load, a common scenario for a power supply or energy source.\nimage_name:(c)\ndescription:System block diagram \"(c)\" depicted as \"(c)\" highlights the voltage polarity and current direction flow, which influence the power calculation in a simple electrical circuit.\n\n1. **Main Components:**\n- The diagram includes a rectangular block representing a circuit element with two terminals labeled \"1\" and \"2.\"\n- Voltage and current are depicted with specific polarity and direction.\n\n2. **Flow of Information or Control:**\n- Voltage is marked with a negative sign at the top and a positive sign at the bottom, indicating a voltage rise from terminal 2 to terminal 1.\n- Current \"i\" flows into terminal 1 and out of terminal 2, represented by an arrow pointing from left to right.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n- Voltage is labeled as \"v\" with polarity indicators showing a negative to positive rise.\n- Current \"i\" is indicated with an arrow and labeled accordingly.\n- The power expression \\( p = -vi \\) reflects the relationship between the voltage polarity and current direction.\n\n4. **Overall System Function:**\n- This configuration indicates power extraction from the circuit inside the box. The negative sign in the power expression \\( p = -vi \\) suggests that the direction of current and the polarity of voltage result in energy being drawn from the circuit element, consistent with the rule that negative power indicates energy extraction.\n\nimage_name:(d)\ndescription:System block diagram \"(d)\" illustrates the relationship between voltage polarity, current direction, and power expression in an electrical circuit, consisting of a simple block representing a circuit element with two terminals labeled 1 and 2.\n\n1. **Main Components:**\n- The circuit element block is represented as a grey box with two terminals labeled 1 and 2, indicating a generic circuit component.\n\n2. **Flow of Information or Control:**\n- Voltage (v) is indicated by polarity signs, with the positive sign at terminal 2 and the negative sign at terminal 1, suggesting a voltage rise from terminal 1 to terminal 2.\n- Current (i) flows from terminal 1 to terminal 2, as indicated by an arrow, meaning current enters terminal 1 and exits terminal 2.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Indicators:**\n- Voltage and current are labeled with their respective symbols (v and i), and the current direction is indicated by an arrow.\n- The power expression \\( p = vi \\) suggests that power is being delivered to the circuit element, as the power calculated is positive.\n\n4. **Overall System Function:**\n- The diagram primarily shows how the polarity of voltage and the direction of current affect the calculation of power in a circuit. In this specific configuration, with the voltage rising from terminal 1 to 2 and current flowing in the same direction, the calculated power is positive, indicating power delivery to the component. This conforms to the rule that power is delivered when both voltage rise and current flow are in the same direction.\n\nFigure 1.6 summarizes the relationship between polarity references for voltage and current and the expression for power.\n\nWe can now establish the rule for interpreting the algebraic sign of power:\n\nIf the power is positive (i.e., \\( p>0 \\)), power is being delivered to the circuit inside the box. If the power is negative (i.e., \\( p<0 \\)), power is being extracted from the circuit inside the box.\n\nFor instance, if the polarity references shown in Fig. 1.6(b) are chosen, and the calculated current and voltage yield the following numerical results: \\( i=4 \\mathrm{~A} \\) and \\( v=-10 \\mathrm{~V} \\), then the power associated with the terminal pair 1,2 is:\n\n$$\np=-(-10)(4)=40 \\mathrm{~W}\n$$\n\nThus, the circuit inside the box is absorbing 40 W.\n\nTo further this analysis, if a colleague is solving the same problem but has chosen the reference polarities shown in Fig. 1.6(c), the resulting numerical values are \\( i=-4 \\mathrm{~A} \\), \\( v=10 \\mathrm{~V} \\), and \\( p=40 \\mathrm{~W} \\). Notably, interpreting these results in terms of this reference system yields the same conclusion—that the circuit inside the box is absorbing 40 W. In fact, any of the reference systems in Fig. 1.6 would produce the same result.\n\nExample 1.3 exemplifies the relationship between voltage, current, power, and energy for an ideal fundamental circuit element and the application of the passive sign convention.\n\n#### Example 1.3 Relating Voltage, Current, Power, and Energy\n\nGiven the voltage at the terminals of the element in Fig. 1.5, whose current was defined in Assessment Problem 1.3, is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\nv=0 & t<0 \\\\\nv=10 e^{-5000 t} \\mathrm{kV}, & t \\geq 0\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\na) Calculate the power supplied to the element at 1 ms.\n\nb) Calculate the total energy (in joules) delivered to the circuit element.\n\n#### Solution\n\na) Since the current enters the + terminal of the voltage drop defined for the element in Fig. 1.5, a \" + \" sign is used in the power equation.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& p=v i=\\left(10,000 e^{-5000 t}\\right)\\left(20 e^{-5000 t}\\right)=200,000 e^{-10,000 t} \\mathrm{~W} \\\\\n& \\begin{aligned}\np(0.001) & =200,000 e^{-10,000 t(0.001)}=200,000 e^{-10} \\\\\n& =200,000\\left(45.4 \\times 10^{-6}\\right)=0.908 \\mathrm{~W}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nb) From the definition of power given in Eq. 1.3, the expression for energy is:\n\n$$\nw(t)=\\int_{0}^{t} p(x) d x\n$$\n\nTo find the total energy delivered, integrate the expression for power from zero to infinity.

A primary rationale for this is that while voltage and current are essential variables for the study and design of electrical systems, the practical output of such systems is frequently non-electrical. This non-electrical output is typically conveyed using units of power or energy. A secondary reason is the practical limits on the power handling capacity of all devices. Hence, solely focusing on voltage and current during design is inadequate.\n\nIn this context, we connect power and energy to voltage and current, while concurrently employing power calculations to exemplify the passive sign convention. From fundamental physics, we understand that power represents the rate at which energy is used or absorbed over time. For instance, a water pump rated at 75 kW can move more liters per second than one rated at 7.5 kW. Mathematically, the energy per unit time can be represented as a derivative:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np=\\frac{d w}{d t} \\tag{1.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\np & =\\text { the power in watts } \\\\\nw & =\\text { the energy in joules } \\\\\ni & =\\text { the time in seconds. }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, 1 W is equivalent to $1 \\mathrm{~J} / \\mathrm{s}$.\n\nThe power associated with the movement of charge is directly derived from the definitions of voltage and current in Eqs. 1.1 and 1.2, as shown by the equation:\n\n$$\np=\\frac{d w}{d t}=\\left(\\frac{d w}{d q}\\right)\\left(\\frac{d q}{d t}\\right)\n$$\n\nConsequently,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np=v i \\tag{1.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\np & =\\text { the power in watts, } \\\\\nv & =\\text { the voltage in volts, } \\\\\ni & =\\text { the current in amperes. }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nEquation 1.4 demonstrates that the power related to a fundamental circuit element is simply the product of the current passing through the element and the voltage across it. Therefore, power is associated with a pair of terminals, and it is crucial to discern from our calculations whether power is being supplied to the terminals or extracted from them. This information is derived from the accurate application and interpretation of the passive sign convention.\n\nIf the passive sign convention is applied, Eq. 1.4 is accurate when the current reference direction is the same as the direction of the voltage drop across the terminals. Otherwise, Eq. 1.4 must include a negative sign. In other words, if the current reference is aligned with the direction of a voltage rise across the terminals, the power expression is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np=-v i \\tag{1.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe algebraic sign of power is determined by the movement of charge through voltage drops and rises. When positive charges traverse a voltage drop, they lose energy, and when they move through a voltage rise, they gain energy.

One key factor is that while voltage and current are critical for the examination and planning of electric systems, the actual results of these systems are often non-electrical in nature. These non-electrical outcomes are commonly expressed in terms of power or energy units. Additionally, all real-world devices have a maximum power capacity they can manage. Consequently, during the design phase, calculations involving only voltage and current are not adequate.\n\nWithin this framework, we establish the relationship between power and energy with voltage and current, while also employing power computations to demonstrate the passive sign convention. In the realm of basic physics, power is defined as the rate at which energy is utilized or absorbed over time. For example, a water pump rated at 75 kW has the capability to move more water per second than one rated at 7.5 kW. This concept is mathematically represented by the derivative of energy over time:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np=\\frac{d w}{d t} \\tag{1.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHere,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\np & =\\text { power measured in watts } \\\\\nw & =\\text { energy quantified in joules } \\\\\ni & =\\text { time measured in seconds. }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, 1 watt is equal to $1 \\mathrm{~J} / \\mathrm{s}$.\n\nThe power associated with the movement of electric charge is directly tied to the definitions of voltage and current, as described by the following equation:\n\n$$\np=\\frac{d w}{d t}=\\left(\\frac{d w}{d q}\\right)\\left(\\frac{d q}{d t}\\right)\n$$\n\nThis leads to the expression for power:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np=v i \\tag{1.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWith\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\np & =\\text { power in watts, } \\\\\nv & =\\text { voltage in volts, } \\\\\ni & =\\text { current in amperes. }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nEquation 1.4 reveals that the power related to a basic circuit element is the product of the current flowing through it and the voltage across it. As a result, power is connected to a pair of terminals, and it is necessary to determine from our calculations whether power is being delivered to or extracted from these terminals. This information is obtained by correctly applying and interpreting the passive sign convention.\n\nWhen the passive sign convention is adopted, Eq. 1.4 holds true when the current reference direction matches the direction of the voltage drop across the terminals. If not, Eq. 1.4 must be adjusted with a negative sign. Alternatively, if the current reference is aligned with the direction of a voltage rise across the terminals, the power expression becomes\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np=-v i \\tag{1.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe algebraic sign of power is determined by the movement of charge through voltage drops and rises. When positive charges move through a voltage drop, they lose energy, and when they pass through a voltage rise, they gain energy.

Consequently, relying solely on voltage and current calculations during design is inadequate.\n\nThe current text establishes a connection between power and energy in relation to voltage and current, while also exemplifying the passive sign convention. From fundamental physics, it is known that power represents the rate at which energy is either used or supplied. (For instance, a water pump rated at 75 kW can pump more liters per second than one rated at 7.5 kW.) Mathematically, energy per unit time is denoted by the derivative and is represented as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np=\\frac{d w}{d t} \\tag{1.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\np & =\\text { power in watts } \\\\\nw & =\\text { energy in joules } \\\\\ni & =\\text { time in seconds. }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHence, 1 W is equal to 1 J/s.\nThe power related to the flow of charge is a direct result of the definitions of voltage and current, as seen in Eqs. 1.1 and 1.2, and can be derived using power calculations.

Therefore, power is a measure related to a pair of terminals, and we must be able to determine from our calculations whether power is supplied to or extracted from the terminals. This information is derived from the proper application and interpretation of the passive sign convention.\n\nApplying the passive sign convention, Eq. 1.4 is accurate if the reference direction for the current is in line with the reference voltage drop across the terminals.

(Refer to page 12.)\n- Current is the rate at which charge flows and is quantified in amperes $(i=d q / d t)$. (See page 12.)\n- An ideal basic circuit element is a two-terminal component that cannot be further divided; it can be mathematically characterized by its terminal voltage and current. (Refer to page 12.)\n- The passive sign convention employs a positive sign in the expression linking voltage and current at an element's terminals when the reference direction for the current aligns with the reference voltage drop across the element.
