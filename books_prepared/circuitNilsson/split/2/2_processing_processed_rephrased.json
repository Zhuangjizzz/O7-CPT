    "text": "In order to explore ideal voltage and current sources, we must first understand the fundamental nature of electrical sources. An electrical source is any device capable of converting non-electric energy into electric energy, and vice versa. For instance, a discharging battery converts chemical energy into electric energy, whereas a charging battery does the opposite. A dynamo, too, is a device that can convert mechanical energy into electric energy and vice versa, operating as a generator in the former mode and as a motor in the latter.\n\nIt's important to note that these sources can either provide or absorb electric power, typically maintaining either voltage or current. This behavior is particularly relevant for circuit analysis, which led to the concept of ideal voltage and current sources as basic circuit elements. The challenge lies in modeling real-world sources in terms of these ideal elements.\n\nAn ideal voltage source is a theoretical circuit element that maintains a constant voltage across its terminals, irrespective of the current flowing through them. Similarly, an ideal current source is another theoretical element that maintains a constant current through its terminals, regardless of the voltage across them. These elements are purely theoretical and do not exist in practical devices—they serve as idealized models for actual voltage and current sources.\n\nEmploying ideal models for current and voltage sources imposes significant constraints on how we describe them mathematically. Since an ideal voltage source maintains a constant voltage regardless of the current, it's impossible to express the current as a function of voltage. Conversely, knowing only the current supplied by an ideal current source doesn't allow us to determine the voltage across it. The simplicity of using ideal sources in circuit analysis comes at the cost of losing the ability to relate voltage and current in a practical source.\n\nIdeal voltage and current sources can be categorized as either independent or dependent sources. An independent source sets a voltage or current in a circuit without being influenced by other voltages or currents within the circuit. The value of the voltage or current it supplies is determined solely by the independent source itself. In contrast, a dependent source establishes a voltage or current whose value depends on another voltage or current elsewhere in the circuit. You cannot specify the value of a dependent source without knowing the value of the voltage or current it depends on.\n\nCircuit symbols for ideal independent sources are depicted in Fig. 2.1. Note the use of a circle to represent an independent source. To fully define an ideal independent voltage source in a circuit, you must specify the voltage value and its reference polarity, as shown in Fig. 2.1(a). Similarly, for an ideal independent current source, you must specify the current value and its reference direction, as shown in Fig. 2.1(b).\n\nThe symbols for ideal dependent sources are shown in Fig. 2.2. A diamond is used to represent a dependent source. Both dependent current and voltage sources can be controlled by either a voltage or a current elsewhere in the circuit, leading to four variations, as indicated by the symbols in Fig. 2.2. Dependent sources are also known as controlled sources.\n\nTo fully define an ideal dependent voltage-controlled voltage source, you must identify the controlling voltage, the equation that allows you to calculate the supplied voltage from the controlling voltage, and the reference polarity for the supplied voltage. In Fig. 2.2(a), the controlling voltage is denoted as $v_{x}$, the equation that determines the supplied voltage $v_{s}$ is given by\n\n$$\nv_{s}=\\mu v_{x}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mu$ is a dimensionless multiplying constant.\n\nSimilar requirements apply to the other ideal dependent sources. In Fig. 2.2(b), the controlling current is $i_{x}$, the equation for the supplied voltage $v_{s}$ is\n\n$$\nv_{s}=\\rho i_{x}\n$$\n\nwith $\\rho$ having the dimension volts per ampere. In Fig. 2.2(c), the controlling voltage is $v_{x}$, the equation for the supplied current $i_{s}$ is\n\n$$\ni_{s}=\\alpha v_{x}\n$$\n\nwith $\\alpha$ having the dimension amperes per volt. In Fig. 2.2(d), the controlling current is $i_{x}$, the equation for the supplied current $i_{s}$ is\n\n$$\ni_{s}=\\beta i_{x}\n$$\n\nwith $\\beta$ being dimensionless.\n\nIn conclusion, ideal sources are examples of active circuit elements, which model devices capable of generating electric energy. Passive elements, on the other hand, model devices that cannot generate electric energy, such as resistors, inductors, and capacitors. Examples 2.1 and 2.2 demonstrate how the characteristics of ideal independent and dependent sources restrict the types of allowable interconnections between sources."

These devices facilitate the conversion between non-electric and electric energy forms. For instance, a discharging battery transforms chemical energy into electric energy, while charging converts electric energy back into chemical energy. A dynamo, on the other hand, can convert mechanical energy into electric energy and vice versa, acting as a generator in one mode and a motor in the other. The pivotal characteristic of these sources is their ability to supply or absorb electric power, usually sustaining a consistent voltage or current.

The challenge lies in modeling real-world sources using these ideal elements.\n\nAn ideal voltage source is a theoretical circuit element that maintains a constant voltage across its terminals, irrespective of the current passing through them. Similarly, an ideal current source sustains a constant current through its terminals, regardless of the voltage across them. These elements are purely theoretical and do not exist in practical devices; they are idealized representations of actual voltage and current sources.\n\nUtilizing these ideal models introduces a critical limitation on their mathematical description. An ideal voltage source offers a constant voltage, making it impossible to define the current as a function of voltage. Conversely, knowing only the current supplied by an ideal current source precludes determining the voltage across it. The trade-off for using these ideal sources in circuit analysis is the loss of the ability to describe the interdependence of voltage and current in real-world sources.\n\nIdeal voltage and current sources can be categorized as independent or dependent sources. An independent source determines the voltage or current in a circuit without relying on other voltages or currents in the circuit. The value it supplies is set solely by the source itself.

    "text": "Before delving into the concepts of optimal voltage and current sources, it is essential to understand the fundamental characteristics of electrical sources. An electrical source is a device designed to transform non-electrical energy into electrical energy and vice versa. For instance, a battery discharging converts chemical energy into electrical energy, while a charging battery converts electrical energy into chemical energy. A dynamo, a mechanical-to-electrical converter, can also function in reverse, becoming an electric-to-mechanical converter. Known as a generator when it operates in the former mode and a motor in the latter, these sources can either supply or absorb electrical power, typically maintaining either a voltage or a current. This behavior is particularly significant in circuit analysis, contributing to the development of the ideal voltage source and the ideal current source as fundamental circuit components. The challenge lies in modeling practical sources based on these ideal elements.\n\nAn ideal voltage source is a circuit component that maintains a specified voltage across its terminals, irrespective of the current flowing through them. Similarly, an ideal current source is a circuit component that maintains a specified current through its terminals, regardless of the voltage across them. These components are not available as actual devices but are theoretical models of real voltage and current sources.\n\nUtilizing ideal models for current and voltage sources imposes certain mathematical restrictions on their description. An ideal voltage source provides a consistent voltage, making it impossible to define the current in terms of the voltage. Similarly, knowing only the current supplied by an ideal current source does not allow determining the voltage across it. By using ideal sources, we have simplified circuit analysis at the cost of sacrificing the ability to directly relate voltage and current in practical sources.\n\nIdeal voltage and current sources can be categorized as independent or dependent sources. An independent source sets a voltage or current in a circuit without being influenced by other voltages or currents within the circuit. The value of the voltage or current it provides is determined solely by the independent source. Conversely, a dependent source sets a voltage or current whose value is influenced by the voltage or current elsewhere in the circuit. The value of a dependent source cannot be specified without knowledge of the voltage or current it depends on.\n\nThe symbols for ideal independent sources are depicted in Figure 2.1, with a circle representing an independent source. To fully define an ideal independent voltage source in a circuit, the voltage value and the reference polarity must be included, as shown in Figure 2.1(a). Similarly, for an ideal independent current source, the current value and its reference direction must be specified, as depicted in Figure 2.1(b).\n\nThe symbols for ideal dependent sources are illustrated in Figure 2.2, using a diamond shape to represent a dependent source. Both the dependent current source and the dependent voltage source can be controlled by either a voltage or a current in the circuit, resulting in four variations as indicated in Figure 2.2. Dependent sources are also known as controlled sources.\n\nTo fully define an ideal dependent voltage-controlled voltage source, the controlling voltage, the equation to calculate the supplied voltage from the controlling voltage, and the reference polarity for the supplied voltage must be identified. In Figure 2.2(a), the controlling voltage is named $v_{x}$, the equation determining the supplied voltage $v_{s}$ is\n\n$$\nv_{s}=\\mu v_{x}\n$$\n\nwith $\\mu$ being a dimensionless multiplying constant. Similar requirements apply to specify other ideal dependent sources. In Figure 2.2(b), the controlling current is $i_{x}$, the equation for the supplied voltage $v_{s}$ is\n\n$$\nv_{s}=\\rho i_{x}\n$$\n\nwith the reference polarity as shown and $\\rho$ having the dimension volts per ampere.

In Figure 2.2(d), the controlling current is $i_{x}$, the equation for the supplied current $i_{s}$ is\n\n$$\ni_{s}=\\beta i_{x}\n$$\n\nwith the reference direction as shown, and $\\beta$ being dimensionless.\n\nLastly, in our discussion of ideal sources, we recognize them as examples of active circuit elements, which model devices capable of generating electric energy. Passive elements, on the other hand, represent physical devices that cannot produce electric energy, such as resistors, inductors, and capacitors.

    "text": "In order to delve into the concepts of ideal voltage and current sources, it's crucial to first understand the fundamental characteristics of electrical sources. An electrical source essentially functions as a converter, transforming non-electric energy into electric energy and vice versa. For instance, when a battery discharges, it converts chemical energy into electric energy, while during the charging process, the conversion is from electric to chemical energy. A dynamo operates by converting mechanical energy into electric energy and vice versa; when it functions in the mechanical-to-electric mode, it is known as a generator, and when it transforms from electric to mechanical energy, it is termed a motor. A key point to remember about these sources is their capability to either supply or absorb electric power, typically maintaining either voltage or current. This behavior holds significant interest for circuit analysis and has led to the conceptualization of the ideal voltage source and the ideal current source as fundamental circuit elements. The challenge lies in accurately modeling real-world sources using these ideal basic circuit elements.\n\nAn ideal voltage source is a circuit component that maintains a constant voltage across its terminals, irrespective of the current flowing through them. Similarly, an ideal current source is a circuit component that maintains a constant current through its terminals, regardless of the voltage across them. It's important to note that these ideal circuit components do not exist in practical devices—they are theoretical models that represent actual voltage and current sources.\n\nEmploying an ideal model for current and voltage sources introduces a critical constraint on how we can describe them mathematically. Since an ideal voltage source maintains a constant voltage, even if the current through the element varies, it is not possible to express the current in an ideal voltage source as a function of its voltage. Conversely, if the only information known about an ideal current source is the current it supplies, it is not feasible to determine the voltage across that current source. In employing ideal sources in circuit analysis, we forego the ability to describe the relationship between voltage and current in practical sources.\n\nIdeal voltage and current sources can be further categorized as either independent or dependent sources. An independent source establishes a voltage or current within a circuit without depending on other voltages or currents in the circuit. The value of the voltage or current it supplies is determined solely by the independent source itself. In contrast, a dependent source establishes a voltage or current whose value is contingent upon the value of a voltage or current elsewhere in the circuit. The value of a dependent source cannot be specified without knowledge of the voltage or current upon which it depends.\n\nThe circuit symbols for ideal independent sources are depicted in Fig. 2.1. It is notable that a circle is used to symbolize an independent source. To fully define an ideal independent voltage source in a circuit, it is necessary to specify the value of the voltage it supplies and the reference polarity, as shown in Fig. 2.1(a). Similarly, to fully define an ideal independent current source, it is necessary to specify the value of the current it supplies and its reference direction, as shown in Fig. 2.1(b).\n\nThe circuit symbols for ideal dependent sources are shown\ndepicted in Fig. 2.2. A diamond shape is used to symbol a dependent source. Both dependent dependent current source and the dependent voltage source can be governed by either a voltage or a current elsewhere in the circuit, leading to four distinct variations, as indicated by the symbols in Fig. 2.2. Dependent sources are sometimes referred to as controlled sources.\n\nTo fully define an ideal dependent voltage-controlled voltage source, it is necessary to identify the controlling voltage, the equation that allows calculation of the supplied voltage from the controlling voltage, and the reference polarity for the supplied voltage. In Fig. 2.2(a), the controlling voltage is denoted as \\( v_x \\), the equation that determines the supplied voltage \\( v_s \\) is given by \\( v_s = \\mu v_x \\), and the reference polarity for \\( v_s \\) is as indicated. Here, \\( \\mu \\) is a multiplying constant with no dimensions.\n\nEquivalent specifications are required for the other ideal dependent sources. In Fig. 2.2(b), the controlling current is \\( i_x \\), the equation for the supplied voltage \\( v_s \\) is \\( v_s = \\rho i_x \\), the reference polarity is as shown, and the multiplying constant \\( \\rho \\) has the dimensions of volts per ampere. In Fig. 2.2(c), the controlling voltage is \\( v_x \\), the equation for the supplied current \\( i_s \\) is \\( i_s = \\alpha v_x \\), the reference direction is as shown, and the multiplying constant \\( \\alpha \\) has the dimensions of amperes per volt. In Fig. 2.2(d), the controlling current is \\( i_x \\), the equation for the supplied current \\( i_s \\) is \\( i_s = \\beta i_x \\), the reference direction is as shown, and the multiplying constant \\( \\beta \\) is dimensionless.\n\nIn the final analysis of ideal sources, it is noted that they serve as examples of active circuit elements. An active element models a device capable of generating electric energy. In contrast, passive elements model physical devices that are incapable of generating electric energy. Resistors, inductors, and capacitors are typical examples of passive circuit elements. Examples 2.1 and 2.2 illustrate how the properties of ideal independent and dependent sources constrain the permissible interconnections of these sources.\n\nFigures and descriptions related to the images have been omitted as per the instruction to maintain the original length of the passage."

It's important to note that these ideal sources do not exist in practical form—they are abstract models used to represent real-world voltage and current sources.\n\nWhen employing these ideal models in circuit analysis, it's critical to acknowledge the limitations this imposes on their mathematical description. For an ideal voltage source, since it maintains a constant voltage regardless of current changes, it's impossible to define the current as a function of voltage. Similarly, for an ideal current source, if only the current value is known, the voltage across it cannot be determined. This simplification in using ideal sources for circuit analysis comes at the cost of losing the ability to describe the interdependence of voltage and current in real sources.\n\nFurther categorization of ideal voltage and current sources includes independent and dependent sources. An independent source independently sets a voltage or current in a circuit without being influenced by other voltages or currents in the circuit. Its value is determined solely by the independent source itself.

For instance, in Figure 2.2(b), the controlling current is \\( i_x \\), and the equation for the supplied voltage \\( v_s \\) is \\( v_s = \\rho i_x \\), with \\( \\rho \\) being a multiplying constant with units of volts per ampere.

A dynamo, which can switch between these energy conversions, is known as a generator when converting mechanical to electric energy and a motor when converting electric to mechanical energy. A key feature of these energy sources is their ability to either provide or consume electric power, typically maintaining a consistent voltage or current level. This behavior is crucial for circuit analysis, thereby inspiring the development of ideal voltage and current sources as fundamental circuit components. The task at hand is to develop models for real-world sources using these ideal components.\n\nAn ideal voltage source is a hypothetical component that maintains a fixed voltage across its terminals regardless of the current flowing through them. In a similar vein, an ideal current source is a theoretical element that ensures a constant current through its terminals, regardless of the voltage across them.

This led to the development of ideal voltage and current sources as fundamental circuit elements. The challenge lies in modeling real sources using these ideal elements.\n\nAn ideal voltage source maintains a constant voltage across its terminals, regardless of the current, while an ideal current source maintains a constant current through its terminals, regardless of the voltage. These ideal circuit elements do not exist in practice but serve as models for actual sources.\n\nUsing ideal models for current and voltage sources imposes limitations on their mathematical description. For instance, an ideal voltage source provides a steady voltage, making it impossible to specify the current as a function of voltage. Similarly, with an ideal current source, it's impossible to determine the voltage based solely on the current value. This simplification sacrifices the ability to relate voltage and current in practical sources.\n\nIdeal voltage and current sources can be categorized as independent or dependent sources. Independent sources set a voltage or current in a circuit without relying on other voltages or currents. Dependent sources, on the other hand, set a voltage or current that depends on other voltages or currents elsewhere in the circuit.\n\nCircuit symbols for ideal independent sources include a circle, with the voltage or current value and reference polarity or direction specified. Dependent sources are represented by a diamond and can be controlled by voltage or current, leading to four variations. Dependent sources are also known as controlled sources.\n\nTo fully specify an ideal dependent voltage-controlled voltage source, one must identify the controlling voltage, the equation to compute the supplied voltage, and the reference polarity. Similar requirements exist for other ideal dependent sources, each with its own multiplying constant and dimensions.\n\nIdeal sources are examples of active circuit elements, capable of generating electric energy, while passive elements like resistors, inductors, and capacitors cannot generate electric energy. Examples illustrate how the characteristics of ideal independent and dependent sources limit the types of permissible interconnections.\n\nFigures and examples demonstrate various interconnections of ideal sources, explaining which are valid and which violate the constraints imposed by the ideal sources. These examples help in understanding the behavior of ideal sources in different circuit configurations.\n\nAssessment problems and solutions further test the understanding of ideal basic circuit elements and their interconnections."

The circuit component representing this behavior is the resistor. Figure 2.5 depicts the circuit symbol for a resistor, with $R$ indicating the resistor's resistance value.\n\nTo conceptualize resistance, consider the electrons constituting electric current as they interact with and are opposed by the atomic structure of the material they traverse.

The magnitude of this resistance varies by material. Metals like copper and aluminum have low resistance, making them suitable for electrical wiring. In circuit diagrams, copper or aluminum wiring is typically not represented as a resistor because its resistance is negligible compared to other circuit elements, allowing us to ignore it for simplicity.\n\nFor circuit analysis, the current through a resistor must be referenced to the terminal voltage. This can be done in two ways: either following the voltage drop or the voltage rise across the resistor, as illustrated in Fig. 2.6.

In professional literature, conductance is often expressed in mhos (ohm spelled backward), symbolized by an inverted omega ( $($ ). Thus, an $8 \\Omega$ resistor can also be described as having a conductance of 0.125 mho ( $\\mho$ ).\n\nIdeal resistors are used in circuit analysis to model physical devices. The term \"ideal\" signifies that the resistor model simplifies actual resistive device behavior, primarily by assuming constant resistance over time. Most real resistive devices have variable resistance, but the ideal resistor model is applicable when the resistance remains relatively constant during the analysis period. This book assumes the simplifying assumptions about resistance devices are valid, employing ideal resistors in circuit analysis.\n\nThe power at a resistor's terminals can be calculated in several ways. One approach is to use the defining equation, calculating the product of terminal voltage and current.

This book assumes these simplifications are valid, using ideal resistors for circuit analysis.\n\nThe power at a resistor's terminals can be calculated in various ways.

The resistor is the circuit element that models this behavior. Figure 2.5 depicts the circuit symbol for a resistor, with $R$ indicating the resistor's resistance value.\n\nTo conceptualize resistance, consider electrons, which constitute electric current, interacting with and being opposed by the atomic structure of the material they traverse. These interactions convert some electric energy into thermal energy, which is dissipated as heat. While this heat generation can be undesirable, many electrical devices, such as stoves, toasters, irons, and space heaters, utilize resistance heating.\n\nMost materials exhibit some level of resistance to current flow. The resistance level depends on the material type. Metals like copper and aluminum have low resistance, making them suitable for electrical wiring. In circuit diagrams, copper or aluminum wiring is often not represented as a resistor because its resistance is minimal compared to other circuit elements, allowing us to disregard it for simplicity.\n\nFor circuit analysis, we must relate the current through the resistor to the terminal voltage. This can be done in two ways: either following the voltage drop or the voltage rise across the resistor, as illustrated in Fig. 2.6.

    "text": "Resistance is the property of materials that hinders the flow of electric current, specifically the movement of electric charge. The circuit component representing this behavior is the resistor, depicted in Fig. 2.5 with the symbol $R$ indicating its resistance value.\n\nTo conceptualize resistance, consider electrons, which constitute electric current, interacting with and being opposed by the atomic structure of the material they traverse. During these interactions, some electric energy converts to thermal energy, dissipating as heat. While this conversion can be undesirable, many electrical devices, such as stoves, toasters, irons, and space heaters, exploit resistance heating.\n\nMost materials exhibit some level of resistance to current flow. The resistance magnitude depends on the material type. Metals like copper and aluminum have low resistance, making them suitable for electrical wiring. In circuit diagrams, the resistance of copper or aluminum wiring is typically negligible compared to other circuit elements, allowing us to omit it for simplicity.\n\nFor circuit analysis, we must relate the resistor's current to its terminal voltage. This can be done in two ways: aligning with the voltage drop or rise across the resistor, as shown in Fig. 2.6. If we choose the former, the voltage-current relationship is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv=i R \\tag{2.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nv & =\\text { voltage in volts, } \\\\\ni & =\\text { current in amperes, } \\\\\nR & =\\text { resistance in ohms. }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nOpting for the latter method, we write\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv=-i R \\tag{2.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHere, $v, i$, and $R$ are measured in volts, amperes, and ohms, respectively. The algebraic signs in Eqs. 2.1 and 2.2 stem from the passive sign convention introduced in Chapter 1.\n\nEqs. 2.1 and 2.2 are known as Ohm's law, named after Georg Simon Ohm, who validated it in the early 19th century. Ohm's law describes the voltage-current relationship for a resistor. In SI units, resistance is measured in ohms, symbolized by the Greek letter omega $(\\Omega)$. Fig. 2.7 illustrates the circuit symbol for an $8 \\Omega$ resistor.\n\nWhile Ohm's law expresses voltage as a function of current, it's also useful to express current as a function of voltage. Thus, from Eq. 2.1,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni=\\frac{v}{R} \\tag{2.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nor, from Eq. 2.2,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni=-\\frac{v}{R} \\tag{2.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe reciprocal of resistance is conductance, denoted by $G$ and measured in siemens (S).

In professional literature, conductance is often expressed in mhos (symbolized by an inverted omega, $($ ), so an $8 \\Omega$ resistor can also be described as having a conductance of 0.125 mho ( $\\mho$ ).\n\nIdeal resistors are used in circuit analysis to model physical devices. The term \"ideal\"提醒我们该模型对实际电阻器件的行为做了简化假设，其中最重要的是理想电阻的阻值恒定，不随时间变化。大多数实际电阻器件的阻值并非恒定，会随时间变化。理想电阻模型适用于那些阻值在电路分析关注的时间段内变化不大的物理器件。本书中，我们假定这些简化假设有效，因此使用理想电阻进行电路分析。\n\n计算电阻器端口的功率有几种方法。第一种方法是使用定义方程，直接计算端口电压和电流的乘积。对于图2.6所示的参考系统，我们写出\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np=v i \\tag{2.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n当 $v=i R$ 时，以及\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np=-v i \\tag{2.7}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n当 $v=-i R$ 时。\n\n第二种方法是用电流和电阻表示功率。将 Eq. 2.1 代入 Eq. 2.6，我们得到\n\n$$\np=v i=(i R) i\n$$\n\n所以\n\n电阻器功率（以电流表示）\n\n电阻器功率（以电压表示）\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np=i^{2} R \\tag{2.8}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n同样，将 Eq. 2.2 代入 Eq. 2.7，我们有\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np=-v i=-(-i R) i=i^{2} R \\tag{2.9}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEqs. 2.8 和 2.9 相同，清楚地表明无论电压极性和电流方向如何，电阻器端口的功率总是正值。因此，电阻器从电路中吸收功率。\n\n第三种方法是用电压和电阻表示功率。该表达式与极性参考无关，所以\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np=\\frac{v^{2}}{R} \\tag{2.10}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n有时电阻器的值会以电导而非电阻表示。使用 Eq. 2.5 中电阻与电导的关系，我们也可以将 Eqs. 2.9 和 2.10 表示为电导，即\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\np & =\\frac{i^{2}}{G}  \\tag{2.11}\\\\\np & =v^{2} G \\tag{2.12}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nEqs. 2.6-2.12 提供了多种计算电阻器吸收功率的方法。每种方法得出的答案相同。在分析电路时，应根据提供的信息选择直接使用该信息的功率方程。\n\n例 2.3 演示了如何结合理想电源和电阻器应用欧姆定律。还展示了电阻器端口的功率计算。\n\n#### 例 2.3 计算简单电阻电路的电压、电流和功率\n\n图 2.8 中的每个电路中，$v$ 或 $i$ 的值未知。\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:\n[\n'name': '1A', 'type': 'CurrentSource', 'value': '1A', 'ports': {'Np': 'GND', 'Nn': 'VA'\n'name': '8Ω', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '8Ω', 'ports': {'N1': 'VA', 'N2': 'GND'\n]\nextrainfo:该电路由一个 1A 电流源与一个 8Ω 电阻器串联组成。电阻器两端的电压标记为 va。\nimage_name:(b)\ndescription:\n[\n'name': '50V', 'type': 'VoltageSource', 'value': '50V', 'ports': {'Np': 'VB', 'Nn': 'GND'\n'name': '0.2S', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '0.2S', 'ports': {'Np': 'VB', 'Nn': 'VD'\n]\nextrainfo:电路 (b) 由一个 50V 电压源与一个 0.2S 电阻器串联组成。节点 VB 和 VD 分别连接到电压源的正负端。\nimage_name:(c)\ndescription:\n[\n'name': '1A', 'type': 'CurrentSource', 'value': '1A', 'ports': {'Np': 'VC', 'Nn': 'GND'\n'name': '20Ω', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '20Ω', 'ports': {'N1': 'VC', 'N2': 'GND'\n]\nextrainfo:电路图 (c) 由一个电流源和一个电阻器串联，以及一个电压源和一个电阻器并联组成。\nimage_name:(d)\ndescription:\n[\n'name': '50V', 'type': 'VoltageSource', 'value': '50 V', 'ports': {'Np': 'Vd', 'Nn': 'GND'\n'name': '25 Ω', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '25 Ω', 'ports': {'N1': 'Vd', 'N2': 'GND'\n]\nextrainfo:电路图 (d) 由一个 50 V 电压源和一个 25 Ω 电阻器并联连接在节点 Vd 和地 (GND) 之间。电流 id 从地流向节点 Vd 通过电阻器。\n\n图 $2.8 \\boldsymbol{\\Delta}$ 例 2.3 的电路。\na) 计算电压 $v$ 和电流 $i$ 的值。\nb) 确定每个电阻器耗散的功率。\n\n#### 解答\n\na) 图 2.8(a) 中的电压 $v_{a}$ 是电流在电阻器中的电压降。因此，\n\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{a}}=(1)(8)=8 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\n图 2.8(b) 中，具有 0.2 S 电导的电阻器中的电流 $i_{b}$ 与电阻器两端的电压降方向一致。因此\n\n$$\ni_{\\mathrm{b}}=(50)(0.2)=10 \\mathrm{~A}\n$$\n\n图 2.8(c) 中的电压 $v_{c}$ 是电流在电阻器中的电压升。因此\n\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{c}}=-(1)(20)=-20 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\n图 2.8(d) 中，$25 \\Omega$ 电阻器中的电流 $i_{\\mathrm{d}}$ 与电阻器两端的电压升方向一致。因此\n\n$$\ni_{\\mathrm{d}}=\\frac{-50}{25}=-2 \\mathrm{~A}\n$$\n\nb) 四个电阻器中每个耗散的功率为\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\np_{8 \\Omega} & =\\frac{(8)^{2}}{8}=(1)^{2}(8)=8 \\mathrm{~W} \\\\\np_{0.2 S} & =(50)^{2}(0.2)=500 \\mathrm{~W} \\\\\np_{20 \\Omega} & =\\frac{(-20)^{2}}{20}=(1)^{2}(20)=20 \\mathrm{~W} \\\\\np_{25 \\Omega} & =\\frac{(50)^{2}}{25}=(-2)^{2}(25)=100 \\mathrm{~W}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n评估问题\n\n目标 2—能够陈述和使用欧姆定律 . . .\n\n2.3 对于所示电路，\na) 如果 $v_{g}=1 \\mathrm{kV}$ 且 $i_{g}=5 \\mathrm{~mA}$，求 $R$ 的值和电阻器吸收的功率。\nb) 如果 $i_{g}=75 \\mathrm{~mA}$ 且电压源提供的功率为 3 W ，求 $v_{g}, R$ 和电阻器吸收的功率。\nc) 如果 $R=300 \\Omega$ 且电阻器吸收的功率为 480 mW ，求 $i_{g}$ 和 $v_{g}$。\nimage_name:对于所示电路\ndescription:\n[\n'name': 'vg', 'type': 'VoltageSource', 'value': 'vg', 'ports': {'Np': 'Vg', 'Nn': 'GND'\n'name': 'R', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'R', 'ports': {'N1': 'Vg', 'N2': 'GND'\n]\nextrainfo:该电路由一个电压源 'vg' 和一个电阻器 'R' 并联组成，电流 'ig' 流过电路。\n\n\n答案: (a) $200 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega, 5 \\mathrm{~W}$；\n(b) $40 \\mathrm{~V}, 533.33 \\Omega, 3 \\mathrm{~W}$；\n(c) $40 \\mathrm{~mA}, 12 \\mathrm{~V}$。\n\n注意：也尝试第 2.11 和 2.12 节的问题。\n2.4 对于所示电路，\na) 如果 $i_{g}=0.5 \\mathrm{~A}$ 且 $G=50 \\mathrm{mS}$，求 $v_{g}$ 和电流源提供的功率。\nb) 如果 $v_{g}=15 \\mathrm{~V}$ 且导体吸收的功率为 9 W ，求电导 $G$ 和源电流 $i_{g}$。\nc) 如果 $G=200 \\mu \\mathrm{~S}$ 且导体吸收的功率为 8 W ，求 $i_{g}$ 和 $v_{g}$。\nimage_name:figure\ndescription:\n[\n'name': 'ig', 'type': 'CurrentSource', 'value': 'ig', 'ports': {'Np': 'GND', 'Nn': 'Vg'\n'name': 'G', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'G', 'ports': {'N1': 'Vg', 'N2': 'GND'\n]\nextrainfo:该电路由一个电流源 'ig' 与一个电阻器 'G' 并联组成。电流源从地流向节点 Vg，电阻器连接在节点 Vg 和地之间。电阻器两端的电压表示为 'vg'。\n\n\n答案: (a) $10 \\mathrm{~V}, 5 \\mathrm{~W}$；\n(b) $40 \\mathrm{mS}, 0.6 \\mathrm{~A}$；\n(c) $40 \\mathrm{~mA}, 200 \\mathrm{~V}$。\n\n在介绍了理想电源和电阻器的一般特性后，我们接下来展示如何使用这些元件构建实际系统的电路模型。"

In professional literature, conductance is often measured in mhos (ohm spelled backward), symbolized by an inverted omega ( $($ ). Thus, an $8 \\Omega$ resistor can also be described as having a conductance of 0.125 mho ( $\\mho$ ).\n\nIdeal resistors are used in circuit analysis to model physical devices. The term \"ideal\" indicates that the resistor model makes simplifying assumptions about actual resistive devices, the most significant being that the resistance is constant and does not change over time. Most real resistive devices have variable resistance, but the ideal resistor model is applicable when the resistance remains relatively constant over the period of interest. This book assumes these simplifications are valid and uses ideal resistors for circuit analysis.\n\nThe power at a resistor's terminals can be calculated in various ways. One approach is to use the defining equation, calculating the product of terminal voltage and current. For the reference systems in Fig. 2.6, we write\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np=v i \\tag{2.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhen $v=i R$ and\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np=-v i \\tag{2.7}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhen $v=-i R$.\n\nAnother method expresses power in terms of current and resistance.

Thus, a resistor absorbs power from the circuit.\n\nA third method expresses power in terms of voltage and resistance. This expression is independent of polarity references, so\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np=\\frac{v^{2}}{R} \\tag{2.10}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSometimes, a resistor's value is given as conductance rather than resistance. Using Eq. 2.5, we can also write Eqs. 2.9 and 2.10 in terms of conductance:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\np & =\\frac{i^{2}}{G}  \\tag{2.11}\\\\\np & =v^{2} G \\tag{2.12}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nEqs. 2.6-2.12 provide various methods for calculating the power absorbed by a resistor, all yielding the same result. In circuit analysis, choose the power equation that directly uses the provided information.\n\n#### Example 2.3 Calculating Voltage, Current, and Power for a Simple Resistive Circuit\n\nIn each circuit in Fig. 2.8, either the value of $v$ or $i$ is unknown.\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:\n[\n'name': '1A', 'type': 'CurrentSource', 'value': '1A', 'ports': {'Np': 'GND', 'Nn': 'VA'\n'name': '8Ω', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '8Ω', 'ports': {'N1': 'VA', 'N2': 'GND'\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit consists of a 1A current source in series with an 8Ω resistor.

Figure 2.5 illustrates the circuit symbol for a resistor, where $R$ indicates the resistance value.\n\nTo conceptualize resistance, consider electrons, which constitute electric current, interacting with and being opposed by the atomic structure of the material they traverse. During these interactions, some electric energy converts to thermal energy and dissipates as heat, an effect that can be undesirable. Nonetheless, many practical electrical devices, such as stoves, toasters, irons, and space heaters, utilize resistance heating.\n\nMost materials exhibit some degree of resistance to current flow. The resistance level depends on the material type. Metals like copper and aluminum have low resistance, making them suitable for electrical wiring. In circuit diagrams, copper or aluminum wiring is typically not represented as a resistor because its resistance is minimal compared to other circuit elements, allowing us to ignore it for simplification.\n\nFor circuit analysis, we must relate the current through the resistor to the terminal voltage. This can be done in two ways: either in the direction of the voltage drop or the voltage rise across the resistor, as depicted in Fig. 2.6. If we choose the former, the relationship between voltage and current is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv=i R \\tag{2.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nv & =\\text { the voltage in volts, } \\\\\ni & =\\text { the current in amperes, } \\\\\nR & =\\text { the resistance in ohms. }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAlternatively, if we choose the second method, we write\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv=-i R \\tag{2.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $v, i$, and $R$ are measured in volts, amperes, and ohms, respectively. The algebraic signs in Eqs. 2.1 and 2.2 result from the passive sign convention introduced in Chapter 1.\n\nEqs. 2.1 and 2.2 are known as Ohm's law, named after Georg Simon Ohm, a German physicist who validated it in the early nineteenth century. Ohm's law describes the algebraic relationship between voltage and current for a resistor. In SI units, resistance is measured in ohms, symbolized by the Greek letter omega $(\\Omega)$. The circuit symbol for an $8 \\Omega$ resistor is shown in Fig. 2.7.\n\nWhile Ohm's law expresses voltage as a function of current, it is also useful to express current as a function of voltage. Thus, from Eq. 2.1,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni=\\frac{v}{R} \\tag{2.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nor, from Eq. 2.2,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni=-\\frac{v}{R} \\tag{2.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe reciprocal of resistance is called conductance, symbolized by $G$, and measured in siemens (S). Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nG=\\frac{1}{R} \\mathrm{~S} \\tag{2.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAn $8 \\Omega$ resistor has a conductance of 0.125 S. In professional literature, conductance is often expressed in mhos (ohm spelled backward), symbolized by an inverted omega ( $($ ). Thus, an $8 \\Omega$ resistor can also be described as having a conductance of 0.125 mho ( $\\mho$ ).\n\nIdeal resistors are used in circuit analysis to model the behavior of physical devices. The term \"ideal\" signifies that the resistor model makes simplifying assumptions about actual resistive devices, the primary one being that the resistance is constant and does not change over time. Most real resistive devices have varying resistance over time, but the ideal resistor model is applicable when the resistance remains relatively constant during the period of interest in the analysis. This book assumes the validity of these simplifying assumptions and employs ideal resistors in circuit analysis.\n\nThe power at a resistor's terminals can be calculated in several ways. One approach is to use the defining equation, calculating the product of the terminal voltage and current. For the reference systems in Fig. 2.6, we write\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np=v i \\tag{2.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhen $v=i R$ and\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np=-v i \\tag{2.7}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhen $v=-i R$.\n\nAnother method expresses power in terms of current and resistance. Substituting Eq. 2.1 into Eq. 2.6 gives\n\n$$\np=v i=(i R) i\n$$\n\nso\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np=i^{2} R \\tag{2.8}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, substituting Eq. 2.2 into Eq. 2.7 yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np=-v i=-(-i R) i=i^{2} R \\tag{2.9}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEqs. 2.8 and 2.9 are identical, clearly showing that the power at a resistor's terminals is positive regardless of voltage polarity and current direction, indicating that a resistor absorbs power from the circuit.\n\nA third method expresses power in terms of voltage and resistance, independent of polarity references:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np=\\frac{v^{2}}{R} \\tag{2.10}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSometimes, a resistor's value is given as conductance rather than resistance. Using Eq. 2.5, we can also write Eqs. 2.9 and 2.10 in terms of conductance:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\np & =\\frac{i^{2}}{G}  \\tag{2.11}\\\\\np & =v^{2} G \\tag{2.12}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nEqs. 2.6-2.12 provide various methods for calculating the power absorbed by a resistor, all yielding the same result. In circuit analysis, choose the power equation that directly uses the provided information.\n\n#### Example 2.3 Calculating Voltage, Current, and Power for a Simple Resistive Circuit\n\nIn each circuit in Fig. 2.8, either the voltage $v$ or current $i$ is unknown.\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:\n[\n'name': '1A', 'type': 'CurrentSource', 'value': '1A', 'ports': {'Np': 'GND', 'Nn': 'VA'\n'name': '8Ω', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '8Ω', 'ports': {'N1': 'VA', 'N2': 'GND'\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit consists of a 1A current source in series with an 8Ω resistor.

The expertise needed to develop a circuit model for a device or system is as intricate as the skill required to solve the resulting circuit. While this text emphasizes the skills needed to solve circuits, other skills are also essential in the practice of electrical engineering, with modeling being one of the most crucial.\n\nIn the following two examples, we develop circuit models. In Example 2.4, we build a circuit model based on an understanding of the system's component behavior and their interconnections. In Example 2.5, we create a circuit model by measuring the terminal behavior of a device.\n\n#### Example 2.4 Constructing a Circuit Model of a Flashlight\n\nCreate a circuit model for a flashlight.\n\n#### Solution\n\nWe selected a flashlight for this example due to its familiar components. Figure 2.9 shows a photograph of a commonly available flashlight.\n\nWhen viewed as an electrical system, the flashlight's key components are the batteries, lamp, connector, case, and switch. We will now consider the circuit model for each component.\n\nA dry-cell battery maintains a relatively constant terminal voltage if the current demand is not excessive. Therefore, if the battery operates within its intended limits, we can model it with an ideal voltage source. The specified voltage remains constant and equals the sum of two dry-cell voltages.\n\nThe lamp's primary output is light energy, achieved by heating the filament to a temperature that produces visible radiation. We can represent the lamp with an ideal resistor. Note that while this resistor accounts for the electrical energy converted to thermal energy, it does not predict how much thermal energy is converted to light. The resistor, denoted as $R_{l}$, does predict the steady current draw from the batteries, a key system characteristic.\n\nThe connector in the flashlight serves a dual purpose. First, it provides an electrical path between the dry cells and the case. Second, it is formed into a springy coil to apply mechanical pressure, ensuring contact between the batteries and the lamp. Thus, the mechanical properties of the wire may be more critical than its electrical properties for the flashlight's design. Electrically, we can model the connector with an ideal resistor, labeled $R_{1}$.\n\nThe case also has mechanical and electrical roles. Mechanically, it houses all components and provides a grip. Electrically, it connects other elements. If the case is metal, it conducts current between the batteries and the lamp. If it is plastic, a metal strip inside connects the coil to the switch. Either way, an ideal resistor, denoted $R_{c}$, models the electrical connection.\n\nThe switch is a two-state electrical device, either on or OFF. An ideal switch offers no resistance when on and infinite resistance when off. These states represent the extreme values of a resistor: the on state corresponds to zero resistance (short circuit), and the off state corresponds to infinite resistance (open circuit). Figures 2.10(a) and (b) show these representations, with (c) depicting a switch that can be either state.\n\nWe now construct the flashlight's circuit model. Starting with the batteries, the positive terminal of the first cell connects to the negative terminal of the second, as shown in Fig. 2.11. The second cell's positive terminal connects to the lamp, which then connects to the switch. The switch connects to the case, which links back to the first cell's negative terminal via a metal spring. This forms a closed circuit, visible in Fig. 2.11. Figure 2.12 presents the circuit model for the flashlight.\n\n#### Observations on Modeling\n\nFrom the flashlight example, we can make several general observations about modeling:\n1. The primary focus in developing a circuit model is the electrical behavior of each physical component. In the flashlight model, the lamp, coiled wire, and case are all represented by resistors because they exhibit similar electrical phenomena, namely resistance to current flow.\n2. Circuit models must consider both desired and undesired electrical effects. For instance, the lamp's heat produces light (desired) but the case and coil's heat is parasitic (undesired), draining the batteries without useful output.\n3. Modeling involves approximation. Simplifying assumptions, such as an ideal switch or negligible contact resistance, may not fully capture real-world behavior. Our model assumes negligible internal energy dissipation in the batteries, which could be refined by adding a resistor.\n\nIn modeling the flashlight, we had access to its internal components. However, sometimes we only know a device's terminal behavior. Example 2.5 addresses such a scenario.\n\n#### Example 2.5 Constructing a Circuit Model Based on Terminal Measurements\n\nGiven the voltage and current measurements at the terminals of a device (Fig. 2.13(a) and (b)), construct a circuit model.\n\n#### Solution\n\nPlotting the voltage against current (Fig. 2.14(a)) shows a linear relationship, indicating the device behaves like a $4 \\Omega$ resistor. Thus, the circuit model is a $4 \\Omega$ resistor (Fig. 2.14(b)).\n\nWe will revisit this terminal-based modeling technique after discussing Kirchhoff's laws and circuit analysis.\n\nFigure $2.14 \\boldsymbol{\\Delta}$ (a) Voltage vs. current for the device.

Starting with the dry-cell batteries, the positive terminal of the first cell connects to the negative terminal of the second cell, as shown in Fig. 2.11. The second cell's positive terminal connects to one terminal of the lamp. The lamp's other terminal contacts one side of the switch, and the other side of the switch connects to the metal case. The metal case then connects to the first cell's negative terminal via the metal spring, forming a closed path or circuit, visible in Fig. 2.11.

In developing a circuit model, the electrical behavior of each physical component is paramount.

Circuit models must account for both desired and undesired electrical effects. For instance, the lamp's heat (desired) produces light, while the case and coil's heat (undesired) drains the batteries without useful output. These parasitic effects must be considered for an accurate model.\n\n3. Modeling involves approximation. Even for the simple flashlight system, we made simplifying assumptions, such as ideal switch behavior and negligible contact resistance. Our model does not predict deviations from these ideals, like high contact resistance or inadequate pressure from the coiled connector. Similarly, using an ideal voltage source ignores internal energy dissipation in the dry cells, which could be represented by adding a resistor.\n\nIn modeling the flashlight, we had access to its internal components. However, sometimes we only know a device's terminal behavior and must use this to construct the model, as explored in Example 2.5.\n\n#### Example 2.5 Constructing a Circuit Model Based on Terminal Measurements\n\nGiven the voltage and current measurements at the terminals of the device in Fig. 2.13(a), construct a circuit model of the device inside the box.\n\n#### Solution\n\nPlotting the voltage against the current yields the graph in Fig. 2.14(a), showing a direct proportionality: $v_{t} = 4i_{t}$.

In the flashlight model, three distinct physical components—the lamp, coiled wire, and metal case—are all represented by resistors because they exhibit similar electrical phenomena, namely resistance to current flow.\n\nSecond, circuit models must consider both desired and undesired electrical effects. For instance, the heat from the lamp's resistance produces light, a desired effect. However, heat from the case and coil represents unwanted parasitic effects that drain the batteries without useful output. Such parasitic effects must be accounted for to ensure the model accurately represents the system.\n\nFinally, modeling involves approximation. Even for the simple flashlight system, we made simplifying assumptions in developing the circuit model. We assumed an ideal switch, ignoring potential high contact resistance that could affect system operation. We also assumed the coiled connector applied sufficient pressure to eliminate contact resistance between the dry cells. Our use of an ideal voltage source overlooked any internal energy dissipation in the dry cells, which could be due to parasitic heating. We could account for this by adding an ideal resistor between the source and the lamp resistor, assuming internal losses are negligible.\n\nIn modeling the flashlight as a circuit, we had access to and understanding of its internal components.

    "text": "A circuit is considered solved once the voltage across and the current through every component have been ascertained. Ohm's law is a crucial equation for deriving such solutions. However, Ohm's law alone may not suffice to provide a complete solution. As we will discover when attempting to solve the flashlight circuit from Example 2.4, we need to employ two more significant algebraic relationships, known as Kirchhoff's laws, to solve most circuits.\n\nWe commence by redrawing the circuit as depicted in Fig. 2.15, with the switch in the on position. It is worth noting that we have also labeled the current and voltage variables associated with each resistor and the current associated with the voltage source. This labeling includes reference polarities, as is customary. For ease of reference, we affix the same subscript to the voltage and current labels as we do to the resistor labels. In Fig. 2.15, we have also removed some of the terminal dots from Fig. 2.12 and have inserted nodes. Terminal dots represent the start and end points of an individual circuit element. A node is a point where two or more circuit elements intersect. It is essential to identify nodes in order to apply Kirchhoff's current law, as we will shortly observe. In Fig. 2.15, the nodes are designated as a, b, c, and d. Node d connects the battery and the lamp and essentially spans the entire top of the diagram, although we label a single point for convenience. The dots on either side of the switch denote its terminals, but only one is required to represent a node, hence only one is labeled as node c.\n\nFor the circuit depicted in Fig. 2.15, we can identify seven unknowns: \\(i_{s}\\), \\(i_{1}\\), \\(i_{c}\\), \\(i_{l}\\), \\(v_{1}\\), \\(v_{c}\\), and \\(v_{l}\\). It is important to remember that \\(v_{s}\\) is a known voltage, as it represents the sum of the terminal voltages of the two dry cells, a constant voltage of 3 V. The challenge lies in determining the seven unknown variables. From algebra, you are aware that to find \\(n\\) unknown quantities, you must solve \\(n\\) simultaneous independent equations. From our discussion of Ohm's law in Section 2.2, you know that three of the necessary equations are:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{gather*}\nv_{1}=i_{1} R_{1} \\tag{2.13}\\\\\nv_{c}=i_{c} R_{c} \\tag{2.14}\\\\\nv_{l}=i_{l} R_{l} \\tag{2.15}\n\\end{gather*}\n\\]\n\nBut what about the remaining four equations?\n\nThe interconnection of circuit elements imposes constraints on the relationship between the terminal voltages and currents. These constraints are referred to as Kirchhoff's laws, named after Gustav Kirchhoff, who first articulated them in a paper published in 1848. The two laws that express these constraints in mathematical form are known as Kirchhoff's current law and Kirchhoff's voltage law.\n\nWe can now articulate Kirchhoff's current law:\n\nThe algebraic sum of all the currents at any node in a circuit equals zero.\n\nTo apply Kirchhoff's current law, an algebraic sign corresponding to a reference direction must be assigned to every current at the node. Assigning a positive sign to a current exiting a node necessitates assigning a negative sign to a current entering the node. Conversely, assigning a negative sign to a current exiting a node requires assigning a positive sign to a current entering the node.\n\nApplying Kirchhoff's current law to the four nodes in the circuit depicted in Fig. 2.15, adhering to the convention that currents exiting a node are considered positive, yields four equations:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\text { node } \\mathrm{a} & i_{s}-i_{1}=0, \\\\\n\\text { node } \\mathrm{b} & i_{1}+i_{c}=0, \\\\\n\\text { node } \\mathrm{c} & -i_{c}-i_{l}=0 \\\\\n\\text { node } \\mathrm{d} & i_{l}-i_{s}=0 \\tag{2.19}\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nIt is important to note that Eqs. 2.16-2.19 are not an independent set, as any one of the four can be derived from the other three. In any circuit with \\(n\\) nodes, \\(n-1\\) independent current equations can be derived from Kirchhoff's current law. ${ }^{1}$ Let's disregard Eq. 2.19, so that we have six independent equations, namely, Eqs. 2.13-2.18. We require one more, which we can derive from Kirchhoff's voltage law.\n\nBefore we can articulate Kirchhoff's voltage law, we must define a closed path or loop. Starting at an arbitrarily chosen node, we trace a closed path in the circuit through selected basic circuit elements and return to the original node without traversing any intermediate node more than once. The circuit depicted in Fig. 2.15 possesses only one closed path or loop. For instance, selecting node a as the starting point and tracing the circuit clockwise, we form the closed path by moving through nodes \\(\\mathrm{d}\\), \\(\\mathrm{c}\\), \\(\\mathrm{b}\\), and back to node a. We can now state Kirchhoff's voltage law:\n\nThe algebraic sum of all the voltages around any closed path in a circuit equals zero.\n\nTo apply Kirchhoff's voltage law, we must assign an algebraic sign (reference direction) to each voltage in the loop. As we trace a closed path, a voltage will manifest either as a rise or a drop in the tracing direction. Assigning a positive sign to a voltage rise requires assigning a negative sign to a voltage drop. Conversely, assigning a negative sign to a voltage rise requires assigning a positive sign to a voltage drop.\n\nWe now apply Kirchhoff's voltage law to the circuit depicted in Fig. 2.15. We opt to trace the closed path clockwise, assigning a positive algebraic sign to voltage drops. Starting at node d leads to the expression\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{l}-v_{c}+v_{1}-v_{s}=0 \\tag{2.20}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\n\nwhich represents the seventh independent equation needed to determine the seven unknown circuit variables mentioned earlier.\n\nThe prospect of having to solve seven simultaneous equations to determine the current delivered by a pair of dry cells to a flashlight lamp is not particularly enticing. Thus, in the subsequent chapters, we introduce you to analytical techniques that will enable you to solve a simple one-loop circuit by formulating a single equation. However, before delving into a discussion of these circuit techniques, we need to make several observations about the detailed analysis of the flashlight circuit. In general, these observations hold true and are therefore significant to the discussions in subsequent chapters. They also support the assertion that the flashlight circuit can be solved by defining a single unknown.\n\n[^0]Firstly, observe that if you know the current in a resistor, you also know the voltage across the resistor, as current and voltage are directly related through Ohm's law. Thus, you can associate one unknown variable with each resistor, either the current or the voltage. Suppose, for instance, we choose the current as the unknown variable. Then, once you solve for the unknown current in the resistor, you can determine the voltage across the resistor. Generally, if you know the current in a passive element, you can find the voltage across it, significantly reducing the number of simultaneous equations to be solved. For example, in the flashlight circuit, we eliminate the voltages \\(v_{c}\\), \\(v_{l}\\), and \\(v_{1}\\) as unknowns. Thus, at the outset, we reduce the analytical task to solving four simultaneous equations rather than seven.\n\nThe second general observation pertains to the implications of connecting only two elements to form a node. According to Kirchhoff's current law, when only two elements connect to a node, if you know the current in one of the elements, you also know it in the other element. In other words, you need to define only one unknown current for the two elements. When just two elements connect at a single node, the elements are said to be in series. The significance of this second observation becomes apparent when you note that each node in the circuit depicted in Fig. 2.15 involves only two elements. Thus, you need to define only one unknown current. The reason is that Eqs. 2.16-2.18 lead directly to\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{s}=i_{1}=-i_{c}=i_{l} \\tag{2.21}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\n\nwhich states that if you know any one of the element currents, you know them all. For example, choosing to use \\(i_{s}\\) as the unknown eliminates \\(i_{1}\\), \\(i_{c}\\), and \\(i_{l}\\). The problem is reduced to determining one unknown, namely, \\(i_{s}\\).\n\nExamples 2.6 and 2.7 illustrate how to formulate circuit equations based on Kirchhoff's laws.

    "text": "A circuit is considered solved when the voltage drop across and the current through each element have been calculated. Ohm's law is a crucial equation used to derive such solutions. However, it may not be sufficient to provide a complete solution. As we will see when attempting to solve the flashlight circuit from Example 2.4, we need to use two more important algebraic relationships, known as Kirchhoff's laws, to solve most circuits.\n\nWe start by redrawing the circuit as shown in Fig. 2.15, with the switch in the on position. We have also labeled the current and voltage variables associated with each resistor and the current associated with the voltage source. The labeling includes reference polarities, as always. For convenience, we attach the same subscript to the voltage and current labels as we do to the resistor labels. In Fig. 2.15, we have removed some of the terminal dots from Fig. 2.12 and have inserted nodes. Terminal dots are the start and end points of an individual circuit element. A node is a point where two or more circuit elements meet. It is necessary to identify nodes in order to use Kirchhoff's current law, as we will see in a moment. In Fig. 2.15, the nodes are labeled a, b, c, and d. Node d connects the battery and the lamp and essentially stretches all the way across the top of the diagram, although we label a single point for convenience. The dots on either side of the switch indicate its terminals, but only one is needed to represent a node, so only one is labeled node c.\n\nFor the circuit shown in Fig. 2.15, we can identify seven unknowns: $i_{s}, i_{1}, i_{c}, i_{l}, v_{1}, v_{c}$, and $v_{l}$. Recall that $v_{s}$ is a known voltage, as it represents the sum of the terminal voltages of the two dry cells, a constant voltage of 3 V . The problem is to find the seven unknown variables. From algebra, you know that to find $n$ unknown quantities you must solve $n$ simultaneous independent equations. From our discussion of Ohm's law in Section 2.2, you know that three of the necessary equations are\n\n$$\n\\begin{gather*}\nv_{1}=i_{1} R_{1}  \\tag{2.13}\\\\\nv_{c}=i_{c} R_{c}  \\tag{2.14}\\\\\nv_{l}=i_{l} R_{l} \\tag{2.15}\n\\end{gather*}\n$$\n\nWhat about the other four equations?\nThe interconnection of circuit elements imposes constraints on the relationship between the terminal voltages and currents. These constraints are referred to as Kirchhoff's laws, after Gustav Kirchhoff, who first stated them in a paper published in 1848. The two laws that state the constraints in mathematical form are known as Kirchhoff's current law and Kirchhoff's voltage law.\n\nWe can now state Kirchhoff's current law:\n\nThe algebraic sum of all the currents at any node in a circuit equals zero.\n\nTo use Kirchhoff's current law, an algebraic sign corresponding to a reference direction must be assigned to every current at the node. Assigning a positive sign to a current leaving a node requires assigning a negative sign to a current entering a node. Conversely, giving a negative sign to a current leaving a node requires giving a positive sign to a current entering a node.\nimage_name:Figure 2.15\ndescription:\n[\n'name': 'Vs', 'type': 'VoltageSource', 'value': 'Vs', 'ports': {'Np': 'd', 'Nn': 'a'\n'name': 'R1', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'R1', 'ports': {'N1': 'a', 'N2': 'b'\n'name': 'Rc', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'Rc', 'ports': {'N1': 'b', 'N2': 'c'\n'name': 'Rl', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'Rl', 'ports': {'N1': 'd', 'N2': 'c'\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit is a simple series circuit with a voltage source and three resistors. The nodes are labeled a, b, c, and d. Currents and voltages are assigned across each component.\n\nFigure 2.15 $\\triangle$ Circuit model of the flashlight with assigned voltage and current variables.\n\nKirchhoff's current law (KCL)\n\nKirchhoff's voltage law (KVL)\n\nApplying Kirchhoff's current law to the four nodes in the circuit shown in Fig. 2.15, using the convention that currents leaving a node are considered positive, yields four equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\text { node } \\mathrm{a} & i_{s}-i_{1}=0, \\\\\n\\text { node } \\mathrm{b} & i_{1}+i_{c}=0, \\\\\n\\text { node } \\mathrm{c} & -i_{c}-i_{l}=0 \\\\\n\\text { node } \\mathrm{d} & i_{l}-i_{s}=0 \\tag{2.19}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nNote that Eqs. 2.16-2.19 are not an independent set, because any one of the four can be derived from the other three. In any circuit with $n$ nodes, $n-1$ independent current equations can be derived from Kirchhoff's current law. ${ }^{1}$ Let's disregard Eq. 2.19 so that we have six independent equations, namely, Eqs. 2.13-2.18. We need one more, which we can derive from Kirchhoff's voltage law.\n\nBefore we can state Kirchhoff's voltage law, we must define a closed path or loop. Starting at an arbitrarily selected node, we trace a closed path in a circuit through selected basic circuit elements and return to the original node without passing through any intermediate node more than once. The circuit shown in Fig. 2.15 has only one closed path or loop. For example, choosing node a as the starting point and tracing the circuit clockwise, we form the closed path by moving through nodes $\\mathrm{d}, \\mathrm{c}, \\mathrm{b}$, and back to node a. We can now state Kirchhoff's voltage law:\n\nThe algebraic sum of all the voltages around any closed path in a circuit equals zero.\n\nTo use Kirchhoff's voltage law, we must assign an algebraic sign (reference direction) to each voltage in the loop. As we trace a closed path, a voltage will appear either as a rise or a drop in the tracing direction. Assigning a positive sign to a voltage rise requires assigning a negative sign to a voltage drop. Conversely, giving a negative sign to a voltage rise requires giving a positive sign to a voltage drop.\n\nWe now apply Kirchhoff's voltage law to the circuit shown in Fig. 2.15. We elect to trace the closed path clockwise, assigning a positive algebraic sign to voltage drops. Starting at node d leads to the expression\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{l}-v_{c}+v_{1}-v_{s}=0 \\tag{2.20}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhich represents the seventh independent equation needed to find the seven unknown circuit variables mentioned earlier.\n\nThe thought of having to solve seven simultaneous equations to find the current delivered by a pair of dry cells to a flashlight lamp is not very appealing. Thus in the coming chapters we introduce you to analytical techniques that will enable you to solve a simple one-loop circuit by writing a single equation. However, before moving on to a discussion of these circuit techniques, we need to make several observations about the detailed analysis of the flashlight circuit. In general, these observations are true and therefore are important to the discussions in subsequent chapters. They also support the contention that the flashlight circuit can be solved by defining a single unknown.\n\n[^0]First, note that if you know the current in a resistor, you also know the voltage across the resistor, because current and voltage are directly related through Ohm's law. Thus you can associate one unknown variable with each resistor, either the current or the voltage. Choose, say, the current as the unknown variable. Then, once you solve for the unknown current in the resistor, you can find the voltage across the resistor. In general, if you know the current in a passive element, you can find the voltage across it, greatly reducing the number of simultaneous equations to be solved. For example, in the flashlight circuit, we eliminate the voltages $v_{c}$, $v_{l}$, and $v_{1}$ as unknowns. Thus at the outset we reduce the analytical task to solving four simultaneous equations rather than seven.\n\nThe second general observation relates to the consequences of connecting only two elements to form a node. According to Kirchhoff's current law, when only two elements connect to a node, if you know the current in one of the elements, you also know it in the second element. In other words, you need define only one unknown current for the two elements. When just two elements connect at a single node, the elements are said to be in series. The importance of this second observation is obvious when you note that each node in the circuit shown in Fig. 2.15 involves only two elements. Thus you need to define only one unknown current. The reason is that Eqs. 2.16-2.18 lead directly to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{s}=i_{1}=-i_{c}=i_{l} \\tag{2.21}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhich states that if you know any one of the element currents, you know them all. For example, choosing to use $i_{s}$ as the unknown eliminates $i_{1}, i_{c}$, and $i_{l}$. The problem is reduced to determining one unknown, namely, $i_{s}$.\n\nExamples 2.6 and 2.7 illustrate how to write circuit equations based on Kirchhoff's laws. Example 2.8 illustrates how to use Kirchhoff's laws and Ohm's law to find an unknown current.

Starting at an arbitrarily selected node, we trace a closed path in a circuit through selected basic circuit elements and return to the original node without passing through any intermediate node more than once. The circuit depicted in Fig. 2.15 has only one closed path or loop. For instance, choosing node a as the starting point and tracing the circuit clockwise, we form the closed path by moving through nodes $\\mathrm{d}, \\mathrm{c}, \\mathrm{b}$, and back to node a. We can now state Kirchhoff's voltage law:\n\nThe algebraic sum of all the voltages around any closed path in a circuit equals zero.\n\nTo apply Kirchhoff's voltage law, we must assign an algebraic sign (reference direction) to each voltage in the loop. As we trace a closed path, a voltage will manifest either as a rise or a drop in the tracing direction. Assigning a positive sign to a voltage rise requires assigning a negative sign to a voltage drop. Conversely, assigning a negative sign to a voltage rise requires assigning a positive sign to a voltage drop.\n\nWe now apply Kirchhoff's voltage law to the circuit depicted in Fig. 2.15. We choose to trace the closed path clockwise, assigning a positive algebraic sign to voltage drops. Starting at node d leads to the expression\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{l}-v_{c}+v_{1}-v_{s}=0 \\tag{2.20}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhich represents the seventh independent equation needed to find the seven unknown circuit variables mentioned earlier.\n\nThe prospect of solving seven simultaneous equations to determine the current supplied by a pair of dry cells to a flashlight lamp is not particularly appealing. Thus, in the upcoming chapters, we introduce you to analytical techniques that will enable you to solve a simple one-loop circuit by writing a single equation. However, before progressing to a discussion of these circuit techniques, we need to make several observations about the detailed analysis of the flashlight circuit. In general, these observations are valid and therefore are significant to the discussions in subsequent chapters. They also support the assertion that the flashlight circuit can be solved by defining a single unknown.\n\n[^0]First, note that if you know the current in a resistor, you also know the voltage across the resistor, as current and voltage are directly related through Ohm's law. Thus, you can associate one unknown variable with each resistor, either the current or the voltage. Suppose, for instance, we choose the current as the unknown variable. Then, once you solve for the unknown current in the resistor, you can find the voltage across the resistor. Generally, if you know the current in a passive element, you can determine the voltage across it, significantly reducing the number of simultaneous equations to be solved. For example, in the flashlight circuit, we eliminate the voltages $v_{c}$, $v_{l}$, and $v_{1}$ as unknowns. Thus, at the outset, we reduce the analytical task to solving four simultaneous equations rather than seven.\n\nThe second general observation pertains to the implications of connecting only two elements to form a node. According to Kirchhoff's current law, when only two elements connect to a node, if you know the current in one of the elements, you also know it in the second element. In other words, you need to define only one unknown current for the two elements. When just two elements connect at a single node, the elements are said to be in series. The significance of this second observation becomes apparent when you realize that each node in the circuit depicted in Fig. 2.15 involves only two elements. Thus, you need to define only one unknown current. The reason is that Eqs. 2.16-2.18 lead directly to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{s}=i_{1}=-i_{c}=i_{l} \\tag{2.21}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhich states that if you know any one of the element currents, you know them all. For instance, choosing to use $i_{s}$ as the unknown eliminates $i_{1}, i_{c}$, and $i_{l}$. The problem is reduced to determining one unknown, namely, $i_{s}$.\n\nExamples 2.6 and 2.7 illustrate how to write circuit equations based on Kirchhoff's laws. Example 2.8 illustrates how to use Kirchhoff's laws and Ohm's law to find an unknown current. Example 2.9 expands on the technique presented in Example 2.5 for constructing a circuit model for a device whose terminal characteristics are known."

    "text": "A circuit is deemed resolved once the voltages across and the currents through every component are established. Ohm's law is a pivotal equation in deriving such solutions. However, it may not suffice to deliver a comprehensive solution on its own. As we will discover in our attempt to solve the flashlight circuit from Example 2.4, we must also employ two additional crucial algebraic relationships, known as Kirchhoff's laws, to tackle most circuits.\n\nWe initiate by redrafting the circuit as depicted in Fig. 2.15, with the switch in the activated state. It should be noted that we have labeled the current and voltage variables corresponding to each resistor and the current associated with the voltage source. This labeling includes reference polarities, as per usual. For convenience, we append the same subscript to the voltage and current labels as we do to the resistor labels. In Fig. 2.15, we have also eliminated some of the terminal dots from Fig. 2.12 and have introduced nodes. Terminal dots signify the commencement and termination points of an individual circuit element. A node is a point where two or more circuit elements intersect. It is imperative to identify nodes to utilize Kirchhoff's current law, as we will soon observe. In Fig. 2.15, the nodes are denoted as a, b, c, and d. Node d connects the battery and the lamp and effectively spans the entire upper portion of the diagram, although we label a single point for convenience. The dots on either side of the switch denote its terminals, but only one is necessary to represent a node, hence only one is labeled as node c.\n\nFor the circuit depicted in Fig. 2.15, we can identify seven unknowns: $i_{s}, i_{1}, i_{c}, i_{l}, v_{1}, v_{c}$, and $v_{l}$. It is worth recalling that $v_{s}$ is a known voltage, as it represents the cumulative terminal voltages of the two dry cells, a constant voltage of 3 V. The challenge lies in determining the seven unknown variables. From algebra, it is known that to ascertain $n$ unknown quantities, one must solve $n$ simultaneous independent equations. From our discourse on Ohm's law in Section 2.2, we know that three of the required equations are\n\n$$\n\\begin{gather*}\nv_{1}=i_{1} R_{1}  \\tag{2.13}\\\\\nv_{c}=i_{c} R_{c}  \\tag{2.14}\\\\\nv_{l}=i_{l} R_{l} \\tag{2.15}\n\\end{gather*}\n$$\n\nBut what about the remaining four equations?\nThe interconnection of circuit elements imposes constraints on the relationship between the terminal voltages and currents. These constraints are referred to as Kirchhoff's laws, named after Gustav Kirchhoff, who first proposed them in a paper published in 1848. The two laws that articulate these constraints in mathematical form are known as Kirchhoff's current law and Kirchhoff's voltage law.\n\nWe can now articulate Kirchhoff's current law:\n\nThe algebraic sum of all the currents at any node in a circuit equals zero.\n\nTo apply Kirchhoff's current law, an algebraic sign corresponding to a reference direction must be allocated to every current at the node. Assigning a positive sign to a current exiting a node necessitates assigning a negative sign to a current entering the node. Conversely, assigning a negative sign to a current exiting a node requires assigning a positive sign to a current entering the node.\n\nApplying Kirchhoff's current law to the four nodes in the circuit depicted in Fig. 2.15, using the convention that currents exiting a node are deemed positive, yields four equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\text { node } \\mathrm{a} & i_{s}-i_{1}=0, \\\\\n\\text { node } \\mathrm{b} & i_{1}+i_{c}=0, \\\\\n\\text { node } \\mathrm{c} & -i_{c}-i_{l}=0 \\\\\n\\text { node } \\mathrm{d} & i_{l}-i_{s}=0 \\tag{2.19}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nIt should be noted that Eqs. 2.16-2.19 are not an independent set, as any one of the four can be derived from the other three. In any circuit with $n$ nodes, $n-1$ independent current equations can be derived from Kirchhoff's current law. ${ }^{1}$ Let's disregard Eq. 2.19 so that we are left with six independent equations, namely, Eqs. 2.13-2.18.

We opt to trace the closed path clockwise, assigning a positive algebraic sign to voltage drops. Commencing at node d leads to the expression\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{l}-v_{c}+v_{1}-v_{s}=0 \\tag{2.20}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhich represents the seventh independent equation needed to determine the seven unknown circuit variables mentioned earlier.\n\nThe prospect of solving seven simultaneous equations to ascertain the current delivered by a pair of dry cells to a flashlight lamp is not particularly enticing.

Recall that $v_{s}$ is a known voltage, as it represents the sum of the terminal voltages of the two dry cells, a constant voltage of 3 V. The problem is to find the seven unknown variables. From algebra, you know that to find $n$ unknown quantities you must solve $n$ simultaneous independent equations. From our discussion of Ohm's law in Section 2.2, you know that three of the necessary equations are\n\n$$\n\\begin{gather*}\nv_{1}=i_{1} R_{1}  \\tag{2.13}\\\\\nv_{c}=i_{c} R_{c}  \\tag{2.14}\\\\\nv_{l}=i_{l} R_{l} \\tag{2.15}\n\\end{gather*}\n$$\n\nWhat about the other four equations? The interconnection of circuit elements imposes constraints on the relationship between the terminal voltages and currents. These constraints are referred to as Kirchhoff's laws, after Gustav Kirchhoff, who first stated them in a paper published in 1848. The two laws that state the constraints in mathematical form are known as Kirchhoff's current law and Kirchhoff's voltage law.\n\nWe can now state Kirchhoff's current law:\n\nThe algebraic sum of all the currents at any node in a circuit equals zero.\n\nTo use Kirchhoff's current law, an algebraic sign corresponding to a reference direction must be assigned to every current at the node. Assigning a positive sign to a current leaving a node requires assigning a negative sign to a current entering a node. Conversely, giving a negative sign to a current leaving a node requires giving a positive sign to a current entering a node.\n\nKir\nA circuit is deemed solved when the voltage across each component and the current flowing through them have been ascertained. Ohm's law is a key equation for deriving such solutions. Nonetheless, Ohm's law may not be adequate to furnish a comprehensive solution. As we shall witness when attempting to resolve the flashlight circuit from Example 2.4, we require the utilization of two additional significant algebraic relationships, known as Kirchhoff's laws, to solve the majority of circuits.\n\nWe initiate by redrafting the circuit as depicted in Fig. 2.15, with the switch in the activated state. Observe that we have also designated the current and voltage variables corresponding to each resistor and the current associated with the voltage source. Designation includes reference polarities, as is customary. For expedience, we append the same subscript to the voltage and current designations as we do to the resistor designations. In Fig. 2.15, we have also excised some of the terminal dots from Fig. 2.12 and have inserted nodes. Terminal dots demarcate the commencement and conclusion points of an individual circuit element. A node is a juncture where two or more circuit elements converge. It is imperative to identify nodes to apply Kirchhoff's current law, as we shall shortly observe. In Fig. 2.15, the nodes are denoted as a, b, c, and d. Node d interconnects the battery and the lamp and essentially spans the entirety of the diagram's apex, although we denote a solitary point for convenience. The dots flanking the switch signify its terminals, yet only one is necessary to denote a node, hence only one is labeled as node c.\n\nFor the circuit depicted in Fig. 2.15, we can pinpoint seven unknowns: $i_{s}, i_{1}, i_{c}, i_{l}, v_{1}, v_{c}$, and $v_{l}$. Recall that $v_{s}$ is a known voltage, representing the cumulative terminal voltages of the two dry cells, a constant voltage of 3 V. The challenge lies in determining the seven unknown variables. Algebraically, it is understood that to determine $n$ unknown quantities, one must solve $n$ simultaneous independent equations. From our discourse on Ohm's law in Section 2.2, it is known that three of the requisite equations are\n\n$$\n\\begin{gather*}\nv_{1}=i_{1} R_{1}  \\tag{2.13}\\\\\nv_{c}=i_{c} R_{c}  \\tag{2.14}\\\\\nv_{l}=i_{l} R_{l} \\tag{2.15}\n\\end{gather*}\n$$\n\nRegarding the remaining four equations, the interconnection of circuit elements imposes limitations on the relationship between the terminal voltages and currents. These limitations are referred to as Kirchhoff's laws, named after Gustav Kirchhoff, who initially proposed them in a 1848 publication. The two laws that articulate these limitations in mathematical terms are known as Kirchhoff's current law and Kirchhoff's voltage law.\n\nWe can now articulate Kirchhoff's current law:\n\nThe algebraic sum of all currents at any node within a circuit is zero.\n\nTo employ Kirchhoff's current law, an algebraic sign corresponding to a reference direction must be ascribed to each current at the node. Ascribing a positive sign to a current exiting a node necessitates ascribing a negative sign to a current entering the node. Similarly, assigning a negative sign to a current exiting a node requires assigning a positive sign to a current entering the node."

However, Ohm's law may not be sufficient to provide a complete solution. As we shall see in trying to solve the flashlight circuit from Example 2.4, we need to use two more important algebraic relationships, known as Kirchhoff's laws, to solve most circuits.\n\nWe start by redrawing the circuit as shown in Fig. 2.15, with the switch in the on state. Note that we have also labeled the current and voltage variables associated with each resistor and the current associated with the voltage source. Labeling includes reference polarities, as always. For convenience, we attach the same subscript to the voltage and current labels as we do to the resistor labels. In Fig. 2.15, we have also removed some of the terminal dots of Fig. 2.12 and have inserted nodes. Terminal dots are the start and end points of an individual circuit element. A node is a point where two or more circuit elements meet. It is necessary to identify nodes in order to use Kirchhoff's current law, as we will see in a moment. In Fig. 2.15, the nodes are labeled a, b, c, and d.

These constraints are referred to as Kirchhoff's laws, after Gustav Kirchhoff, who first stated them in a paper published in 1848. The two laws that state the constraints in mathematical form are known as Kirchhoff's current law and Kirchhoff's voltage law.\n\nWe can now state Kirchhoff's current law:\n\nThe algebraic sum of all the currents at any node in a circuit equals zero.\n\nTo use Kirchhoff's current law, an algebraic sign corresponding to a reference direction must be assigned to every current at the node. Assigning a positive sign to a current leaving a node requires assigning a negative sign to a current entering a node. Conversely, giving a negative sign to a current leaving a node requires giving a positive sign to a current entering a node.\n\nApplying Kirchhoff's current law to the four nodes in the circuit shown in Fig. 2.15, using the convention that currents leaving a node are considered positive, yields four equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\text { node } \\mathrm{a} & i_{s}-i_{1}=0, \\\\\n\\text { node } \\mathrm{b} & i_{1}+i_{c}=0, \\\\\n\\text { node } \\mathrm{c} & -i_{c}-i_{l}=0 \\\\\n\\text { node } \\mathrm{d} & i_{l}-i_{s}=0 \\tag{2.19}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nNote that Eqs. 2.16-2.19 are not an independent set, because any one of the four can be derived from the other three. In any circuit with $n$ nodes, $n-1$ independent current equations can be derived from Kirchhoff's current law. ${ }^{1}$ Let's disregard Eq. 2.19 so that we have six independent equations, namely, Eqs. 2.13-2.18. We need one more, which we can derive from Kirchhoff's voltage law.\n\nBefore we can state Kirchhoff's voltage law, we must define a closed path or loop. Starting at an arbitrarily selected node, we trace a closed path in a circuit through selected basic circuit elements and return to the original node without passing through any intermediate node more than once. The circuit shown in Fig. 2.15 has only one closed path or loop. For example, choosing node a as the starting point and tracing the circuit clockwise, we form the closed path by moving through nodes $\\mathrm{d}, \\mathrm{c}, \\mathrm{b}$, and back to node a. We can now state Kirchhoff's voltage law:\n\nThe algebraic sum of all the voltages around any closed path in a circuit equals zero.\n\nTo use Kirchhoff's voltage law, we must assign an algebraic sign (reference direction) to each voltage in the loop. As we trace a closed path, a voltage will appear either as a rise or a drop in the tracing direction. Assigning a positive sign to a voltage rise requires assigning a negative sign to a voltage drop. Conversely, giving a negative sign to a voltage rise requires giving a positive sign to a voltage drop.\n\nWe now apply Kirchhoff's voltage law to the circuit shown in Fig. 2.15. We elect to trace the closed path clockwise, assigning a positive algebraic sign to voltage drops. Starting at node d leads to the expression\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{l}-v_{c}+v_{1}-v_{s}=0 \\tag{2.20}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhich represents the seventh independent equation needed to find the seven unknown circuit variables mentioned earlier.\n\nThe thought of having to solve seven simultaneous equations to find the current delivered by a pair of dry cells to a flashlight lamp is not very appealing. Thus in the coming chapters we introduce you to analytical techniques that will enable you to solve a simple one-loop circuit by writing a single equation. However, before moving on to a discussion of these circuit techniques, we need to make several observations about the detailed analysis of the flashlight circuit. In general, these observations are true and therefore are important to the discussions in subsequent chapters. They also support the contention that the flashlight circuit can be solved by defining a single unknown.\n\n[^0]First, note that if you know the current in a resistor, you also know the voltage across the resistor, because current and voltage are directly related through Ohm's law. Thus you can associate one unknown variable with each resistor, either the current or the voltage. Choose, say, the current as the unknown variable. Then, once you solve for the unknown current in the resistor, you can find the voltage across the resistor. In general, if you know the current in a passive element, you can find the voltage across it, greatly reducing the number of simultaneous equations to be solved. For example, in the flashlight circuit, we eliminate the voltages $v_{c}$, $v_{l}$, and $v_{1}$ as unknowns. Thus at the outset we reduce the analytical task to solving four simultaneous equations rather than seven.\n\nThe second general observation relates to the consequences of connecting only two elements to form a node. According to Kirchhoff's current law, when only two elements connect to a node, if you know the current in one of the elements, you also know it in the second element. In other words, you need define only one unknown current for the two elements. When just two elements connect at a single node, the elements are said to be in series. The importance of this second observation is obvious when you note that each node in the circuit shown in Fig. 2.15 involves only two elements. Thus you need to define only one unknown current. The reason is that Eqs. 2.16-2.18 lead directly to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{s}=i_{1}=-i_{c}=i_{l} \\tag{2.21}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhich states that if you know any one of the element currents, you know them all. For example, choosing to use $i_{s}$ as the unknown eliminates $i_{1}, i_{c}$, and $i_{l}$. The problem is reduced to determining one unknown, namely, $i_{s}$.\n\nExamples 2.6 and 2.7 illustrate how to write circuit equations based on Kirchhoff's laws. Example 2.8 illustrates how to use Kirchhoff's laws and Ohm's law to find an unknown current. Example 2.9 expands on the technique presented in Example 2.5 for constructing a circuit model for a device whose terminal characteristics are known."

Conversely, assigning a negative sign to a current exiting a node necessitates assigning a positive sign to a current entering the node.\n\nWe now proceed to delineate the circuit depicted in Fig. 2.15, employing the convention that currents exiting a node are deemed positive, yielding four equations:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\text { node } \\mathrm{a} & i_{s}-i_{1}=0, \\\\\n\\text { node } \\mathrm{b} & i_{1}+i_{c}=0, \\\\\n\\text { node } \\mathrm{c} & -i_{c}-i_{l}=0 \\\\\n\\text { node } \\mathrm{d} & i_{l}-i_{s}=0 \\tag{2.19}\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nIt should be noted that Eqs. 2.16-2.19 do not constitute an independent set, since any one of the four can be inferred from the other three.

Commencing at an arbitrarily chosen node, we trace a closed path in the circuit through selected fundamental circuit elements and return to the original node without traversing any intermediate node more than once. The circuit depicted in Fig. 2.15 encompasses a solitary closed path or loop. For instance, selecting node a as the starting point and tracing the circuit clockwise, we form the closed path by navigating through nodes \\(\\mathrm{d}\\), \\(\\mathrm{c}\\), \\(\\mathrm{b}\\), and back to node a. We can now articulate Kirchhoff's voltage law:\n\nThe algebraic sum of all the voltages around any closed path in a circuit is zero.\n\nTo invoke Kirchhoff's voltage law, we must allocate an algebraic sign (reference direction) to each voltage in the loop.

Assigning a positive sign to a voltage ascent necessitates assigning a negative sign to a voltage descent. Conversely, assigning a negative sign to a voltage ascent necessitates assigning a positive sign to a voltage descent.\n\nWe now apply Kirchhoff's voltage law to the circuit depicted in Fig. 2.15. We opt to trace the closed path clockwise, assigning a positive algebraic sign to voltage descents. Commencing at node d leads to the expression\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{l}-v_{c}+v_{1}-v_{s}=0 \\tag{2.20}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\n\nwhich signifies the seventh independent equation required to ascertain the seven unknown circuit variables mentioned previously.\n\nThe prospect of resolving seven simultaneous equations to ascertain the current supplied by a pair of dry cells to a flashlight lamp is not particularly enticing. Hence, in subsequent chapters, we introduce you to analytical techniques that will empower you to resolve a simple one-loop circuit by formulating a solitary equation. However, before advancing to a discourse on these circuit techniques, it is necessary to make several observations regarding the meticulous analysis of the flashlight circuit. Generally, these observations hold true and are therefore pertinent to the discussions in subsequent chapters. They also substantiate the assertion that the flashlight circuit can be resolved by defining a single unknown.\n\n[^0]Firstly, it should be noted that if the current in a resistor is known, the voltage drop across the resistor is also known, since current and voltage are directly correlated through Ohm's law. Thus, one can associate one unknown variable with each resistor, either the current or the voltage. Suppose, for instance, the current is chosen as the unknown variable. Then, once the unknown current in the resistor is resolved, the voltage drop across the resistor can be ascertained. Generally, if the current in a passive element is known, the voltage across it can be determined, substantially reducing the number of simultaneous equations to be solved. For example, in the flashlight circuit, we eliminate the voltages \\(v_{c}\\), \\(v_{l}\\), and \\(v_{1}\\) as unknowns. Thus, at the outset, we diminish the analytical task to resolving four simultaneous equations instead of seven.\n\nThe second general observation pertains to the repercussions of connecting only two elements to form a node. According to Kirchhoff's current law, when merely two elements connect to a node, if the current in one of the elements is known, the current in the second element is also known. In other words, only one unknown current needs to be defined for the two elements. When just two elements connect at a single node, the elements are said to be in series. The significance of this second observation becomes apparent when it is noted that each node in the circuit depicted in Fig. 2.15 involves only two elements. Thus, only one unknown current needs to be defined. The reason is that Eqs. 2.16-2.18 directly lead to\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{s}=i_{1}=-i_{c}=i_{l} \\tag{2.21}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\n\nwhich signifies that if the current in any one of the elements is known, all the element currents are known. For example, opting to utilize \\(i_{s}\\) as the unknown eliminates \\(i_{1}\\), \\(i_{c}\\), and \\(i_{l}\\). The problem is thereby reduced to determining a single unknown, namely, \\(i_{s}\\).\n\nExamples 2.6 and 2.7 illustrate how to formulate circuit equations based on Kirchhoff's laws. Example 2.8 illustrates how to employ Kirchhoff's laws and Ohm's law to ascertain an unknown current. Example 2.9 expands on the technique presented in Example 2.5 for constructing a circuit model for a device whose terminal characteristics are known.\n\n#### Example 2.6 Utilizing Kirchhoff's Current Law\n\nAggregate the currents at each node in the circuit depicted in Fig. 2.16.

This examination will aid in formulating a strategy for solving the circuit with minimal calculations.\n\nFrom the diagram, we can infer the following relationships:\n\n- The voltage 'v_o' can be determined once we know the current 'i_o'.\n- The current through the dependent source, '5iΔ', can be determined once we know 'iΔ'.\n- The current in the 500 V source is 'iΔ'.\n\nThese observations indicate that there are two unknown currents, 'iΔ' and 'i_o', which necessitate the formulation and solution of two independent equations to find 'v_o'.\n\nBy observing the closed loop that includes the voltage source and both resistors, we can apply Kirchhoff's voltage law to create the first equation involving the two unknown currents:\n\n500 = 5iΔ + 20i_o\n\nFor the second equation, we consider the loop consisting of the 20 Ω resistor and the dependent current source. However, applying Kirchhoff's voltage law here does not yield a useful equation since the voltage across the dependent source is unknown and is actually 'v_o', the voltage we aim to calculate. Therefore, we must look elsewhere for our second equation.\n\nGiven that there are three nodes in the circuit, we can turn to Kirchhoff's current law to generate the second equation. Node 'a' connects the voltage source and the 5 Ω resistor, and the current through these elements is the same. We can choose either node 'b' or 'c' to apply Kirchhoff's current law, and we opt for node 'b', leading to the following equation:\n\ni_o = iΔ + 5iΔ = 6iΔ\n\nSolving these two equations for the currents, we find:\n\niΔ = 4 A\ni_o = 24 A\n\nUsing the value of 'i_o' and Ohm's law for the 20 Ω resistor, we can calculate 'v_o':\n\nv_o = 20i_o = 480 V\n\nThe analysis strategy, as demonstrated, shows that not every closed path or node provides a straightforward application of Kirchhoff's laws. A thoughtful approach and the selection of appropriate analysis tools can significantly simplify the problem-solving process. Additional examples are provided to illustrate further applications of Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's laws in circuits with dependent sources.\n\nFurther examples and practical perspectives are presented to reinforce the concepts, including the analysis of circuits with various configurations and the calculation of power in electric circuits. These examples highlight the importance of considering the circuit's configuration and the impact it has on the total power available for applications such as heating with electric radiators."

Since there are two closed paths and both have voltage sources, we can apply Kirchhoff's voltage law to each, resulting in the following equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n10 &= 6i_s \\\\\n3i_s &= 2i_o + 3i_o\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSolving for the currents gives:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ni_s &= 1.67 \\mathrm{~A} \\\\\ni_o &= 1 \\mathrm{~A}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nApplying Ohm's law to the \\( 3 \\Omega \\) resistor gives the desired voltage:\n\n$$\nv_o = 3i_o = 3 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nb) To compute the power delivered to the voltage sources, we use the power equation in the form \\( p = vi \\). The power delivered to the independent voltage source is:\n\n$$\np = (10)(-1.67) = -16.7 \\mathrm{~W}\n$$\n\nThe power delivered to the dependent voltage source is:\n\n$$\np = (3i_s)(-i_o) = (5)(-1) = -5 \\mathrm{~W}\n$$\n\nBoth sources are developing power, and the total developed power is 21.7 W.\n\nTo compute the power delivered to the resistors, we use the power equation in the form \\( p = i^2R \\). The power delivered to the \\( 6 \\Omega \\) resistor is:\n\n$$\np = (1.67)^2(6) = 16.7 \\mathrm{~W}\n$$\n\nThe power delivered to the \\( 2 \\Omega \\) resistor is:\n\n$$\np = (1)^2(2) = 2 \\mathrm{~W}\n$$\n\nThe power delivered to the \\( 3 \\Omega \\) resistor is:\n\n$$\np = (1)^2(3) = 3 \\mathrm{~W}\n$$\n\nThe resistors all dissipate power, and the total power dissipated is 21.7 W, equal to the total power developed in the sources.\n\n#### Example 2.11: Applying Ohm's Law and Kirchhoff's Law in an Amplifier Circuit\n\nThe circuit in Figure 2.24 represents a common configuration encountered in the analysis and design of transistor amplifiers. Assume that the values of all the circuit elements \\( -R_1, R_2, R_C, R_E, V_{CC}, \\) and \\( V_0 \\) are known.\n\na) Develop the equations needed to determine the current in each element of this circuit.\nb) From these equations, devise a formula for computing \\( i_B \\) in terms of the circuit element values.\n\nFigure 2.24 depicts the circuit for Example 2.11.\n\n#### Solution\n\nA careful examination of the circuit reveals a total of six unknown currents, designated \\( i_1, i_2, i_B, i_C, i_E, \\) and \\( i_{CC} \\). In defining these six unknown currents, we used the observation that the resistor \\( R_C \\) is in series with the dependent current source \\( \\beta i_B \\). We now need to derive six independent equations involving these six unknowns.\n\na) We can derive three equations by applying Kirchhoff's current law to any three of the nodes \\( a, b, c, \\) and d. Let's use nodes a, b, and c and label the currents away from the nodes as positive:\n\n(1) \\( i_1 + i_C - i_{CC} = 0 \\),\n(2) \\( i_B + i_2 - i_1 = 0 \\),\n(3) \\( i_E - i_B - i_C = 0 \\).\n\nA fourth equation results from imposing the constraint presented by the series connection of \\( R_C \\) and the dependent source:\n\n(4) \\( i_C = \\beta i_B \\).\n\nWe turn to Kirchhoff's voltage law in deriving the remaining two equations. We need to select two closed paths in order to use Kirchhoff's voltage law. Note that the voltage across the dependent current source is unknown, and it cannot be determined from the source current \\( \\beta i_B \\). Therefore, we must select two closed paths that do not contain this dependent current source.\n\nWe choose the paths bcdb and badb and specify voltage drops as positive to yield:\n\n(5) \\( V_0 + i_E R_E - i_2 R_2 = 0 \\),\n(6) \\( -i_1 R_1 + V_{CC} - i_2 R_2 = 0 \\).\n\nb) To get a single equation for \\( i_B \\) in terms of the known circuit variables, follow these steps:\n\n- Solve Eq. (6) for \\( i_1 \\), and substitute this solution for \\( i_1 \\) into Eq. (2).\n- Solve the transformed Eq. (2) for \\( i_2 \\), and substitute this solution for \\( i_2 \\) into Eq. (5).\n- Solve the transformed Eq. (5) for \\( i_E \\), and substitute this solution for \\( i_E \\) into Eq. (3). Use Eq. (4) to eliminate \\( i_C \\) in Eq. (3).\n- Solve the transformed Eq. (3) for \\( i_B \\), and rearrange the terms to yield:\n\n$$\ni_B = \\frac{\\left(V_{CC} R_2\\right) / \\left(R_1 + R_2\\right) - V_0}{\\left(R_1 R_2\\right) / \\left(R_1 + R_2\\right) + (1 + \\beta) R_E} \\tag{2.25}\n$$\n\nProblem 2.31 asks you to verify these steps. Note that once \\( i_B \\) is known, we can easily obtain the remaining currents.\n\n### ASSESSMENT PROBLEMS\n\nObjective 3: Calculate power for each element in a simple circuit\n\n2.9 For the circuit shown, find (a) the current \\( i_1 \\) in microamperes, (b) the voltage \\( v \\) in volts, (c) the total power generated, and (d) the total power absorbed.\n\nAnswer: (a) \\( 25 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} \\);\n(b) -2 V;\n(c) \\( 6150 \\mu \\mathrm{~W} \\);\n(d) \\( 6150 \\mu \\mathrm{~W} \\).\n\n2.10 The current \\( i_{\\phi} \\) in the circuit shown is 2 A. Calculate:\na) \\( v_s \\),\nb) the power absorbed by the independent voltage source,\n\nc) the power delivered by the independent current source,\nd) the power delivered by the controlled current source,\ne) the total power dissipated in the two resistors.\n\nAnswer: (a) 70 V;\n(b) 210 W;\n(c) 300 W;\n(d) 40 W;\n(e) 130 W.\n\n### Practical Perspective\n\nHeating with Electric Radiators\n\nLet's determine which of the two wiring diagrams introduced at the beginning of this chapter should be used to wire the electric radiators to the power supplied to the garage. We begin with the diagram shown in Figure 2.25. We can turn this into a circuit by modeling the radiators as resistors. The resulting circuit is shown in Figure 2.26. Note that each radiator has the same resistance \\( R \\) and is labeled with a voltage and current value.\n\nFigure 2.25 shows a wiring diagram for two radiators.\n\nFigure 2.26 shows a circuit based on Figure 2.25.\n\nTo find the unknown voltages and currents for the circuit in Figure 2.26, start by writing a KVL equation for the left side of the circuit:\n\n$$\n-240 + v_1 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_1 = 240 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nNow write a KVL equation for the right side of this circuit:\n\n$$\n-v_1 + v_2 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_2 = v_1 = 240 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nRemember that the power and voltage specifications for each radiator are 1200 W and 240 V, respectively. Therefore, the configuration shown in Figure 2.25 satisfies the voltage specification, since each radiator would have a supplied voltage of 240 V.\n\nNext, calculate the value of resistance \\( R \\) that will correctly model each radiator. We want the power associated with each radiator to be 1200 W. Use the equation for resistor power that involves the resistance and the voltage:\n\n$$\nP_1 = \\frac{v_1^2}{R} = \\frac{v_2^2}{R} = P_2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad R = \\frac{v_1^2}{P_1} = \\frac{240^2}{1200} = 48 \\Omega\n$$\n\nEach radiator can be modeled as a \\( 48 \\Omega \\) resistor with a voltage drop of 240 V and power of 1200 W. The total power for two radiators is thus 2400 W.\n\nFinally, calculate the power supplied by the 240 V source. To do this, calculate the current in the voltage source \\( i_{s'} \\) by writing a KCL equation at the top node in Figure 2.26, and use that current to calculate the power for the voltage source:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n-i_s + i_1 + i_2 = 0 \\Rightarrow i_s = i_1 + i_2 = \\frac{v_1}{R} + \\frac{v_2}{R} = \\frac{240}{48} + \\frac{240}{48} = 10 \\mathrm{~A} \\\\\nP_s = -(240)i_s = -(240)(10) = -2400 \\mathrm{~W}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nThus, the total power in the circuit is \\( -2400 + 2400 = 0 \\), so the power balances.\n\nNow consider the other wiring diagram for the radiators, shown in Figure 2.27. We know that the radiators can be modeled using \\( 48 \\Omega \\) resistors, which are used to turn the wiring diagram into the circuit in Figure 2.28.\n\nStart analyzing the circuit in Figure 2.28 by writing a KVL equation:\n\n$$\n-240 + v_x + v_y = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_x + v_y = 240\n$$\n\nNext, write a KCL equation at the node labeled a:\n\n$$\n-i_x + i_y = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad i_x = i_y = i\n$$\n\nThe current in the two resistors is the same, and we can use that current in Ohm's Law equations to replace the two unknown voltages in the KVL equation:\n\n$$\n48i = 48i = 240 = 96i \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad i = \\frac{240}{96} = 2.5 \\mathrm{~A}\n$$\n\nUse the current in the two resistors to calculate the power for the two radiators:\n\n$$\nP_x = P_y = R i^2 = (48)(2.5)^2 = 300 \\mathrm{~W}\n$$\n\nThus, if the radiators are wired as shown in Figure 2.27, their total power will be only 600 W. This is insufficient to heat the garage.\n\nTherefore, the way the radiators are wired significantly impacts the amount of heat supplied. When they are wired using the diagram in Figure 2.25, 2400 W of power will be available, but when they are wired using the diagram in Figure 2.27, only 600 W of power will be available.\n\n### Note\n\nAssess your understanding of the Practical Perspective by solving Chapter Problems 2.41-2.43."

As demonstrated, not every closed path allows for a useful equation based on Kirchhoff's voltage law, and not every node provides a useful application of Kirchhoff's current law. Some initial contemplation of the problem can guide the selection of the most productive approach and the most suitable analysis tools for a specific problem.

We must establish and solve two independent equations involving these currents to find the value of vo.\n\nUpon examining the circuit, we notice a closed loop encompassing the voltage source, the 5 Ω resistor, and the 20 Ω resistor. Kirchhoff's voltage law can be applied to this loop, resulting in an equation involving the two unknown currents:\n\n$$\n500 = 5i_{\\Delta} + 20i_{o} \\tag{2.22}\n$$\n\nTo develop a second equation involving these currents, we consider the closed loop formed by the 20 Ω resistor and the dependent current source. Attempting to apply Kirchhoff's voltage law to this loop does not yield a useful equation because the voltage across the dependent source is unknown; it is, in fact, vo, the very voltage we seek. Consequently, formulating an equation for this loop does not aid in our quest for a solution. For this same reason, the closed loop containing the voltage source, the 5 Ω resistor, and the dependent source is also not utilized.\n\nThe circuit has three nodes, prompting us to employ Kirchhoff's current law to derive the second equation. Node a connects the voltage source and the 5 Ω resistor; as previously noted, the current through these elements is identical. We can choose either node b or node c to construct the second equation from Kirchhoff's current law. Selecting node b, we arrive at the following equation:\n\n$$\ni_{o} = i_{\\Delta} + 5i_{\\Delta} = 6i_{\\Delta} \\tag{2.23}\n$$\n\nBy solving Equations 2.22 and 2.23 for the currents, we obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ni_{\\Delta} & = 4 \\mathrm{~A} \\\\\ni_{o} & = 24 \\mathrm{~A} \\tag{2.24}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nUtilizing Equation 2.24 and Ohm's law for the 20 Ω resistor, we can calculate the voltage vo:\n\n$$\nv_{o} = 20i_{o} = 480 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nIt is beneficial to strategize the circuit analysis approach before commencing with equation formulation. As demonstrated, not every closed path allows for a meaningful equation based on Kirchhoff's voltage law, nor does every node provide a practical application of Kirchhoff's current law. Some forethought into the problem can streamline the selection of the most productive approach and the most suitable analysis tools for a given problem. Selecting an optimal approach and the right tools can frequently simplify the number and complexity of the equations that need to be solved.\n\n**Example 2.10** and **Example 2.11** illustrate further applications of Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's laws to circuits containing dependent sources. These examples demonstrate that with a well-thought-out strategy and the appropriate tools, analyzing even complex circuits can be relatively straightforward.\n\n---"

We conclude our introduction to basic circuit analysis by examining this circuit.\n\nWe aim to apply Kirchhoff's laws and Ohm's law to determine $v_{o}$ in this circuit. Before formulating equations, it is beneficial to study the circuit diagram meticulously. This aids in identifying known information and the quantities we need to calculate. It may also help in formulating a strategy to solve the circuit using minimal calculations.\n\nAnalyzing the circuit in Figure 2.22, we observe that:\n\n- Once we know $i_{o}$, we can determine $v_{o}$ using Ohm's law.\n- Once we know $i_{\\Delta}$, we also know the current supplied by the dependent source $5 i_{\\Delta}$.\n- The current in the 500 V source is $i_{\\Delta}$.\n\nThus, there are two unknown currents, $i_{\\Delta}$ and $i_{o}$. We need to establish and solve two independent equations involving these two currents to find a value for $v_{o}$.\n\nConsidering the closed path that encompasses the voltage source, the $5 \\Omega$ resistor, and the $20 \\Omega$ resistor in the circuit, we can apply Kirchhoff's voltage law around this path. The resulting equation incorporates the two unknown currents:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n500=5 i_{\\Delta}+20 i_{o} \\tag{2.22}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nNext, we need to derive a second equation involving these two currents. Let's consider the closed path formed by the $20 \\Omega$ resistor and the dependent current source. Applying Kirchhoff's voltage law to this loop does not yield a meaningful equation since the voltage across the dependent source is unknown. In fact, the voltage across the dependent source is $v_{o}$, which is the voltage we are trying to find. Formulating an equation for this loop does not contribute to finding a solution. Similarly, we do not use the closed path containing the voltage source, the $5 \\Omega$ resistor, and the dependent source.\n\nThe circuit has three nodes, so we resort to Kirchhoff's current law to generate the second equation. Node a connects the voltage source and the $5 \\Omega$ resistor; as previously noted, the current in these two elements is identical. Either node b or node c can be utilized to derive the second equation from Kirchhoff's current law. We choose node b and obtain the following equation:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{o}=i_{\\Delta}+5 i_{\\Delta}=6 i_{\\Delta} \\tag{2.23}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSolving Eqs. 2.22 and 2.23 for the currents, we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ni_{\\Delta} & =4 \\mathrm{~A} \\\\\ni_{o} & =24 \\mathrm{~A} \\tag{2.24}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nUsing Eq. 2.24 and Ohm's law for the $20 \\Omega$ resistor, we can solve for the voltage $v_{o}$ :\n\n$$\nv_{o}=20 i_{o}=480 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nIt is important to strategize before beginning to write equations. As demonstrated, not every closed path allows for a useful equation based on Kirchhoff's voltage law. Similarly, not every node provides a useful application of Kirchhoff's current law. Some preliminary analysis of the problem can help in selecting the most effective approach and the most appropriate analysis tools for a particular problem. Choosing the right approach and tools can usually minimize the number and complexity of equations to be solved. Example 2.10 demonstrates another application of Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's laws to a circuit with a dependent source.

The dependent current source is controlled by the base current iB.\n\n\nFigure 2.24 The circuit for Example 2.11.\n\n#### Solution\n\nA careful examination of the circuit reveals a total of six unknown currents, designated $i_{1}, i_{2}, i_{B}, i_{C}, i_{E}$, and $i_{C C}$. In defining these six unknown currents, we used the observation that the resistor $R_{C}$ is in series with the dependent current source $\\beta i_{B}$. We now must derive six independent equations involving these six unknowns.\na) We can derive three equations by applying Kirchhoff's current law to any three of the nodes $\\mathrm{a}, \\mathrm{b}, \\mathrm{c}$, and d. Let's use nodes a, b, and c and label the currents away from the nodes as positive:\n(1) $i_{1}+i_{C}-i_{C C}=0$,\n(2) $i_{B}+i_{2}-i_{1}=0$,\n(3) $i_{E}-i_{B}-i_{C}=0$.\n\nA fourth equation results from imposing the constraint presented by the series connection of $R_{C}$ and the dependent source:\n(4) $i_{C}=\\beta i_{B}$.\n\nWe turn to Kirchhoff's voltage law in deriving the remaining two equations. We need to select two closed paths in order to use Kirchhoff's voltage law. Note that the voltage across the dependent current source is unknown, and that it cannot be determined from the source current $\\beta i_{B}$. Therefore, we must select two closed paths that do not contain this dependent current source.\n\nWe choose the paths bcdb and badb and specify voltage drops as positive to yield\n(5) $V_{0}+i_{E} R_{E}-i_{2} R_{2}=0$,\n(6) $-i_{1} R_{1}+V_{C C}-i_{2} R_{2}=0$.\nb) To obtain a single equation for $i_{B}$ in terms of the known circuit variables, you can follow these steps:\n\n- Solve Eq. (6) for $i_{1}$, and substitute this solution for $i_{1}$ into Eq. (2).\n- Solve the transformed Eq. (2) for $i_{2}$, and substitute this solution for $i_{2}$ into Eq. (5).\n- Solve the transformed Eq. (5) for $i_{E}$, and substitute this solution for $i_{E}$ into Eq. (3). Use Eq. (4) to eliminate $i_{C}$ in Eq. (3).\n- Solve the transformed Eq. (3) for $i_{B}$, and rearrange the terms to yield\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{B}=\\frac{\\left(V_{C C} R_{2}\\right) /\\left(R_{1}+R_{2}\\right)-V_{0}}{\\left(R_{1} R_{2}\\right) /\\left(R_{1}+R_{2}\\right)+(1+\\beta) R_{E}} \\tag{2.25}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nProblem 2.31 asks you to verify these steps. Note that once we know $i_{B}$, we can easily obtain the remaining currents.\n\nASSESSMENT PROBLEMS\n\nObjective 3-Know how to calculate power for each element in a simple circuit\n\n2.9 For the circuit shown find (a) the current $i_{1}$ in microamperes, (b) the voltage $v$ in volts, (c) the total power generated, and (d) the total power absorbed.\n\nAnswer: (a) $25 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$;\n(b) -2 V ;\n(c) $6150 \\mu \\mathrm{~W}$;\n(d) $6150 \\mu \\mathrm{~W}$.\nimage_name:2.9\ndescription:\n[\n'name': '54 kΩ', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '54 kΩ', 'ports': {'N1': 'X3', 'N2': 'X2'\n'name': '1 V', 'type': 'VoltageSource', 'value': '1 V', 'ports': {'Np': 'X1', 'Nn': 'X2'\n'name': '6 kΩ', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '6 kΩ', 'ports': {'N1': 'X1', 'N2': 'GND'\n'name': '30 i₁', 'type': 'VoltageControlledCurrentSource', 'value': '30 i₁', 'ports': {'Np': 'X4', 'Nn': 'X1'\n'name': '1.8 kΩ', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '1.8 kΩ', 'ports': {'N1': 'X4', 'N2': 'X5'\n'name': '5 V', 'type': 'VoltageSource', 'value': '5 V', 'ports': {'Np': 'X3', 'Nn': 'GND'\n'name': '8 V', 'type': 'VoltageSource', 'value': '8 V', 'ports': {'Np': 'X5', 'Nn': 'GND'\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit consists of resistors, independent voltage sources, and a voltage-controlled voltage source.

It is advisable to thoroughly inspect the circuit diagram initially. This meticulous analysis will assist in recognizing known information and calculating the necessary data. It can also aid in developing a strategic approach to solve the circuit with minimal calculations.\n\nA thorough examination of Fig. 2.22 indicates:\n\n- Once the current $i_{o}$ is known, the voltage $v_{o}$ can be calculated using Ohm's law.\n- Once the current $i_{\\Delta}$ is determined, the current supplied by the dependent source, $5i_{\\Delta}$, is also known.\n- The current through the 500 V source is $i_{\\Delta}$.\n\nThere are, therefore, two unknown currents, $i_{\\Delta}$ and $i_{o}$.

The circuit involves six unknown currents: i1, i2, iB, iC, iE, and iCC. The dependent current source is controlled by the base current iB.\n\nFigure 2.24 depicts the circuit for Example 2.11.\n\n#### Solution\n\nA careful examination of the circuit reveals six unknown currents labeled $i_{1}, i_{2}, i_{B}, i_{C}, i_{E}$, and $i_{C C}$. In defining these six unknown currents, we observed that the resistor $R_{C}$ is in series with the dependent current source $\\beta i_{B}$. We must now derive six independent equations involving these six unknowns.\n\nWe can derive three equations by applying Kirchhoff's current law to any three of the nodes (a, b, c, and d). Let's use nodes a, b, and c and label the currents away from the nodes as positive:\n\n(1) $i_{1}+i_{C}-i_{C C}=0$,\n\n(2) $i_{B}+i_{2}-i_{1}=0$,\n\n(3) $i_{E}-i_{B}-i_{C}=0$.\n\nA fourth equation results from the constraint presented by the series connection of $R_{C}$ and the dependent source:\n\n(4) $i_{C}=\\beta i_{B}$.\n\nTo derive the remaining two equations, we turn to Kirchhoff's voltage law. We need to select two closed paths to use Kirchhoff's voltage law. Note that the voltage across the dependent current source is unknown and cannot be determined from the source current $\\beta i_{B}$. Therefore, we must select two closed paths that do not contain this dependent current source.\n\nWe choose the paths bcdb and badb, specifying voltage drops as positive to yield:\n\n(5) $V_{0}+i_{E} R_{E}-i_{2} R_{2}=0$,\n\n(6) $-i_{1} R_{1}+V_{CC}-i_{2} R_{2}=0$.\n\nTo obtain a single equation for $i_{B}$ in terms of known circuit variables, follow these steps:\n\n- Solve Eq. (6) for $i_{1}$ and substitute this solution into Eq. (2).\n- Solve the transformed Eq. (2) for $i_{2}$ and substitute this solution into Eq. (5).\n- Solve the transformed Eq. (5) for $i_{E}$ and substitute this solution into Eq. (3). Use Eq. (4) to eliminate $i_{C}$ in Eq. (3).\n- Solve the transformed Eq. (3) for $i_{B}$ and rearrange the terms to yield:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{B}=\\frac{\\left(V_{CC} R_{2}\\right) /\\left(R_{1}+R_{2}\\right)-V_{0}}{\\left(R_{1} R_{2}\\right) /\\left(R_{1}+R_{2}\\right)+(1+\\beta) R_{E}} \\tag{2.25}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nProblem 2.31 asks you to verify these steps. Note that once we know $i_{B}$, we can easily obtain the remaining currents.\n\nASSESSMENT PROBLEMS\n\nObjective 3-Know how to calculate power for each element in a simple circuit\n\n2.9 For the circuit shown, find (a) the current $i_{1}$ in microamperes, (b) the voltage $v$ in volts, (c) the total power generated, and (d) the total power absorbed.\n\nAnswer: (a) $25 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$;\n\n(b) -2 V ;\n\n(c) $6150 \\mu \\mathrm{~W}$;\n\n(d) $6150 \\mu \\mathrm{~W}$.\nimage_name:2.9\ndescription:\n[\n{\n    'name': '54 kΩ',\n    'type': 'Resistor',\n    'value': '54 kΩ',\n    'ports': {\n        'N1': 'X3',\n        'N2': 'X2'\n    }\n},\n{\n    'name': '1 V',\n    'type': 'VoltageSource',\n    'value': '1 V',\n    'ports': {\n        'Np': 'X1',\n        'Nn': 'X2'\n    }\n},\n{\n    'name': '6 kΩ',\n    'type': 'Resistor',\n    'value': '6 kΩ',\n    'ports': {\n        'N1': 'X1',\n        'N2': 'GND'\n    }\n},\n{\n    'name': '30 i₁',\n    'type': 'VoltageControlledCurrentSource',\n    'value': '30 i₁',\n    'ports': {\n        'Np': 'X4',\n        'Nn': 'X1'\n    }\n},\n{\n    'name': '1.8 kΩ',\n    'type': 'Resistor',\n    'value': '1.8 kΩ',\n    'ports': {\n        'N1': 'X4',\n        'N2': 'X5'\n    }\n},\n{\n    'name': '5 V',\n    'type': 'VoltageSource',\n    'value': '5 V',\n    'ports': {\n        'Np': 'X3',\n        'Nn': 'GND'\n    }\n},\n{\n    'name': '8 V',\n    'type': 'VoltageSource',\n    'value': '8 V',\n    'ports': {\n        'Np': 'X5',\n        'Nn': 'GND'\n    }\n}\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit includes resistors, independent voltage sources, and a voltage-controlled voltage source.
