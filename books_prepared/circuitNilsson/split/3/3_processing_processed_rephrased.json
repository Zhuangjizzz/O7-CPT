    "text": "Our toolkit for analysis now includes Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's laws. In Chapter 2, we employed these tools to solve simple circuits. This chapter continues their application but extends to more complex circuits. The increased complexity arises from a larger number of elements with intricate interconnections. This section aims to simplify such circuits into more straightforward, equivalent forms. We persist in focusing on relatively simple circuits for two reasons: (1) It allows us to become thoroughly familiar with the laws that underpin more advanced methods, and (2) it introduces us to circuits that have significant engineering applications.\n\nThe circuits discussed in this chapter are powered by voltage and current sources that produce constant voltages or currents; that is, voltages and currents that do not change over time. These constant sources are commonly referred to as dc sources. The term \"dc\" stands for direct current, a term rooted in history but potentially misleading today. Historically, direct current was defined as current generated by a constant voltage. Consequently, a constant voltage became known as a direct current, or dc, voltage. The usage of \"dc\" for constant has persisted, and the terms \"dc current\" and \"dc voltage\" are now universally accepted in science and engineering to denote constant current and constant voltage.\n\nCHAPTER CONTENTS\n\n3.1 Resistors in Series p. 58\n3.2 Resistors in Parallel p. 59\n3.3 The Voltage-Divider and Current-Divider Circuits p. 61\n3.4 Voltage Division and Current Division p. 64\n3.5 Measuring Voltage and Current p. 66\n3.6 Measuring Resistance-The Wheatstone Bridge p. 69\n3.7 Delta-to-Wye (Pi-to-Tee) Equivalent Circuits p. 71\n\nCHAPTER OBJECTIVES\n\n1 Recognize resistors connected in series and parallel, and apply the rules for combining these resistors to determine equivalent resistance.\n2 Design simple voltage-divider and current-divider circuits.\n3 Appropriately use voltage division and current division to solve simple circuits.\n4 Determine the readings of an ammeter for measuring current and a voltmeter for measuring voltage when added to a circuit.\n5 Understand the application of a Wheatstone bridge for measuring resistance.\n6 Know when and how to use delta-to-wye equivalent circuits to solve simple circuits.\n\nPractical Perspective\n\nResistive Touch Screens\n\nSome mobile phones and tablet computers utilize resistive touch screens, which are created by applying a transparent resistive material to glass or acrylic screens. Typically, two screens are used, separated by a transparent insulating layer. The resulting touch screen can be modeled as a grid of resistors in the x-direction and another in the y-direction, as illustrated in the accompanying figure.\n\nA dedicated electronic circuit applies a voltage drop across the x-direction grid, between points a and b, then removes that voltage and applies a voltage drop across the y-direction grid (between points c and d), repeating this process continuously. When the screen is touched, the two resistive layers make contact, generating a voltage sensed in the x-grid and another in the y-grid. These voltages accurately pinpoint the touch location.\n\nHow does the voltage generated by touching the screen relate to the touch position? How are the grid properties used to calculate this position? We will address these questions in the Practical Perspective section at the end of this chapter. The circuit analysis required to answer these questions employs tools developed in the following sections.\n\nImage Description: The image shows a smartphone with a touchscreen interface. The screen is mostly blue, suggesting it is in standby mode or displaying a simple background. At the top, typical smartphone status indicators such as time (12:53 AM), battery level, and signal strength are visible, indicating the device is operational and connected to a network.\n\nThe bottom of the screen features a navigation bar with three icons: 'Applications,' 'Phone,' and 'Messaging,' standard on many smartphones for quick access to main functions.\n\nThe device has a white frame, with a front-facing camera and possibly a speaker or sensor at the top. The design is typical of modern smartphones, emphasizing a large touch-sensitive display that covers most of the front surface. This display uses a grid of sensors to detect touch, allowing the device to register user interactions precisely.\n\nOverall, the image highlights the interface and basic structure of a touchscreen smartphone, focusing on its interactive and communicative features.\n\nImage Description: Figure 3.1\n- The circuit includes a voltage source (Vs) and resistors (R1 to R7) connected in series and parallel between nodes a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h.

    "text": "When two elements are connected at a single node pair, they are considered to be in parallel. Elements connected in parallel exhibit the same voltage across their terminals. Figure 3.5 depicts resistors connected in parallel. It's important not to assume that elements are in parallel just because they are aligned parallelly in a circuit diagram; the key characteristic of parallel-connected elements is their identical terminal voltage. In Figure 3.6, resistors $R_{1}$ and $R_{3}$ are not in parallel because another resistor intervenes, dissipating some voltage between their terminals.\n\nResistors in parallel can be simplified to a single equivalent resistor using Kirchhoff's current law and Ohm's law, as demonstrated below. In the circuit shown in Figure 3.5, let $i_{1}, i_{2}, i_{3}$, and $i_{4}$ be the currents through resistors $R_{1}$ to $R_{4}$, respectively, with the positive reference direction for each current being downward through the resistor, from node a to node b. According to Kirchhoff's current law,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{s}=i_{1}+i_{2}+i_{3}+i_{4} \\tag{3.7}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe parallel connection ensures that the voltage across each resistor is the same.

Figure 3.5 depicts resistors in a parallel configuration. Avoid the误区 of assuming elements are in parallel merely based on their alignment in a circuit diagram. The definitive trait of parallel-connected elements is their shared terminal voltage. In Fig. 3.6, $R_{1}$ and $R_{3}$ are not in parallel because another resistor intervenes, dissipating some voltage between their terminals.\n\nResistors in parallel can be condensed into a single equivalent resistor using Kirchhoff's current law and Ohm's law, as demonstrated next.

The definitive trait of parallel-connected elements is their identical terminal voltage. In Fig. 3.6, $R_{1}$ and $R_{3}$ are not in parallel because another resistor intervenes, dissipating some voltage between their terminals.\n\nResistors in parallel can be simplified to a single equivalent resistor using Kirchhoff's current law and Ohm's law, as demonstrated next.

    "text": "When two elements join at a single node pair, they are considered to be in parallel. Elements connected in parallel exhibit the same voltage across their terminals. Figure 3.5 depicts resistors connected in parallel. Avoid the误区 of assuming elements are in parallel merely because they are aligned parallelly in a circuit diagram. The key feature of parallel-connected elements is their identical terminal voltage. In Fig. 3.6, $R_{1}$ and $R_{3}$ are not parallel-connected since another resistor dissipates some voltage between their respective terminals.\n\nResistors in parallel can be condensed into a single equivalent resistor using Kirchhoff's current law and Ohm's law, as demonstrated next. In the circuit shown in Fig. 3.5, we denote the currents through resistors $R_{1}$ to $R_{4}$ as $i_{1}, i_{2}, i_{3}$, and $i_{4}$, respectively. We also define the positive reference direction for each resistor current as downward through the resistor, from node a to node b. According to Kirchhoff's current law,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{s}=i_{1}+i_{2}+i_{3}+i_{4} \\tag{3.7}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe parallel connection ensures that the voltage across each resistor is the same.

Next, we replace the parallel combination of the $9 \\Omega$ and $18 \\Omega$ resistors with a single resistance of $(18 \\times 9) /(18+9)$, or $6 \\Omega$. Figure 3.10(b) shows this further simplified circuit. Nodes x and y, marked in all diagrams, aid in tracing the circuit reduction.\n\nFrom Fig. 3.10(b), $i_{s}$ is verified to be 120/10, or 12 A. Figure 3.11 shows the analysis at this stage, with the voltage $v_{1}$ added for clarity. Using Ohm's law, we compute $v_{1}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{1}=(12)(6)=72 \\mathrm{~V} \\tag{3.16}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince $v_{1}$ is the voltage drop from node x to node y, we return to Fig. 3.10(a) and use Ohm's law to calculate $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& i_{1}=\\frac{v_{1}}{18}=\\frac{72}{18}=4 \\mathrm{~A}  \\tag{3.17}\\\\\n& i_{2}=\\frac{v_{1}}{9}=\\frac{72}{9}=8 \\mathrm{~A} \\tag{3.18}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nWe have determined the specified currents using series-parallel reductions and Ohm's law.\nimage_name:Figure 3.9\ndescription:\n[\n'name': '120 V', 'type': 'VoltageSource', 'value': '120 V', 'ports': {'Np': 'b', 'Nn': 'y'\n'name': '4 Ω', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '4 Ω', 'ports': {'N1': 'b', 'N2': 'x'\n'name': '3 Ω', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '3 Ω', 'ports': {'N1': 'x', 'N2': 'a'\n'name': '6 Ω', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '6 Ω', 'ports': {'N1': 'a', 'N2': 'y'\n'name': '18 Ω', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '18 Ω', 'ports': {'N1': 'x', 'N2': 'y'\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit consists of a 120 V voltage source connected to a series of resistors forming a bridge circuit with nodes labeled a, b, x, and y.

    "text": "When two elements join at a single node pair, they are deemed to be in parallel. Elements connected in parallel exhibit the same voltage across their terminals. Figure 3.5 exemplifies resistors in a parallel configuration. Avoid the misconception that elements are in parallel merely because they are aligned parallelly in a circuit diagram; the definitive trait of parallel-connected elements is their identical terminal voltage. In Fig. 3.6, $R_{1}$ and $R_{3}$ are not in parallel because another resistor intervenes, dissipating some voltage between their terminals.\n\nResistors in parallel can be condensed into a single equivalent resistor using Kirchhoff's current law and Ohm's law, as demonstrated next. In the circuit depicted in Fig. 3.5, we denote the currents through resistors $R_{1}$ to $R_{4}$ as $i_{1}, i_{2}, i_{3}$, and $i_{4}$, respectively, with the positive reference direction for each resistor current being downward, from node a to node b. According to Kirchhoff's current law,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{s}=i_{1}+i_{2}+i_{3}+i_{4} \\tag{3.7}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe parallel arrangement ensures that the voltage across each resistor is uniform.

Nodes x and y, marked in all diagrams, aid in tracking the circuit reduction.\n\nFrom Fig. 3.10(b), $i_{s}$ is calculated as 120/10, or 12 A.

    "text": "In certain situations, particularly in electronic circuits, it is necessary to derive multiple voltage levels from a single voltage source. One effective method to achieve this is by employing a voltage-divider circuit, as illustrated in Fig. 3.12.\n\nWe examine this circuit by directly applying Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's laws. To facilitate the analysis, we introduce the current $i$ as depicted in Fig. 3.12(b). According to Kirchhoff's current law, $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ carry identical currents.

Each fraction represents the ratio of the resistance across which the divided voltage is measured to the total resistance. Since this ratio is always less than 1.0, the divided voltages $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ are always lower than the source voltage $v_{s}$.\n\nimage_name:(a)\ndescription:\n[\n'name': 'Vs', 'type': 'VoltageSource', 'value': 'Vs', 'ports': {'Np': 'a', 'Nn': 'c'\n'name': 'R1', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'R1', 'ports': {'N1': 'a', 'N2': 'b'\n'name': 'R2', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'R2', 'ports': {'N1': 'b', 'N2': 'c'\n]\nextrainfo:This is a simple voltage divider circuit with two resistors R1 and R2 connected in series across a voltage source Vs.

The voltage source Vs provides the input voltage Vin, and the divided voltage Vo is measured across R2 and RL.\n\n\nFigure 3.13 $\\triangle$ A voltage divider connected to a load $R_{L}$.\n\nIf a specific value of $v_{2}$ is desired and $v_{s}$ is given, an infinite number of $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ combinations can achieve the required ratio. For instance, if $v_{s}$ is 15 V and $v_{2}$ is intended to be 5 V, then $v_{2} / v_{s}=\\frac{1}{3}$. From Eq. 3.22, this ratio is met whenever $R_{2}=\\frac{1}{2} R_{1}$. Other considerations in selecting $R_{1}$, and consequently $R_{2}$, include the power losses incurred in dividing the source voltage and the impact of connecting the voltage-divider circuit to other components.\n\nConsider attaching a resistor $R_{L}$ in parallel with $R_{2}$, as shown in Fig. 3.13. The resistor $R_{L}$ acts as a load on the voltage-divider circuit. A load in any circuit comprises one or more elements that draw power from the circuit. With $R_{L}$ connected, the expression for the output voltage becomes\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{o}=\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{R_{1}+R_{\\mathrm{eq}}} v_{s}, \\tag{3.23}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{\\mathrm{eq}}=\\frac{R_{2} R_{L}}{R_{2}+R_{L}} \\tag{3.24}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSubstituting Eq. 3.24 into Eq. 3.23 results in\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{o}=\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}\\left[1+\\left(R_{2} / R_{L}\\right)\\right]+R_{2}} v_{s} \\tag{3.25}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nNote that Eq. 3.25 simplifies to Eq. 3.22 as $R_{L} \\rightarrow \\infty$, as it should. Equation 3.25 demonstrates that, provided $R_{L} \\gg R_{2}$, the voltage ratio $v_{o} / v_{s}$ remains largely unaffected by the addition of the load.\n\nAnother important aspect of the voltage-divider circuit is its sensitivity to the tolerances of the resistors. Tolerance refers to the range of possible values. The resistances of commercially available resistors always vary within a certain percentage of their stated value. Example 3.2 illustrates the effect of resistor tolerances in a voltage-divider circuit.\n\n#### Example 3.2 Analyzing the Voltage-Divider Circuit\n\nThe resistors in the voltage-divider circuit shown in Fig. 3.14 have a tolerance of $\\pm 10 \\%$.

The resistors have a tolerance of ±10%.\n\n\nFigure 3.14 A The circuit for Example 3.2.\n\n#### Solution\n\nFrom Eq. 3.22, the maximum value of $v_{o}$ occurs when $R_{2}$ is $10 \\%$ high and $R_{1}$ is $10 \\%$ low, and the minimum value of $v_{o}$ occurs when $R_{2}$ is $10 \\%$ low and $R_{1}$ is 10\\% high. Thus,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& v_{o}(\\max )=\\frac{(100)(110)}{110+22.5}=83.02 \\mathrm{~V} \\\\\n& v_{o}(\\min )=\\frac{(100)(90)}{90+27.5}=76.60 \\mathrm{~V}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, in choosing $10 \\%$ resistors for this voltage divider, we acknowledge that the no-load output voltage will range between 76.60 and 83.02 V.\n\nThe Current-Divider Circuit\n\nThe current-divider circuit depicted in Fig. 3.15 comprises two resistors connected in parallel across a current source. This circuit is designed to divide the current $i_{s}$ between $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$. We determine the relationship between $i_{s}$ and the currents through each resistor ($i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$) by directly applying Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's current law. The voltage across the parallel resistors is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv=i_{1} R_{1}=i_{2} R_{2}=\\frac{R_{1} R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} i_{s} \\tag{3.26}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFrom Eq. 3.26,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& i_{1}=\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} i_{s}  \\tag{3.27}\\\\\n& i_{2}=\\frac{R_{1}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} i_{s} \\tag{3.28}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nEquations 3.27 and 3.28 show that the current divides between two parallel resistors such that the current through one resistor equals the entering current multiplied by the other resistance and divided by the sum of the resistances.

One effective method to achieve this is through the use of a voltage-divider circuit, such as the one depicted in Fig. 3.12.\n\nTo analyze this circuit, we directly apply Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's laws. To facilitate the analysis, we introduce the current $i$ as illustrated in Fig. 3.12(b). According to Kirchhoff's current law, $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ carry identical currents.

For instance, if $v_{s}$ is 15 V and $v_{2}$ needs to be 5 V, then $v_{2} / v_{s}=\\frac{1}{3}$, and from Eq.3.22, this ratio is met whenever $R_{2}=\\frac{1}{2} R_{1}$. Other considerations in selecting $R_{1}$, and consequently $R_{2}$, include power losses in the voltage division process and the impact of connecting the voltage-divider circuit to other components.\n\nConsider attaching a resistor $R_{L}$ in parallel with $R_{2}$, as shown in Fig. 3.13. The resistor $R_{L}$ acts as a load on the voltage-divider circuit. A load in any circuit comprises one or more elements that draw power from it. With $R_{L}$ connected, the expression for the output voltage becomes\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{o}=\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{R_{1}+R_{\\mathrm{eq}}} v_{s}, \\tag{3.23}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{\\mathrm{eq}}=\\frac{R_{2} R_{L}}{R_{2}+R_{L}} \\tag{3.24}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSubstituting Eq. 3.24 into Eq. 3.23 yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{o}=\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}\\left[1+\\left(R_{2} / R_{L}\\right)\\right]+R_{2}} v_{s} \\tag{3.25}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nNote that Eq. 3.25 simplifies to Eq. 3.22 as $R_{L} \\rightarrow \\infty$, as it should. Equation 3.25 demonstrates that, as long as $R_{L} \\gg R_{2}$, the voltage ratio $v_{o} / v_{s}$ remains largely unaffected by the addition of the load.\n\nAnother important aspect of the voltage-divider circuit is its sensitivity to resistor tolerances. Tolerance refers to the range of possible values a resistor can have. Commercially available resistors always have a variability within a certain percentage of their stated value. Example 3.2 illustrates the effect of resistor tolerances in a voltage-divider circuit.\n\n#### Example 3.2 Analyzing the Voltage-Divider Circuit\n\nThe resistors in the voltage-divider circuit shown in Fig. 3.14 have a tolerance of $\\pm 10 \\%$.

The resistors have a tolerance of ±10%.\n\nFigure 3.14 A The circuit for Example 3.2.\n\n#### Solution\n\nFrom Eq. 3.22, the maximum value of $v_{o}$ occurs when $R_{2}$ is $10 \\%$ high and $R_{1}$ is $10 \\%$ low, and the minimum value of $v_{o}$ occurs when $R_{2}$ is $10 \\%$ low and $R_{1}$ is 10\\% high.

This circuit is designed to divide the current $i_{s}$ between $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$. We determine the relationship between $i_{s}$ and the currents through each resistor ($i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$) by applying Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's current law directly. The voltage across the parallel resistors is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv=i_{1} R_{1}=i_{2} R_{2}=\\frac{R_{1} R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} i_{s} \\tag{3.26}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFrom Eq. 3.26,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& i_{1}=\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} i_{s}  \\tag{3.27}\\\\\n& i_{2}=\\frac{R_{1}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} i_{s} \\tag{3.28}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nEquations 3.27 and 3.28 show that the current divides between two parallel resistors such that the current through one resistor is the current entering the parallel pair multiplied by the other resistance and divided by the sum of the resistances. Example 3.3 demonstrates the application of the current-divider equation.\n\n#### Example 3.3 Analyzing a Current-Divider Circuit\n\nCalculate the power dissipated in the $6 \\Omega$ resistor shown in Fig. 3.16.\n\n#### Solution\n\nFirst, we need to find the current through the resistor by simplifying the circuit using series-parallel reductions. Thus, the circuit in Fig. 3.16 reduces to the one in Fig. 3.17. We find the current $i_{o}$ using the current-division formula:\n\n$$\ni_{o}=\\frac{16}{16+4}(10)=8 \\mathrm{~A}\n$$\n\nNote that $i_{o}$ is the current in the $1.6 \\Omega$ resistor in Fig. 3.16.

Other considerations in selecting $R_{1}$, and consequently $R_{2}$, include the power losses incurred in dividing the source voltage and the impact of connecting the voltage-divider circuit to other circuit components.\n\nConsider attaching a resistor $R_{L}$ in parallel with $R_{2}$, as shown in Fig. 3.13. The resistor $R_{L}$ acts as a load on the voltage-divider circuit. A load in any circuit comprises one or more elements that draw power from the circuit.

This circuit is designed to divide the current $i_{s}$ between $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$. We determine the relationship between the current $i_{s}$ and the currents in each resistor ($i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$) by directly applying Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's current law. The voltage across the parallel resistors is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv=i_{1} R_{1}=i_{2} R_{2}=\\frac{R_{1} R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} i_{s} \\tag{3.26}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFrom Eq. 3.26,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& i_{1}=\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} i_{s}  \\tag{3.27}\\\\\n& i_{2}=\\frac{R_{1}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} i_{s} \\tag{3.28}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nEquations 3.27 and 3.28 show that the current divides between two parallel resistors such that the current in one resistor equals the current entering the parallel pair multiplied by the other resistance and divided by the sum of the resistances.

This circuit is designed to divide the current $i_{s}$ between $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$. We determine the relationship between $i_{s}$ and the currents in each resistor ($i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$) by applying Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's current law. The voltage across the parallel resistors is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv=i_{1} R_{1}=i_{2} R_{2}=\\frac{R_{1} R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} i_{s} \\tag{3.26}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFrom Eq. 3.26,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& i_{1}=\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} i_{s}  \\tag{3.27}\\\\\n& i_{2}=\\frac{R_{1}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} i_{s} \\tag{3.28}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nEquations 3.27 and 3.28 show that the current divides between two parallel resistors such that the current in one resistor equals the total current entering the parallel pair multiplied by the other resistance and divided by the sum of the resistances.

For instance, if $v_{s}$ is 15 V and $v_{2}$ is to be 5 V, then $v_{2} / v_{s}=\\frac{1}{3}$. From Eq. 3.22, this ratio is met whenever $R_{2}=\\frac{1}{2} R_{1}$. Other considerations in selecting $R_{1}$, and consequently $R_{2}$, include power losses in the voltage division process and the impact of connecting the voltage-divider circuit to other components.\n\nConsider attaching a resistor $R_{L}$ in parallel with $R_{2}$, as shown in Fig. 3.13. The resistor $R_{L}$ acts as a load on the voltage-divider circuit. A load in any circuit comprises one or more elements that draw power from it.

Other considerations in selecting $R_{1}$, and consequently $R_{2}$, include the power losses incurred in dividing the source voltage and the impact of connecting the voltage-divider circuit to other circuit components.\n\nConsider attaching a resistor $R_{L}$ in parallel with $R_{2}$, as shown in Fig. 3.13. The resistor $R_{L}$ acts as a load on the voltage-divider circuit. A load in any circuit comprises one or more elements that draw power from the circuit. With $R_{L}$ connected, the expression for the output voltage becomes\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{o}=\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{R_{1}+R_{\\mathrm{eq}}} v_{s}, \\tag{3.23}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{\\mathrm{eq}}=\\frac{R_{2} R_{L}}{R_{2}+R_{L}} \\tag{3.24}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSubstituting Eq. 3.24 into Eq. 3.23 results in\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{o}=\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}\\left[1+\\left(R_{2} / R_{L}\\right)\\right]+R_{2}} v_{s} \\tag{3.25}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nNote that Eq. 3.25 simplifies to Eq. 3.22 as $R_{L} \\rightarrow \\infty$, as it should. Equation 3.25 demonstrates that, as long as $R_{L} \\gg R_{2}$, the voltage ratio $v_{o} / v_{s}$ remains largely unaffected by the addition of the load.\n\nAnother important aspect of the voltage-divider circuit is its sensitivity to the tolerances of the resistors. Tolerance refers to the range of possible values that a resistor can have. The resistances of commercially available resistors always vary within a certain percentage of their stated value. Example 3.2 illustrates the effect of resistor tolerances in a voltage-divider circuit.\n\n#### Example 3.2 Analyzing the Voltage-Divider Circuit\n\nThe voltage-divider circuit shown in Fig. 3.14 uses resistors with a tolerance of $\\pm 10 \\%$.

This circuit is designed to divide the current $i_{s}$ between $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$. We determine the relationship between $i_{s}$ and the currents in each resistor ($i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$) by directly applying Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's current law. The voltage across the parallel resistors is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv=i_{1} R_{1}=i_{2} R_{2}=\\frac{R_{1} R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} i_{s} \\tag{3.26}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFrom Eq. 3.26,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& i_{1}=\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} i_{s}  \\tag{3.27}\\\\\n& i_{2}=\\frac{R_{1}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} i_{s} \\tag{3.28}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nEquations 3.27 and 3.28 show that the current divides between two parallel resistors such that the current in one resistor is the current entering the parallel pair multiplied by the other resistance and divided by the sum of the resistances.

These extensions will introduce two additional, highly useful circuit analysis methods known as voltage division and current division. Refer to the circuit depicted in Fig. 3.18.\n\nThe left-side box may house a single voltage source or any combination of fundamental circuit elements that produce the voltage $v$ shown. To the right of this box, there are $n$ resistors connected in series. Our goal is to determine the voltage drop $v_{j}$ across a specific resistor $R_{j}$ in relation to the voltage $v$. Initially, we employ Ohm's law to compute the current $i$ flowing through all the series resistors, based on the voltage $v$ and the $n$ resistors:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni=\\frac{v}{R_{1}+R_{2}+\\cdots+R_{n}}=\\frac{v}{R_{\\mathrm{eq}}} \\tag{3.29}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe equivalent resistance, $R_{\\text {eq }}$, is the sum of the $n$ resistor values due to their series connection, as per Eq. 3.6.

Equation 3.30 represents the voltage division formula. It indicates that the voltage drop $v_{j}$ across a single resistor $R_{j}$ in a series of resistors is proportional to the total voltage $v$ across the series. The proportionality constant is the ratio of the individual resistance to the equivalent resistance of the series resistors, or $R_{j} / R_{\\text {eq }}$.\n\nNow, examine the circuit in Fig. 3.19.

Consider the circuit depicted in Fig. 3.18.\n\nThe left-hand box may contain a single voltage source or any combination of basic circuit elements that produce the voltage $v$ indicated in the figure. To the right of the box are $n$ resistors connected in series. Our goal is to determine the voltage drop $v_{j}$ across an arbitrary resistor $R_{j}$ in terms of the voltage $v$. We begin by applying Ohm's law to compute $i$, the current through all series resistors, using the voltage $v$ and the $n$ resistors:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni=\\frac{v}{R_{1}+R_{2}+\\cdots+R_{n}}=\\frac{v}{R_{\\mathrm{eq}}} \\tag{3.29}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe equivalent resistance, $R_{\\text{eq}}$, is the sum of the $n$ resistor values due to their series connection, as per Eq. 3.6.

Equation 3.30 is known as the voltage division equation. It states that the voltage drop $v_{j}$ across a single resistor $R_{j}$ in a series of resistors is proportional to the total voltage drop $v$ across the series-connected resistors. The proportionality constant is the ratio of the single resistance to the equivalent resistance of the series-connected resistors, or $R_{j} / R_{\\text{eq}}$.\n\nNow, consider the circuit shown in Fig. 3.19.

To the right of the box are $n$ resistors connected in parallel. We aim to find the current $i_{j}$ through an arbitrary resistor $R_{j}$ in terms of the current $i$.

We apply Ohm's law a second time to calculate the current $i_{j}$ through resistor $R_{j}$, using the voltage $v$ from Eq. 3.31:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{j}=\\frac{v}{R_{j}}=\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{R_{j}} i \\tag{3.32}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nNote that Eq. 3.31 was used to derive the right-hand side of Eq. 3.32. Equation 3.32 is the current division equation. It indicates that the current $i$ through a single resistor $R_{j}$ in a set of parallel-connected resistors is proportional to the total current $i$ supplied to the parallel-connected resistors. The proportionality constant is the ratio of the equivalent resistance of the parallel-connected resistors to the single resistance, or $R_{\\mathrm{eq}} / R_{j}$.

    "text": "When dealing with real circuits, you often need to measure voltages and currents. We will dedicate some time to discussing various measuring devices in this and the next section, as they are relatively straightforward to analyze and provide practical examples of the current- and voltage-divider configurations we have just examined.\n\nAn ammeter is an instrument designed to measure current; it is placed in series with the circuit element whose current is being measured. A voltmeter, on the other hand, is designed to measure voltage and is placed in parallel with the element whose voltage is being measured. An ideal ammeter or voltmeter does not affect the circuit variable it is intended to measure.\n\nSpecifically, an ideal ammeter has an equivalent resistance of $0 \\Omega$ and acts as a short circuit in series with the element whose current is being measured. An ideal voltmeter has an infinite equivalent resistance, functioning as an open circuit in parallel with the element whose voltage is being measured. The configurations for an ammeter measuring current in $R_{1}$ and a voltmeter measuring voltage across $R_{2}$ are illustrated in Fig. 3.21. The ideal models for these meters in the same circuit are shown in Fig. 3.22.\n\nThere are two main types of meters used to measure continuous voltages and currents: digital meters and analog meters. Digital meters measure the continuous voltage or current signal at specific points in time, known as sampling times. This converts the signal from an analog signal, which is continuous in time, to a digital signal, which exists only at discrete moments. A detailed explanation of how digital meters work is beyond the scope of this text and course. However, you are likely to encounter and use digital meters in laboratory settings due to their advantages over analog meters. They introduce less resistance into the circuit, are easier to connect, and offer greater measurement precision due to their readout mechanism.\n\nAnalog meters are based on the d'Arsonval meter movement, which implements the readout mechanism. A d'Arsonval meter movement consists of a movable coil placed within the field of a permanent magnet. When current flows through the coil, it generates a torque, causing the coil to rotate and move a pointer across a calibrated scale. The pointer's deflection is directly proportional to the current in the coil. The coil has both a voltage rating and a current rating. For instance, a commercially available meter movement might be rated at 50 mV and 1 mA. This means that when the coil carries 1 mA, the voltage drop across the coil is 50 mV, and the pointer deflects to its full-scale position. A schematic illustration of a d'Arsonval meter movement is shown in Fig. 3.23.\n\nAn analog ammeter comprises a d'Arsonval movement in parallel with a resistor, as depicted in Fig. 3.24. The parallel resistor's purpose is to limit the current in the movement's coil by diverting some of it through $R_{A}$. An analog voltmeter consists of a d'Arsonval movement in series with a resistor, as shown in Fig. 3.25. Here, the resistor limits the voltage drop across the meter's coil. In both meters, the added resistor determines the full-scale reading of the meter movement.\n\nFrom these descriptions, it is clear that a real meter is nonideal; both the added resistor and the meter movement introduce resistance into the circuit. In fact, any instrument used for physical measurements extracts energy from the system, and the more energy extracted, the more the measurement is disturbed. A real ammeter has a non-zero equivalent resistance, effectively adding resistance to the circuit in series with the element whose current it measures. Similarly, a real voltmeter has a finite equivalent resistance, adding resistance to the circuit in parallel with the element whose voltage it measures.\n\nThe extent to which these meters disturb the circuit depends on their effective resistance compared to the circuit's resistance. For example, following the $1/10$th rule, an ammeter's effective resistance should be no more than $1/10$th of the smallest resistance in the circuit to ensure the measured current is nearly the same with or without the ammeter. However, in an analog meter, the resistance value is determined by the desired full-scale reading and cannot be arbitrarily chosen. The following examples illustrate how to calculate the resistance needed in an analog ammeter or voltmeter and consider the resulting effective resistance when the meter is inserted into a circuit.\n\n**Figure 3.21**: An ammeter connected to measure the current in $R_{1}$, and a voltmeter connected to measure the voltage across $R_{2}$.\n\n**Figure 3.22**: A short-circuit model for the ideal ammeter, and an open-circuit model for the ideal voltmeter.\n\n**Figure 3.23**: A schematic diagram of a d'Arsonval meter movement.\n\n**Figure 3.24**: An analog ammeter circuit using a d'Arsonval movement with a parallel resistor $R_{A}$.\n\n**Figure 3.25**: An analog voltmeter circuit using a d'Arsonval movement with a series resistor $R_{v}$.\n\n#### Example 3.5: Using a d'Arsonval Ammeter\n\na) A $50 \\mathrm{mV}, 1 \\mathrm{~mA}$ d'Arsonval movement is to be used in an ammeter with a full-scale reading of 10 mA. Determine $R_{A}$.\nb) Repeat (a) for a full-scale reading of 1 A.\nc) How much resistance is added to the circuit when the 10 mA ammeter is inserted to measure current?\nd) Repeat (c) for the 1 A ammeter.\n\n#### Solution\n\na) From the problem statement, when the current at the ammeter terminals is $10 \\mathrm{~mA}$, $1 \\mathrm{~mA}$ flows through the meter coil, meaning $9 \\mathrm{~mA}$ must be diverted through $R_{A}$. When the movement carries $1 \\mathrm{~mA}$, the voltage drop across its terminals is $50 \\mathrm{mV}$. By Ohm's law:\n\n$$\n9 \\times 10^{-3} R_{A} = 50 \\times 10^{-3},\n$$\n\nso\n\n$$\nR_{A} = \\frac{50}{9} \\approx 5.555 \\Omega.\n$$\n\nb) For a full-scale deflection of $1 \\mathrm{~A}$, $R_{A}$ must carry $999 \\mathrm{~mA}$ when the movement carries $1 \\mathrm{~mA}$. Thus,\n\n$$\n999 \\times 10^{-3} R_{A} = 50 \\times 10^{-3},\n$$\n\nyielding\n\n$$\nR_{A} \\approx \\frac{50}{999} \\approx 50.05 \\mathrm{~m} \\Omega.\n$$\n\nc) Let $R_{m}$ represent the equivalent resistance of the ammeter. For the 10 mA ammeter,\n\n$$\nR_{m} = \\frac{50 \\mathrm{mV}}{10 \\mathrm{~mA}} = 5 \\Omega,\n$$\n\nor alternatively,\n\n$$\nR_{m} = \\frac{(50)(50/9)}{50 + (50/9)} = 5 \\Omega.\n$$\n\nd) For the 1 A ammeter,\n\n$$\nR_{m} = \\frac{50 \\mathrm{mV}}{1 \\mathrm{~A}} = 0.050 \\Omega,\n$$\n\nor alternatively,\n\n$$\nR_{m} = \\frac{(50)(50/999)}{50 + (50/999)} = 0.050 \\Omega.\n$$\n\n#### Example 3.6: Using a d'Arsonval Voltmeter\n\na) A $50 \\mathrm{mV}, 1 \\mathrm{~mA}$ d'Arsonval movement is to be used in a voltmeter with a full-scale reading of 150 V.

    "text": "When dealing with real circuits, you frequently need to measure voltages and currents. We will dedicate some time to discussing various measuring devices in this and the next section, as they are relatively straightforward to analyze and provide practical examples of the current- and voltage-divider configurations we have just explored.\n\nAn ammeter is an instrument designed to measure current and is placed in series with the circuit element whose current is being measured. A voltmeter, on the other hand, is designed to measure voltage and is placed in parallel with the element whose voltage is being measured. An ideal ammeter or voltmeter does not affect the circuit variable it is intended to measure.\n\nSpecifically, an ideal ammeter has an equivalent resistance of $0 \\Omega$ and acts as a short circuit in series with the element whose current is being measured. An ideal voltmeter has infinite equivalent resistance, functioning as an open circuit in parallel with the element whose voltage is being measured. The configurations for an ammeter measuring current in $R_{1}$ and a voltmeter measuring voltage across $R_{2}$ are illustrated in Fig. 3.21. The ideal models for these meters in the same circuit are shown in Fig. 3.22.\n\nThere are two primary types of meters used to measure continuous voltages and currents: digital meters and analog meters. Digital meters measure the continuous voltage or current signal at specific points in time, known as sampling times. This converts the signal from an analog signal, which is continuous in time, to a digital signal, which exists only at discrete moments. A detailed explanation of digital meters' functioning is beyond the scope of this text and course. However, you are likely to encounter and use digital meters in laboratory settings due to their advantages over analog meters. They introduce less resistance into the connected circuit, are easier to connect, and offer greater measurement precision due to their readout mechanism.\n\nAnalog meters are based on the d'Arsonval meter movement, which implements the readout mechanism. A d'Arsonval meter movement consists of a movable coil placed in the field of a permanent magnet. When current flows through the coil, it generates a torque, causing the coil to rotate and move a pointer across a calibrated scale. The pointer's deflection is directly proportional to the current in the coil. The coil has both a voltage rating and a current rating. For instance, a commercially available meter movement might be rated at 50 mV and 1 mA, meaning that when the coil carries 1 mA, the voltage drop across the coil is 50 mV, and the pointer deflects to its full-scale position. A schematic illustration of a d'Arsonval meter movement is provided in Fig. 3.23.\n\nAn analog ammeter comprises a d'Arsonval movement in parallel with a resistor, as depicted in Fig. 3.24. The parallel resistor's purpose is to limit the current in the movement's coil by shunting some of it through $R_{A}$. An analog voltmeter consists of a d'Arsonval movement in series with a resistor, as shown in Fig. 3.25. Here, the resistor limits the voltage drop across the meter's coil. In both meters, the added resistor determines the full-scale reading of the meter movement.\n\nFrom these descriptions, it is evident that a real meter is nonideal; both the added resistor and the meter movement introduce resistance into the attached circuit. In fact, any instrument used for physical measurements extracts energy from the system during measurement. The more energy extracted, the more the measurement is disturbed. A real ammeter has a non-zero equivalent resistance, effectively adding resistance to the circuit in series with the element whose current it measures. A real voltmeter has a finite equivalent resistance, thus adding resistance to the circuit in parallel with the element whose voltage is being measured.\n\nThe extent to which these meters disturb the circuit being measured depends on their effective resistance compared to the circuit's resistance. For example, using the $1/10$th rule, an ammeter's effective resistance should be no more than $1/10$th of the smallest resistance in the circuit to ensure the measured current is nearly the same with or without the ammeter. However, in an analog meter, the resistance value is determined by the desired full-scale reading and cannot be arbitrarily chosen. The following examples illustrate the calculations involved in determining the resistance needed in an analog ammeter or voltmeter and consider the resulting effective resistance of the meter when inserted into a circuit.\n\nFigure 3.21 $\\triangle$ An ammeter connected to measure the current in $R_{1}$, and a voltmeter connected to measure the voltage across $R_{2}$.\n\nFigure $3.22 \\triangle$ A short-circuit model for the ideal ammeter, and an open-circuit model for the ideal voltmeter.\n\n#### Example 3.5 Using a d'Arsonval Ammeter\n\na) A $50 \\mathrm{mV}, 1 \\mathrm{~mA}$ d'Arsonval movement is to be used in an ammeter with a full-scale reading of 10 mA.

    "text": "When dealing with real circuits, you frequently need to measure voltages and currents. We will dedicate some time to discussing various measuring devices in this and the next section, as they are relatively straightforward to analyze and provide practical examples of the current- and voltage-divider configurations we have just examined.\n\nAn ammeter is an instrument designed to measure current; it is placed in series with the circuit element whose current is being measured. A voltmeter is an instrument designed to measure voltage; it is placed in parallel with the element whose voltage is being measured. An ideal ammeter or voltmeter does not affect the circuit variable it is intended to measure.\n\nSpecifically, an ideal ammeter has an equivalent resistance of $0 \\Omega$ and acts as a short circuit in series with the element whose current is being measured. An ideal voltmeter has an infinite equivalent resistance and thus acts as an open circuit in parallel with the element whose voltage is being measured. The configurations for an ammeter measuring the current in $R_{1}$ and a voltmeter measuring the voltage across $R_{2}$ are illustrated in Fig. 3.21. The ideal models for these meters in the same circuit are shown in Fig. 3.22.\n\nThere are two main types of meters used to measure continuous voltages and currents: digital meters and analog meters. Digital meters measure the continuous voltage or current signal at specific points in time, known as sampling times. This converts the signal from an analog signal, which is continuous in time, to a digital signal, which exists only at discrete moments. A detailed explanation of how digital meters work is beyond the scope of this text and course. However, you are likely to encounter and use digital meters in laboratory settings due to their advantages over analog meters. They introduce less resistance into the circuit they are connected to, are easier to connect, and offer greater measurement precision due to the nature of their readout mechanism.\n\nAnalog meters are based on the d'Arsonval meter movement, which implements the readout mechanism. A d'Arsonval meter movement consists of a movable coil placed in the field of a permanent magnet. When current flows through the coil, it generates a torque, causing the coil to rotate and move a pointer across a calibrated scale. The pointer's deflection is directly proportional to the current in the coil. The coil has both a voltage rating and a current rating. For instance, a commercially available meter movement might be rated at 50 mV and 1 mA. This means that when the coil carries 1 mA, the voltage drop across the coil is 50 mV, and the pointer deflects to its full-scale position. A schematic illustration of a d'Arsonval meter movement is shown in Fig. 3.23.\n\nAn analog ammeter comprises a d'Arsonval movement in parallel with a resistor, as depicted in Fig. 3.24. The parallel resistor's purpose is to limit the current in the movement's coil by shunting some of it through $R_{A}$. An analog voltmeter consists of a d'Arsonval movement in series with a resistor, as shown in Fig. 3.25. Here, the resistor limits the voltage drop across the meter's coil. In both meters, the added resistor determines the full-scale reading of the meter movement.\n\nFrom these descriptions, it is evident that a real meter is nonideal; both the added resistor and the meter movement introduce resistance into the circuit to which the meter is attached. In fact, any instrument used for physical measurements extracts energy from the system while measuring. The more energy extracted, the more the measurement is disturbed. A real ammeter has an equivalent resistance that is not zero, effectively adding resistance to the circuit in series with the element whose current it measures. A real voltmeter has an equivalent resistance that is not infinite, thus adding resistance to the circuit in parallel with the element whose voltage it measures.\n\nThe extent to which these meters disturb the circuit being measured depends on their effective resistance compared to the circuit's resistance. For example, using the $1/10$th rule, the effective resistance of an ammeter should be no more than $1/10$th of the smallest resistance in the circuit to ensure the measured current is nearly the same with or without the ammeter. However, in an analog meter, the resistance value is determined by the desired full-scale reading and cannot be arbitrarily chosen. The following examples illustrate the calculations involved in determining the resistance needed in an analog ammeter or voltmeter and consider the resulting effective resistance of the meter when inserted into a circuit.\n\nimage_name:Figure 3.21\ndescription:\n[\n'name': 'Vs', 'type': 'VoltageSource', 'value': 'Vs', 'ports': {'Np': '1', 'Nn': 'GND'\n'name': 'R1', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'R1', 'ports': {'N1': '1', 'N2': '2'\n'name': 'R2', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'R2', 'ports': {'N1': '2', 'N2': 'GND'\n]\nextrainfo:An ammeter is connected in series with R1 to measure the current, and a voltmeter is connected in parallel with R2 to measure the voltage across it.\n\n\nFigure 3.21 $\\triangle$ An ammeter connected to measure the current in $R_{1}$, and a voltmeter connected to measure the voltage across $R_{2}$.\n\n\n\nFigure $3.22 \\triangle$ A short-circuit model for the ideal ammeter, and an open-circuit model for the ideal voltmeter.\nimage_name:d'Arsonval meter movement\ndescription:The image depicts a schematic diagram of a d'Arsonval meter movement, a fundamental component used in analog measuring instruments such as ammeters and voltmeters. The primary components visible in the diagram include:\n\n1. **Permanent Magnet**: This is shown as a large, curved structure that creates a magnetic field. It is crucial for the operation of the meter by interacting with the moveable coil.\n\n2. **Moveable Coil**: Positioned within the magnetic field of the permanent magnet, this coil is depicted as a wound wire around a cylindrical form. It is free to rotate and is responsible for moving the pointer when current flows through it.\n\n3. **Pointer**: Attached to the moveable coil, the pointer moves across a scale to indicate the measurement. It is shown as a thin, elongated arrow pointing towards the scale.\n\n4. **Scale**: A curved, marked surface over which the pointer moves, allowing the user to read the measurement. The scale is depicted with divisions or markings for measurement reference.\n\n5. **Restoring Spring**: This component is connected to the moveable coil and is responsible for returning the pointer to the zero position when no current flows through the coil. It provides the necessary counter-torque to balance the coil’s movement.\n\n6. **Magnetic Steel Core**: Located at the center of the moveable coil, this core enhances the magnetic field and improves the efficiency of the meter.\n\nThe diagram clearly labels each component, aiding in understanding the interactions and mechanical structure of the d'Arsonval meter movement. The flow of current through the coil generates a magnetic force that interacts with the permanent magnet, causing the coil (and thus the pointer) to rotate. The degree of rotation is proportional to the current, allowing for precise measurement.\n\n\nFigure 3.23 $\\triangle$ A schematic diagram of a d'Arsonval meter movement.\nimage_name:Figure 3.24 Δ Adc ammeter circuit\ndescription:\n[\n'name': 'RA', 'type': 'Resistor', 'ports': {'N1': 'N1', 'N2': 'N2'\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit is an ammeter configuration using a d'Arsonval movement with a parallel resistor RA.

A real voltmeter has a finite equivalent resistance, adding resistance to the circuit in parallel with the element whose voltage it measures.\n\nThe extent to which these meters disturb the circuit depends on their effective resistance compared to the circuit's resistance. For example, following the $1/10$th rule, an ammeter's effective resistance should be no more than $1/10$th of the smallest resistance in the circuit to ensure the measured current is nearly the same with or without the ammeter. However, in an analog meter, the resistance value is determined by the desired full-scale reading and cannot be arbitrarily chosen. The following examples illustrate how to calculate the resistance needed in an analog ammeter or voltmeter and the resulting effective resistance of the meter when inserted into a circuit.\n\n**Figure 3.21** $\\triangle$ An ammeter connected to measure the current in $R_{1}$, and a voltmeter connected to measure the voltage across $R_{2}$.\n\n**Figure 3.22** $\\triangle$ A short-circuit model for the ideal ammeter, and an open-circuit model for the ideal voltmeter.\n\n**Figure 3.23** $\\triangle$ A schematic diagram of a d'Arsonval meter movement.\n\n**Figure 3.24** $\\triangle$ An analog ammeter circuit.\n\n**Figure 3.25** $\\triangle$ An analog voltmeter circuit.\n\n#### Example 3.5 Using a d'Arsonval Ammeter\n\na) A $50 \\mathrm{mV}, 1 \\mathrm{~mA}$ d'Arsonval movement is to be used in an ammeter with a full-scale reading of 10 mA.

    "text": "When dealing with real circuits, you often need to measure voltages and currents. We will dedicate some time to discussing various measuring devices in this and the next section, as they are relatively straightforward to analyze and provide practical examples of the current- and voltage-divider configurations we have just examined.\n\nAn ammeter is an instrument designed to measure current; it is placed in series with the circuit element whose current is being measured. A voltmeter, on the other hand, is designed to measure voltage and is placed in parallel with the element whose voltage is being measured. An ideal ammeter or voltmeter does not affect the circuit variable it is intended to measure.\n\nSpecifically, an ideal ammeter has an equivalent resistance of $0 \\Omega$ and acts as a short circuit in series with the element whose current is being measured. Conversely, an ideal voltmeter has an infinite equivalent resistance, functioning as an open circuit in parallel with the element whose voltage is being measured. The configurations for an ammeter measuring the current in $R_{1}$ and a voltmeter measuring the voltage across $R_{2}$ are illustrated in Fig. 3.21. The ideal models for these meters in the same circuit are shown in Fig. 3.22.\n\nThere are two main types of meters used to measure continuous voltages and currents: digital meters and analog meters. Digital meters measure the continuous voltage or current signal at specific points in time, known as sampling times. This converts the signal from an analog signal, which is continuous in time, to a digital signal, which exists only at discrete moments. A detailed explanation of how digital meters work is beyond the scope of this text and course. However, you are likely to encounter and use digital meters in laboratory settings due to their advantages over analog meters. They introduce less resistance into the circuit, are easier to connect, and offer greater measurement precision due to their readout mechanism.\n\nAnalog meters are based on the d'Arsonval meter movement, which implements the readout mechanism. A d'Arsonval meter movement consists of a movable coil placed in the field of a permanent magnet. When current flows through the coil, it generates a torque that causes the coil to rotate, moving a pointer across a calibrated scale. The pointer's deflection is directly proportional to the current in the coil. The coil has both a voltage rating and a current rating. For instance, a commercially available meter movement might be rated at 50 mV and 1 mA, meaning that when the coil carries 1 mA, the voltage drop across the coil is 50 mV, and the pointer deflects to its full-scale position. A schematic illustration of a d'Arsonval meter movement is provided in Fig. 3.23.\n\nAn analog ammeter comprises a d'Arsonval movement in parallel with a resistor, as depicted in Fig. 3.24. The parallel resistor's purpose is to limit the current in the movement's coil by diverting some of it through $R_{A}$. An analog voltmeter consists of a d'Arsonval movement in series with a resistor, shown in Fig. 3.25. Here, the resistor limits the voltage drop across the meter's coil. In both meters, the added resistor determines the full-scale reading of the meter movement.\n\nFrom these descriptions, it is clear that a real meter is nonideal; both the added resistor and the meter movement introduce resistance into the circuit. In fact, any instrument used for physical measurements extracts energy from the system, thereby disturbing the measurement. The more energy extracted, the greater the disturbance. A real ammeter has a non-zero equivalent resistance, effectively adding resistance to the circuit in series with the element whose current it measures. Similarly, a real voltmeter has a finite equivalent resistance, adding resistance to the circuit in parallel with the element whose voltage it measures.\n\nThe extent to which these meters disturb the circuit depends on their effective resistance compared to the circuit's resistance. For example, following the $1/10$th rule, an ammeter's effective resistance should be no more than $1/10$th of the smallest resistance in the circuit to ensure the measured current is nearly the same with or without the ammeter. However, in an analog meter, the resistance value is determined by the desired full-scale reading and cannot be arbitrarily chosen. The following examples illustrate how to calculate the resistance needed in an analog ammeter or voltmeter and consider the resulting effective resistance when the meter is inserted into a circuit.\n\nimage_name:Figure 3.21\ndescription:\n[\n'name': 'Vs', 'type': 'VoltageSource', 'value': 'Vs', 'ports': {'Np': '1', 'Nn': 'GND'\n'name': 'R1', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'R1', 'ports': {'N1': '1', 'N2': '2'\n'name': 'R2', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'R2', 'ports': {'N1': '2', 'N2': 'GND'\n]\nextrainfo:An ammeter is connected in series with R1 to measure the current, and a voltmeter is connected in parallel with R2 to measure the voltage across it.\n\n\nFigure 3.21 $\\triangle$ An ammeter connected to measure the current in $R_{1}$, and a voltmeter connected to measure the voltage across $R_{2}$.\n\n\n\nFigure $3.22 \\triangle$ A short-circuit model for the ideal ammeter, and an open-circuit model for the ideal voltmeter.\nimage_name:d'Arsonval meter movement\ndescription:The image shows a schematic diagram of a d'Arsonval meter movement, a key component in analog measuring instruments like ammeters and voltmeters. The main components in the diagram include:\n\n1. **Permanent Magnet**: This is represented as a large, curved structure generating a magnetic field, essential for the meter's operation by interacting with the movable coil.\n\n2. **Movable Coil**: Located within the magnetic field of the permanent magnet, this coil is shown as wire wound around a cylindrical form. It can rotate and is responsible for moving the pointer when current flows through it.\n\n3. **Pointer**: Attached to the movable coil, this thin, elongated arrow moves across a scale to indicate measurements.\n\n4. **Scale**: A curved, marked surface over which the pointer moves, providing a reference for reading measurements. The scale is shown with divisions or markings.\n\n5. **Restoring Spring**: Connected to the movable coil, this component returns the pointer to the zero position when no current flows. It provides counter-torque to balance the coil's movement.\n\n6. **Magnetic Steel Core**: Situated at the center of the movable coil, this core enhances the magnetic field and improves meter efficiency.\n\nThe diagram clearly labels each component, aiding in understanding their interactions and the mechanical structure of the d'Arsonval meter movement. Current flow through the coil produces a magnetic force that interacts with the permanent magnet, causing the coil (and thus the pointer) to rotate. The rotation degree is proportional to the current, enabling precise measurement.\n\n\nFigure 3.23 $\\triangle$ A schematic diagram of a d'Arsonval meter movement.\nimage_name:Figure 3.24 Δ Adc ammeter circuit\ndescription:\n[\n'name': 'RA', 'type': 'Resistor', 'ports': {'N1': 'N1', 'N2': 'N2'\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit is an ammeter configuration using a d'Arsonval movement with a parallel resistor RA.

    "text": "A variety of circuit configurations are employed to measure resistance, but here we concentrate on a specific one: the Wheatstone bridge. This circuit is adept at precisely measuring resistances of moderate values, ranging from $1 \\Omega$ to $1 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega$. In commercial Wheatstone bridge models, accuracies as high as $\\pm 0.1 \\%$ can be achieved. The bridge comprises four resistors, a dc voltage source, and a detector.

The detector is usually a d'Arsonval movement in the microamp range, known as a galvanometer. Fig. 3.26 illustrates the arrangement of the resistances, battery, and detector, where $R_{1}, R_{2}$, and $R_{3}$ are known resistors, and $R_{x}$ is the unknown resistor.\n\nTo determine $R_{x}$, we adjust the variable resistor $R_{3}$ until the galvanometer shows no current.

Thus, when the bridge is balanced, Kirchhoff's voltage law necessitates that\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& i_{3} R_{3}=i_{x} R_{x}  \\tag{3.36}\\\\\n& i_{1} R_{1}=i_{2} R_{2} \\tag{3.37}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nCombining Eqs. 3.34 and 3.35 with Eq. 3.36 yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{1} R_{3}=i_{2} R_{x} \\tag{3.38}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWe derive Eq. 3.33 by first dividing Eq. 3.38 by Eq. 3.37 and then solving for $R_{x}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{R_{3}}{R_{1}}=\\frac{R_{x}}{R_{2}} \\tag{3.39}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhich leads to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{x}=\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}} R_{3} \\tag{3.40}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHaving validated Eq. 3.33, some observations are pertinent. Firstly, if the ratio $R_{2} / R_{1}$ is unity, $R_{x}$ equals $R_{3}$. In such a scenario, the bridge resistor $R_{3}$ must vary over a range that includes $R_{x}$. For instance, if $R_{x}$ is $1000 \\Omega$ and $R_{3}$ can vary from 0 to $100 \\Omega$, the bridge cannot be balanced. Therefore, to accommodate a wide range of unknown resistors, the ratio $R_{2} / R_{1}$ must be adjustable. In commercial Wheatstone bridges, $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ are typically decimal values of resistances that can be switched into the circuit, usually $1,10,100$, and $1000 \\Omega$, allowing the ratio $R_{2} / R_{1}$ to vary from 0.001 to 1000 in decimal steps. The variable resistor $R_{3}$ is generally adjustable in integral values from 1 to $11,000 \\Omega$.\n\nWhile Eq. 3.33 suggests $R_{x}$ can range from zero to infinity, the practical range is approximately $1 \\Omega$ to $1 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega$. Measuring lower resistances on a standard Wheatstone bridge is challenging due to thermoelectric voltages at dissimilar metal junctions and thermal heating effects, i.e., $i^{2} R$ effects. Higher resistances are difficult to measure accurately because of leakage currents. In other words, if $R_{x}$ is large, the current leakage in the insulation may be comparable to the current in the bridge circuit branches.\n\nASSESSMENT PROBLEM\n\nObjective 5-Understand how a Wheatstone bridge is used to measure resistance\n\n3.7 The bridge circuit shown is balanced with $R_{1}=100 \\Omega, R_{2}=1000 \\Omega$, and $R_{3}=150 \\Omega$.

    "text": "A variety of circuit configurations are employed to measure resistance, but we will concentrate on one specific type: the Wheatstone bridge. This circuit is designed to accurately measure resistances of moderate values, ranging from $1 \\Omega$ to $1 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega$. In commercial Wheatstone bridge models, accuracies of $\\pm 0.1 \\%$ can be achieved. The bridge comprises four resistors, a direct current (dc) voltage source, and a detector. One of these resistors, indicated by an arrow through $R_{3}$ in Fig. 3.26, is variable. The dc voltage source, typically a battery, is symbolized by the battery icon for the voltage source $v$ in Fig. 3.26. The detector is usually a d'Arsonval movement in the microamp range, known as a galvanometer. Fig. 3.26 illustrates the arrangement of the resistances, battery, and detector, where $R_{1}, R_{2}$, and $R_{3}$ are known resistors, and $R_{x}$ is the unknown resistor.\n\nTo determine $R_{x}$, we adjust the variable resistor $R_{3}$ until no current flows through the galvanometer. The unknown resistor is then calculated using the straightforward formula\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{x}=\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}} R_{3} \\tag{3.33}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe derivation of Eq. 3.33 is based on applying Kirchhoff's laws to the bridge circuit.

Thus, when the bridge is balanced, Kirchhoff's voltage law requires that\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& i_{3} R_{3}=i_{x} R_{x}  \\tag{3.36}\\\\\n& i_{1} R_{1}=i_{2} R_{2} \\tag{3.37}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nCombining Eqs. 3.34 and 3.35 with Eq. 3.36 yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{1} R_{3}=i_{2} R_{x} \\tag{3.38}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWe derive Eq. 3.33 by first dividing Eq. 3.38 by Eq. 3.37 and then solving for $R_{x}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{R_{3}}{R_{1}}=\\frac{R_{x}}{R_{2}} \\tag{3.39}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nfrom which we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{x}=\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}} R_{3} \\tag{3.40}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHaving validated Eq. 3.33, some observations are pertinent. Firstly, if the ratio $R_{2} / R_{1}$ is unity, $R_{x}$ equals $R_{3}$. In this scenario, the bridge resistor $R_{3}$ must vary over a range that includes $R_{x}$. For instance, if $R_{x}$ were $1000 \\Omega$ and $R_{3}$ could vary from 0 to $100 \\Omega$, the bridge could never balance. Therefore, to accommodate a wide range of unknown resistors, the ratio $R_{2} / R_{1}$ must be adjustable. In commercial Wheatstone bridges, $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ are composed of decimal resistance values that can be switched into the circuit, typically $1,10,100$, and $1000 \\Omega$, allowing the ratio $R_{2} / R_{1}$ to vary from 0.001 to 1000 in decimal steps. The variable resistor $R_{3}$ is usually adjustable in integral values from 1 to $11,000 \\Omega$.\n\nAlthough Eq. 3.33 suggests $R_{x}$ can range from zero to infinity, the practical range is about $1 \\Omega$ to $1 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega$. Measuring lower resistances on a standard Wheatstone bridge is challenging due to thermoelectric voltages at dissimilar metal junctions and thermal heating effects, i.e., $i^{2} R$ effects. Higher resistances are difficult to measure accurately because of leakage currents. In other words, if $R_{x}$ is large, the leakage current in the insulation may be comparable to the current in the bridge circuit branches.\n\nASSESSMENT PROBLEM\n\nObjective 5-Understand how a Wheatstone bridge measures resistance\n\n3.7 In the given balanced bridge circuit with $R_{1}=100 \\Omega, R_{2}=1000 \\Omega$, and $R_{3}=150 \\Omega$, powered by a 5 V dc source:\na) Determine $R_{x}$.\nb) If each resistor can dissipate 250 mW, can the bridge remain balanced without exceeding the power-dissipating capacity of the resistors, thus avoiding damage?\n\nimage_name:Wheatstone bridge circuit\ndescription:\n[\n'name': 'V', 'type': 'VoltageSource', 'value': 'V', 'ports': {'Np': 'Vin', 'Nn': 'GND'\n'name': 'R1', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'R1', 'ports': {'N1': 'Vin', 'N2': 'a'\n'name': 'R2', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'R2', 'ports': {'N1': 'Vin', 'N2': 'b'\n'name': 'R3', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'R3', 'ports': {'N1': 'a', 'N2': 'GND'\n'name': 'Rx', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'Rx', 'ports': {'N1': 'b', 'N2': 'GND'\n]\nextrainfo:The Wheatstone bridge is balanced with R1 = 100 Ω, R2 = 1000 Ω, R3 = 150 Ω, and Rx = 1500 Ω.

    "text": "The bridge configuration depicted in Fig. 3.26 warrants further examination due to the complex interconnection of resistances. By substituting the galvanometer with its equivalent resistance $R_{m}$, we arrive at the circuit illustrated in Fig. 3.28. Unlike simpler series or parallel configurations previously discussed, the resistors in this circuit cannot be reduced to a single equivalent resistance across the battery terminals. However, using delta-to-wye ( $\\Delta$-to-Y) or pi-to-tee ( $\\pi$-to-T) transformations, the interconnected resistors can be simplified to a single equivalent resistor.\n\nIn Fig. 3.28, the resistors $R_{1}, R_{2}$, and $R_{m}$ (or $R_{3}, R_{m}$ and $R_{x}$) form a delta ( $\\Delta$) interconnection, resembling the Greek letter $\\Delta$. This configuration is also known as a pi interconnection because the $\\Delta$ can be reshaped into a $\\pi$ without altering the electrical equivalence. This equivalence is clearly demonstrated in Fig. 3.29.\n\nThe resistors $R_{1}, R_{m}$, and $R_{3}$ (or $R_{2}, R_{m}$ and $R_{x}$) in Fig. 3.28 form a wye ( $\\mathbf{Y}$) interconnection, as the arrangement can be manipulated to resemble the letter Y, more evident in the representation of Fig. 3.30. This Y configuration is also referred to as a tee ( $\\mathbf{T}$) interconnection since the Y can be transformed into a T without affecting the electrical equivalence, as shown in Fig. 3.30.\n\nFig. 3.31 demonstrates the transformation from a $\\Delta$-to-Y (or $\\pi$-to-T) equivalent circuit. It's important to note that this transformation is not merely a change in shape; it implies that the $\\Delta$ configuration can be substituted with a Y configuration to achieve identical terminal behavior. Consequently, external measurements would not discern whether a black box contains a set of $\\Delta$-connected resistors or Y-connected resistors, provided the resistance between corresponding terminal pairs remains constant. For instance, the resistance between terminals a and b must be consistent whether using the $\\Delta$-connected set or the Y-connected set. The equivalent resistance for each pair of terminals in the $\\Delta$-connected circuit can be calculated using series and parallel simplifications:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gather*}\nR_{\\mathrm{ab}}=\\frac{R_{c}\\left(R_{a}+R_{b}\\right)}{R_{a}+R_{b}+R_{c}}=R_{1}+R_{2},  \\tag{3.41}\\\\\nR_{\\mathrm{bc}}=\\frac{R_{a}\\left(R_{b}+R_{c}\\right)}{R_{a}+R_{b}+R_{c}}=R_{2}+R_{3},  \\tag{3.42}\\\\\nR_{\\mathrm{ca}}=\\frac{R_{b}\\left(R_{c}+R_{a}\\right)}{R_{a}+R_{b}+R_{c}}=R_{1}+R_{3} . \\tag{3.43}\n\\end{gather*}\n$$\n\nThe reverse transformation from Y-to-$\\Delta$ is also feasible.

This resistance can be easily determined after transforming either the upper $\\Delta$(100,125,25 Ω) or the lower $\\Delta$ (40, $25,37.5 \\Omega$) into its equivalent Y. We opt to transform the upper $\\Delta$. Subsequently, we calculate the three Y resistances from Eqs. 3.44 to 3.46:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& R_{1}=\\frac{100 \\times 125}{250}=50 \\Omega \\\\\n& R_{2}=\\frac{125 \\times 25}{250}=12.5 \\Omega \\\\\n& R_{3}=\\frac{100 \\times 25}{250}=10 \\Omega\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBy substituting the Y resistances into the circuit shown in Fig. 3.32, we obtain the circuit depicted in Fig. 3.34. The resistance across the 40 V source terminals can then be calculated using series-parallel simplifications:\n\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{eq}}=55+\\frac{(50)(50)}{100}=80 \\Omega\n$$\n\nThe final step involves recognizing that the circuit reduces to an $80 \\Omega$ resistor across the 40 V source, as shown in Fig. 3.35. This indicates that the 40 V source delivers 0.5 A and 20 W to the circuit.\nimage_name:Figure 3.33\ndescription:\n[\n'name': 'R1', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '100Ω', 'ports': {'N1': 'N1', 'N2': 'N2'\n'name': '25Ω', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '25Ω', 'ports': {'N1': 'N2', 'N2': 'N3'\n'name': '125Ω', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '125Ω', 'ports': {'N1': 'N3', 'N2': 'N1'\n'name': 'R1', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'R1', 'ports': {'N1': 'N1', 'N2': 'N4'\n'name': 'R2', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'R2', 'ports': {'N1': 'N3', 'N2': 'N4'\n'name': 'R3', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'R3', 'ports': {'N1': 'N2', 'N2': 'N4'\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit is a delta configuration with resistors R1, R2, and R3 forming a triangle.\n\nFigure 3.33 $\\Delta$ The equivalent $Y$ resistors.\nimage_name:Figure 3.34\ndescription:\n[\n'name': 'V1', 'type': 'VoltageSource', 'value': '40V', 'ports': {'Np': 'a', 'Nn': 'GND'\n'name': 'R1', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '5Ω', 'ports': {'N1': 'a', 'N2': 'b'\n'name': 'R2', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '10Ω', 'ports': {'N1': 'b', 'N2': 'd'\n'name': 'R3', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '50Ω', 'ports': {'N1': 'b', 'N2': 'c'\n'name': 'R4', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '40Ω', 'ports': {'N1': 'd', 'N2': 'GND'\n'name': 'R5', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '12.5Ω', 'ports': {'N1': 'c', 'N2': 'e'\n'name': 'R6', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '37.5Ω', 'ports': {'N1': 'e', 'N2': 'GND'\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit is a simplified version of a delta to wye transformation.

We model the resistance of the grid in the $x$-direction with the resistance $R_{x^{\\prime}}$ as shown in Fig. 3.34. The $x$-location where the screen is touched is indicated by the arrow. The resulting voltage drop across the resistance $\\alpha R_{x}$ is $V_{x}$. Touching the screen effectively divides the total resistance, $R_{x^{\\prime}}$ into two separate resistances $\\alpha R_{x}$ and $(1-\\alpha) R_{x}$.\n\nFrom the figure you can see that when the touch is on the far right side of the screen, $\\alpha=0$, and $V_{x}=0$. Similarly, when the touch is on the far left side of the screen, $\\alpha=1$, and $V_{x}=V_{s}$. If the touch is in between the two edges of the screen, the value of $\\alpha$ is between 0 and 1 and the two parts of the resistance $R_{x}$ form a voltage divider. We can calculate the voltage $V_{x}$ using the equation for voltage division:\n\n$$\nV_{x}=\\frac{\\alpha R_{x}}{\\alpha R_{x}+(1-\\alpha) R_{x}} V_{s}=\\frac{\\alpha R_{x}}{R_{x}} V_{s}=\\alpha V_{s} .\n$$\n\nWe can find the value of $\\alpha$, which represents the location of the touch point with respect the far right side of the screen, by dividing the voltage\nimage_name:Figure 3.36\ndescription:\n[\n'name': 'Vs', 'type': 'VoltageSource', 'value': 'Vs', 'ports': {'Np': 'vs', 'Nn': 'GND'\n'name': 'Rx', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'Rx', 'ports': {'N1': 'vs', 'N2': 'GND'\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit diagram represents a resistive touch screen grid in the x-direction. The resistor Rx is divided into two parts: (1-α)Rx and αRx, forming a voltage divider.

Typically the screen coordinates are specified in terms of pixels (short for \"picture elements\"). For example, the screen of a mobile phone would be divided into a grid of pixels with $p_{x}$ pixels in the $x$-direction, and $p_{y}$ pixels in the $y$-direction. Each pixel is identified by its $x$-location (a number between 0 and $p_{x}-1$ ) and its $y$-location (a number between 0 and $\\left.p_{y}-1\\right)$. The pixel with the location $(0,0)$ is in the upper left hand corner of the screen, as shown in Fig. 3.37.\nimage_name:Figure 3.37\ndescription:The image, labeled as Figure 3.37, displays a rectangular grid representing a screen divided into pixels. The corners of the rectangle are marked with pixel coordinates. The top-left corner is labeled \\((0,0)\\), indicating the starting point of the grid.

The equivalence between the Δ and π configurations is demonstrated in Fig. 3.29.\n\nThe resistors \\( R_1, R_m \\), and \\( R_3 \\) (or \\( R_2, R_m \\), and \\( R_x \\)) in the same circuit are referred to as a wye (Y) configuration because their interconnection resembles the letter Y. This is more apparent in the representation in Fig. 3.30. Additionally, the Y configuration is known as a tee (T) configuration, as the Y can be transformed into a T without affecting the electrical equivalence. The equivalence of the Y and T configurations is clear from Fig. 3.30.\n\nFig. 3.31 illustrates the Δ-to-Y (or π-to-T) transformation. It's important to note that merely altering the physical shape of the connections does not transform a Δ configuration into a Y configuration. The statement that a Δ-connected circuit is equivalent to a Y-connected circuit means that the Δ configuration can be substituted with a Y configuration, ensuring identical terminal behavior. Consequently, if both configurations were enclosed in a black box, external measurements would not distinguish between a set of Δ-connected resistors and Y-connected resistors. This equivalence holds true only if the resistance between corresponding terminal pairs is consistent for each configuration. For instance, the resistance between terminals a and b must be the same whether a Δ or Y configuration is used. The equivalent resistance for each pair of terminals in the Δ-connected circuit can be calculated using series and parallel simplifications, resulting in:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nR_{ab} &= \\frac{R_c(R_a + R_b)}{R_a + R_b + R_c} = R_1 + R_2, \\tag{3.41} \\\\\nR_{bc} &= \\frac{R_a(R_b + R_c)}{R_a + R_b + R_c} = R_2 + R_3, \\tag{3.42} \\\\\nR_{ca} &= \\frac{R_b(R_c + R_a)}{R_a + R_b + R_c} = R_1 + R_3. \\tag{3.43}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThe reverse transformation from Δ-to-Y is also feasible, allowing a Y configuration to be replaced with an equivalent Δ configuration. The expressions for the three Δ-connected resistors in terms of the Y-connected resistors are:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nR_a &= \\frac{R_1 R_2 + R_2 R_3 + R_3 R_1}{R_1}, \\tag{3.47} \\\\\nR_b &= \\frac{R_1 R_2 + R_2 R_3 + R_3 R_1}{R_2}, \\tag{3.48} \\\\\nR_c &= \\frac{R_1 R_2 + R_2 R_3 + R_3 R_1}{R_3}. \\tag{3.49}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nExample 3.7 demonstrates the application of a Δ-to-Y transformation to simplify circuit analysis.\n\n#### Example 3.7 Applying a Delta-to-Wye Transform\n\nDetermine the current and power supplied by the 40 V source in the circuit shown in Fig. 3.32.\n\n#### Solution\n\nOur focus is on the current and power drawn from the 40 V source, so the problem is solved once we find the equivalent resistance across the source's terminals. After replacing either the upper Δ (100, 125, 25 Ω) or the lower Δ (40, 25, 37.5 Ω) with its equivalent Y, we can easily determine this resistance. We opt to replace the upper Δ. Subsequently, we calculate the three Y resistances, defined in Fig. 3.33, using Eqs. 3.44 to 3.46:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nR_1 &= \\frac{100 \\times 125}{250} = 50 \\Omega, \\\\\nR_2 &= \\frac{125 \\times 25}{250} = 12.5 \\Omega, \\\\\nR_3 &= \\frac{100 \\times 25}{250} = 10 \\Omega.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nIntroducing the Y resistors into the circuit shown in Fig. 3.32 yields the circuit in Fig. 3.34. From Fig. 3.34, we can easily calculate the resistance across the 40 V source's terminals using series-parallel simplifications:\n\n\\[\nR_{eq} = 55 + \\frac{(50)(50)}{100} = 80 \\Omega.\n\\]\n\nThe final step involves recognizing that the circuit simplifies to an 80 Ω resistor across the 40 V source, as shown in Fig. 3.35. It is then evident that the 40 V source supplies 0.5 A and 20 W to the circuit.\n\n#### Assessment Problem\n\nObjective 6—Know when and how to use delta-to-wye equivalent circuits\n3.8 Apply a Y-to-Δ transformation to find the voltage \\( v \\) in the circuit shown.\n\nAnswer: 35 V.\nNote: Also try Chapter Problems 3.60, 3.62, and 3.63.\n\n#### Practical Perspective\n\nResistive Touch Screens\n\nBegin by analyzing the resistive grid in the x-direction. We model the resistance of the grid in the x-direction with the resistance \\( R_{x'} \\) as shown in Fig. 3.34. The x-location where the screen is touched is indicated by the arrow. The resulting voltage drop across the resistance \\( \\alpha R_x \\) is \\( V_x \\). Touching the screen effectively divides the total resistance, \\( R_{x'} \\), into two separate resistances \\( \\alpha R_x \\) and \\( (1-\\alpha) R_x \\).\n\nFrom the figure, when the touch is on the far right side of the screen, \\( \\alpha = 0 \\), and \\( V_x = 0 \\). Similarly, when the touch is on the far left side, \\( \\alpha = 1 \\), and \\( V_x = V_s \\). If the touch is between the two edges, \\( \\alpha \\) is between 0 and 1, and the two parts of the resistance \\( R_x \\) form a voltage divider. The voltage \\( V_x \\) can be calculated using the voltage division equation:\n\n\\[\nV_x = \\frac{\\alpha R_x}{\\alpha R_x + (1-\\alpha) R_x} V_s = \\frac{\\alpha R_x}{R_x} V_s = \\alpha V_s.\n\\]\n\nThe value of \\( \\alpha \\), which represents the touch point's location relative to the right side of the screen, can be found by dividing the voltage across the grid resistance starting at the touch point, \\( V_{x'} \\), by the voltage applied across the entire resistive grid in the x-direction, \\( V_s \\):\n\n\\[\n\\alpha = \\frac{V_x}{V_s}.\n\\]\n\nNow, to determine the x-coordinate of the touch location on the screen, we use the value of \\( \\alpha \\). Typically, screen coordinates are specified in pixels. For instance, a mobile phone screen would be divided into a grid of pixels with \\( p_x \\) pixels in the x-direction and \\( p_y \\) pixels in the y-direction. Each pixel is identified by its x-location (a number between 0 and \\( p_x-1 \\)) and its y-location (a number between 0 and \\( p_y-1 \\)). The pixel with the location (0,0) is in the upper left corner of the screen, as shown in Fig. 3.37.\n\nSince \\( \\alpha \\) represents the touch point's location with respect to the right side of the screen, \\( (1-\\alpha) \\) represents its location with respect to the left side. Therefore, the x-coordinate of the pixel corresponding to the touch point is:\n\n\\[\nx = (1-\\alpha) p_x.\n\\]\n\nNote that the value of \\( x \\) is capped at \\( p_x-1 \\).\n\nUsing the model of the resistive screen grid in the y-direction shown in Fig. 3.38, it is easy to show that the voltage created by a touch at the arrow is given by:\n\n\\[\nV_y = \\beta V_s.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the y-coordinate of the pixel corresponding to the touch point is:\n\n\\[\ny = (1-\\beta) p_y,\n\\]\n\nwhere the value of \\( y \\) is capped at \\( p_y-1 \\). (See Problem 3.72.)\n\nNote: Assess your understanding of the Practical Perspective by solving Chapter Problems 3.72-3.75."

However, this can be accomplished through delta-to-wye (Δ-to-Y) or pi-to-tee (π-to-T) transformations.\n\nIn the circuit of Fig. 3.28, the resistors \\( R_{1}, R_{2} \\), and \\( R_{m} \\) (or \\( R_{3}, R_{m} \\), and \\( R_{x} \\)) form a delta (Δ) interconnection, resembling the Greek letter Δ. This configuration is also known as a pi interconnection, as the Δ can be transformed into a π without altering the electrical equivalence, as demonstrated in Fig. 3.29.\n\nSimilarly, the resistors \\( R_{1}, R_{m} \\), and \\( R_{3} \\) (or \\( R_{2}, R_{m} \\), and \\( R_{x} \\)) in Fig. 3.28 constitute a wye (Y) interconnection, which can be shaped to resemble the letter Y, clearly visible in Fig. 3.30. This Y configuration is also referred to as a tee (T) interconnection, as it can be reshaped into a T without compromising the electrical equivalence, as shown in Fig. 3.30.\n\nFig. 3.31 illustrates the Δ-to-Y (or π-to-T) transformation. It's important to note that simply altering the shape of the interconnections does not achieve the transformation. The equivalence between the Δ and Y configurations means that the Δ configuration can be replaced with a Y configuration to make the terminal behavior of the two configurations identical. This is only true if the resistance between corresponding terminal pairs is the same for each configuration. For example, the resistance between terminals a and b must be the same whether we use the Δ-connected set or the Y-connected set. The equivalent resistance for each pair of terminals in the Δ-connected circuit can be calculated using series and parallel simplifications to yield:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gather*}\nR_{\\mathrm{ab}}=\\frac{R_{c}\\left(R_{a}+R_{b}\\right)}{R_{a}+R_{b}+R_{c}}=R_{1}+R_{2},  \\tag{3.41}\\\\\nR_{\\mathrm{bc}}=\\frac{R_{a}\\left(R_{b}+R_{c}\\right)}{R_{a}+R_{b}+R_{c}}=R_{2}+R_{3},  \\tag{3.42}\\\\\nR_{\\mathrm{ca}}=\\frac{R_{b}\\left(R_{c}+R_{a}\\right)}{R_{a}+R_{b}+R_{c}}=R_{1}+R_{3} . \\tag{3.43}\n\\end{gather*}\n$$\n\nThe Δ-to-Y transformation can also be reversed. Starting with the Y structure, we can replace it with an equivalent Δ structure. The expressions for the three Δ-connected resistors as functions of the three Y-connected resistors are:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nR_{a} & =\\frac{R_{1} R_{2}+R_{2} R_{3}+R_{3} R_{1}}{R_{1}}  \\tag{3.47}\\\\\nR_{b} & =\\frac{R_{1} R_{2}+R_{2} R_{3}+R_{3} R_{1}}{R_{2}}  \\tag{3.48}\\\\\nR_{c} & =\\frac{R_{1} R_{2}+R_{2} R_{3}+R_{3} R_{1}}{R_{3}} \\tag{3.49}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nExample 3.7 demonstrates the application of a Δ-to-Y transformation to simplify circuit analysis.\n\n#### Example 3.7 Applying a Delta-to-Wye Transform\n\nDetermine the current and power supplied by the 40 V source in the circuit shown in Fig. 3.32.\nimage_name:Figure 3.32\ndescription:\n[\n'name': 'V1', 'type': 'VoltageSource', 'value': '40V', 'ports': {'Np': 'a', 'Nn': 'e'\n'name': 'R1', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '5Ω', 'ports': {'N1': 'a', 'N2': 'b'\n'name': 'R2', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '100Ω', 'ports': {'N1': 'b', 'N2': 'c'\n'name': 'R3', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '125Ω', 'ports': {'N1': 'b', 'N2': 'd'\n'name': 'R4', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '25Ω', 'ports': {'N1': 'c', 'N2': 'd'\n'name': 'R5', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '40Ω', 'ports': {'N1': 'c', 'N2': 'e'\n'name': 'R6', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '37.5Ω', 'ports': {'N1': 'd', 'N2': 'e'\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit contains a Delta configuration of resistors between nodes b, c, and d.

This equivalent resistance can be easily determined after replacing either the upper Δ (100, 125, 25 Ω) or the lower Δ (40, 25, 37.5 Ω) with its equivalent Y. We choose to replace the upper Δ. We then compute the three Y resistances, defined in Fig. 3.33, from Eqs. 3.44 to 3.46. Thus:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& R_{1}=\\frac{100 \\times 125}{250}=50 \\Omega \\\\\n& R_{2}=\\frac{125 \\times 25}{250}=12.5 \\Omega \\\\\n& R_{3}=\\frac{100 \\times 25}{250}=10 \\Omega\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the Y-resistors into the circuit shown in Fig. 3.32 produces the circuit shown in Fig. 3.34.

We model the resistance of the grid in the x-direction with the resistance \\( R_{x^{\\prime}} \\) as shown in Fig. 3.34. The x-location where the screen is touched is indicated by the arrow. The resulting voltage drop across the resistance \\( \\alpha R_{x} \\) is \\( V_{x} \\). Touching the screen effectively divides the total resistance, \\( R_{x^{\\prime}} \\) into two separate resistances \\( \\alpha R_{x} \\) and \\( (1-\\alpha) R_{x} \\).\n\nFrom the figure, you can see that when the touch is on the far right side of the screen, \\( \\alpha=0 \\), and \\( V_{x}=0 \\). Similarly, when the touch is on the far left side of the screen, \\( \\alpha=1 \\), and \\( V_{x}=V_{s} \\). If the touch is in between the two edges of the screen, the value of \\( \\alpha \\) is between 0 and 1, and the two parts of the resistance \\( R_{x} \\) form a voltage divider. We can calculate the voltage \\( V_{x} \\) using the equation for voltage division:\n\n$$\nV_{x}=\\frac{\\alpha R_{x}}{\\alpha R_{x}+(1-\\alpha) R_{x}} V_{s}=\\frac{\\alpha R_{x}}{R_{x}} V_{s}=\\alpha V_{s} .\n$$\n\nWe can find the value of \\( \\alpha \\), which represents the location of the touch point with respect to the far right side of the screen, by dividing the voltage across the grid resistance starting at the touch point, \\( V_{x^{\\prime}} \\), by the voltage applied across the entire resistive grid in the x-direction, \\( V_{s} \\):\n\n$$\n\\alpha=\\frac{V_{x}}{V_{s}} .\n$$\n\nNow we want to use the value of \\( \\alpha \\) to determine the x-coordinate of the touch location on the screen. Typically, the screen coordinates are specified in terms of pixels (short for \"picture elements\"). For example, the screen of a mobile phone would be divided into a grid of pixels with \\( p_{x} \\) pixels in the x-direction and \\( p_{y} \\) pixels in the y-direction. Each pixel is identified by its x-location (a number between 0 and \\( p_{x}-1 \\)) and its y-location (a number between 0 and \\( p_{y}-1 \\)). The pixel with the location (0,0) is in the upper left hand corner of the screen, as shown in Fig. 3.37.\nimage_name:Figure 3.37\ndescription:The image, labeled as Figure 3.37, displays a rectangular grid representing a screen divided into pixels. The corners of the rectangle are marked with pixel coordinates. The top-left corner is labeled \\((0,0)\\), indicating the starting point of the grid. The top-right corner is labeled \\((p_x-1, 0)\\), showing the maximum x-coordinate at the top edge. The bottom-left corner is marked \\((0, p_y-1)\\), indicating the maximum y-coordinate at the left edge. Finally, the bottom-right corner is labeled \\((p_x-1, p_y-1)\\), representing the maximum x and y coordinates on the screen. This setup illustrates how pixel coordinates are structured on a screen, with \\( p_{x} \\) pixels in the x-direction and \\( p_{y} \\) pixels in the y-direction.\"}\n\n\nFigure 3.37 Δ The pixel coordinates of a screen with \\( p_{x} \\) pixels in the x-direction and \\( p_{y} \\) pixels in the y-direction.\n\nSince \\( \\alpha \\) represents the location of the touch point with respect to the right side of the screen, \\( (1-\\alpha) \\) represents the location of the touch point with respect to the left side of the screen. Therefore, the x-coordinate of the pixel corresponding to the touch point is:\n\n$$\nx=(1-\\alpha) p_{x}\n$$\n\nNote that the value of \\( x \\) is capped at \\( (p_{x}-1) \\).\nUsing the model of the resistive screen grid in the y-direction shown in Fig. 3.38, it is easy to show that the voltage created by a touch at the arrow is given by:\n\n$$\nV_{y}=\\beta V_{s} .\n$$\n\nimage_name:Figure 3.38\ndescription:\n[\n'name': 'Ry', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'Ry', 'ports': {'N1': 'Vin', 'N2': 'GND'\n'name': 'Vs', 'type': 'VoltageSource', 'value': 'Vs', 'ports': {'Np': 'Vin', 'Nn': 'GND'\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit represents a resistive touch screen grid model in the y-direction.

    "text": "The bridge arrangement depicted in Fig. 3.26 presents a complex interplay of resistive elements necessitating a detailed examination. Upon substituting the galvanometer with its resistive equivalent $R_{m}$, the resulting circuit can be visualized in Fig. 3.28. It is not feasible to condense the resistors in this circuit into a solitary equivalent resistance across the battery terminals by solely employing the straightforward series or parallel resistance simplifications introduced earlier in this text. However, this can be achieved by converting the resistive network into a delta-to-wye ( $\\Delta$-to-Y) or pi-to-tee ( $\\pi$-to-T) equivalent circuit.\n\nThe resistors $R_{1}, R_{2}$, and $R_{m}$ (or $R_{3}, R_{m}$, and $R_{x}$) in the circuit of Fig. 3.28 are identified as a delta ( $\\Delta$) configuration due to their arrangement reminiscent of the Greek letter $\\Delta$. This configuration is also recognized as a pi configuration since the $\\Delta$ can be effortlessly reshaped into a $\\pi$ without compromising the electrical equivalence of both setups. This equivalence is clearly depicted in Fig. 3.29.\n\nThe resistors $R_{1}, R_{m}$, and $R_{3}$ (or $R_{2}, R_{m}$, and $R_{x}$) in the circuit of Fig. 3.28 are designated as a wye ( $\\mathbf{Y}$) configuration because their interconnection can be manipulated to resemble the letter Y, a feature more pronounced when the circuit is illustrated as in Fig. 3.30. This Y arrangement is colloquially referred to as a tee ( $\\mathbf{T}$) configuration since it can be modified into a T shape without altering the electrical equivalence. This equivalence is evident from Fig. 3.30.\n\nFig. 3.31 delineates the transformation from a $\\Delta$-to-Y (or $\\pi$-to-T) equivalent circuit. It is crucial to understand that simply altering the shape of the connections does not transform a $\\Delta$-connected circuit into a Y-connected one. Stating that a $\\Delta$-connected circuit is equivalent to a Y-connected one implies that the $\\Delta$ configuration can be substituted with a Y configuration to ensure identical terminal behavior. Consequently, if both configurations were enclosed in opaque boxes, external measurements would be insufficient to discern whether the boxes contain $\\Delta$- or Y-connected resistors. This holds true only when the resistance between corresponding terminal pairs is consistent across both boxes. For instance, the resistance between terminals a and b must be uniform regardless of whether a $\\Delta$- or Y-connected set is employed. For each terminal pair in the $\\Delta$-connected circuit, the equivalent resistance can be determined through series and parallel simplifications as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gather*}\nR_{\\mathrm{ab}}=\\frac{R_{c}\\left(R_{a}+R_{b}\\right)}{R_{a}+R_{b}+R_{c}}=R_{1}+R_{2},  \\tag{3.41}\\\\\nR_{\\mathrm{bc}}=\\frac{R_{a}\\left(R_{b}+R_{c}\\right)}{R_{a}+R_{b}+R_{c}}=R_{2}+R_{3},  \\tag{3.42}\\\\\nR_{\\mathrm{ca}}=\\frac{R_{b}\\left(R_{c}+R_{a}\\right)}{R_{a}+R_{b}+R_{c}}=R_{1}+R_{3} . \\tag{3.43}\n\\end{gather*}\n$$\n\nThe transformation from a $\\Delta$ to a Y configuration can be reversed, allowing us to start with a Y configuration and replace it with an equivalent $\\Delta$ structure.

This equivalent resistance can be readily determined after replacing either the upper $\\Delta$ (100, 125, 25 $\\Omega$) or the lower $\\Delta$ (40, 25, 37.5 $\\Omega$) with its corresponding Y configuration. We opt to replace the upper $\\Delta$. Subsequently, we calculate the three Y resistances using Eqs. 3.44 to 3.46, as defined in Fig. 3.33:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& R_{1}=\\frac{100 \\times 125}{250}=50 \\Omega \\\\\n& R_{2}=\\frac{125 \\times 25}{250}=12.5 \\Omega \\\\\n& R_{3}=\\frac{100 \\times 25}{250}=10 \\Omega\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIntroducing these Y resistors into the circuit of Fig. 3.32 yields the circuit shown in Fig. 3.34.

We model this resistance with $R_{x^{\\prime}}$ as depicted in Fig. 3.34. The point of contact on the screen is marked by an arrow. The voltage drop across the resistance $\\alpha R_{x}$ is denoted as $V_{x}$. A touch on the screen effectively splits the total resistance $R_{x^{\\prime}}$ into two distinct resistances: $\\alpha R_{x}$ and $(1-\\alpha) R_{x}$.\n\nWhen the touch is at the extreme right of the screen, $\\alpha=0$, and consequently, $V_{x}=0$. Similarly, a touch at the far left results in $\\alpha=1$ and $V_{x}=V_{s}$. For intermediate points, $\\alpha$ falls between 0 and 1, with the two sections of $R_{x}$ acting as a voltage divider. The voltage $V_{x}$ can be calculated using the voltage divider formula:\n\n$$\nV_{x}=\\frac{\\alpha R_{x}}{\\alpha R_{x}+(1-\\alpha) R_{x}} V_{s}=\\frac{\\alpha R_{x}}{R_{x}} V_{s}=\\alpha V_{s} .\n$$\n\nThe value of $\\alpha$, which signifies the touch point's location relative to the screen's right edge, can be determined by dividing the voltage $V_{x^{\\prime}}$ across the resistance at the touch point by the voltage $V_{s}$ applied across the entire resistive grid in the $x$-direction:\n\n$$\n\\alpha=\\frac{V_{x}}{V_{s}} .\n$$\n\nThe $x$-coordinate of the pixel corresponding to the touch point on the screen is then calculated using $\\alpha$. Screens typically use pixels (picture elements) for coordinate specification. For instance, a mobile phone screen is divided into a grid of pixels with $p_{x}$ pixels in the $x$-direction and $p_{y}$ pixels in the $y$-direction. Each pixel is identified by its $x$-location (ranging from 0 to $p_{x}-1$) and its $y$-location (ranging from 0 to $p_{y}-1$). The pixel at location $(0,0)$ is found in the upper left corner of the screen, as shown in Fig. 3.37.\n\nSince $\\alpha$ denotes the touch point's position relative to the screen's right edge, $(1-\\alpha)$ indicates its position relative to the left edge. Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of the pixel corresponding to the touch point is\n\n$$\nx=(1-\\alpha) p_{x}\n$$\n\nwith the value of $x$ capped at $\\left(p_{x}-1\\right)$.\n\nUsing the resistive screen grid model in the $y$-direction depicted in Fig. 3.38, it is straightforward to demonstrate that the voltage generated by a touch at the indicated point is given by\n\n$$\nV_{y}=\\beta V_{s} .\n$$\n\nThus, the $y$-coordinate of the pixel corresponding to the touch point is\n\n$$\ny=(1-\\beta) p_{y}\n$$\n\nwith the value of $y$ capped at $\\left(p_{y}-1\\right)$.

A Delta-to-Wye transformation can be applied to simplify the analysis.\n\nFigure 3.32 Δ The circuit for Example 3.7.\n\n#### Solution\n\nOur focus is solely on the current and power supplied by the 40 V source, which can be determined once the equivalent resistance across the source terminals is found. This equivalent resistance can be easily calculated after replacing either the upper Δ (100, 125, 25 Ω) or the lower Δ (40, 25, 37.5 Ω) with its equivalent Y. We opt to replace the upper Δ. Subsequently, we compute the three Y resistances from Eqs. 3.44 to 3.46 as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& R_1=\\frac{100 \\times 125}{250}=50 \\Omega, \\\\\n& R_2=\\frac{125 \\times 25}{250}=12.5 \\Omega, \\\\\n& R_3=\\frac{100 \\times 25}{250}=10 \\Omega.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the Y resistors into the circuit shown in Fig. 3.32 yields the circuit depicted in Fig. 3.34. From this figure, the resistance across the terminals of the 40 V source can be easily calculated using series-parallel simplifications:\n\n$$\nR_{eq}=55+\\frac{(50)(50)}{100}=80 \\Omega.\n$$\n\nThe final step reveals that the circuit simplifies to an 80 Ω resistor across the 40 V source, as shown in Fig. 3.35, indicating that the 40 V source delivers 0.5 A and 20 W to the circuit.\n\nimage_name: Figure 3.33\ndescription:\n[\n'name': 'R1', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '100Ω', 'ports': {'N1': 'N1', 'N2': 'N2'},\n'name': '25Ω', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '25Ω', 'ports': {'N1': 'N2', 'N2': 'N3'},\n'name': '125Ω', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '125Ω', 'ports': {'N1': 'N3', 'N2': 'N1'},\n'name': 'R1', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'R1', 'ports': {'N1': 'N1', 'N2': 'N4'},\n'name': 'R2', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'R2', 'ports': {'N1': 'N3', 'N2': 'N4'},\n'name': 'R3', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'R3', 'ports': {'N1': 'N2', 'N2': 'N4'}\n]\nextrainfo: The circuit is a delta configuration with resistors R1, R2, and R3 forming a triangle.\n\nFigure 3.33 Δ The equivalent Y resistors.\nimage_name: Figure 3.34\ndescription:\n[\n'name': 'V1', 'type': 'VoltageSource', 'value': '40V', 'ports': {'Np': 'a', 'Nn': 'GND'},\n'name': 'R1', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '5Ω', 'ports': {'N1': 'a', 'N2': 'b'},\n'name': 'R2', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '10Ω', 'ports': {'N1': 'b', 'N2': 'd'},\n'name': 'R3', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '50Ω', 'ports': {'N1': 'b', 'N2': 'c'},\n'name': 'R4', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '40Ω', 'ports': {'N1': 'd', 'N2': 'GND'},\n'name': 'R5', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '12.5Ω', 'ports': {'N1': 'c', 'N2': 'e'},\n'name': 'R6', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '37.5Ω', 'ports': {'N1': 'e', 'N2': 'GND'}\n]\nextrainfo: The circuit is a simplified version of a delta to wye transformation.

We model the resistance of the grid in the x-direction with the resistance $R_{x'}$ as shown in Fig. 3.34. The x-location where the screen is touched is indicated by the arrow. The resulting voltage drop across the resistance α$R_x$ is $V_x$. Touching the screen effectively divides the total resistance $R_{x'}$ into two separate resistances α$R_x$ and (1-α)$R_x$.\n\nFrom the figure, it is evident that when the touch is on the far right side of the screen, α=0, and $V_x=0$. Similarly, when the touch is on the far left side of the screen, α=1, and $V_x=V_s$. If the touch is between the two edges, α varies between 0 and 1, forming a voltage divider with the two parts of the resistance $R_x$. The voltage $V_x$ can be calculated using the voltage division equation:\n\n$$\nV_x=\\frac{\\alpha R_x}{\\alpha R_x+(1-\\alpha) R_x} V_s=\\frac{\\alpha R_x}{R_x} V_s=\\alpha V_s.\n$$\n\nThe value of α, representing the touch location relative to the far right side of the screen, can be determined by dividing the voltage across the grid resistance starting at the touch point, $V_{x'}$, by the voltage applied across the entire resistive grid in the x-direction, $V_s$:\n\n$$\n\\alpha=\\frac{V_x}{V_s}.\n$$\n\nNow, we use α to calculate the x-coordinate of the touch location on the screen. Typically, screen coordinates are specified in pixels (picture elements). For example, a mobile phone screen would be divided into a grid of pixels with $p_x$ pixels in the x-direction and $p_y$ pixels in the y-direction. Each pixel is identified by its x-location (a number between 0 and $p_x-1$) and its y-location (a number between 0 and $p_y-1$). The pixel at location (0,0) is in the upper left corner of the screen, as shown in Fig. 3.37.\n\nFigure 3.37 Δ The pixel coordinates of a screen with $p_x$ pixels in the x-direction and $p_y$ pixels in the y-direction.\n\nSince α represents the touch location relative to the right side of the screen, (1-α) represents the location relative to the left side. Therefore, the x-coordinate of the pixel corresponding to the touch point is:\n\n$$\nx=(1-\\alpha) p_x.\n$$\n\nNote that the value of x is capped at $(p_x-1)$.\nUsing the model of the resistive screen grid in the y-direction shown in Fig. 3.38, it is straightforward to show that the voltage created by a touch at the arrow is given by:\n\n$$\nV_y=\\beta V_s.\n"
