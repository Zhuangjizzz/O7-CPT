However, a thorough analysis of this circuit necessitates an understanding of electronic components like diodes and transistors. You might question why we introduce this circuit before discussing its electronic components. There are several reasons for this approach. Firstly, by focusing on the terminal behavior of the operational amplifier, you can appreciate its role as a fundamental circuit building block without needing to fully grasp the internal workings of its electronic components. Secondly, the circuit model of the operational amplifier involves the use of a dependent source, providing an opportunity to apply this type of source in a practical context rather than as an abstract concept.

Finally, after introducing inductors and capacitors in Chapter 6, we can demonstrate how to use the operational amplifier to design integrating and differentiating circuits.\n\nOur emphasis on the terminal behavior of the operational amplifier involves adopting a black box approach; that is, we are not concerned with the internal structure of the amplifier or the currents and voltages within it. The crucial point to remember is that the internal behavior of the amplifier dictates the voltage and current constraints at the terminals. (For now, we ask you to accept these constraints without detailed explanation.)\n\nPractical Perspective\n\nStrain Gages\n\nHow can you measure the bending of a metal bar, like the one illustrated, without direct contact? One method involves using a strain gage. A strain gage is a type of transducer, which is a device that converts a measured quantity into a more manageable form. The quantity we aim to measure in the metal bar is the bending angle, but direct measurement is challenging and potentially hazardous. Instead, we attach a strain gage (pictured in the line drawing) to the metal bar. A strain gage consists of a grid of thin wires whose resistance changes when the wires are stretched or compressed:\n\n$$\n\\Delta R=2 R \\frac{\\Delta L}{L}\n$$\n\nwhere $R$ is the resistance of the gage at rest, $\\Delta L / L$ is the fractional change in length (defining \"strain\"), the constant 2 is typical of the manufacturer's gage factor, and $\\Delta R$ is the resistance change due to the bar's bending. Typically, pairs of strain gages are attached to opposite sides of the bar. When the bar bends, the wires in one pair lengthen and thin, increasing resistance, while the wires in the other pair shorten and thicken, decreasing resistance.\n\nBut how is this change in resistance measured? One method is using an ohmmeter. However, the resistance change in a strain gage is usually too small for accurate ohmmeter measurement. Typically, pairs of strain gages are configured in a Wheatstone bridge, and the voltage difference between two bridge legs is measured. To accurately measure this voltage difference, we use an operational amplifier circuit to amplify it. After introducing the operational amplifier and key circuits that utilize it, we will present the circuit used with strain gages to measure the bending of a metal bar.\n\nThe operational amplifier circuit initially emerged as a basic building block in analog computers. It was termed \"operational\" because it executed mathematical operations like integration, differentiation, addition, sign changing, and scaling. In recent years, its applications have expanded beyond these operations, but the original name remains. Engineers and technicians often create technical terminology; thus, the operational amplifier is widely known as the op amp.\n\nimage_name:Figure 5.1\ndescription:The image shows a graphical representation of a cylindrical object, likely a cable or pipe, overlaid with flexible, layered sheets.

In 1968, Fairchild Semiconductor launched an op amp that gained extensive popularity: the $\\mu \\mathrm{A} 741$. (The $\\mu \\mathrm{A}$ prefix denotes Fairchild's microcircuit fabrication of the amplifier.) This amplifier comes in various package types, but for our purposes, we consider an eight-lead DIP. ${ }^{1}$ Figure 5.1 presents a top view of this package, with terminal labels adjacent to each terminal. The key terminals are:\n\n- inverting input,\n- noninverting input,\n- output,\n- positive power supply $\\left(V^{+}\\right)$,\n- negative power supply $\\left(V^{-}\\right)$.\n\nThe other three terminals are generally less significant. The offset null terminals can be employed in auxiliary circuits to mitigate performance decline due to aging and imperfections. However, such decline is often minimal, rendering the offset terminals frequently unused and of secondary importance in circuit analysis.

    "text": "We are set to discuss the terminal voltages and currents employed to depict the operational amplifier's behavior. Voltage measurements are taken relative to a common reference node, as depicted in Figure 5.4, which illustrates these voltage variables along with their respective polarities.\n\nAccording to the node-voltage analysis methodology, all voltages are perceived as increments from the common node. A positive supply voltage (\\(V_{CC}\\)) is linked between \\(V^{+}\\) and the common node, while a negative supply voltage (\\(-V_{CC}\\)) is connected between \\(V^{-}\\) and the common node. The voltage between the inverting input terminal and the common node is denoted as \\(v_n\\), between the non-inverting input terminal and the common node as \\(v_p\\), and between the output terminal and the common node as \\(v_o\\).\n\nFigure 5.5 delineates the current variables with their respective reference directions. It's important to note that all current reference directions point towards the operational amplifier's terminals: \\(i_n\\) is the current into the inverting input terminal, \\(i_p\\) into the non-inverting input terminal, and \\(i_o\\) into the output terminal. \\(i_{c^{+}}\\) is the current into the positive power supply terminal, and \\(i_{c^{-}}\\) into the negative power supply terminal.\n\nThe operational amplifier's terminal behavior as a linear circuit element is defined by limitations on the input voltages and currents. The voltage constraint is inferred from the operational amplifier integrated circuit's voltage transfer characteristic, as shown in Figure 5.6.\n\nThe voltage transfer characteristic delineates how the output voltage fluctuates as a function of the input voltages, that is, how voltage is conveyed from input to output. It's noteworthy that the operational amplifier's output voltage is a function of the input voltage difference, \\(v_p - v_n\\). The equation for the voltage transfer characteristic is given by Equation 5.1.\n\nAs depicted in Figure 5.6 and defined by Equation 5.1, the operational amplifier exhibits three distinct operational regions. When the input voltage difference magnitude (\\(|v_p - v_n|\\)) is minimal, the operational amplifier acts linearly, with the output voltage being a linear function of the input voltages. Beyond this linear region, the operational amplifier's output saturates, and it behaves nonlinearly since the output voltage is no longer linearly dependent on the input voltages. In its linear operation, the operational amplifier's output voltage is equivalent to the input voltage difference multiplied by the gain, \\(A\\).\n\nWhen restricting the operational amplifier to its linear operational region, a constraint is imposed on the input voltages, \\(v_p\\) and \\(v_n\\). This constraint is grounded in typical \\(V_{CC}\\) and \\(A\\) values as per Equation 5.1. For most operational amplifiers, the recommended direct current power supply voltages rarely exceed 20 V, and the gain, \\(A\\), is seldom less than 10,000 or \\(10^4\\). As indicated in Figure 5.6 and Equation 5.1, within the linear region, the input voltage difference magnitude (\\(|v_p - v_n|\\)) must be less than \\(20 / 10^4\\) or 2 mV.\n\nOrdinarily, node voltages in the circuits under study are significantly greater than 2 mV. Hence, a voltage difference of less than 2 mV suggests that the two voltages are essentially equal. Thus, when an operational amplifier is confined to its linear operational region and the node voltages are much larger than 2 mV, the constraint on the operational amplifier's input voltages is given by Equation 5.2.\n\nEquation 5.2 defines the relationship between the input voltages for an ideal operational amplifier—one with an infinite \\(A\\) value. This input voltage constraint is known as the virtual short condition at the operational amplifier's input. The mechanism ensuring the virtual short at the input when the operational amplifier is integrated into a circuit, thereby guaranteeing linear operation, is the feedback signal from the output terminal to the inverting input terminal. This arrangement is known as negative feedback since the feedback signal reduces the input signal. Negative feedback diminishes the input voltage difference, and because the output voltage is proportional to this difference, the output voltage is reduced, keeping the operational amplifier in its linear region.\n\nWithout a negative feedback path from the operational amplifier's output to its inverting input in a circuit containing an operational amplifier, the operational amplifier will typically saturate. The input signal difference must be exceedingly small to prevent saturation without negative feedback. However, even with a negative feedback path, linear operation is not guaranteed. We verify whether the operational amplifier operates in its linear region by assuming linear operation, conducting the circuit analysis, and subsequently checking for contradictions.\n\nFor instance, if we assume that an operational amplifier in a circuit operates linearly and calculate its output voltage to be 10 V, but upon examining the circuit, we find that \\(V_{CC}\\) is 6 V, a contradiction arises because the operational amplifier's output voltage cannot exceed \\(V_{CC}\\). Hence, our assumption of linear operation is erroneous, and the operational amplifier's output must be saturated at 6 V.\n\nThe input voltage constraint in Equation 5.2 is predicated on the operational amplifier integrated circuit's voltage transfer characteristic, the supposition that the operational amplifier is limited to its linear operational region, and typical \\(V_{CC}\\) and \\(A\\) values. Equation 5.2 delineates the voltage constraint for an ideal operational amplifier, i.e., one with an infinite \\(A\\) value.\n\nOur focus now shifts to the constraint on the input currents. An analysis of the operational amplifier integrated circuit reveals that the equivalent resistance perceived by the input terminals is exceedingly high, usually \\(1 \\mathrm{M}\\Omega\\) or more. Ideally, this equivalent input resistance is infinite, leading to the current constraint in Equation 5.3.\n\nThis current constraint is not predicated on the assumption that the operational amplifier is confined to its linear operational region, unlike the voltage constraint. Equations 5.2 and 5.3 collectively define the terminal behavior constraints characterizing our ideal operational amplifier model.\n\nFrom Kirchhoff's current law, we discern that the sum of the currents entering the operational amplifier is zero, as expressed in Equation 5.4. Substituting the constraint from Equation 5.3 into Equation 5.4 yields Equation 5.5. Equation 5.5's significance lies in the fact that, despite negligible current at the input terminals, the output terminal may still exhibit significant current.\n\nBefore delving into the analysis of circuits containing operational amplifiers, let's further streamline the circuit symbol. When we ascertain that the amplifier operates within its linear region, the direct current voltages \\(\\pm V_{CC}\\) are irrelevant to the circuit equations.\n\nUnder these circumstances, we can eliminate the power supply terminals from the symbol and the direct current power supplies from the circuit, as demonstrated in Figure 5.7. A word of caution: The omission of the power supply terminals from the symbol might mislead one to infer that \\(i_p + i_n + i_o = 0\\). However, as previously mentioned, this is not the case; the correct relation is \\(i_p + i_n + i_o + i_{c^{+}} + i_{c^{-}} = 0\\). In other words, the ideal operational amplifier model's constraint \\(i_p = i_n = 0\\) does not imply \\(i_o = 0\\).\n\nIt's important to note that the positive and negative power supply voltages need not be of equal magnitude. In the linear operational region, \\(v_o\\) must lie between the two supply voltages. For instance, if \\(V^{+} = 15 \\mathrm{~V}\\) and \\(V^{-} = -10 \\mathrm{~V}\\), then \\(-10 \\mathrm{~V} \\leq v_o \\leq 15 \\mathrm{~V}\\). Additionally, be mindful that the \\(A\\) value is not constant under all operating conditions. For the time being, however, we assume it to be constant. A detailed discussion of how and why the \\(A\\) value can fluctuate must be deferred until after you have examined the electronic devices and components used in amplifier fabrication.\n\nExample 5.1 showcasesifies the judicious application of Equations 5.2 and 5.3.

    "text": "We are set to discuss the terminal voltages and currents, which are essential in describing the operational amplifier's (op amp) behavior. Voltage measurements are taken with respect to a common reference node, as depicted in Figure 5.4, which illustrates these voltage variables alongside their reference polarities.\n\nAccording to the convention, similar to the node-voltage analysis method, all voltages are understood as the rise from the common node. A positive supply voltage ($V_{CC}$) is linked between the $V^{+}$ terminal and the common node, whereas a negative supply voltage ($-V_{CC}$) is connected between the $V^{-}$ terminal and the common node. The voltage measured from the inverting input terminal to the common node is labeled as $v_{n}$, and the voltage from the noninverting input terminal to the common node is marked as $v_{p}$. Lastly, the voltage from the output terminal to the common node is denoted by $v_{o}$.\n\nFigure 5.5 presents the current variables and their respective reference directions. It is important to note that all current directions are into the op amp's terminals: $i_{n}$ represents the current flowing into the inverting input terminal; $i_{p}$ is the current entering the noninverting input terminal; $i_{o}$ is the current heading into the output terminal; $i_{c^{+}}$ is the current going into the positive power supply terminal; and $i_{c^{-}}$ is the current moving into the negative power supply terminal.\n\nThe linear circuit behavior of the op amp is defined by constraints on the input voltages and currents. The voltage constraint arises from the op amp integrated circuit's voltage transfer characteristic, as shown in Figure 5.6.\n\nThis characteristic illustrates how the output voltage ($v_{o}$) changes in response to the input voltages' difference ($v_{p}-v_{n}$). For the op amp, the output voltage is dependent on this differential input voltage. The equation for the voltage transfer characteristic is expressed in Equation 5.1.\n\nIt is evident from Figure 5.6 and Equation 5.1 that the op amp operates in three distinct regions. When the difference in input voltages is small, the op amp acts as a linear device since the output voltage is directly proportional to the input voltages. Beyond this linear range, the op amp's output saturates, behaving nonlinearly, as the output voltage is no longer a linear function of the input voltages. In linear operation, the op amp's output voltage is the product of the input voltage difference and the amplification constant, or gain, $A$.\n\nLimiting the op amp to its linear region imposes constraints on the input voltages, $v_{p}$ and $v_{n}$. Based on typical values for $V_{CC}$ and $A$, this constraint dictates that for most op amps, the recommended direct current (dc) power supply voltages rarely exceed 20 V, and the gain, $A$, is usually not less than 10,000 or $10^{4}$. Therefore, in the linear region, the magnitude of the input voltage difference must be less than $20 / 10^{4}$, which is 2 mV.\n\nGiven that node voltages in the circuits we examine are often significantly greater than 2 mV, a voltage difference of less than 2 mV implies that the two voltages are essentially equal. Consequently, when an op amp is restricted to its linear operating region and the node voltages are much larger than 2 mV, the constraint on the input voltages of the op amp becomes $v_{p}=v_{n}$, as stated in Equation 5.2.\n\nThis equation represents the relationship between the input voltages for an ideal op amp, one with an infinite value of $A$. The input voltage constraint in Equation 5.2 is referred to as the virtual short condition at the op amp's input.\n\nIt is logical to question how the virtual short is sustained at the input of the op amp when integrated into a circuit, thus ensuring linear operation. The mechanism involves feeding back a signal from the output terminal to the inverting input terminal, creating a configuration known as negative feedback. This negative feedback reduces the input voltage difference, and since the output voltage is proportional to this difference, it too decreases, allowing the op amp to function linearly.\n\nIn circuits without a negative feedback path from the op amp output to the inverting input, the op amp will typically saturate. For saturation to be avoided without negative feedback, the input signals' difference must be exceedingly small. However, even with a negative feedback path, linear operation is not guaranteed. We determine whether the op amp is operating linearly by assuming linear operation, conducting the circuit analysis, and subsequently checking for contradictions. For instance, if we assume an op amp in a circuit is operating linearly and calculate an output voltage of 10 V, but upon examining the circuit, we find that $V_{CC}$ is only 6 V, we encounter a contradiction because the op amp's output voltage cannot exceed $V_{CC}$. Thus, our assumption of linear operation is incorrect, and the op amp's output must be saturated at 6 V.\n\nThe input voltage constraint in Equation 5.2 is based on the op amp integrated circuit's voltage transfer characteristic and the assumption of linear operation within typical values for $V_{CC}$ and $A$. This equation characterizes the voltage constraint for an ideal op amp, implying an infinite $A$ value.\n\nNow, let's consider the constraint on the input currents. The analysis of the op amp integrated circuit reveals that the equivalent resistance seen at the input terminals is very high, typically $1 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega$ or greater. Ideally, this equivalent input resistance is infinite, leading to the current constraint expressed in Equation 5.3, $i_{p}=i_{n}=0$.\n\nIt is important to note that the current constraint is not derived from the assumption of the op amp being restricted to its linear operating region, unlike the voltage constraint. Equations 5.2 and 5.3 together form the terminal behavior constraints that define our ideal op amp model.\n\nKirchhoff's current law tells us that the sum of the currents entering the operational amplifier is zero, as shown in Equation 5.4. Substituting the current constraint from Equation 5.3 into Equation 5.4 yields Equation 5.5, which indicates that even though the current at the input terminals is negligible, there may still be a significant current at the output terminal.\n\nBefore analyzing circuits containing op amps, we simplify the circuit symbol further. When we are certain that the amplifier is operating within its linear region, the dc voltages $\\pm V_{CC}$ do not factor into the circuit equations. In such cases, we can omit the power supply terminals from the symbol and remove the dc power supplies from the circuit, as shown in Figure 5.7. However, it is crucial to remember that the absence of power supply terminals in the symbol does not imply that $i_{p}+i_{n}+i_{o}=0$. As previously stated, the ideal op amp model constraint that $i_{p}=i_{n}=0$ does not mean that $i_{o}=0$.\n\nIt is also important to realize that the positive and negative power supply voltages need not be of equal magnitude. In the linear operating region, $v_{o}$ must remain between the two supply voltages. For example, if $V^{+}=15 \\mathrm{~V}$ and $V^{-}=-10 \\mathrm{~V}$, then $-10 \\mathrm{~V} \\leq v_{o} \\leq 15 \\mathrm{~V}$. Furthermore, the value of $A$ is not constant under all operating conditions, but for the purposes of our current discussion, we assume it remains constant. A detailed explanation of the factors influencing the value of $A$ will be provided after studying the electronic devices and components used to construct amplifiers.\n\nExample 5.1 demonstrates the application of Equations 5.2 and 5.3 in predicting the behavior of a circuit containing an op amp. When using these equations, we are essentially employing an ideal model of the device to analyze the circuit.\n\n#### Example 5.1: Analyzing an Op Amp Circuit\n\nThe op amp in the circuit depicted in Figure 5.8 is considered ideal.\n\na) Calculate $v_{o}$ if $v_{\\mathrm{a}}=1 \\mathrm{~V}$ and $v_{\\mathrm{b}}=0 \\mathrm{~V}$.\n\nb) Repeat the calculation for $v_{\\mathrm{a}}=1 \\mathrm{~V}$ and $v_{\\mathrm{b}}=2 \\mathrm{~V}$.\n\nc) If $v_{\\mathrm{a}}=1.5 \\mathrm{~V}$, specify the range of $v_{\\mathrm{b}}$ that avoids amplifier saturation.\n\nFigure 5.8 illustrates the circuit for Example 5.1.\n\n#### Solution\n\na) Given the presence of a negative feedback path from the op amp's output to its inverting input through the $100 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$ resistor, we assume the op amp operates within its linear region. We can write a node-voltage equation at the inverting input terminal. The voltage at the inverting input terminal is 0, as $v_{p}=v_{\\mathrm{b}}=0$ from the connected voltage source, and $v_{n}=v_{p}$ from the voltage constraint Equation 5.2. The node-voltage equation at $v_{n}$ is therefore:\n\n$$\ni_{25}=i_{100}=i_{n}\n$$\n\nUsing Ohm's law, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ni_{25} & =\\left(v_{\\mathrm{a}}-v_{n}\\right) / 25=\\frac{1}{25} \\mathrm{~mA} \\\\\ni_{100} & =\\left(v_{o}-v_{n}\\right) / 100=v_{o} / 100 \\mathrm{~mA}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe current constraint dictates that $i_{n}=0$.

    "text": "We are prepared to introduce the terminal voltages and currents used to describe the behavior of the op amp. The voltage variables are measured from a common reference node. Figure 5.4 shows the voltage variables with their reference polarities.\n\nAll voltages are considered as voltage rises from the common node. This convention is the same as that used in the node-voltage method of analysis. A positive supply voltage (V_CC) is connected between V+ and the common node. A negative supply voltage (-V_CC) is connected between V- and the common node. The voltage between the inverting input terminal and the common node is denoted v_n. The voltage between the noninverting input terminal and the common node is designated as v_p. The voltage between the output terminal and the common node is denoted v_o.\n\nFigure 5.5 shows the current variables with their reference directions. Note that all the current reference directions are into the terminals of the operational amplifier: i_n is the current into the inverting input terminal; i_p is the current into the noninverting input terminal; i_o is the current into the output terminal; i_c+ is the current into the positive power supply terminal; and i_c- is the current into the negative power supply terminal.\n\nThe terminal behavior of the op amp as a linear circuit element is characterized by constraints on the input voltages and the input currents. The voltage constraint is derived from the voltage transfer characteristic of the op amp integrated circuit and is pictured in Fig. 5.6.\n\nThe voltage transfer characteristic describes how the output voltage varies as a function of the input voltages; that is, how voltage is transferred from the input to the output. Note that for the op amp, the output voltage is a function of the difference between the input voltages, v_p - v_n. The equation for the voltage transfer characteristic is:\n\nv_o = \n\\begin{cases}\n-V_{CC} & A(v_p-v_n) < -V_{CC} \\\\\nA(v_p-v_n) & -V_{CC} \\leq A(v_p-v_n) \\leq +V_{CC} \\\\\n+V_{CC} & A(v_p-v_n) > +V_{CC}\n\\end{cases}\n\nWe see from Fig. 5.6 and Eq. 5.1 that the op amp has three distinct regions of operation. When the magnitude of the input voltage difference (|v_p-v_n|) is small, the op amp behaves as a linear device, as the output voltage is a linear function of the input voltages. Outside this linear region, the output of the op amp saturates, and the op amp behaves as a nonlinear device, because the output voltage is no longer a linear function of the input voltages. When it is operating linearly, the op amp's output voltage is equal to the difference in its input voltages times the multiplying constant, or gain, A.\n\nWhen we confine the op amp to its linear operating region, a constraint is imposed on the input voltages, v_p and v_n. The constraint is based on typical numerical values for V_CC and A in Eq. 5.1. For most op amps, the recommended dc power supply voltages seldom exceed 20 V, and the gain, A, is rarely less than 10,000, or 10^4. We see from both Fig. 5.6 and Eq. 5.1 that in the linear region, the magnitude of the input voltage difference (|v_p-v_n|) must be less than 20 / 10^4, or 2 mV.\n\nTypically, node voltages in the circuits we study are much larger than 2 mV, so a voltage difference of less than 2 mV means the two voltages are essentially equal. Thus, when an op amp is constrained to its linear operating region and the node voltages are much larger than 2 mV, the constraint on the input voltages of the op amp is:\n\nv_p = v_n\n\nNote that Eq. 5.2 characterizes the relationship between the input voltages for an ideal op amp; that is, an op amp whose value of A is infinite.\n\nThe input voltage constraint in Eq. 5.2 is called the virtual short condition at the input of the op amp. It is natural to ask how the virtual short is maintained at the input of the op amp when the op amp is embedded in a circuit, thus ensuring linear operation. The answer is that a signal is fed back from the output terminal to the inverting input terminal. This configuration is known as negative feedback because the signal fed back from the output subtracts from the input signal. The negative feedback causes the input voltage difference to decrease. Because the output voltage is proportional to the input voltage difference, the output voltage is also decreased, and the op amp operates in its linear region.\n\nIf a circuit containing an op amp does not provide a negative feedback path from the op amp output to the inverting input, then the op amp will normally saturate. The difference in the input signals must be extremely small to prevent saturation with no negative feedback. But even if the circuit provides a negative feedback path for the op amp, linear operation is not ensured. So how do we know whether the op amp is operating in its linear region?\n\nThe answer is, we don't! We deal with this dilemma by assuming linear operation, performing the circuit analysis, and then checking our results for contradictions. For example, suppose we assume that an op amp in a circuit is operating in its linear region, and we compute the output voltage of the op amp to be 10 V. On examining the circuit, we discover that V_CC is 6 V, resulting in a contradiction, because the op amp's output voltage can be no larger than V_CC. Thus our assumption of linear operation was invalid, and the op amp output must be saturated at 6 V.\n\nWe have identified a constraint on the input voltages that is based on the voltage transfer characteristic of the op amp integrated circuit, the assumption that the op amp is restricted to its linear operating region and to typical values for V_CC and A. Equation 5.2 represents the voltage constraint for an ideal op amp, that is, with a value of A that is infinite.\n\nWe now turn our attention to the constraint on the input currents. Analysis of the op amp integrated circuit reveals that the equivalent resistance seen by the input terminals of the op amp is very large, typically 1 MΩ or more. Ideally, the equivalent input resistance is infinite, resulting in the current constraint:\n\ni_p = i_n = 0\n\nNote that the current constraint is not based on assuming the op amp is confined to its linear operating region as was the voltage constraint. Together, Eqs. 5.2 and 5.3 form the constraints on terminal behavior that define our ideal op amp model.\n\nFrom Kirchhoff's current law we know that the sum of the currents entering the operational amplifier is zero, or:\n\ni_p + i_n + i_o + i_c+ + i_c- = 0\n\nSubstituting the constraint given by Eq. 5.3 into Eq. 5.4 gives:\n\ni_o = -(i_c+ + i_c-)\n\nThe significance of Eq. 5.5 is that, even though the current at the input terminals is negligible, there may still be appreciable current at the output terminal.\n\nBefore we start analyzing circuits containing op amps, let's further simplify the circuit symbol. When we know that the amplifier is operating within its linear region, the dc voltages ±V_CC do not enter into the circuit equations.\n\nIn this case, we can remove the power supply terminals from the symbol and the dc power supplies from the circuit, as shown in Fig. 5.7. A word of caution: Because the power supply terminals have been omitted, there is a danger of inferring from the symbol that i_p + i_n + i_o = 0. We have already noted that such is not the case; that is, i_p + i_n + i_o + i_c+ + i_c- = 0. In other words, the ideal op amp model constraint that i_p = i_n = 0 does not imply that i_o = 0.\n\nNote that the positive and negative power supply voltages do not have to be equal in magnitude. In the linear operating region, v_o must lie between the two supply voltages. For example, if V+ = 15 V and V- = -10 V, then -10 V ≤ v_o ≤ 15 V. Be aware also that the value of A is not constant under all operating conditions. For now, however, we assume that it is. A discussion of how and why the value of A can change must be delayed until after you have studied the electronic devices and components used to fabricate an amplifier.\n\nExample 5.1 illustrates the judicious application of Eqs. 5.2 and 5.3. When we use these equations to predict the behavior of a circuit containing an op amp, in effect we are using an ideal model of the device.\n\nFigure 5.7 A The op amp symbol with the power supply terminals removed.\n\n#### Example 5.1 Analyzing an Op Amp Circuit\n\nThe op amp in the circuit shown in Fig. 5.8 is ideal.\n\na) Calculate v_o if v_a = 1 V and v_b = 0 V.\n\nb) Repeat (a) for v_a = 1 V and v_b = 2 V.\n\nc) If v_a = 1.5 V, specify the range of v_b that avoids amplifier saturation.\n\nFigure 5.8 Δ The circuit for Example 5.1.\n\n#### Solution\n\na) Because a negative feedback path exists from the op amp's output to its inverting input through the 100 kΩ resistor, let's assume the op amp is confined to its linear operating region. We can write a node-voltage equation at the inverting input terminal. The voltage at the inverting input terminal is 0, as v_p = v_b = 0 from the connected voltage source, and v_n = v_p from the voltage constraint Eq. 5.2. The node-voltage equation at v_n is thus:\n\ni_{25} = i_{100} = i_n\n\nFrom Ohm's law:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\ni_{25} & = (v_a - v_n) / 25 = \\frac{1}{25} \\text{ mA} \\\\\ni_{100} & = (v_o - v_n) / 100 = v_o / 100 \\text{ mA}\n\\end{aligned}\n\nThe current constraint requires i_n = 0. Substituting the values for the three currents into the node-voltage equation, we obtain:\n\n\\frac{1}{25} + \\frac{v_o}{100} = 0\n\nHence, v_o is -4 V. Note that because v_o lies between ±10 V, the op amp is in its linear region of operation.\n\nb) Using the same process as in (a), we get:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nv_p & = v_b = v_n = 2 \\text{ V} \\\\\ni_{25} & = \\frac{v_a - v_n}{25} = \\frac{1 - 2}{25} = -\\frac{1}{25} \\text{ mA} \\\\\ni_{100} & = \\frac{v_o - v_n}{100} = \\frac{v_o - 2}{100} \\text{ mA} \\\\\ni_{25} & = -i_{100}\n\\end{aligned}\n\nTherefore, v_o = 6 V. Again, v_o lies within ±10 V.\n\nc) As before, v_n = v_p = v_b, and i_{25} = -i_{100}. Because v_a = 1.5 V,\n\n\\frac{1.5 - v_b}{25} = -\\frac{v_o - v_b}{100}\n\nSolving for v_b as a function of v_o gives:\n\nv_b = \\frac{1}{5}(6 + v_o)\n\nSubstituting these limits on v_o into the expression for v_b, we see that v_b is limited to:\n\n-0.8 V ≤ v_b ≤ 3.2 V\n\nNow, if the amplifier is to be within the linear region of operation, -10 V ≤ v_o ≤ 10 V.\n\n#### ASSESSMENT PROBLEM\n\nObjective 1-Use voltage and current constraints in an ideal op amp\n\n5.1 Assume that the op amp in the circuit shown is ideal.\n\na) Calculate v_o for the following values of v_s: 0.4, 2.0, 3.5, -0.6, -1.6, and -2.4 V.\n\nb) Specify the range of v_s required to avoid amplifier saturation.\n\nAnswer: (a) -2, -10, -15, 3, 8, and 10 V; (b) -2 V ≤ v_s ≤ 3 V.\n\nFigure 5.9 Δ An inverting-amplifier circuit."

    "text": "We are set to delve into the voltages and currents at the terminals, which are pivotal in depicting the operational amplifier's behavior. These voltages are gauged from a standard reference node. As illustrated in Figure 5.4, the voltages and their respective polarities are depicted.\n\nAll voltages are perceived as increases from the common node, adhering to the node-voltage analysis convention. A positive supply voltage (\\(V_{CC}\\)) is linked between \\(V^{+}\\) and the common node, while a negative supply voltage (\\(-V_{CC}\\)) connects \\(V^{-}\\) to the common node. The voltage across the inverting input terminal and the common node is indicated as \\(v_{n}\\). Between the non-inverting input terminal and the common node, the voltage is marked as \\(v_{p}\\). The voltage from the output terminal to the common node is denoted as \\(v_{o}\\).\n\nFigure 5.5 presents the currents at the terminals along with their directional references. It's important to note that the directional references for all currents are towards the operational amplifier's terminals: \\(i_{n}\\) signifies the current into the inverting input terminal, \\(i_{p}\\) into the non-inverting input terminal, \\(i_{o}\\) into the output terminal, \\(i_{c^{+}}\\) into the positive power supply terminal, and \\(i_{c^{-}}\\) into the negative power supply terminal.\n\nThe operational amplifier's terminal behavior as a linear circuit element is defined by limitations on the input voltages and currents. The voltage constraint arises from the op amp's voltage transfer characteristics, as depicted in Figure 5.6.\n\nThis characteristic describes how the output voltage varies depending on the input voltages; in other words, it illustrates the transfer of voltage from input to output. For an op amp, the output voltage depends on the input voltage difference (\\(v_{p} - v_{n}\\)). The equation for the voltage transfer characteristic is expressed as:\n\n\\[\nv_{o} = \n\\begin{cases}\n-V_{CC} & A(v_{p} - v_{n}) < -V_{CC} \\\\\nA(v_{p} - v_{n}) & -V_{CC} \\leq A(v_{p} - v_{n}) \\leq +V_{CC} \\\\\n+V_{CC} & A(v_{p} - v_{n}) > +V_{CC}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nFrom Figure 5.6 and Equation 5.1, it is evident that the op amp exhibits three distinct operational regions. When the input voltage difference (\\(|v_{p} - v_{n}|\\)) is minimal, the op amp behaves linearly, with the output voltage being a direct function of the input voltages. Beyond this linear range, the output saturates, indicating non-linear behavior as the output voltage is no longer directly proportional to the input voltages. In linear operation, the output voltage is the product of the input voltage difference and the gain \\(A\\).\n\nWhen restricting the op amp to its linear region, constraints on the input voltages (\\(v_{p}\\) and \\(v_{n}\\)) arise. Based on typical values for \\(V_{CC}\\) and \\(A\\) in Equation 5.1, for most op amps, the recommended DC power supply voltages are usually not more than 20 V, and the gain \\(A\\) is rarely less than 10,000 or \\(10^{4}\\). In the linear region, as depicted in Figure 5.6 and Equation 5.1, the input voltage difference magnitude (\\(|v_{p} - v_{n}|\\)) must be less than \\(20 / 10^{4}\\) or 2 mV.\n\nOrdinarily, the node voltages in the circuits under study are much greater than 2 mV, rendering a voltage difference of less than 2 mV negligible, implying the two voltages are essentially the same. Hence, when the op amp is confined to its linear region and node voltages significantly exceed 2 mV, the constraint on the input voltages of the op amp simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nv_{p} = v_{n}\n\\]\n\nThis equation characterizes the relationship between the input voltages for an ideal op amp—one with an infinite \\(A\\) value.\n\nThe input voltage constraint in Equation 5.2 is referred to as the virtual short condition at the input of the op amp. The maintenance of this virtual short at the input of an op amp within a circuit ensures linear operation, achieved through a feedback signal from the output terminal to the inverting input terminal. This setup is known as negative feedback since the feedback signal reduces the input signal. Negative feedback diminishes the input voltage difference, causing a proportional decrease in the output voltage and keeping the op amp in its linear region.\n\nLack of a negative feedback path from the op amp output to the inverting input usually leads to saturation. An extremely small input signal difference is necessary to prevent saturation without negative feedback. Even with a negative feedback path, linear operation is not guaranteed. Determining whether the op amp operates in its linear region involves assuming linear operation, conducting a circuit analysis, and subsequently checking for inconsistencies.\n\nIf we assume an op amp operates linearly and calculate an output voltage exceeding the power supply voltage, our assumption is flawed, and the op amp must be saturated at the supply voltage level.\n\nThe current constraint arises from the op amp's high equivalent input resistance, typically \\(1 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega\\) or more. Ideally, this resistance is infinite, leading to the current constraint:\n\n\\[\ni_{p} = i_{n} = 0\n\\]\n\nThis constraint is independent of the assumption of linear operation. Equations 5.2 and 5.3 together define the terminal behavior constraints that characterize our ideal op amp model.\n\nAccording to Kirchhoff's current law, the sum of the currents entering the operational amplifier is zero:\n\n\\[\ni_{p} + i_{n} + i_{o} + i_{c^{+}} + i_{c^{-}} = 0\n\\]\n\nSubstituting Equation 5.3 into Equation 5.4 yields:\n\n\\[\ni_{o} = - (i_{c^{+}} + i_{c^{-}})\n\\]\n\nThis indicates that while the input currents are negligible, the output current may be significant.\n\nFor circuits with op amps operating within their linear region, the DC voltages \\(\\pm V_{CC}\\) can be omitted from the equations. The power supply terminals can be removed from the symbol, simplifying the circuit representation, as shown in Figure 5.7. However, it's crucial to remember that the absence of the power supply terminals doesn't imply \\(i_{p} + i_{n} + i_{o} = 0\\). The ideal op amp model constraint \\(i_{p} = i_{n} = 0\\) doesn't mean \\(i_{o} = 0\\).\n\nIn the linear operating region, \\(v_{o}\\) must remain between the supply voltages. For example, if \\(V^{+} = 15 \\mathrm{~V}\\) and \\(V^{-} = -10 \\mathrm{~V}\\), then \\(-10 \\mathrm{~V} \\leq v_{o} \\leq 15 \\mathrm{~V}\\). Additionally, the value of \\(A\\) may vary under different operating conditions, but for now, we assume it remains constant.\n\nExample 5.1 showcases the application of Equations 5.2 and 5.3 in predicting the behavior of a circuit containing an op amp, effectively using an ideal model of the device.\n\n#### Example 5.1 Analyzing an Op Amp Circuit\n\nThe op amp in the circuit of Figure 5.8 is ideal.\na) Calculate \\(v_{o}\\) if \\(v_{\\mathrm{a}} = 1 \\mathrm{~V}\\) and \\(v_{\\mathrm{b}} = 0 \\mathrm{~V}\\).\nb) Repeat (a) for \\(v_{\\mathrm{a}} = 1 \\mathrm{~V}\\) and \\(v_{\\mathrm{b}} = 2 \\mathrm{~V}\\).\nc) If \\(v_{\\mathrm{a}} = 1.5 \\mathrm{~V}\\), specify the range of \\(v_{\\mathrm{b}}\\) that avoids amplifier saturation.\n\nFigure 5.8 shows the circuit for Example 5.1.\n\n#### Solution\n\na) Given the negative feedback through the \\(100 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega\\) resistor, we assume the op amp operates linearly.

The equation representing the voltage transfer characteristic is:\n\n$$\nv_{o}= \\begin{cases}-V_{CC} & A(v_{p}-v_{n})<-V_{CC}  \\tag{5.1}\\\\ A(v_{p}-v_{n}) & -V_{CC} \\leq A(v_{p}-v_{n}) \\leq+V_{CC} \\\\ +V_{CC} & A(v_{p}-v_{n})>+V_{CC}\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nAs depicted in Figure 5.6 and defined by Equation 5.1, the op amp operates in three distinct regions. When the input voltage difference's magnitude is small, the op amp acts linearly, with the output voltage being a direct function of the input voltages. Beyond this linear range, the op amp's output saturates, behaving nonlinearly, as the output voltage is no longer directly proportional to the input voltages. In linear operation, the output voltage equals the input voltage difference multiplied by the gain, $A$.\n\nConfining the op amp to its linear region imposes constraints on the input voltages, $v_{p}$ and $v_{n}$. These constraints are based on typical values for $V_{CC}$ and $A$. For most op amps, the recommended power supply voltages do not exceed 20 V, and the gain, $A$, is usually at least 10,000 or $10^{4}$. In the linear region, the input voltage difference's magnitude must be less than $20 / 10^{4}$, or 2 mV.\n\nConsidering that node voltages in typical circuits are much greater than 2 mV, a voltage difference of less than 2 mV implies the voltages are essentially equal. Thus, when the op amp operates linearly and the node voltages are significantly larger than 2 mV, the constraint on the input voltages becomes:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{p}=v_{n} \\tag{5.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis equation describes the relationship between input voltages for an ideal op amp, where the gain, $A$, is infinite.\n\nThis input voltage constraint, as stated in Equation 5.2, is known as the virtual short condition at the op amp's input. The mechanism maintaining this virtual short in a circuit is negative feedback, where a portion of the output signal is fed back to the inverting input terminal. This feedback reduces the input voltage difference, and since the output voltage is proportional to this difference, the output voltage decreases, keeping the op amp in its linear region.\n\nWithout a negative feedback path, an op amp in a circuit will generally saturate, and only an extremely small input voltage difference can prevent saturation in the absence of feedback. Even with feedback, linear operation isn't guaranteed. We assume linear operation, perform the analysis, and then verify for consistency. For instance, if we assume an op amp operates linearly in a circuit and calculate an output voltage of 10 V, but the power supply voltage $V_{CC}$ is only 6 V, there is a contradiction, indicating the op amp's output must be saturated at 6 V.\n\nThe input voltage constraint in Equation 5.2 is derived from the op amp's voltage transfer characteristic, assuming linear operation and typical values for $V_{CC}$ and $A$. This equation defines the voltage constraint for an ideal op amp.\n\nWe now consider the constraint on the input currents. The op amp's equivalent input resistance, as revealed by its circuit analysis, is very high, often $1 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega$ or more. Ideally, this resistance is infinite, leading to the current constraint:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{p}=i_{n}=0 \\tag{5.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nUnlike the voltage constraint, the current constraint is not dependent on the assumption of linear operation. Equations 5.2 and 5.3 together define the terminal behavior constraints of our ideal op amp model.\n\nFrom Kirchhoff's current law, the sum of currents entering the op amp is zero:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{p}+i_{n}+i_{o}+i_{c^{+}}+i_{c^{-}}=0 \\tag{5.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the constraint from Equation 5.3 into Equation 5.4 yields:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{o}=-\\left(i_{c^{+}}+i_{c^{-}}\\right) \\tag{5.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation 5.5 shows that even though the input currents are negligible, there may still be significant current at the output terminal.\n\nWhen analyzing circuits with op amps operating linearly, we can simplify the circuit diagram by omitting the power supply terminals, as depicted in Figure 5.7. It is important to remember that this simplification does not imply that $i_{p}+i_{n}+i_{o}=0$. As stated earlier, the ideal op amp model's constraint $i_{p}=i_{n}=0$ does not mean $i_{o}=0$.\n\nThe power supply voltages do not need to be of equal magnitude. In the linear region, $v_{o}$ must remain between the supply voltages. For instance, if $V^{+}=15 \\mathrm{~V}$ and $V^{-}=-10 \\mathrm{~V}$, then $-10 \\mathrm{~V} \\leq v_{o} \\leq 15 \\mathrm{~V}$. It's also crucial to note that the gain, $A$, may not be constant under all conditions, but for now, we assume it is.\n\nThe ideal op amp model is used to predict circuit behavior, as demonstrated in Example 5.1. This model is based on Equations 5.2 and 5.3, which are applied to circuits containing op amps.\n\nExample 5.1 shows the application of these equations. Assuming the op amp operates linearly, we use node-voltage equations to calculate the output voltage. The input currents are negligible due to the high input resistance, and the output current is determined by the circuit configuration and the op amp's linear response to the input voltage difference.\n\nIn summary, the ideal op amp model is a powerful tool for analyzing circuits. It simplifies the analysis by assuming linear operation and using the virtual short and zero-input-current constraints. This model allows us to predict the behavior of op amps in various circuit configurations, facilitating the design and troubleshooting of electronic systems."

    "text": "We are now prepared to discuss the terminal voltages and currents that describe the operational amplifier's behavior. Voltage measurements are taken with respect to a common reference node. Figure 5.4 depicts these voltage variables along with their reference polarities.\n\nAll voltages are regarded as increases from the common node, adhering to the same convention used in the node-voltage analysis method. A positive supply voltage ($V_{CC}$) is linked between $V^{+}$ and the common node, while a negative supply voltage ($-V_{CC}$) connects $V^{-}$ to the common node. The voltage across the inverting input terminal and the common node is denoted as $v_{n}$. The voltage between the non-inverting input terminal and the common node is labeled $v_{p}$. The voltage from the output terminal to the common node is represented by $v_{o}$.\n\nFigure 5.5 illustrates the current variables along with their reference directions. It is important to note that all current reference directions point towards the operational amplifier's terminals: $i_{n}$ indicates the current into the inverting input terminal, $i_{p}$ is the current into the non-inverting input terminal, $i_{o}$ is the current into the output terminal, $i_{c^{+}}$ is the current into the positive power supply terminal, and $i_{c^{-}}$ is the current into the negative power supply terminal.\n\nThe operational amplifier's terminal behavior as a linear circuit element is defined by limitations on the input voltages and currents. The voltage constraint stems from the operational amplifier's voltage transfer characteristic, as shown in Figure 5.6.\n\nThe voltage transfer characteristic outlines how the output voltage changes in response to the input voltages; in other words, it describes how voltage is transferred from the input to the output. For the operational amplifier, the output voltage depends on the difference between the input voltages, $v_{p} - v_{n}$. The equation for the voltage transfer characteristic is given by:\n\n$$\nv_{o}= \\begin{cases}\n-V_{C C} & A\\left(v_{p}-v_{n}\\right)<-V_{C C}  \\tag{5.1}\\\\\nA\\left(v_{p}-v_{n}\\right) & -V_{C C} \\leq A\\left(v_{p}-v_{n}\\right) \\leq+V_{C C} \\\\\n+V_{C C} & A\\left(v_{p}-v_{n}\\right)>+V_{C C}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nAs observed in Figure 5.6 and Equation 5.1, the operational amplifier has three distinct operating regions. When the input voltage difference magnitude ($|v_{p}-v_{n}|$) is small, the operational amplifier acts linearly, with the output voltage being a direct function of the input voltages. Beyond this linear region, the operational amplifier's output saturates, and it behaves non-linearly since the output voltage is no longer directly proportional to the input voltages. When operating linearly, the operational amplifier's output voltage equals the product of the input voltage difference and the gain constant, $A$.\n\nRestricting the operational amplifier to its linear operating region imposes a constraint on the input voltages, $v_{p}$ and $v_{n}$. This constraint is based on typical values for $V_{CC}$ and $A$ from Equation 5.1. For most operational amplifiers, the recommended direct current power supply voltages rarely exceed 20 V, and the gain, $A$, is usually not less than 10,000 or $10^{4}$. As indicated in Figure 5.6 and Equation 5.1, within the linear region, the input voltage difference magnitude ($|v_{p}-v_{n}|$) must be less than $20 / 10^{4}$, or 2 mV.\n\nTypically, node voltages in the circuits we analyze are much larger than 2 mV. Therefore, a voltage difference of less than 2 mV implies that the two voltages are essentially equal. Thus, when an operational amplifier is confined to its linear operating region and the node voltages are significantly greater than 2 mV, the constraint on the input voltages of the operational amplifier is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{p}=v_{n} \\tag{5.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis constraint in Equation 5.2 characterizes the relationship between the input voltages for an ideal operational amplifier; that is, an operational amplifier with an infinite value of $A$.\n\nThe input voltage constraint in Equation 5.2 is known as the virtual short condition at the operational amplifier's input. It is natural to inquire how the virtual short is sustained at the input of the operational amplifier when it is part of a larger circuit, thereby ensuring linear operation. The response is that a signal is fed back from the output terminal to the inverting input terminal. This arrangement is referred to as negative feedback because the feedback signal subtracts from the input signal. The negative feedback reduces the input voltage difference. As the output voltage is proportional to the input voltage difference, the output voltage decreases as well, keeping the operational amplifier within its linear region.\n\nIf a circuit with an operational amplifier lacks a negative feedback path from the output to the inverting input, the operational amplifier will typically saturate. The input signals' difference must be extremely small to prevent saturation without negative feedback. However, even if the circuit includes a negative feedback path for the operational amplifier, linear operation is not guaranteed. So, how do we determine whether the operational amplifier is operating in its linear region?\n\nThe answer is that we cannot be certain! We handle this uncertainty by assuming linear operation, performing the circuit analysis, and then verifying our results for consistency. For instance, suppose we assume that an operational amplifier in a circuit is operating in its linear region and calculate the output voltage to be 10 V. Upon examining the circuit, we find that $V_{C C}$ is 6 V, leading to a contradiction since the operational amplifier's output voltage cannot exceed $V_{C C}$. Thus, our assumption of linear operation was incorrect, and the operational amplifier's output must be saturated at 6 V.\n\nWe have identified a constraint on the input voltages based on the operational amplifier's voltage transfer characteristic and the assumption that the operational amplifier is restricted to its linear operating region with typical values for $V_{C C}$ and $A$. Equation 5.2 represents the voltage constraint for an ideal operational amplifier, meaning one with an infinite value of $A$.\n\nWe now turn our attention to the constraint on the input currents. Analysis of the operational amplifier integrated circuit reveals that the equivalent resistance seen by the input terminals is very high, typically $1 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega$ or more. Ideally, the equivalent input resistance is infinite, leading to the current constraint:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{p}=i_{n}=0 \\tag{5.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nNote that the current constraint is not dependent on assuming the operational amplifier is confined to its linear operating region, unlike the voltage constraint. Together, Equations 5.2 and 5.3 establish the constraints on terminal behavior that define our ideal operational amplifier model.\n\nFrom Kirchhoff's current law, we know that the sum of the currents entering the operational amplifier is zero, or:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{p}+i_{n}+i_{o}+i_{c^{+}}+i_{c^{-}}=0 \\tag{5.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the constraint from Equation 5.3 into Equation 5.4 yields:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{o}=-\\left(i_{c^{+}}+i_{c^{-}}\\right) \\tag{5.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe significance of Equation 5.5 is that, even though the current at the input terminals is negligible, there may still be a significant current at the output terminal.\n\nBefore we proceed to analyze circuits containing operational amplifiers, let's further simplify the circuit symbol. When we know that the amplifier is operating within its linear region, the direct current voltages $\\pm V_{C C}$ do not factor into the circuit equations.\n\nIn such cases, we can omit the power supply terminals from the symbol and the direct current power supplies from the circuit, as depicted in Figure 5.7. A word of caution: Since the power supply terminals have been removed, there is a risk of inferring from the symbol that $i_{p}+i_{n}+i_{o}=0$. However, as previously mentioned, this is not the case; that is, $i_{p}+i_{n}+i_{o}+i_{c^{+}}+i_{c^{-}}=0$. In other words, the ideal operational amplifier model constraint that $i_{p}=i_{n}=0$ does not imply that $i_{o}=0$.\n\nIt is important to note that the positive and negative power supply voltages do not need to be equal in magnitude. In the linear operating region, $v_{o}$ must fall between the two supply voltages. For example, if $V^{+}=15 \\mathrm{~V}$ and $V^{-}=-10 \\mathrm{~V}$, then $-10 \\mathrm{~V} \\leq v_{o} \\leq 15 \\mathrm{~V}$. Additionally, be aware that the value of $A$ is not constant under all operating conditions. For now, however, we assume that it is constant. A discussion of how and why the value of $A$ can change must be deferred until after studying the electronic devices and components used to construct an amplifier.\n\nExample 5.1 demonstrates the judicious application of Equations 5.2 and 5.3. When we use these equations to predict the behavior of a circuit containing an operational amplifier, we are effectively using an ideal model of the device."

The potential difference between the noninverting input terminal and the shared node is marked as \\(v_{p}\\). The voltage between the output terminal and the shared node is denoted \\(v_{o}\\).\n\nFigure 5.5 illustrates the current variables and their respective reference directions. It's important to note that all current reference directions point towards the op amp's terminals: \\(i_{n}\\) signifies the current flowing into the inverting input terminal; \\(i_{p}\\) is the current entering the noninverting input terminal; \\(i_{o}\\) is the current into the output terminal; \\(i_{c^{+}}\\) is the current into the positive power supply terminal; and \\(i_{c^{-}}\\) is the current into the negative power supply terminal.\n\nThe linear circuit element characteristics of the op amp are defined by the limitations on its input voltages and currents. The voltage constraint originates from the op amp's integrated circuit voltage transfer characteristic, as depicted in Figure 5.6.\n\nThe voltage transfer characteristic portrays how the output voltage fluctuates in response to the input voltages, illustrating the conversion of voltage from input to output. For the op amp, the output voltage is a direct function of the input voltage differential, \\(v_{p}-v_{n}\\). The formulation for the voltage transfer characteristic is expressed as:\n\n\\[\nv_{o}= \n\\begin{cases}\n-V_{CC} & A\\left(v_{p}-v_{n}\\right)<-V_{CC}  \\\\\nA\\left(v_{p}-v_{n}\\right) & -V_{CC} \\leq A\\left(v_{p}-v_{n}\\right) \\leq+V_{CC} \\\\\n+V_{CC} & A\\left(v_{p}-v_{n}\\right)>+V_{CC}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nInspecting Figure 5.6 and Equation 5.1, we discern three operational zones of the op amp. When the input voltage differential magnitude is minute, the op amp behaves linearly, with the output voltage being a direct function of the input voltages. Beyond this linear domain, the op amp's output saturates, adopting a nonlinear comportment since the output voltage is no longer directly proportional to the input voltages. Within the linear domain, the op amp's output voltage is equivalent to the input voltage differential multiplied by the gain, \\(A\\).\n\nRestricting the op amp to its linear operational domain imposes constraints on the input voltages, \\(v_{p}\\) and \\(v_{n}\\). These constraints are founded on typical \\(V_{CC}\\) and \\(A\\) values in Equation 5.1. For the majority of op amps, the recommended direct current (dc) power supply voltages seldom surpass 20 V, and the gain, \\(A\\), is infrequently less than 10,000, or \\(10^{4}\\). As deduced from Figure 5.6 and Equation 5.1, within the linear domain, the input voltage differential magnitude must be less than \\(20 / 10^{4}\\), or 2 mV.\n\nConsequently, when the op amp is confined to its linear operational domain and the node voltages significantly exceed 2 mV, the constraint on the input voltages of the op amp is:\n\n\\[\nv_{p}=v_{n}\n\\]\n\nThis equation typifies the relationship between the input voltages of an ideal op amp, where \\(A\\) is infinite.\n\nThe input voltage constraint in Equation 5.2 is known as the virtual short condition at the op amp's input. The mechanism by which the virtual short is sustained at the input of the op amp within a circuit, thereby ensuring linear operation, is through a feedback loop from the output terminal to the inverting input terminal. This setup is referred to as negative feedback due to the signal feedback that reduces the input voltage difference. Since the output voltage is proportional to the input voltage difference, it too diminishes, thus maintaining the op amp's linear operation.\n\nWithout a negative feedback loop from the op amp's output to its inverting input, the op amp will typically saturate. An exceedingly small input signal differential is necessary to avert saturation in the absence of negative feedback. Even with a negative feedback path, linear operation is not guaranteed. To ascertain whether the op amp operates in its linear region, we hypothesize linear operation, conduct the circuit analysis, and subsequently verify our findings for inconsistencies. If we postulate that an op amp in a circuit operates linearly and calculate an output voltage exceeding the supply voltage, we identify a contradiction, invalidating our assumption of linear operation.\n\nThe input voltage constraint in Equation 5.2 is premised on the op amp's voltage transfer characteristic, the supposition that the op amp is restricted to its linear operational domain, and typical \\(V_{CC}\\) and \\(A\\) values. Equation 5.2 encapsulates the voltage constraint for an ideal op amp, where \\(A\\) is infinite.\n\nThe constraint on the input currents is next considered. Op amp integrated circuit analysis indicates that the equivalent resistance perceived by the input terminals is substantial, commonly \\(1 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega\\) or greater. Ideally, this equivalent resistance is infinite, leading to the current constraint:\n\n\\[\ni_{p}=i_{n}=0\n\\]\n\nThis current constraint is not predicated on the assumption that the op amp is confined to its linear operational domain, unlike the voltage constraint. Equations 5.2 and 5.3 collectively delineate the terminal behavior constraints that define our ideal op amp model.\n\nAccording to Kirchhoff's current law, the algebraic sum of the currents entering the operational amplifier is zero:\n\n\\[\ni_{p}+i_{n}+i_{o}+i_{c^{+}}+i_{c^{-}}=0\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the constraint from Equation 5.3 into Equation 5.4 yields:\n\n\\[\ni_{o}=-\\left(i_{c^{+}}+i_{c^{-}}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThe implication of Equation 5.5 is that, despite negligible current at the input terminals, the output terminal may still experience significant current flow.\n\nWhen analyzing circuits containing op amps and knowing that the amplifier operates within its linear region, the dc voltages \\(\\pm V_{CC}\\) are irrelevant to the circuit equations. Thus, the power supply terminals can be removed from the symbol, and the dc power supplies can be omitted from the circuit, as depicted in Figure 5.7. Caution is advised as the omitted power supply terminals might incorrectly suggest that \\(i_{p}+i_{n}+i_{o}=0\\). However, as previously stated, \\(i_{p}+i_{n}+i_{o}+i_{c^{+}}+i_{c^{-}}=0\\). In other words, the ideal op amp model constraint \\(i_{p}=i_{n}=0\\) does not imply \\(i_{o}=0\\).\n\nIt's important to recognize that the positive and negative power supply voltages need not be of equal magnitude. Within the linear operating region, \\(v_{o}\\) must reside between the two supply voltages. For instance, if \\(V^{+}=15 \\mathrm{~V}\\) and \\(V^{-}=-10 \\mathrm{~V}\\), then \\(-10 \\mathrm{~V} \\leq v_{o} \\leq 15 \\mathrm{~V}\\). Furthermore, the value of \\(A\\) is not invariant under all operating conditions, but for the present discussion, it is considered constant.\n\nExample 5.1 exemplifies the judicious application of Equations 5.2 and 5.3. When employing these equations to forecast the behavior of a circuit containing an op amp, we effectively utilize an ideal model of the device."

    "text": "We are prepared to delve into the functioning of several pivotal op amp circuits, utilizing Eqs. 5.2 and 5.3 to depict the device's behavior. Figure 5.9 illustrates an inverting-amplifier configuration. We presume the op amp is functioning within its linear range. Note that the circuit comprises, in addition to the op amp, two resistors ($R_{f}$ and $R_{s}$), a voltage signal source ($v_{s}$), and a short circuit linking the noninverting input terminal to the common node.\n\nWe proceed to analyze this circuit under the assumption of an ideal op amp. Our objective is to derive an expression for the output voltage, $v_{o}$, as a function of the source voltage, $v_{s}$. We apply a single node-voltage equation at the inverting terminal of the op amp, expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{s}+i_{f}=i_{n} \\tag{5.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe voltage constraint from Eq. 5.2 sets $v_{n}=0$, due to $v_{p}=0$. Consequently,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ni_{s} & =\\frac{v_{s}}{R_{s}}  \\tag{5.7}\\\\\ni_{f} & =\\frac{v_{o}}{R_{f}} \\tag{5.8}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nNext, we apply the constraint from Eq. 5.3, which states\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{n}=0 \\tag{5.9}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSubstituting Eqs. 5.7-5.9 into Eq. 5.6 yields the desired result:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{o}=\\frac{-R_{f}}{R_{s}} v_{s} \\tag{5.10}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nNote that the output voltage is an inverted, scaled version of the input. The sign inversion from input to output is the basis for calling this circuit an inverting amplifier. The scaling factor, or gain, is the ratio $R_{f} / R_{s}$.\n\nThe result in Eq. 5.10 holds true only if the op amp in Fig. 5.9 is ideal, meaning $A$ is infinite and the input resistance is infinite. For a real op amp, Eq. 5.10 is an approximation, typically a reliable one. (Further discussion on this follows later.) Eq. 5.10 is significant because it indicates that if the op amp gain $A$ is substantial, the gain of the inverting amplifier can be set using the external resistors $R_{f}$ and $R_{s}$. The upper limit on the gain, $R_{f} / R_{s}$, is dictated by the power supply voltages and the signal voltage $v_{s}$. Assuming equal power supply voltages, i.e., $V^{+}=-V^{-}=V_{C C}$, we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left|v_{o}\\right| \\leq V_{C C}, \\quad\\left|\\frac{R_{f}}{R_{s}} v_{s}\\right| \\leq V_{C C}, \\quad \\frac{R_{f}}{R_{s}} \\leq\\left|\\frac{V_{C C}}{v_{s}}\\right| \\tag{5.11}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor instance, if $V_{C C}=15 \\mathrm{~V}$ and $v_{s}=10 \\mathrm{mV}$, the ratio $R_{f} / R_{s}$ must be less than 1500.\n\nIn the inverting amplifier circuit depicted in Fig. 5.9, the resistor $R_{f}$ provides the negative feedback connection, linking the output terminal to the inverting input terminal. If $R_{f}$ is removed, the feedback path is open, and the amplifier operates in an open-loop configuration. Figure 5.10 shows this open-loop operation.\n\nOpening the feedback path significantly alters the circuit's behavior. Initially, the output voltage becomes\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{o}=-A v_{n} \\tag{5.12}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nassuming $V^{+}=-V^{-}=V_{C C}$; thus, $\\left|v_{n}\\right|<V_{C C} / A$ for linear operation. Since the inverting input current is nearly zero, the voltage drop across $R_{s}$ is minimal, and the inverting input voltage closely matches the signal voltage, $v_{s}$; that is, $v_{n} \\approx v_{s}$. Hence, the op amp can operate in the linear mode open loop only if $\\left|v_{s}\\right|<V_{C C} / A$. If $\\left|v_{s}\\right|>V_{C C} / A$, the op amp saturates. Specifically, if $v_{s}<-V_{C C} / A$, the op amp saturates at $+V_{C C}$, and if $v_{s}>V_{C C} / A$, it saturates at $-V_{C C}$. Because Eq. 5.12 applies when no feedback path exists, $A$ is often termed the open-loop gain of the op amp.\n\nExample 5.2 employs the inverting-amplifier equation to design an inverting amplifier using practical resistor values.\n\n#### Example 5.2 Designing an Inverting Amplifier\n\na) Design an inverting amplifier (refer to Fig. 5.9) with a gain of 12. Use $\\pm 15 \\mathrm{~V}$ power supplies and an ideal op amp.\nb) Determine the range of input voltages, $v_{s}$, that keeps the op amp in this design within its linear operating region.\n\n#### Solution\n\na) We need to select two resistors with a ratio of 12 from the practical resistor values listed in Appendix H.

Input voltage Vs is connected through a 1 kΩ resistor to the inverting input of the op-amp A0, and feedback is provided by a 12 kΩ resistor from the output to the inverting input.

The sign inversion from input to output is why the circuit is termed an inverting amplifier. The scaling factor, or gain, is the ratio $R_{f} / R_{s}$.\n\nEq. 5.10 holds true only if the op amp in Fig. 5.9 is ideal, meaning $A$ is infinite and the input resistance is infinite. For a real op amp, Eq. 5.10 is an approximation, typically a reliable one. (Further discussion on this follows later.) Eq. 5.10 is significant because it indicates that if the op amp gain $A$ is substantial, the gain of the inverting amplifier can be set using external resistors $R_{f}$ and $R_{s}$. The upper limit on the gain, $R_{f} / R_{s}$, is dictated by the power supply voltages and the signal voltage $v_{s}$.

    "text": "We are prepared to explore the functionality of several key operational amplifier (op amp) circuits, utilizing Eqs. 5.2 and 5.3 to model the device's behavior. Figure 5.9 illustrates an inverting-amplifier circuit. We presume the op amp is functioning within its linear range. Note that the circuit comprises, in addition to the op amp, two resistors ($R_{f}$ and $R_{s}$), a voltage signal source ($v_{s}$), and a short circuit linking the noninverting input terminal to the common node.\n\nNext, we analyze this circuit under the assumption of an ideal op amp. Our objective is to derive an expression for the output voltage, $v_{o}$, as a function of the source voltage, $v_{s}$. We apply a single node-voltage equation at the inverting terminal of the op amp, expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{s}+i_{f}=i_{n} \\tag{5.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe voltage constraint from Eq. 5.2 sets $v_{n}=0$, due to $v_{p}=0$.

The sign inversion from input to output is why the circuit is termed an inverting amplifier. The scaling factor, or gain, is the ratio $R_{f} / R_{s}$.\n\nThe result in Eq. 5.10 is valid only if the op amp in Fig. 5.9 is ideal, meaning $A$ is infinite and the input resistance is infinite. For a real op amp, Eq. 5.10 is an approximation, typically a reliable one. (Further discussion on this follows later.) Eq. 5.10 is significant because it indicates that if the op amp gain $A$ is large, the gain of the inverting amplifier can be determined by the external resistors $R_{f}$ and $R_{s}$. The upper limit on the gain, $R_{f} / R_{s}$, is dictated by the power supply voltages and the signal voltage $v_{s}$. Assuming equal power supply voltages, $V^{+}=-V^{-}=V_{C C}$, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left|v_{o}\\right| \\leq V_{C C}, \\quad\\left|\\frac{R_{f}}{R_{s}} v_{s}\\right| \\leq V_{C C}, \\quad \\frac{R_{f}}{R_{s}} \\leq\\left|\\frac{V_{C C}}{v_{s}}\\right| \\tag{5.11}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor instance, if $V_{C C}=15 \\mathrm{~V}$ and $v_{s}=10 \\mathrm{mV}$, the ratio $R_{f} / R_{s}$ must be less than 1500.\n\nIn the inverting amplifier circuit of Fig. 5.9, the resistor $R_{f}$ provides the negative feedback connection, linking the output terminal to the inverting input terminal. If $R_{f}$ is removed, the feedback path is open, and the amplifier operates in an open-loop configuration. Figure 5.10 depicts this open-loop operation.\n\nOpening the feedback path significantly alters the circuit's behavior. Initially, the output voltage becomes\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{o}=-A v_{n} \\tag{5.12}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nassuming $V^{+}=-V^{-}=V_{C C}$; thus, $\\left|v_{n}\\right|<V_{C C} / A$ for linear operation. Since the inverting input current is nearly zero, the voltage drop across $R_{s}$ is minimal, and the inverting input voltage closely matches the signal voltage, $v_{s}$; that is, $v_{n} \\approx v_{s}$. Hence, the op amp can operate in the linear mode open loop only if $\\left|v_{s}\\right|<V_{C C} / A$. If $\\left|v_{s}\\right|>V_{C C} / A$, the op amp saturates. Specifically, if $v_{s}<-V_{C C} / A$, the op amp saturates at $+V_{C C}$, and if $v_{s}>V_{C C} / A$, it saturates at $-V_{C C}$. Because Eq. 5.12 applies when no feedback path exists, $A$ is often termed the open-loop gain of the op amp.\n\nExample 5.2 demonstrates the use of the inverting-amplifier equation to design an inverting amplifier with realistic resistor values.\n\n#### Example 5.2 Designing an Inverting Amplifier\n\na) Design an inverting amplifier (refer to Fig. 5.9) with a gain of 12, using $\\pm 15 \\mathrm{~V}$ power supplies and an ideal op amp.\nb) Determine the range of input voltages, $v_{s}$, that keeps the op amp in this design within its linear operating region.\n\n#### Solution\n\na) We need to select two resistors with a ratio of 12 from the realistic values listed in Appendix H.

    "text": "We are prepared to explore the functionality of several significant op amp circuits, utilizing Eqs. 5.2 and 5.3 to model the device's behavior. Figure 5.9 illustrates an inverting-amplifier circuit. We presume the op amp is functioning within its linear range. Note that, aside from the op amp, the circuit comprises two resistors ($R_{f}$ and $R_{s}$), a voltage signal source ($v_{s}$), and a short circuit linking the noninverting input terminal to the common node.\n\nWe now examine this circuit under the assumption of an ideal op amp. Our objective is to derive an expression for the output voltage, $v_{o}$, as a function of the source voltage, $v_{s}$. We apply a single node-voltage equation at the inverting terminal of the op amp, expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{s}+i_{f}=i_{n} \\tag{5.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe voltage constraint of Eq. 5.2 sets $v_{n}=0$, due to $v_{p}=0$. Consequently,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ni_{s} & =\\frac{v_{s}}{R_{s}}  \\tag{5.7}\\\\\ni_{f} & =\\frac{v_{o}}{R_{f}} \\tag{5.8}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nNext, we apply the constraint from Eq. 5.3, which states\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{n}=0 \\tag{5.9}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSubstituting Eqs. 5.7-5.9 into Eq. 5.6 yields the desired result:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{o}=\\frac{-R_{f}}{R_{s}} v_{s} \\tag{5.10}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nNote that the output voltage is an inverted, scaled version of the input. The sign inversion from input to output is why the circuit is termed an inverting amplifier. The scaling factor, or gain, is the ratio $R_{f} / R_{s}$.\n\nEq. 5.10 is valid only if the op amp in Fig. 5.9 is ideal, meaning $A$ is infinite and the input resistance is infinite. For a real op amp, Eq. 5.10 is an approximation, typically a good one. (Further discussion on this follows later.) Eq. 5.10 is crucial because it indicates that if the op amp gain $A$ is large, the inverting amplifier's gain can be set using external resistors $R_{f}$ and $R_{s}$. The upper limit on the gain, $R_{f} / R_{s}$, is dictated by the power supply voltages and the signal voltage $v_{s}$. Assuming equal power supply voltages, $V^{+}=-V^{-}=V_{C C}$, we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left|v_{o}\\right| \\leq V_{C C}, \\quad\\left|\\frac{R_{f}}{R_{s}} v_{s}\\right| \\leq V_{C C}, \\quad \\frac{R_{f}}{R_{s}} \\leq\\left|\\frac{V_{C C}}{v_{s}}\\right| \\tag{5.11}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor instance, if $V_{C C}=15 \\mathrm{~V}$ and $v_{s}=10 \\mathrm{mV}$, the ratio $R_{f} / R_{s}$ must be less than 1500.\n\nIn the inverting amplifier circuit of Fig. 5.9, resistor $R_{f}$ provides the negative feedback connection, linking the output terminal to the inverting input terminal. Removing $R_{f}$ opens the feedback path, resulting in open-loop operation, as depicted in Fig. 5.10.\n\nOpen-loop operation significantly alters the circuit's behavior. Firstly, the output voltage now is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{o}=-A v_{n} \\tag{5.12}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nassuming $V^{+}=-V^{-}=V_{C C}$; thus, $\\left|v_{n}\\right|<V_{C C} / A$ for linear operation. Since the inverting input current is nearly zero, the voltage drop across $R_{s}$ is minimal, making the inverting input voltage almost equal to the signal voltage, $v_{s}$; that is, $v_{n} \\approx v_{s}$. Hence, the op amp can operate in the linear mode open-loop only if $\\left|v_{s}\\right|<V_{C C} / A$. If $\\left|v_{s}\\right|>V_{C C} / A$, the op amp saturates. Specifically, if $v_{s}<-V_{C C} / A$, the op amp saturates at $+V_{C C}$, and if $v_{s}>V_{C C} / A$, it saturates at $-V_{C C}$. The value of $A$ in Eq. 5.12, occurring without feedback, is termed the open-loop gain of the op amp.\n\nExample 5.2 demonstrates the use of the inverting-amplifier equation to design an inverting amplifier with practical resistor values.\n\n#### Example 5.2 Designing an Inverting Amplifier\n\na) Design an inverting amplifier (refer to Fig. 5.9) with a gain of 12, using $\\pm 15 \\mathrm{~V}$ power supplies and an ideal op amp.\nb) Determine the range of input voltages, $v_{s}$, that keeps the op amp in its linear operating region for this design.\n\n#### Solution\n\na) We need to select two resistors with a ratio of 12 from the practical values listed in Appendix H. Numerous options exist, but let's choose $R_{s}=1 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$ and $R_{f}=12 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$. Verify the design using the inverting-amplifier equation (Eq. 5.10):\n\n$$\nv_{o}=-\\frac{R_{f}}{R_{s}} v_{s}=-\\frac{12,000}{1000} v_{s}=-12 v_{s}\n$$\n\nThus, we have an inverting amplifier with a gain of 12, as shown in Fig. 5.11.\nimage_name:Figure 5.11\ndescription:\n[\n'name': 'Vs', 'type': 'VoltageSource', 'value': 'Vs', 'ports': {'Np': 'Vs', 'Nn': 'GND'\n'name': '1 kΩ', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '1 kΩ', 'ports': {'N1': 'Vs', 'N2': 'InN'\n'name': '12 kΩ', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': '12 kΩ', 'ports': {'N1': 'InN', 'N2': 'Vo'\n'name': 'A0', 'type': 'OpAmp', 'value': 'A0', 'ports': {'InP': 'GND', 'InN': 'InN', 'OutP': 'Vo', 'Vdd':'+15V', '-Vdd':'-15V'\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit is an inverting amplifier with a gain of 12. Input voltage Vs is connected through a 1 kΩ resistor to the inverting input of the op-amp A0, and feedback is provided by a 12 kΩ resistor from the output to the inverting input. The non-inverting input is grounded, and the op-amp is powered by ±15V supplies.\n\n\nFigure 5.11 $\\triangle$ Inverting amplifier for Example 5.2.\nb) Solve the inverting-amplifier equation for $v_{s}$ using $v_{o}=+15 \\mathrm{~V}$ and then $v_{o}=-15 \\mathrm{~V}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n15 & =-12 v_{s} \\text { so } \\quad v_{s}=-1.25 \\mathrm{~V} \\\\\n-15 & =-12 v_{s} \\text { so } \\quad v_{s}=1.25 \\mathrm{~V}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, for the input voltage to keep the op amp in its linear operating region, it must be between -1.25 V and +1.25 V.\n\nASSESSMENT PROBLEM\n\nObjective 2-Ability to analyze simple circuits with ideal op amps\n5.2 In Assessment Problem 5.1, the source voltage $v_{s}$ is -640 mV.

Please present only the rephrased text.\n\n---[Context Provided]---\nThe output voltage of a difference amplifier is directly related to the difference between the two input voltages. To illustrate this concept, let's examine the difference amplifier circuit depicted in Figure 5.15, with the understanding that we are using an ideal operational amplifier (op-amp) operating within its linear range. We calculate the connection between the output voltage $v_{o}$ and the input voltages $v_{\\mathrm{a}}$ and $v_{\\mathrm{b}}$ by calculating the summation of currents flowing away from the inverting input node:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{v_{n}-v_{\\mathrm{a}}}{R_{\\mathrm{a}}}+\\frac{v_{n}-v_{o}}{R_{\\mathrm{b}}}+i_{n}=0 \\tag{5.19}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince the op-amp is assumed to be ideal, we can deduce, using voltage and current constraints, that\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& i_{n}=i_{p}=0  \\tag{5.20}\\\\\n& v_{n}=v_{p}=\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{d}}}{R_{\\mathrm{c}}+R_{\\mathrm{d}}} v_{\\mathrm{b}} \\tag{5.21}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nCombining Equations 5.19, 5.20, and 5.21 yields the sought-after relationship:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{o}=\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{d}}\\left(R_{\\mathrm{a}}+R_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)}{R_{\\mathrm{a}}\\left(R_{\\mathrm{c}}+R_{\\mathrm{d}}\\right)} v_{\\mathrm{b}}-\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{b}}}{R_{\\mathrm{a}}} v_{\\mathrm{a}} . \\tag{5.22}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation 5.22 demonstrates that the output voltage is proportional to the disparity between a scaled version of $v_{\\mathrm{b}}$ and a scaled version of $v_{\\mathrm{a}}$. Typically, the scaling factor applied to $v_{\\mathrm{b}}$ is not identical to the one applied to $v_{\\mathrm{a}}$. Nevertheless, the scaling factor for each input voltage can be equalized by setting\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{a}}}{R_{\\mathrm{b}}}=\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{c}}}{R_{\\mathrm{d}}} \\tag{5.23}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWhen Equation 5.23 holds true, the formula for the output voltage simplifies to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{o}=\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{b}}}{R_{\\mathrm{a}}}\\left(v_{\\mathrm{b}}-v_{\\mathrm{a}}\\right) \\tag{5.24}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nStreamlined Difference-Amp Formula\n\nEquation 5.24 suggests that the output voltage can be adjusted to replicate a scaled difference of the input voltages $v_{\\mathrm{b}}$ and $v_{\\mathrm{a}}$. Similar to the previous ideal op-amp circuits, the scaling is governed by the external resistors. Moreover, the relationship between the output voltage and the input voltages remains unaffected by the addition of a non-zero load resistance across the amplifier's output.\n\nExample 5.4 outlines the design of a difference amplifier using practical resistor values.\nimage_name:Figure 5.15\ndescription:\n[\n'name': 'Va', 'type': 'VoltageSource', 'value': 'Va', 'ports': {'Np': 'va', 'Nn': 'GND'\n'name': 'Vb', 'type': 'VoltageSource', 'value': 'Vb', 'ports': {'Np': 'vb', 'Nn': 'GND'\n'name': 'Ra', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'Ra', 'ports': {'N1': 'va', 'N2': 'InN(Ao)'\n'name': 'Rb', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'Rb', 'ports': {'N1': 'Vo', 'N2': 'InN(Ao)'\n'name': 'Rc', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'Rc', 'ports': {'N1': 'vb', 'N2': 'InP(Ao)'\n'name': 'Rd', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'Rd', 'ports': {'N1': 'InP(A0)', 'N2': 'GND'\n'name': 'Ao', 'type': 'OpAmp', 'value': 'Ao', 'ports': {'InP': 'InP(A0)', 'InN': 'InN(Ao)', 'OutP': 'Vo','Vdd': '+VCC', '-Vdd': '-VCC'\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit illustrated is a difference amplifier, with the output voltage Vo being a scaled representation of the difference between the input voltages va and vb.

The output voltage Vo is determined by the resistors and the input voltages. The op-amp is powered by a dual supply of +10V and -10V.\n\n\nNote: Additionally, attempt Chapter Problems 5.26, 5.27, and 5.30.\n\nFrom a different viewpoint, we can closely inspect the behavior of a difference amplifier by redefining its inputs in terms of two additional voltages. The first is the differential mode input, which represents the difference between the two input voltages as shown in Figure 5.15:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{\\mathrm{dm}}=v_{\\mathrm{b}}-v_{\\mathrm{a}} \\tag{5.25}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe second is the common mode input, which denotes the average of the two input voltages in Figure 5.15:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{\\mathrm{cm}}=\\left(v_{\\mathrm{a}}+v_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right) / 2 \\tag{5.26}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nBy utilizing Equations 5.25 and 5.26, we can now express the original input voltages, $v_{\\mathrm{a}}$ and $v_{\\mathrm{b}}$, in terms of the differential mode and common mode voltages, $v_{\\mathrm{dm}}$ and $v_{\\mathrm{cm}}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& v_{\\mathrm{a}}=v_{\\mathrm{cm}}-\\frac{1}{2} v_{\\mathrm{dm}}  \\tag{5.27}\\\\\n& v_{\\mathrm{b}}=v_{\\mathrm{cm}}+\\frac{1}{2} v_{\\mathrm{dm}} \\tag{5.28}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSubstituting Equations 5.27 and 5.28 into Equation 5.22 provides the output of the difference amplifier in terms of the differential mode and common mode voltages:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv_{o}= & {\\left[\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{a}} R_{\\mathrm{d}}-R_{\\mathrm{b}} R_{\\mathrm{c}}}{R_{\\mathrm{a}}\\left(R_{\\mathrm{c}}+R_{\\mathrm{d}}\\right)}\\right] v_{\\mathrm{cm}} } \\\\\n& +\\left[\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{d}}\\left(R_{\\mathrm{a}}+R_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)+R_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left(R_{\\mathrm{c}}+R_{\\mathrm{d}}\\right)}{2 R_{\\mathrm{a}}\\left(R_{\\mathrm{c}}+R_{\\mathrm{d}}\\right)}\\right] v_{\\mathrm{dm}}  \\tag{5.29}\\\\\n= & A_{\\mathrm{cm}} v_{\\mathrm{cm}}+A_{\\mathrm{dm}} v_{\\mathrm{dm}} \\tag{5.30}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere $A_{\\mathrm{cm}}$ is the common mode gain and $A_{\\mathrm{dm}}$ is the differential mode gain. Now, substitute $R_{\\mathrm{c}}=R_{\\mathrm{a}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{d}}=R_{\\mathrm{b}}$, which are permissible values for $R_{\\mathrm{c}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{d}}$ that fulfill Equation 5.23, into Equation 5.29:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{o}=(0) v_{\\mathrm{cm}}+\\left(\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{b}}}{R_{\\mathrm{a}}}\\right) v_{\\mathrm{dm}} \\tag{5.31}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHence, an ideal difference amplifier possesses $A_{\\mathrm{cm}}=0$, amplifies solely the differential mode component of the input voltage, and excludes the common mode component of the input voltage. Figure 5.17 illustrates a difference-amplifier circuit equipped with differential mode and common mode input voltages instead of $v_{\\mathrm{a}}$ and $v_{\\mathrm{b}}$.\n\nEquation 5.30 offers a significant perspective on the function of the difference amplifier, as the differential mode signal often holds the meaningful information in various applications, while the common mode signal encompasses the noise that is inherent in all electric signals. For example, an electrocardiogram (ECG) electrode detects the voltages generated by the body to regulate heartbeats. These voltages are minute in comparison to the electrical noise acquired from sources such as lights and electrical equipment. The noise constitutes the common mode component of the measured voltage, whereas the heart rate voltages form the differential mode component. Thus, an ideal difference amplifier would amplify only the relevant voltage and suppress the noise.\n\nMeasuring Difference-Amplifier PerformanceThe Common Mode Rejection Ratio\n\nAn ideal difference amplifier exhibits zero common mode gain and a nonzero (typically substantial) differential mode gain. Two factors can influence the ideal common mode gain: resistance mismatches (i.e., Equation [5.23] is not satisfied) or a nonideal op-amp (i.e., Equation [5.20] is not satisfied). We concentrate on the impact of resistance mismatches on the performance of a difference amplifier.\nimage_name:Figure 5.17 A\ndescription:\n[\n'name': 'Ra', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'Ra', 'ports': {'N1': 'b', 'N2': 'InN(Ao)'\n'name': 'Rb', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'Rb', 'ports': {'N1': 'InN(Ao)', 'N2': 'Vo'\n'name': 'Rc', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'Rc', 'ports': {'N1': 'b"

The first is the differential mode input, which is the difference between the two input voltages in Fig. 5.15:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{\\mathrm{dm}}=v_{\\mathrm{b}}-v_{\\mathrm{a}} \\tag{5.25}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe second is the common mode input, which is the average of the two input voltages in Fig. 5.15:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{\\mathrm{cm}}=\\left(v_{\\mathrm{a}}+v_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right) / 2 \\tag{5.26}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nUsing Eqs. 5.25 and 5.26, we can now represent the original input voltages, $v_{\\mathrm{a}}$ and $v_{\\mathrm{b}}$, in terms of the differential mode and common mode voltages, $v_{\\mathrm{dm}}$ and $v_{\\mathrm{cm}}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& v_{\\mathrm{a}}=v_{\\mathrm{cm}}-\\frac{1}{2} v_{\\mathrm{dm}}  \\tag{5.27}\\\\\n& v_{\\mathrm{b}}=v_{\\mathrm{cm}}+\\frac{1}{2} v_{\\mathrm{dm}} \\tag{5.28}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSubstituting Eqs. 5.27 and 5.28 into Eq. 5.22 gives the output of the difference amplifier in terms of the differential mode and common mode voltages:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv_{o}= & {\\left[\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{a}} R_{\\mathrm{d}}-R_{\\mathrm{b}} R_{\\mathrm{c}}}{R_{\\mathrm{a}}\\left(R_{\\mathrm{c}}+R_{\\mathrm{d}}\\right)}\\right] v_{\\mathrm{cm}} } \\\\\n& +\\left[\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{d}}\\left(R_{\\mathrm{a}}+R_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)+R_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left(R_{\\mathrm{c}}+R_{\\mathrm{d}}\\right)}{2 R_{\\mathrm{a}}\\left(R_{\\mathrm{c}}+R_{\\mathrm{d}}\\right)}\\right] v_{\\mathrm{dm}}  \\tag{5.29}\\\\\n= & A_{\\mathrm{cm}} v_{\\mathrm{cm}}+A_{\\mathrm{dm}} v_{\\mathrm{dm}} \\tag{5.30}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere $A_{\\mathrm{cm}}$ is the common mode gain and $A_{\\mathrm{dm}}$ is the differential mode gain. Now, substitute $R_{\\mathrm{c}}=R_{\\mathrm{a}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{d}}=R_{\\mathrm{b}}$, which are possible values for $R_{\\mathrm{c}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{d}}$ that satisfy Eq. 5.23, into Eq. 5.29:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{o}=(0) v_{\\mathrm{cm}}+\\left(\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{b}}}{R_{\\mathrm{a}}}\\right) v_{\\mathrm{dm}} \\tag{5.31}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, an ideal difference amplifier has $A_{\\mathrm{cm}}=0$, amplifies only the differential mode portion of the input voltage, and eliminates the common mode portion of the input voltage. Figure 5.17 shows a differenceamplifier circuit with differential mode and common mode input voltages in place of $v_{\\mathrm{a}}$ and $v_{\\mathrm{b}}$.\n\nEquation 5.30 provides an important perspective on the function of the difference amplifier, since in many applications it is the differential mode signal that contains the information of interest, whereas the common mode signal is the noise found in all electric signals. For example, an electrocardiograph electrode measures the voltages produced by your body to regulate your heartbeat. These voltages have very small magnitudes compared with the electrical noise that the electrode picks up from sources such as lights and electrical equipment. The noise appears as the common mode portion of the measured voltage, whereas the heart rate voltages comprise the differential mode portion. Thus an ideal difference amplifier would amplify only the voltage of interest and would suppress the noise.\n\nMeasuring Difference-Amplifier PerformanceThe Common Mode Rejection Ratio\n\nAn ideal difference amplifier has zero common mode gain and nonzero (and usually large) differential mode gain. Two factors have an influence on the ideal common mode gain-resistance mismatches (that is, Eq. [5.23] is not satisfied) or a nonideal op amp (that is, Eq. [5.20] is not satisfied). We focus here on the effect of resistance mismatches on the performance of a difference amplifier.\nimage_name:Figure 5.17 A\ndescription:\n[\n'name': 'Ra', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'Ra', 'ports': {'N1': 'b', 'N2': 'InN(Ao)'\n'name': 'Rb', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'Rb', 'ports': {'N1': 'InN(Ao)', 'N2': 'Vo'\n'name': 'Rc', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'Rc', 'ports': {'N1': 'b', 'N2': 'InP(Ao)'\n'name': 'Rd', 'type': 'Resistor', 'value': 'Rd', 'ports': {'N1': 'InP(Ao)', 'N2': 'GND'\n'name': 'Ao', 'type': 'OpAmp', 'value': 'Ao', 'ports': {'InP': 'InP(Ao)', 'InN': 'InN(Ao)', 'OutP': 'Vo','Vdd': '+VCC', '-Vdd': '-VCC"

The first is the differential mode input, which represents the difference between the two input voltages in Fig. 5.15:\n\n\\[\nv_{dm} = v_b - v_a \\tag{5.25}\n\\]\n\nThe second is the common mode input, which is the average of the two input voltages in Fig. 5.15:\n\n\\[\nv_{cm} = \\frac{v_a + v_b}{2} \\tag{5.26}\n\\]\n\nUsing Equations 5.25 and 5.26, the original input voltages, \\( v_a \\) and \\( v_b \\), can now be expressed in terms of the differential mode and common mode voltages, \\( v_{dm} \\) and \\( v_{cm} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nv_a &= v_{cm} - \\frac{1}{2} v_{dm} \\tag{5.27} \\\\\nv_b &= v_{cm} + \\frac{1}{2} v_{dm} \\tag{5.28}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting Equations 5.27 and 5.28 into Equation 5.22 yields the output of the difference amplifier in terms of the differential mode and common mode voltages:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nv_o &= \\left[\\frac{R_a R_d - R_b R_c}{R_a (R_c + R_d)}\\right] v_{cm} \\\\\n&+ \\left[\\frac{R_d (R_a + R_b) + R_b (R_c + R_d)}{2 R_a (R_c + R_d)}\\right] v_{dm} \\tag{5.29} \\\\\n&= A_{cm} v_{cm} + A_{dm} v_{dm} \\tag{5.30}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( A_{cm} \\) denotes the common mode gain and \\( A_{dm} \\) denotes the differential mode gain. Now, substitute \\( R_c = R_a \\) and \\( R_d = R_b \\), which are possible resistor values satisfying Equation 5.23, into Equation 5.29:\n\n\\[\nv_o = (0) v_{cm} + \\left(\\frac{R_b}{R_a}\\right) v_{dm} \\tag{5.31}\n\\]\n\nThus, an ideal difference amplifier exhibits \\( A_{cm} = 0 \\), amplifying solely the differential mode component of the input voltage and rejecting the common mode component. Figure 5.17 depicts a difference-amplifier circuit with differential mode and common mode input voltages replacing \\( v_a \\) and \\( v_b \\).\n\nEquation 5.30 offers a crucial insight into the function of the difference amplifier, as in many applications, the differential mode signal carries the relevant information, whereas the common mode signal constitutes the noise inherent in all electrical signals. For instance, an electrocardiograph electrode measures the voltages generated by the body to regulate the heartbeat, which are much smaller in magnitude compared to the electrical noise picked up from sources like lights and electrical equipment. This noise manifests as the common mode portion of the measured voltage, whereas the heartbeat voltages form the differential mode portion. Hence, an ideal difference amplifier would amplify the voltage of interest and suppress the noise.\n\nMeasuring Difference-Amplifier Performance—The Common Mode Rejection Ratio\n\nAn ideal difference amplifier exhibits zero common mode gain and a non-zero (usually large) differential mode gain. Two factors can influence the ideal common mode gain: resistance mismatches (where Equation 5.23 is not satisfied) or a non-ideal operational amplifier (where Equation 5.20 is not satisfied). Here, we focus on the impact of resistance mismatches on the performance of a difference amplifier.\n\nSuppose the resistor values do not exactly satisfy Equation 5.23. Instead, the relationship among the resistors \\( R_a, R_b, R_c \\), and \\( R_d \\) is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{R_a}{R_b} = (1 - \\epsilon) \\frac{R_c}{R_d}\n\\]\n\nso\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nR_a &= (1 - \\epsilon) R_c \\quad \\text{and} \\quad R_b = R_d \\tag{5.32} \\\\\nR_d &= (1 - \\epsilon) R_b \\quad \\text{and} \\quad R_a = R_c \\tag{5.33}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\epsilon \\) is an exceedingly small number. We can observe the effect of this resistance mismatch on the common mode gain of the difference amplifier by substituting Equation 5.33 into Equation 5.29 and simplifying the expression for \\( A_{cm} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nA_{cm} &= \\frac{R_a (1 - \\epsilon) R_b - R_a R_b}{R_a [R_a + (1 - \\epsilon) R_b]} \\tag{5.34} \\\\\n&= \\frac{-\\epsilon R_b}{R_a + (1 - \\epsilon) R_b} \\tag{5.35} \\\\\n&\\approx \\frac{-\\epsilon R_b}{R_a + R_b} \\tag{5.36}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nWe can make the approximation leading to Equation 5.36 because \\( \\epsilon \\) is very small, and thus \\( (1 - \\epsilon) \\) is approximately 1 in the denominator of Equation 5.35. Note that when the resistors in the difference amplifier satisfy Equation 5.23, \\( \\epsilon = 0 \\) and Equation 5.36 yields \\( A_{cm} = 0 \\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the effect of the resistance mismatch on the differential mode gain by substituting Equation 5.33 into Equation 5.29 and simplifying the expression for \\( A_{dm} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nA_{dm} &= \\frac{(1 - \\epsilon) R_b (R_a + R_b) + R_b [R_a + (1 - \\epsilon) R_b]}{2 R_a [R_a + (1 - \\epsilon) R_b]} \\tag{5.37} \\\\\n&= \\frac{R_b}{R_a} \\left[1 - \\frac{(\\epsilon / 2) R_a}{R_a + (1 - \\epsilon) R_b}\\right] \\tag{5.38} \\\\\n&\\approx \\frac{R_b}{R_a} \\left[1 - \\frac{(\\epsilon / 2) R_a}{R_a + R_b}\\right] \\tag{5.39}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nWe employ the same reasoning for the approximation in Equation 5.39 as in the computation of \\( A_{cm} \\). When the resistors in the difference amplifier satisfy Equation 5.23, \\( \\epsilon = 0 \\) and Equation 5.39 gives \\( A_{dm} = R_b / R_a \\).\n\nThe common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) is a measure of how closely a difference amplifier approximates the ideal. It is defined as the ratio of the differential mode gain to the common mode gain:\n\n\\[\n\\mathrm{CMRR} = \\left|\\frac{A_{dm}}{A_{cm}}\\right| \\tag{5.40}\n\\]\n\nA higher CMRR indicates a closer approximation to the ideal difference amplifier. We can observe the effect of resistance mismatch on the CMRR by substituting Equations 5.36 and 5.39 into Equation 5.40:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathrm{CMRR} &\\approx \\left|\\frac{\\frac{R_b}{R_a} \\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{R_a \\epsilon}{2}\\right) / \\left(R_a + R_b\\right)\\right]}{-\\epsilon R_b / \\left(R_a + R_b\\right)}\\right| \\tag{5.41} \\\\\n&\\approx \\left|\\frac{R_a (1 - \\epsilon / 2) + R_b}{-\\epsilon R_a}\\right| \\tag{5.42} \\\\\n&\\approx \\left|\\frac{1 + R_b / R_a}{-\\epsilon}\\right| \\tag{5.43}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nFrom Equation 5.43, if the resistors in the difference amplifier are matched, \\( \\epsilon = 0 \\) and \\( \\mathrm{CMRR} = \\infty \\). Even if the resistors are mismatched, we can minimize the impact of the mismatch by making the differential mode gain \\( (R_b / R_a) \\) very large, thereby increasing the CMRR.\n\nWe mentioned earlier that another factor contributing to a non-zero common mode gain is a non-ideal operational amplifier. Note that the operational amplifier itself acts as a difference amplifier, as its output in the linear operating region is proportional to the difference of its inputs; that is, \\( v_o = A (v_p - v_n) \\). The output of a non-ideal operational amplifier is not strictly proportional to the difference between the inputs (the differential mode input) but also includes a common mode signal. Internal mismatches in the components of the integrated circuit render the operational amplifier's behavior non-ideal, similar to how resistor mismatches in the difference-amplifier circuit affect its performance. Although a detailed discussion of non-ideal operational amplifiers is beyond the scope of this text, it is worth noting that the CMRR is often used to evaluate how closely an operational amplifier's behavior approximates the ideal. In fact, it is one of the primary metrics used to rate operational amplifiers in practice.\n\nPlease attempt Chapter Problems 5.33 and 5.34 to further assess your understanding of this material."

The first is the differential mode input, defined as the voltage difference between the two input voltages in Fig. 5.15:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{\\mathrm{dm}}=v_{\\mathrm{b}}-v_{\\mathrm{a}} \\tag{5.25}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe second is the common mode input, defined as the average of the two input voltages in Fig. 5.15:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{\\mathrm{cm}}=\\left(v_{\\mathrm{a}}+v_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right) / 2 \\tag{5.26}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nBy using Eqs. 5.25 and 5.26, we can now express the original input voltages, $v_{\\mathrm{a}}$ and $v_{\\mathrm{b}}$, in terms of the differential mode and common mode voltages, $v_{\\mathrm{dm}}$ and $v_{\\mathrm{cm}}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& v_{\\mathrm{a}}=v_{\\mathrm{cm}}-\\frac{1}{2} v_{\\mathrm{dm}}  \\tag{5.27}\\\\\n& v_{\\mathrm{b}}=v_{\\mathrm{cm}}+\\frac{1}{2} v_{\\mathrm{dm}} \\tag{5.28}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSubstituting Eqs. 5.27 and 5.28 into Eq. 5.22 yields the output of the differential amplifier in terms of the differential mode and common mode voltages:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv_{o}= & {\\left[\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{a}} R_{\\mathrm{d}}-R_{\\mathrm{b}} R_{\\mathrm{c}}}{R_{\\mathrm{a}}\\left(R_{\\mathrm{c}}+R_{\\mathrm{d}}\\right)}\\right] v_{\\mathrm{cm}} } \\\\\n& +\\left[\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{d}}\\left(R_{\\mathrm{a}}+R_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)+R_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left(R_{\\mathrm{c}}+R_{\\mathrm{d}}\\right)}{2 R_{\\mathrm{a}}\\left(R_{\\mathrm{c}}+R_{\\mathrm{d}}\\right)}\\right] v_{\\mathrm{dm}}  \\tag{5.29}\\\\\n= & A_{\\mathrm{cm}} v_{\\mathrm{cm}}+A_{\\mathrm{dm}} v_{\\mathrm{dm}} \\tag{5.30}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere $A_{\\mathrm{cm}}$ denotes the common mode gain and $A_{\\mathrm{dm}}$ represents the differential mode gain. Now, by substituting $R_{\\mathrm{c}}=R_{\\mathrm{a}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{d}}=R_{\\mathrm{b}}$, which are possible resistor values satisfying Eq. 5.23, into Eq. 5.29:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{o}=(0) v_{\\mathrm{cm}}+\\left(\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{b}}}{R_{\\mathrm{a}}}\\right) v_{\\mathrm{dm}} \\tag{5.31}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, an ideal differential amplifier has $A_{\\mathrm{cm}}=0$, amplifying only the differential mode component of the input voltage while suppressing the common mode component. Figure 5.17 displays a differential amplifier circuit with differential mode and common mode input voltages substituting $v_{\\mathrm{a}}$ and $v_{\\mathrm{b}}$.\n\nEquation 5.30 offers a critical perspective on the differential amplifier's function, as in many applications, the differential mode signal contains the pertinent information, whereas the common mode signal constitutes the noise inherent in all electrical signals. For instance, an electrocardiogram electrode measures the voltages generated by the body to regulate the heartbeat. These voltages are minute compared to the electrical noise the electrode picks up from sources such as lighting and electrical equipment. The noise manifests as the common mode component of the measured voltage, while the heartbeat voltages form the differential mode component. Hence, an ideal differential amplifier would amplify solely the voltage of interest and suppress the noise.\n\nAssessing Differential Amplifier Performance: The Common Mode Rejection Ratio\n\nAn ideal differential amplifier exhibits zero common mode gain and a non-zero (usually significant) differential mode gain. Two factors influence the ideal common mode gain: resistance mismatches (where Eq. [5.23] is not met) or a non-ideal operational amplifier (where Eq. [5.20] is not met). We will focus on the impact of resistance mismatches on the performance of a differential amplifier.\nImage Description: The circuit depicted in Figure 5.17 is a differential amplifier with common mode and differential mode input voltages.\n\nConsider a scenario where resistor values are selected that do not exactly satisfy Eq. 5.23. Instead, the relationship among the resistors $R_{\\mathrm{a}}, R_{\\mathrm{b}}, R_{\\mathrm{c}}$, and $R_{\\mathrm{d}}$ is\n\n$$\n\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{a}}}{R_{\\mathrm{b}}}=(1-\\epsilon) \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{c}}}{R_{\\mathrm{d}}}\n$$\n\nthus\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{\\mathrm{a}}=(1-\\epsilon) R_{\\mathrm{c}} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad R_{\\mathrm{b}}=R_{\\mathrm{d}} \\tag{5.32}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{\\mathrm{d}}=(1-\\epsilon) R_{\\mathrm{b}} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad R_{\\mathrm{a}}=R_{\\mathrm{c}} \\tag{5.33}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is an exceedingly small number. The effect of this resistance mismatch on the common mode gain of the differential amplifier can be observed by substituting Eq. 5.33 into Eq. 5.29 and simplifying the expression for $A_{\\mathrm{cm}}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nA_{\\mathrm{cm}} & =\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{a}}(1-\\epsilon) R_{\\mathrm{b}}-R_{\\mathrm{a}} R_{\\mathrm{b}}}{R_{\\mathrm{a}}\\left[R_{\\mathrm{a}}+(1-\\epsilon) R_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right]}  \\tag{5.34}\\\\\n& =\\frac{-\\epsilon R_{\\mathrm{b}}}{R_{\\mathrm{a}}+(1-\\epsilon) R_{\\mathrm{b}}}  \\tag{5.35}\\\\\n& \\approx \\frac{-\\epsilon R_{\\mathrm{b}}}{R_{\\mathrm{a}}+R_{\\mathrm{b}}} \\tag{5.36}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe approximation leading to Eq. 5.36 is valid because $\\epsilon$ is very small, making $(1-\\epsilon)$ approximately 1 in the denominator of Eq. 5.35. Note that when the resistors in the differential amplifier satisfy Eq. 5.23, $\\epsilon=0$ and Eq. 5.36 yields $A_{\\mathrm{cm}}=0$.\n\nNext, we calculate the effect of the resistance mismatch on the differential mode gain by substituting Eq. 5.33 into Eq. 5.29 and simplifying the expression for $A_{\\mathrm{dm}}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nA_{\\mathrm{dm}} & =\\frac{(1-\\epsilon) R_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left(R_{\\mathrm{a}}+R_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)+R_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left[R_{\\mathrm{a}}+(1-\\epsilon) R_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right]}{2 R_{\\mathrm{a}}\\left[R_{\\mathrm{a}}+(1-\\epsilon) R_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right]}  \\tag{5.37}\\\\\n& =\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{b}}}{R_{\\mathrm{a}}}\\left[1-\\frac{(\\epsilon / 2) R_{\\mathrm{a}}}{R_{\\mathrm{a}}+(1-\\epsilon) R_{\\mathrm{b}}}\\right]  \\tag{5.38}\\\\\n& \\approx \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{b}}}{R_{\\mathrm{a}}}\\left[1-\\frac{(\\epsilon / 2) R_{\\mathrm{a}}}{R_{\\mathrm{a}}+R_{\\mathrm{b}}}\\right] \\tag{5.39}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe same reasoning for the approximation in Eq. 5.39 applies as in the computation of $A_{\\mathrm{cm}}$. When the resistors in the differential amplifier adhere to Eq. 5.23, $\\epsilon=0$ and Eq. 5.39 gives $A_{\\mathrm{dm}}=R_{\\mathrm{b}} / R_{\\mathrm{a}}$.\n\nThe common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) is employed to quantify how closely a differential amplifier approximates an ideal one. It is defined as the ratio of the differential mode gain to the common mode gain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{CMRR}=\\left|\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{dm}}}{A_{\\mathrm{cm}}}\\right| \\tag{5.40}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nA higher CMRR indicates a closer approximation to an ideal differential amplifier.

As in the previous ideal amplifier circuits, the scaling is controlled by the external resistors. Furthermore, the relationship between the output voltage and the input voltages is not affected by connecting a nonzero load resistance across the output of the amplifier.\n\nExample 5.4 describes the design of a difference amplifier using realistic resistor values.\n\nFigure 5.15 $\\triangle$ A difference amplifier.\n\n#### Solution\n\na) Using the simplified difference-amplifier equation (Eq. 5.24),\n$v_{o}=\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{b}}}{R_{\\mathrm{a}}}\\left(v_{\\mathrm{b}}-v_{\\mathrm{a}}\\right)=8\\left(v_{\\mathrm{b}}-v_{\\mathrm{a}}\\right)$ so $\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{b}}}{R_{\\mathrm{a}}}=8$.\nWe want two resistors whose ratio is 8. Look at the realistic resistor values listed in Appendix H. Let's choose $R_{\\mathrm{b}}=12 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$, so $R_{\\mathrm{a}}=1.5 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$, although there are many other possibilities. Note that the simplified difference-amplifier equation requires that\n\n$$\n\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{a}}}{R_{\\mathrm{b}}}=\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{c}}}{R_{\\mathrm{d}}}\n$$\n\nA simple choice for $R_{\\mathrm{c}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{d}}$ is $R_{\\mathrm{c}}=R_{\\mathrm{a}}=$ $1.5 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$ and $R_{\\mathrm{d}}=R_{\\mathrm{b}}=12 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$. The resulting circuit is shown in Fig. 5.16.\n\nFigure 5.16 $\\Delta$ The difference amplifier designed in Example 5.4.\n\nb) Solve two different versions of the simplified difference-amplifier equation for $v_{o}$ in terms of $v_{\\mathrm{b}}$-first using $v_{o}=+8 \\mathrm{~V}$ and then using $v_{o}=-8 \\mathrm{~V}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& v_{o}=8\\left(v_{\\mathrm{b}}-1\\right)=8 \\mathrm{~V} \\quad \\text { so } v_{\\mathrm{b}}=2 \\mathrm{~V} \\\\\n& v_{o}=8\\left(v_{\\mathrm{b}}-1\\right)=-8 \\mathrm{~V} \\quad \\text { so } v_{\\mathrm{b}}=0 \\mathrm{~V}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, if $v_{\\mathrm{a}}=1 \\mathrm{~V}$ in the difference amplifier from part (a), the op amp will remain in its linear region of operation if $0 \\mathrm{~V} \\leq v_{\\mathrm{b}} \\leq+2 \\mathrm{~V}$.\n\nASSESSMENT PROBLEM\n\nObjective 2-Be able to analyze simple circuits containing ideal op amps\n\n5.5 a) In the difference amplifier shown, $v_{\\mathrm{b}}=4.0 \\mathrm{~V}$.

The first is the differential mode input, which is the difference between the two input voltages in Fig. 5.15:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{\\mathrm{dm}}=v_{\\mathrm{b}}-v_{\\mathrm{a}} \\tag{5.25}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe second is the common mode input, which is the average of the two input voltages in Fig. 5.15:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{\\mathrm{cm}}=\\left(v_{\\mathrm{a}}+v_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right) / 2 \\tag{5.26}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nUsing Eqs. 5.25 and 5.26, we can now represent the original input voltages, $v_{\\mathrm{a}}$ and $v_{\\mathrm{b}}$, in terms of the differential mode and common mode voltages, $v_{\\mathrm{dm}}$ and $v_{\\mathrm{cm}}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& v_{\\mathrm{a}}=v_{\\mathrm{cm}}-\\frac{1}{2} v_{\\mathrm{dm}}  \\tag{5.27}\\\\\n& v_{\\mathrm{b}}=v_{\\mathrm{cm}}+\\frac{1}{2} v_{\\mathrm{dm}} \\tag{5.28}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSubstituting Eqs. 5.27 and 5.28 into Eq. 5.22 gives the output of the difference amplifier in terms of the differential mode and common mode voltages:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv_{o}= & {\\left[\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{a}} R_{\\mathrm{d}}-R_{\\mathrm{b}} R_{\\mathrm{c}}}{R_{\\mathrm{a}}\\left(R_{\\mathrm{c}}+R_{\\mathrm{d}}\\right)}\\right] v_{\\mathrm{cm}} } \\\\\n& +\\left[\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{d}}\\left(R_{\\mathrm{a}}+R_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)+R_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left(R_{\\mathrm{c}}+R_{\\mathrm{d}}\\right)}{2 R_{\\mathrm{a}}\\left(R_{\\mathrm{c}}+R_{\\mathrm{d}}\\right)}\\right] v_{\\mathrm{dm}}  \\tag{5.29}\\\\\n= & A_{\\mathrm{cm}} v_{\\mathrm{cm}}+A_{\\mathrm{dm}} v_{\\mathrm{dm}} \\tag{5.30}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere $A_{\\mathrm{cm}}$ is the common mode gain and $A_{\\mathrm{dm}}$ is the differential mode gain. Now, substitute $R_{\\mathrm{c}}=R_{\\mathrm{a}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{d}}=R_{\\mathrm{b}}$, which are possible values for $R_{\\mathrm{c}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{d}}$ that satisfy Eq. 5.23, into Eq. 5.29:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{o}=(0) v_{\\mathrm{cm}}+\\left(\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{b}}}{R_{\\mathrm{a}}}\\right) v_{\\mathrm{dm}} \\tag{5.31}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, an ideal difference amplifier has $A_{\\mathrm{cm}}=0$, amplifies only the differential mode portion of the input voltage, and eliminates the common mode portion of the input voltage. Figure 5.17 shows a differenceamplifier circuit with differential mode and common mode input voltages in place of $v_{\\mathrm{a}}$ and $v_{\\mathrm{b}}$.\n\nEquation 5.30 provides an important perspective on the function of the difference amplifier, since in many applications it is the differential mode signal that contains the information of interest, whereas the common mode signal is the noise found in all electric signals. For example, an electrocardiograph electrode measures the voltages produced by your body to regulate your heartbeat. These voltages have very small magnitudes compared with the electrical noise that the electrode picks up from sources such as lights and electrical equipment. The noise appears as the common mode portion of the measured voltage, whereas the heart rate voltages comprise the differential mode portion. Thus an ideal difference amplifier would amplify only the voltage of interest and would suppress the noise.\n\nMeasuring Difference-Amplifier PerformanceThe Common Mode Rejection Ratio\n\nAn ideal difference amplifier has zero common mode gain and nonzero (and usually large) differential mode gain. Two factors have an influence on the ideal common mode gain-resistance mismatches (that is, Eq. [5.23] is not satisfied) or a nonideal op amp (that is, Eq. [5.20] is not satisfied). We focus here on the effect of resistance mismatches on the performance of a difference amplifier.\n\nSuppose that resistor values are chosen that do not precisely satisfy Eq. 5.23. Instead, the relationship among the resistors $R_{\\mathrm{a}}, R_{\\mathrm{b}}, R_{\\mathrm{c}}$, and $R_{\\mathrm{d}}$ is\n\n$$\n\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{a}}}{R_{\\mathrm{b}}}=(1-\\epsilon) \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{c}}}{R_{\\mathrm{d}}}\n$$\n\nso\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{\\mathrm{a}}=(1-\\epsilon) R_{\\mathrm{c}} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad R_{\\mathrm{b}}=R_{\\mathrm{d}} \\tag{5.32}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_{\\mathrm{d}}=(1-\\epsilon) R_{\\mathrm{b}} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad R_{\\mathrm{a}}=R_{\\mathrm{c}} \\tag{5.33}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is a very small number. We can see the effect of this resistance mismatch on the common mode gain of the difference amplifier by substituting Eq. 5.33 into Eq. 5.29 and simplifying the expression for $A_{\\mathrm{cm}}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nA_{\\mathrm{cm}} & =\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{a}}(1-\\epsilon) R_{\\mathrm{b}}-R_{\\mathrm{a}} R_{\\mathrm{b}}}{R_{\\mathrm{a}}\\left[R_{\\mathrm{a}}+(1-\\epsilon) R_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right]}  \\tag{5.34}\\\\\n& =\\frac{-\\epsilon R_{\\mathrm{b}}}{R_{\\mathrm{a}}+(1-\\epsilon) R_{\\mathrm{b}}}  \\tag{5.35}\\\\\n& \\approx \\frac{-\\epsilon R_{\\mathrm{b}}}{R_{\\mathrm{a}}+R_{\\mathrm{b}}} \\tag{5.36}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nWe can make the approximation to give Eq. 5.36 because $\\epsilon$ is very small, and therefore $(1-\\epsilon)$ is approximately 1 in the denominator of Eq. 5.35. Note that, when the resistors in the difference amplifier satisfy Eq. 5.23, $\\epsilon=0$ and Eq. 5.36 gives $A_{\\mathrm{cm}}=0$.\n\nNow calculate the effect of the resistance mismatch on the differential mode gain by substituting Eq. 5.33 into Eq. 5.29 and simplifying the expression for $A_{\\mathrm{dm}}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nA_{\\mathrm{dm}} & =\\frac{(1-\\epsilon) R_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left(R_{\\mathrm{a}}+R_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)+R_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left[R_{\\mathrm{a}}+(1-\\epsilon) R_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right]}{2 R_{\\mathrm{a}}\\left[R_{\\mathrm{a}}+(1-\\epsilon) R_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right]}  \\tag{5.37}\\\\\n& =\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{b}}}{R_{\\mathrm{a}}}\\left[1-\\frac{(\\epsilon / 2) R_{\\mathrm{a}}}{R_{\\mathrm{a}}+(1-\\epsilon) R_{\\mathrm{b}}}\\right]  \\tag{5.38}\\\\\n& \\approx \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{b}}}{R_{\\mathrm{a}}}\\left[1-\\frac{(\\epsilon / 2) R_{\\mathrm{a}}}{R_{\\mathrm{a}}+R_{\\mathrm{b}}}\\right] \\tag{5.39}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nWe use the same rationale for the approximation in Eq. 5.39 as in the computation of $A_{\\mathrm{cm}}$. When the resistors in the difference amplifier satisfy Eq. 5.23, $\\epsilon=0$ and Eq. 5.39 gives $A_{\\mathrm{dm}}=R_{\\mathrm{b}} / R_{\\mathrm{a}}$.\n\nThe common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) can be used to measure how nearly ideal a difference amplifier is. It is defined as the ratio of the differential mode gain to the common mode gain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathrm{CMRR}=\\left|\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{dm}}}{A_{\\mathrm{cm}}}\\right| \\tag{5.40}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe higher the CMRR, the more nearly ideal the difference amplifier. We can see the effect of resistance mismatch on the CMRR by substituting Eqs. 5.36 and 5.39 into Eq. 5.40:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathrm{CMRR} & \\approx\\left|\\frac{\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{b}}}{R_{\\mathrm{a}}}\\left[1-\\left(R_{\\mathrm{a}} \\epsilon / 2\\right) /\\left(R_{\\mathrm{a}}+R_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)\\right]}{-\\epsilon R_{\\mathrm{b}} /\\left(R_{\\mathrm{a}}+R_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)}\\right|  \\tag{5.41}\\\\\n& \\approx\\left|\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{a}}(1-\\epsilon / 2)+R_{\\mathrm{b}}}{-\\epsilon R_{\\mathrm{a}}}\\right|  \\tag{5.42}\\\\\n& \\approx\\left|\\frac{1+R_{\\mathrm{b}} / R_{\\mathrm{a}}}{-\\epsilon}\\right| \\tag{5.43}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nFrom Eq. 5.43, if the resistors in the difference amplifier are matched, $\\epsilon=0$ and $\\mathrm{CMRR}=\\infty$. Even if the resistors are mismatched, we can minimize the impact of"

As with previous analyses, our objective is to express the output voltage, $v_{o}$, as a function of the source voltage, $v_{s}$. This is achieved by formulating two node-voltage equations that describe the circuit and subsequently solving the resulting equations for $v_{o}$. In Fig. 5.19, the two nodes are designated as a and b. It is also noted that $v_{p}=0$ due to the external short-circuit connection at the noninverting input terminal. The node-voltage equations are as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& \\text { node a: } \\frac{v_{n}-v_{s}}{R_{s}}+\\frac{v_{n}}{R_{i}}+\\frac{v_{n}-v_{o}}{R_{f}}=0  \\tag{5.44}\\\\\n& \\text { node b: } \\frac{v_{o}-v_{n}}{R_{f}}+\\frac{v_{o}-A\\left(-v_{n}\\right)}{R_{o}}=0 \\tag{5.45}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nRearranging Eqs. 5.44 and 5.45 facilitates the application of Cramer's method to solve for $v_{o}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& \\left(\\frac{1}{R_{s}}+\\frac{1}{R_{i}}+\\frac{1}{R_{f}}\\right) v_{n}-\\frac{1}{R_{f}} v_{o}=\\frac{1}{R_{s}} v_{s},  \\tag{5.46}\\\\\n& \\left(\\frac{A}{R_{o}}-\\frac{1}{R_{f}}\\right) v_{n}+\\left(\\frac{1}{R_{f}}+\\frac{1}{R_{o}}\\right) v_{o}=0 . \\tag{5.47}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSolving for $v_{o}$ results in:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{o}=\\frac{-A+\\left(R_{o} / R_{f}\\right)}{\\frac{R_{s}}{R_{f}}\\left(1+A+\\frac{R_{o}}{R_{i}}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{R_{s}}{R_{i}}+1\\right)+\\frac{R_{o}}{R_{f}}} v_{s} \\tag{5.48}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIt is observed that Eq. 5.48 reverts to Eq. 5.10 as $R_{o}$ approaches zero, $R_{i}$ approaches infinity, and $A$ approaches infinity. If the inverting amplifier depicted in Fig. 5.19 were loaded with a load resistance of $R_{L}$ ohms at its output terminals, the relationship between $v_{o}$ and $v_{s}$ would be modified to:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{o}=\\frac{-A+\\left(R_{o} / R_{f}\\right)}{\\frac{R_{s}}{R_{f}}\\left(1+A+\\frac{R_{o}}{R_{i}}+\\frac{R_{o}}{R_{L}}\\right)+\\left(1+\\frac{R_{o}}{R_{L}}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{R_{s}}{R_{i}}\\right)+\\frac{R_{o}}{R_{f}}} v_{s} \\tag{5.49}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAnalysis of a Noninverting-Amplifier Circuit Utilizing the More Realistic Op Amp Model\n\nWhen employing the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 5.18 to analyze a noninverting amplifier, the resulting circuit is illustrated in Fig. 5.20. Here, the voltage source $v_{g}$, in series with resistor $R_{g}$, signifies the signal source. Resistor $R_{L}$ represents the load on the amplifier. Our analysis entails deriving an expression for $v_{o}$ as a function of $v_{g}$. This is accomplished by formulating the node-voltage equations at nodes a and b. At node a, the equation is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{v_{n}}{R_{s}}+\\frac{v_{n}-v_{g}}{R_{g}+R_{i}}+\\frac{v_{n}-v_{o}}{R_{f}}=0 \\tag{5.50}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand at node b:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{v_{o}-v_{n}}{R_{f}}+\\frac{v_{o}}{R_{L}}+\\frac{v_{o}-A\\left(v_{p}-v_{n}\\right)}{R_{o}}=0 \\tag{5.51}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince the current through $R_{g}$ is equivalent to that through $R_{i}$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{v_{p}-v_{g}}{R_{g}}=\\frac{v_{n}-v_{g}}{R_{i}+R_{g}} \\tag{5.52}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nUtilizing Eq. 5.52 to eliminate $v_{p}$ from Eq. 5.51 yields a pair of equations involving the unknown voltages $v_{n}$ and $v_{o}$.

For the unloaded (i.e., $R_{L}=\\infty$) noninverting amplifier, Eq. 5.55 simplifies to:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{o}=\\frac{\\left[\\left(R_{f}+R_{s}\\right)+R_{s} R_{o} / A R_{i}\\right] v_{g}}{R_{s}+\\frac{R_{o}}{A}\\left(1+\\frac{R_{s}+R_{g}}{R_{i}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{A R_{i}}\\left[R_{f} R_{s}+\\left(R_{f}+R_{s}\\right)\\left(R_{i}+R_{g}\\right)\\right]} \\tag{5.56}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIt is worth noting that in the derivation of Eq. 5.56 from Eq. 5.55, $K_{r}$ simplifies to $\\left(R_{s}+R_{g}\\right) / R_{i}$.\n\nASSESSMENT PROBLEM\n\nObjective 3: Comprehend the more realistic model for an operational amplifier\n\n5.6 The inverting amplifier within the depicted circuit possesses an input resistance of $500 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$, an output resistance of $5 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$, and an open-loop gain of 300,000.

An aircraft frame exemplifies such structures, where engineers must account for elastic strain. The effective application of strain gages necessitates understanding their physical structure, methods of attachment to the structural surface, and orientation relative to the applied forces. Our intent here is to emphasize the significance of strain gage measurements in engineering applications and the relevance of electrical circuit knowledge to their proper usage.\n\nThe circuit shown in Fig. 5.21 exemplifies one method for measuring the resistance change experienced by strain gages in applications similar to those discussed at the chapter's outset. As we will see, this circuit employs the familiar difference amplifier, with the strain gage bridge providing the two voltages whose difference is amplified. The strain gages that elongate when the bar bends have values of $R+\\Delta R$ in the bridge that feeds the difference amplifier, whereas the gages that shorten have values of $R-\\Delta R$. We will analyze this circuit to ascertain the relationship between the output voltage, $v_{o}$, and the resistance change, $\\Delta R$, experienced by the strain gages.\n\nTo initiate the analysis, we assume an ideal operational amplifier. Formulating the KCL equations at the inverting and noninverting input terminals of the operational amplifier yields:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{ref}}-v_{n}}{R+\\Delta R}=\\frac{v_{n}}{R-\\Delta R}+\\frac{v_{n}-v_{o}}{R_{f}}  \\tag{5.57}\\\\\n& \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{ref}}-v_{p}}{R-\\Delta R}=\\frac{v_{p}}{R+\\Delta R}+\\frac{v_{p}}{R_{f}} \\tag{5.58}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nRearranging Eq. 5.58 provides an expression for the voltage at the noninverting terminal of the operational amplifier:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{p}=\\frac{v_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{(R-\\Delta R)\\left(\\frac{1}{R+\\Delta R}+\\frac{1}{R-\\Delta R}+\\frac{1}{R_{f}}\\right)} \\tag{5.59}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAssuming the operational amplifier is operating within its linear region, $v_{p}=v_{n}$, and the expression for $v_{p}$ in Eq. 5.59 also applies to $v_{n}$. We can substitute the right-hand side of Eq. 5.59 for $v_{n}$ in Eq. 5.57 and solve for $v_{o}$. Following algebraic manipulation, we obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{o}=\\frac{R_{f}(2 \\Delta R)}{R^{2}-(\\Delta R)^{2}} v_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\tag{5.60}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nGiven that the resistance change experienced by strain gages is minimal, $(\\Delta R)^{2} \\ll R^{2}$, it follows that $R^{2}-(\\Delta R)^{2} \\approx R^{2}$, rendering Eq. 5.60 as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{o} \\approx \\frac{R_{f}}{R} 2 \\delta v_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\tag{5.61}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\delta=\\Delta R / R$.\n\nNote: Assess your comprehension of this Practical Perspective by attempting Chapter Problem 5.49."

    "text": "- The equation depicting the voltage transfer characteristic of an ideal operational amplifier (op amp) is expressed as:\n$$\nv_{o}= \\begin{cases}-V_{C C}, & A\\left(v_{p}-v_{n}\\right)<-V_{C C}, \\\\ A\\left(v_{p}-v_{n}\\right), & -V_{C C} \\leq A\\left(v_{p}-v_{n}\\right) \\leq+V_{C C}, \\\\ +V_{C C}, & A\\left(v_{p}-v_{n}\\right)>+V_{C C},\\end{cases}\n$$\nwhere $A$ denotes the open-loop gain, a proportionality constant, and $V_{C C}$ signifies the power supply voltages. (Refer to page 147.)\n- By establishing a feedback path from the op amp's output to its inverting input, the op amp can be restricted to its linear operational range, where $v_{o}=A\\left(v_{p}-v_{n}\\right)$. (Refer to page 147.)\n- A voltage constraint is present when the op amp operates within its linear region due to standard values of $V_{C C}$ and $A$. Assuming ideal conditions with $A$ being infinite, the ideal op amp model is defined by the voltage constraint:\n$$\nv_{p}=v_{n}\n$$\n(Refer to page 147.)\n- The ideal op amp model is further defined by a current constraint, stemming from the infinite input resistance of the op amp integrated circuit. This constraint is articulated as:\n$$\ni_{p}=i_{n}=0\n$$\n(Refer to page 148.)\n- This chapter examines both a basic ideal op amp model and a more detailed realistic model. The distinctions between these models are outlined below:\n\n| Simplified Model | More Realistic Model |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Infinite input resistance | Finite input resistance |\n| Infinite open-loop gain | Finite open-loop gain |\n| Zero output resistance | Nonzero output resistance |\n\n(Refer to page 159.)\n- An inverting amplifier is an op amp configuration that generates an output voltage which is an inverted and scaled version of the input voltage. (Refer to page 150.)\n- A summing amplifier is an op amp circuit that produces an output voltage representing a scaled sum of the input voltages. (Refer to page 152.)\n- A noninverting amplifier is an op amp setup that yields an output voltage that is a scaled copy of the input voltage. (Refer to page 153.)\n- A difference amplifier is an op amp circuit that creates an output voltage that is a scaled version of the difference between the input voltages. (Refer to page 155.)\n- The two input voltages of a difference amplifier can be utilized to determine the common mode and difference mode voltages, $v_{\\mathrm{cm}}$ and $v_{\\mathrm{dm}}$. The output of the difference amplifier can be formulated as:\n$$\nv_{o}=A_{\\mathrm{cm}} v_{\\mathrm{cm}}+A_{\\mathrm{dm}} v_{\\mathrm{dm}}\n$$\nwhere $A_{\\mathrm{cm}}$ is the common mode gain, and $A_{\\mathrm{dm}}$ is the differential mode gain. (Refer to page 157.)\n- In an ideal difference amplifier, $A_{\\mathrm{cm}}=0$. To assess how closely a difference amplifier approaches the ideal, the common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) is used:\n$$\n\\mathrm{CMRR}=\\left|\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{dm}}}{A_{\\mathrm{cm}}}\\right|\n$$\nAn ideal difference amplifier possesses an infinite CMRR.
