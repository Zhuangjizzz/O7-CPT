Inductance, Capacitance, and Mutual Inductance

We begin this chapter by introducing the last two ideal circuit elements mentioned in Chapter 2, namely, inductors and capacitors. Be assured that the circuit analysis techniques introduced in Chapters 3 and 4 apply to circuits containing inductors and capacitors. Therefore, once you understand the terminal behavior of these elements in terms of current and voltage, you can use Kirchhoff's laws to describe any interconnections with the other basic elements. Like other components, inductors and capacitors are easier to describe in terms of circuit variables rather than electromagnetic field variables. However, before we focus on the circuit descriptions, a brief review of the field concepts underlying these basic elements is in order.

An inductor is an electrical component that opposes any change in electrical current. It is composed of a coil of wire wound around a supporting core whose material may be magnetic or nonmagnetic. The behavior of inductors is based on phenomena associated with magnetic fields. The source of the magnetic field is charge in motion, or current. If the current is varying with time, the magnetic field is varying with time. A timevarying magnetic field induces a voltage in any conductor linked by the field. The circuit parameter of inductance relates the induced voltage to the current. We discuss this quantitative relationship in Section 6.1.

A capacitor is an electrical component that consists of two conductors separated by an insulator or dielectric material. The capacitor is the only device other than a battery that can store electrical charge. The behavior of capacitors is based on phenomena associated with electric fields. The source of the electric field is separation of charge, or voltage. If the voltage is varying with time, the electric field is varying with time. A time-varying electric field produces a displacement current in the space occupied by the field. The circuit parameter of capacitance relates the displacement current to the voltage, where the displacement current is equal to the conduction current at the terminals of the capacitor. We discuss this quantitative relationship in Section 6.2.

Practical Perspective

Capacitive Touch Screens

The Practical Perspective in Chapter 3 showed how a grid of resistors is used to create a touch screen for a phone or computer monitor. But resistive touch screens have some limitations, the most important of which is that the screen can only process a single touch at any instant in time (see Problem 3.75). For example, a resistive touch screen cannot process the "pinch" gesture used by many devices to enlarge or shrink the image on the screen.

Multi-touch screens use a different component within a grid below the screen - capacitors. As you are about to
discover in this chapter, a capacitor is a circuit element whose terminal characteristics are determined by electric fields. When you touch a capacitive touch screen, you produce a change in the value of a capacitor, causing a voltage change. Once you have learned the basic behavior of capacitors and have learned how they combine in series and in parallel, we will present two possible designs for a multi-touch screen using a grid of capacitors. These designs are presented in the Practical Perspective example at the end of this chapter.

Section 6.3 describes techniques used to simplify circuits with series or parallel combinations of capacitors or inductors.

Energy can be stored in both magnetic and electric fields. Hence you should not be too surprised to learn that inductors and capacitors are capable of storing energy. For example, energy can be stored in an inductor and then released to fire a spark plug. Energy can be stored in a capacitor and then released to fire a flashbulb. In ideal inductors and capacitors, only as much energy can be extracted as has been stored. Because inductors and capacitors cannot generate energy, they are classified as passive elements.

In Sections 6.4 and 6.5 we consider the situation in which two circuits are linked by a magnetic field and thus are said to be magnetically coupled. In this case, the voltage induced in the second circuit can be related to the time-varying current in the first circuit by a parameter known as mutual inductance. The practical significance of magnetic coupling unfolds as we study the relationships between current, voltage, power, and several new parameters specific to mutual inductance. We introduce these relationships here and then describe their utility in a device called a transformer in Chapters 9 and 10.

## 6.1 The Inductor

Inductance is the circuit parameter used to describe an inductor. Inductance is symbolized by the letter $L$, is measured in henrys $(\mathrm{H})$, and is represented graphically as a coiled wire-a reminder that inductance is a consequence of a conductor linking a magnetic field. Figure 6.1(a) shows an inductor. Assigning the reference direction of the current in the direction of the voltage drop across the terminals of the inductor, as shown in Fig. 6.1(b), yields

$$
\begin{equation*}
v=L \frac{d i}{d t} \tag{6.1}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $v$ is measured in volts, $L$ in henrys, $i$ in amperes, and $t$ in seconds. Equation 6.1 reflects the passive sign convention shown in Fig. 6.1(b); that is, the current reference is in the direction of the voltage drop across the inductor. If the current reference is in the direction of the voltage rise, Eq. 6.1 is written with a minus sign.

Note from Eq. 6.1 that the voltage across the terminals of an inductor is proportional to the time rate of change of the current in the inductor. We can make two important observations here. First, if the current is constant, the voltage across the ideal inductor is zero. Thus the inductor behaves as a short circuit in the presence of a constant, or dc, current. Second, current cannot change instantaneously in an inductor; that is, the current cannot change by a finite amount in zero time. Equation 6.1 tells us that this change would require an infinite voltage, and infinite voltages are not possible. For example, when someone opens the switch on an inductive circuit in an actual system, the current initially continues to flow in the air across the switch, a phenomenon called arcing. The arc across the switch prevents the current from dropping to zero instantaneously. Switching inductive circuits is an important engineering problem, because arcing and voltage surges must be controlled to prevent equipment damage. The first step to understanding the nature of this problem is to master the introductory material presented in this and the following two chapters. Example 6.1 illustrates the application of Eq. 6.1 to a simple circuit.

### Example 6.1 Determining the Voltage, Given the Current, at the Terminals of an Inductor

The independent current source in the circuit shown in Fig. 6.2 generates zero current for $t<0$ and a pulse $10 t e^{-5 t} \mathrm{~A}$, for $t>0$.

### Current in an Inductor in Terms of the Voltage Across the Inductor

Equation 6.1 expresses the voltage across the terminals of an inductor as a function of the current in the inductor. Also desirable is the ability to express the current as a function of the voltage. To find $i$ as a function of $v$, we start by multiplying both sides of Eq. 6.1 by a differential time $d t$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
v d t=L\left(\frac{d i}{d t}\right) d t \tag{6.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

Multiplying the rate at which $i$ varies with $t$ by a differential change in time generates a differential change in $i$, so we write Eq. 6.2 as

$$
\begin{equation*}
v d t=L d i \tag{6.3}
\end{equation*}
$$

The inductor $i-v$ equation

We next integrate both sides of Eq. 6.3. For convenience, we interchange the two sides of the equation and write

$$
\begin{equation*}
L \int_{i\left(t_{0}\right)}^{i(t)} d x=\int_{t_{0}}^{t} v d \tau \tag{6.4}
\end{equation*}
$$

Note that we use $x$ and $\tau$ as the variables of integration, whereas $i$ and $t$ become limits on the integrals. Then, from Eq. 6.4,

$$
\begin{equation*}
i(t)=\frac{1}{L} \int_{t_{0}}^{t} v d \tau+i\left(t_{0}\right) \tag{6.5}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $i(t)$ is the current corresponding to $t$, and $i\left(t_{0}\right)$ is the value of the inductor current when we initiate the integration, namely, $t_{0}$. In many practical applications, $t_{0}$ is zero and Eq. 6.5 becomes

$$
\begin{equation*}
i(t)=\frac{1}{L} \int_{0}^{t} v d \tau+i(0) \tag{6.6}
\end{equation*}
$$

Equations 6.1 and 6.5 both give the relationship between the voltage and current at the terminals of an inductor. Equation 6.1 expresses the voltage as a function of current, whereas Eq. 6.5 expresses the current as a function of voltage. In both equations the reference direction for the current is in the direction of the voltage drop across the terminals. Note that $i\left(t_{0}\right)$ carries its own algebraic sign. If the initial current is in the same direction as the reference direction for $i$, it is a positive quantity. If the initial current is in the opposite direction, it is a negative quantity. Example 6.2 illustrates the application of Eq. 6.5.

### Example 6.2 Determining the Current, Given the Voltage, at the Terminals of an Inductor

The voltage pulse applied to the 100 mH inductor shown in Fig. 6.5 is 0 for $t<0$ and is given by the expression

$$
v(t)=20 t e^{-10 t} \mathrm{~V}
$$

for $t>0$. Also assume $i=0$ for $t \leq 0$.
a) Sketch the voltage as a function of time.
b) Find the inductor current as a function of time.
c) Sketch the current as a function of time.

### Solution

a) The voltage as a function of time is shown in Fig. 6.6.
b) The current in the inductor is 0 at $t=0$. Therefore, the current for $t>0$ is

$$
i=\frac{1}{0.1} \int_{0}^{t} 20 \tau e^{-10 \tau} d \tau+0
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =\left.200\left[\frac{-e^{-10 \tau}}{100}(10 \tau+1)\right]\right|_{0} ^{t}, \\
& =2\left(1-10 t e^{-10 t}-e^{-10 t}\right) \mathrm{A}, \quad t>0 .
\end{aligned}
$$

c) Figure 6.7 shows the current as a function of time.

Note in Example 6.2 that $i$ approaches a constant value of 2 A as $t$ increases. We say more about this result after discussing the energy stored in an inductor.

### Power and Energy in the Inductor

The power and energy relationships for an inductor can be derived directly from the current and voltage relationships. If the current reference is in the direction of the voltage drop across the terminals of the inductor, the power is

$$
\begin{equation*}
p=v i \tag{6.7}
\end{equation*}
$$

Remember that power is in watts, voltage is in volts, and current is in amperes. If we express the inductor voltage as a function of the inductor current, Eq. 6.7 becomes

$$
\begin{equation*}
p=L i \frac{d i}{d t} \tag{6.8}
\end{equation*}
$$

Power in an inductor

We can also express the current in terms of the voltage:

$$
\begin{equation*}
p=v\left[\frac{1}{L} \int_{t_{0}}^{t} v d \tau+i\left(t_{0}\right)\right] \tag{6.9}
\end{equation*}
$$

Equation 6.8 is useful in expressing the energy stored in the inductor. Power is the time rate of expending energy, so

$$
\begin{equation*}
p=\frac{d w}{d t}=L i \frac{d i}{d t} \tag{6.10}
\end{equation*}
$$

Multiplying both sides of Eq. 6.10 by a differential time gives the differential relationship

$$
\begin{equation*}
d w=L i d i \tag{6.11}
\end{equation*}
$$

Both sides of Eq. 6.11 are integrated with the understanding that the reference for zero energy corresponds to zero current in the inductor. Thus

$$
\begin{gather*}
\int_{0}^{w} d x=L \int_{0}^{i} y d y \\
w=\frac{1}{2} L i^{2} \tag{6.12}
\end{gather*}
$$

As before, we use different symbols of integration to avoid confusion with the limits placed on the integrals. In Eq. 6.12, the energy is in joules, inductance is in henrys, and current is in amperes. To illustrate the application of Eqs. 6.7 and 6.12, we return to Examples 6.1 and 6.2 by means of Example 6.3.

### Example 6.3 Determining the Current, Voltage, Power, and Energy for an Inductor

a) For Example 6.1, plot $i, v, p$, and $w$ versus time. Line up the plots vertically to allow easy assessment of each variable's behavior.
b) In what time interval is energy being stored in the inductor?
c) In what time interval is energy being extracted from the inductor?
d) What is the maximum energy stored in the inductor?
e) Evaluate the integrals

$$
\int_{0}^{0.2} p d t \quad \text { and } \quad \int_{0.2}^{\infty} p d t
$$

and comment on their significance.
f) Repeat (a)-(c) for Example 6.2.
g) In Example 6.2, why is there a sustained current in the inductor as the voltage approaches zero?

### Solution

a) The plots of $i, v, p$, and $w$ follow directly from the expressions for $i$ and $v$ obtained in Example 6.1 and are shown in Fig. 6.8. In particular, $p=v i$, and $w=\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) L i^{2}$.
b) An increasing energy curve indicates that energy is being stored. Thus energy is being stored in the time interval 0 to 0.2 s . Note that this corresponds to the interval when $p>0$.
c) A decreasing energy curve indicates that energy is being extracted. Thus energy is being extracted in the time interval 0.2 s to $\infty$. Note that this corresponds to the interval when $p<0$.
d) From Eq. 6.12 we see that energy is at a maximum when current is at a maximum; glancing at the graphs confirms this. From Example 6.1, maximum current $=0.736$ A. Therefore, $w_{\max }=27.07 \mathrm{~mJ}$.
e) From Example 6.1,

$$
i=10 t e^{-5 t} \mathrm{~A} \quad \text { and } \quad v=e^{-5 t}(1-5 t) \mathrm{V}
$$

Therefore,

$$
p=v i=10 t e^{-10 t}-50 t^{2} e^{-10 t} \mathrm{~W}
$$

Figure 6.8 $\triangle$ The variables $i, v, p$, and $w$ versus $t$ for Example 6.1.

Thus

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \int_{0}^{0.2} p d t=10\left[\frac{e^{-10 t}}{100}(-10 t-1)\right]_{0}^{0.2} \\
& -50\left\{\frac{t^{2} e^{-10 t}}{-10}+\frac{2}{10}\left[\frac{e^{-10 t}}{100}(-10 t-1)\right]\right\}_{0}^{0.2} \\
& =0.2 e^{-2}=27.07 \mathrm{~mJ} \text {, } \\
& \int_{0.2}^{\infty} p d t=10\left[\frac{e^{-10 t}}{100}(-10 t-1)\right]_{0.2}^{\infty} \\
& -50\left\{\frac{t^{2} e^{-10 t}}{-10}+\frac{2}{10}\left[\frac{e^{-10 t}}{100}(-10 t-1)\right]\right\}_{0.2}^{\infty} \\
& =-0.2 e^{-2}=-27.07 \mathrm{~mJ} .
\end{aligned}
$$

Based on the definition of $p$, the area under the plot of $p$ versus $t$ represents the energy expended over the interval of integration. Hence the integration of the power between 0 and 0.2 s represents the energy stored in the inductor during this time interval. The integral of $p$ over the interval $0.2 \mathrm{~s}-\infty$ is the energy extracted. Note that in this time interval, all the energy originally stored is removed; that is, after the current peak has passed, no energy is stored in the inductor.
f) The plots of $v, i, p$, and $w$ follow directly from the expressions for $v$ and $i$ given in Example 6.2 and are shown in Fig. 6.9. Note that in this case the power is always positive, and hence energy is always being stored during the voltage pulse.
g) The application of the voltage pulse stores energy in the inductor. Because the inductor is ideal, this energy cannot dissipate after the voltage subsides to zero. Therefore, a sustained current circulates in the circuit. A lossless inductor obviously is an ideal circuit element. Practical inductors require a resistor in the circuit model. (More about this later.)

Capacitor $i-v$ equation

## 6.2 The Capacitor

The circuit parameter of capacitance is represented by the letter $C$, is measured in farads ( F ), and is symbolized graphically by two short parallel conductive plates, as shown in Fig. 6.10(a). Because the farad is an extremely large quantity of capacitance, practical capacitor values usually lie in the picofarad $(\mathrm{pF})$ to microfarad $(\mu \mathrm{F})$ range.

The graphic symbol for a capacitor is a reminder that capacitance occurs whenever electrical conductors are separated by a dielectric, or insulating, material. This condition implies that electric charge is not transported through the capacitor. Although applying a voltage to the terminals of the capacitor cannot move a charge through the dielectric, it can displace a charge within the dielectric. As the voltage varies with time, the displacement of charge also varies with time, causing what is known as the displacement current.

At the terminals, the displacement current is indistinguishable from a conduction current. The current is proportional to the rate at which the voltage across the capacitor varies with time, or, mathematically,

$$
\begin{equation*}
i=C \frac{d v}{d t} \tag{6.13}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $i$ is measured in amperes, $C$ in farads, $v$ in volts, and $t$ in seconds.
Equation 6.13 reflects the passive sign convention shown in Fig. 6.10(b); that is, the current reference is in the direction of the voltage drop across the capacitor. If the current reference is in the direction of the voltage rise, Eq. 6.13 is written with a minus sign.

Two important observations follow from Eq. 6.13. First, voltage cannot change instantaneously across the terminals of a capacitor. Equation 6.13 indicates that such a change would produce infinite current, a physical impossibility. Second, if the voltage across the terminals is constant, the capacitor current is zero. The reason is that a conduction current cannot be established in the dielectric material of the capacitor. Only a time-varying voltage can produce a displacement current. Thus a capacitor behaves as an open circuit in the presence of a constant voltage.

Equation 6.13 gives the capacitor current as a function of the capacitor voltage. Expressing the voltage as a function of the current is also useful. To do so, we multiply both sides of Eq. 6.13 by a differential time $d t$ and then integrate the resulting differentials:

$$
i d t=C d v \quad \text { or } \quad \int_{v\left(t_{0}\right)}^{v(t)} d x=\frac{1}{C} \int_{t_{0}}^{t} i d \tau
$$

Carrying out the integration of the left-hand side of the second equation gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
v(t)=\frac{1}{C} \int_{t_{0}}^{t} i d \tau+v\left(t_{0}\right) \tag{6.14}
\end{equation*}
$$

$\triangle$ Capacitor $v-i$ equation

In many practical applications of Eq. 6.14, the initial time is zero; that is, $t_{0}=0$. Thus Eq. 6.14 becomes

$$
\begin{equation*}
v(t)=\frac{1}{C} \int_{0}^{t} i d \tau+v(0) \tag{6.15}
\end{equation*}
$$

We can easily derive the power and energy relationships for the capacitor. From the definition of power,

$$
\begin{equation*}
p=v i=C v \frac{d v}{d t} \tag{6.16}
\end{equation*}
$$

Capacitor power equation
or

$$
\begin{equation*}
p=i\left[\frac{1}{C} \int_{t_{0}}^{t} i d \tau+v\left(t_{0}\right)\right] \tag{6.17}
\end{equation*}
$$

Combining the definition of energy with Eq. 6.16 yields

$$
d w=C v d v
$$

from which

$$
\int_{0}^{w} d x=C \int_{0}^{v} y d y
$$

or

Capacitor energy equation

$$
\begin{equation*}
w=\frac{1}{2} C v^{2} \tag{6.18}
\end{equation*}
$$

In the derivation of Eq. 6.18, the reference for zero energy corresponds to zero voltage.

Examples 6.4 and 6.5 illustrate the application of the current, voltage, power, and energy relationships for a capacitor.

### Example 6.4 Determining Current, Voltage, Power, and Energy for a Capacitor

The voltage pulse described by the following equations is impressed across the terminals of a $0.5 \mu \mathrm{~F}$ capacitor:

$$
v(t)= \begin{cases}0, & t \leq 0 \mathrm{~s} \\ 4 t \mathrm{~V}, & 0 \mathrm{~s} \leq t \leq 1 \mathrm{~s} \\ 4 e^{-(t-1)} \mathrm{V}, & t \geq 1 \mathrm{~s}\end{cases}
$$

a) Derive the expressions for the capacitor current, power, and energy.
b) Sketch the voltage, current, power, and energy as functions of time. Line up the plots vertically.
c) Specify the interval of time when energy is being stored in the capacitor.
d) Specify the interval of time when energy is being delivered by the capacitor.
e) Evaluate the integrals

$$
\int_{0}^{1} p d t \quad \text { and } \quad \int_{1}^{\infty} p d t
$$

and comment on their significance.

### Solution

a) From Eq. 6.13,

$$
i= \begin{cases}\left(0.5 \times 10^{-6}\right)(0)=0, & t<0 \mathrm{~s} \\ \left(0.5 \times 10^{-6}\right)(4)=2 \mu \mathrm{~A}, & 0 \mathrm{~s}<t<1 \mathrm{~s} \\ \left(0.5 \times 10^{-6}\right)\left(-4 e^{-(t-1)}\right)=-2 e^{-(t-1)} \mu \mathrm{A}, & t>1 \mathrm{~s}\end{cases}
$$

The expression for the power is derived from Eq. 6.16:

$$
p= \begin{cases}0, & t \leq 0 \mathrm{~s} \\ (4 t)(2)=8 t \mu \mathrm{~W}, & 0 \mathrm{~s} \leq t<1 \mathrm{~s} \\ \left(4 e^{-(t-1)}\right)\left(-2 e^{-(t-1)}\right)=-8 e^{-2(t-1)} \mu \mathrm{W}, & t>1 \mathrm{~s}\end{cases}
$$

The energy expression follows directly from Eq. 6.18:

$$
w= \begin{cases}0, & t \leq 0 \mathrm{~s} \\ \frac{1}{2}(0.5) 16 t^{2}=4 t^{2} \mu \mathrm{~J}, & 0 \mathrm{~s} \leq t \leq 1 \mathrm{~s} \\ \frac{1}{2}(0.5) 16 e^{-2(t-1)}=4 e^{-2(t-1)} \mu \mathrm{J}, & t \geq 1 \mathrm{~s}\end{cases}
$$

b) Figure 6.11 shows the voltage, current, power, and energy as functions of time.
c) Energy is being stored in the capacitor whenever the power is positive. Hence energy is being stored in the interval $0-1 \mathrm{~s}$.
d) Energy is being delivered by the capacitor whenever the power is negative. Thus energy is being delivered for all $t$ greater than 1 s .
e) The integral of $p d t$ is the energy associated with the time interval corresponding to the limits on the integral. Thus the first integral represents the energy stored in the capacitor between 0 and 1 s , whereas the second integral represents the energy returned, or delivered, by the capacitor in the interval 1 s to $\infty$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \int_{0}^{1} p d t=\int_{0}^{1} 8 t d t=\left.4 t^{2}\right|_{0} ^{1}=4 \mu \mathrm{~J} \\
& \int_{1}^{\infty} p d t=\int_{1}^{\infty}\left(-8 e^{-2(t-1)}\right) d t=(-8)^{\left.\frac{e^{-2(t-1)}}{-2}\right|_{1} ^{\infty}=-4 \mu \mathrm{~J}}
\end{aligned}
$$

The voltage applied to the capacitor returns to zero as time increases without limit, so the energy returned by this ideal capacitor must equal the energy stored.

Figure 6.11 $\triangle$ The variables $v, i, p$, and $w$ versus $t$ for Example 6.4.

### Example 6.5 Finding $v, p$, and $w$ Induced by a Triangular Current Pulse for a Capacitor

An uncharged $0.2 \mu \mathrm{~F}$ capacitor is driven by a triangular current pulse. The current pulse is described by

$$
i(t)= \begin{cases}0, & t \leq 0 \\ 5000 t \mathrm{~A}, & 0 \leq t \leq 20 \mu \mathrm{~s} \\ 0.2-5000 t \mathrm{~A}, & 20 \leq t \leq 40 \mu \mathrm{~s} \\ 0, & t \geq 40 \mu \mathrm{~s}\end{cases}
$$

a) Derive the expressions for the capacitor voltage, power, and energy for each of the four time intervals needed to describe the current.
b) Plot $i, v, p$, and $w$ versus $t$. Align the plots as specified in the previous examples.
c) Why does a voltage remain on the capacitor after the current returns to zero?

### Solution

a) For $t \leq 0, v, p$, and $w$ all are zero.

For $0 \leq t \leq 20 \mu s$,
$v=5 \times 10^{6} \int_{0}^{t}(5000 \tau) d \tau+0=12.5 \times 10^{9} t^{2} \mathrm{~V}$,
$p=v i=62.5 \times 10^{12} t^{3} \mathrm{~W}$,
$w=\frac{1}{2} C v^{2}=15.625 \times 10^{12} t^{4} \mathrm{~J}$.
For $20 \mu \mathrm{~s} \leq t \leq 40 \mu \mathrm{~s}$,

$$
v=5 \times 10^{6} \int_{20 \mu \mathrm{~s}}^{t}(0.2-5000 \tau) d \tau+5
$$

(Note that 5 V is the voltage on the capacitor at the end of the preceding interval.) Then,

$$
\begin{aligned}
v= & \left(10^{6} t-12.5 \times 10^{9} t^{2}-10\right) \mathrm{V} \\
p= & v i \\
= & \left(62.5 \times 10^{12} t^{3}-7.5 \times 10^{9} t^{2}+2.5 \times 10^{5} t-2\right) \mathrm{W} \\
w= & \frac{1}{2} C v^{2} \\
= & \left(15.625 \times 10^{12} t^{4}-2.5 \times 10^{9} t^{3}+0.125 \times 10^{6} t^{2}\right. \\
& \left.-2 t+10^{-5}\right) \mathrm{J} \\
\text { For } t \geq & 40 \mu \mathrm{~s} \\
v= & 10 \mathrm{~V} \\
p= & v i=0 \\
w= & \frac{1}{2} C v^{2}=10 \mu \mathrm{~J}
\end{aligned}
$$

b) The excitation current and the resulting voltage, power, and energy are plotted in Fig. 6.12.
c) Note that the power is always positive for the duration of the current pulse, which means that energy is continuously being stored in the capacitor. When the current returns to zero, the stored energy is trapped because the ideal capacitor offers no means for dissipating energy. Thus a voltage remains on the capacitor after $i$ returns to zero.

## 6.3 Series-Parallel Combinations of Inductance and Capacitance

Just as series-parallel combinations of resistors can be reduced to a single equivalent resistor, series-parallel combinations of inductors or capacitors can be reduced to a single inductor or capacitor. Figure 6.13 shows inductors in series. Here, the inductors are forced to carry the same current; thus we define only one current for the series combination. The voltage drops across the individual inductors are

$$
v_{1}=L_{1} \frac{d i}{d t}, \quad v_{2}=L_{2} \frac{d i}{d t}, \quad \text { and } \quad v_{3}=L_{3} \frac{d i}{d t}
$$

The voltage across the series connection is

$$
v=v_{1}+v_{2}+v_{3}=\left(L_{1}+L_{2}+L_{3}\right) \frac{d i}{d t}
$$

from which it should be apparent that the equivalent inductance of seriesconnected inductors is the sum of the individual inductances. For $n$ inductors in series,

$$
\begin{equation*}
L_{\mathrm{eq}}=L_{1}+L_{2}+L_{3}+\cdots+L_{n} \tag{6.19}
\end{equation*}
$$

If the original inductors carry an initial current of $i\left(t_{0}\right)$, the equivalent inductor carries the same initial current. Figure 6.14 shows the equivalent circuit for series inductors carrying an initial current.

Inductors in parallel have the same terminal voltage. In the equivalent circuit, the current in each inductor is a function of the terminal voltage and the initial current in the inductor. For the three inductors in parallel shown in Fig. 6.15, the currents for the individual inductors are

$$
\begin{align*}
i_{1} & =\frac{1}{L_{1}} \int_{t_{0}}^{t} v d \tau+i_{1}\left(t_{0}\right) \\
i_{2} & =\frac{1}{L_{2}} \int_{t_{0}}^{t} v d \tau+i_{2}\left(t_{0}\right) \\
i_{3} & =\frac{1}{L_{3}} \int_{t_{0}}^{t} v d \tau+i_{3}\left(t_{0}\right) \tag{6.20}
\end{align*}
$$

The current at the terminals of the three parallel inductors is the sum of the inductor currents:

$$
\begin{equation*}
i=i_{1}+i_{2}+i_{3} \tag{6.21}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substituting Eq. 6.20 into Eq. 6.21 yields

$$
\begin{equation*}
i=\left(\frac{1}{L_{1}}+\frac{1}{L_{2}}+\frac{1}{L_{3}}\right) \int_{t_{0}}^{t} v d \tau+i_{1}\left(t_{0}\right)+i_{2}\left(t_{0}\right)+i_{3}\left(t_{0}\right) \tag{6.22}
\end{equation*}
$$

Now we can interpret Eq. 6.22 in terms of a single inductor; that is,

$$
\begin{equation*}
i=\frac{1}{L_{\mathrm{eq}}} \int_{t_{0}}^{t} v d \tau+i\left(t_{0}\right) \tag{6.23}
\end{equation*}
$$

Comparing Eq. 6.23 with (6.22) yields

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{L_{\mathrm{eq}}} & =\frac{1}{L_{1}}+\frac{1}{L_{2}}+\frac{1}{L_{3}}  \tag{6.24}\\
i\left(t_{0}\right) & =i_{1}\left(t_{0}\right)+i_{2}\left(t_{0}\right)+i_{3}\left(t_{0}\right) \tag{6.25}
\end{align*}
$$

Figure 6.16 shows the equivalent circuit for the three parallel inductors in Fig. 6.15.

The results expressed in Eqs. 6.24 and 6.25 can be extended to $n$ inductors in parallel:

$$
\begin{align*}
& \frac{1}{L_{\mathrm{eq}}}=\frac{1}{L_{1}}+\frac{1}{L_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{L_{n}}  \tag{6.26}\\
& i\left(t_{0}\right)=i_{1}\left(t_{0}\right)+i_{2}\left(t_{0}\right)+\cdots+i_{n}\left(t_{0}\right) \tag{6.27}
\end{align*}
$$

Capacitors connected in series can be reduced to a single equivalent capacitor. The reciprocal of the equivalent capacitance is equal to the sum of the reciprocals of the individual capacitances. If each capacitor carries its own initial voltage, the initial voltage on the equivalent capacitor is the algebraic sum of the initial voltages on the individual capacitors. Figure 6.17 and the following equations summarize these observations:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{C_{\mathrm{eq}}}=\frac{1}{C_{1}}+\frac{1}{C_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{C_{n}} \tag{6.28}
\end{equation*}
$$

$$
\begin{equation*}
v\left(t_{0}\right)=v_{1}\left(t_{0}\right)+v_{2}\left(t_{0}\right)+\cdots+v_{n}\left(t_{0}\right) \tag{6.29}
\end{equation*}
$$

We leave the derivation of the equivalent circuit for series-connected capacitors as an exercise. (See Problem 6.32.)

The equivalent capacitance of capacitors connected in parallel is simply the sum of the capacitances of the individual capacitors, as Fig. 6.18 and the following equation show:

$$
\begin{equation*}
C_{\mathrm{eq}}=C_{1}+C_{2}+\cdots+C_{n} \tag{6.30}
\end{equation*}
$$

Capacitors connected in parallel must carry the same voltage. Therefore, if there is an initial voltage across the original parallel capacitors, this same initial voltage appears across the equivalent capacitance $C_{\text {eq }}$. The derivation of the equivalent circuit for parallel capacitors is left as an exercise. (See Problem 6.33.)

We say more about series-parallel equivalent circuits of inductors and capacitors in Chapter 7, where we interpret results based on their use.

Figure $6.21 \triangle$ The circuit of Fig. 6.20 with dots added to the coils indicating the polarity of the mutually induced voltages.

### Dot convention for mutually coupled coils

Dot convention for mutually coupled coils (alternate)
known as mutual inductance. The circuit shown in Fig. 6.19 represents two magnetically coupled coils. The self-inductances of the two coils are labeled $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$, and the mutual inductance is labeled $M$. The doubleheaded arrow adjacent to $M$ indicates the pair of coils with this value of mutual inductance. This notation is needed particularly in circuits containing more than one pair of magnetically coupled coils.

The easiest way to analyze circuits containing mutual inductance is to use mesh currents. The problem is to write the circuit equations that describe the circuit in terms of the coil currents. First, choose the reference direction for each coil current. Figure 6.20 shows arbitrarily selected reference currents. After choosing the reference directions for $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$, sum the voltages around each closed path. Because of the mutual inductance $M$, there will be two voltages across each coil, namely, a self-induced voltage and a mutually induced voltage. The selfinduced voltage is the product of the self-inductance of the coil and the first derivative of the current in that coil. The mutually induced voltage is the product of the mutual inductance of the coils and the first derivative of the current in the other coil. Consider the coil on the left in Fig. 6.20 whose self-inductance has the value $L_{1}$. The self-induced voltage across this coil is $L_{1}\left(d i_{1} / d t\right)$ and the mutually induced voltage across this coil is $M\left(d i_{2} / d t\right)$. But what about the polarities of these two voltages?

Using the passive sign convention, the self-induced voltage is a voltage drop in the direction of the current producing the voltage. But the polarity of the mutually induced voltage depends on the way the coils are wound in relation to the reference direction of coil currents. In general, showing the details of mutually coupled windings is very cumbersome. Instead, we keep track of the polarities by a method known as the dot convention, in which a dot is placed on one terminal of each winding, as shown in Fig. 6.21. These dots carry the sign information and allow us to draw the coils schematically rather than showing how they wrap around a core structure.

The rule for using the dot convention to determine the polarity of mutually induced voltage can be summarized as follows:

When the reference direction for a current enters the dotted terminal of a coil, the reference polarity of the voltage that it induces in the other coil is positive at its dotted terminal.
Or, stated alternatively,

When the reference direction for a current leaves the dotted terminal of a coil, the reference polarity of the voltage that it induces in the other coil is negative at its dotted terminal.

For the most part, dot markings will be provided for you in the circuit diagrams in this text. The important skill is to be able to write the appropriate circuit equations given your understanding of mutual inductance and the dot convention. Figuring out where to place the polarity dots if they are not given may be possible by examining the physical configuration of an actual circuit or by testing it in the laboratory. We will discuss these procedures after we discuss the use of dot markings.

In Fig. 6.21, the dot convention rule indicates that the reference polarity for the voltage induced in coil 1 by the current $i_{2}$ is negative at the dotted terminal of coil 1 . This voltage $\left(M d i_{2} / d t\right)$ is a voltage rise with respect to $i_{1}$. The voltage induced in coil 2 by the current $i_{1}$ is $M d i_{1} / d t$, and its reference polarity is positive at the dotted terminal of coil 2 . This voltage is a voltage rise in the direction of $i_{2}$. Figure 6.22 shows the self- and mutually induced voltages across coils 1 and 2 along with their polarity marks.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_c10d55b585080950decbg-090.jpg?height=278&width=819&top_left_y=250&top_left_x=388)

Figure $6.22 \triangle$ The self- and mutually induced voltages appearing across the coils shown in Fig. 6.21.

Now let's look at the sum of the voltages around each closed loop. In Eqs. 6.31 and 6.32 , voltage rises in the reference direction of a current are negative:

$$
\begin{array}{r}
-v_{g}+i_{1} R_{1}+L_{1} \frac{d i_{1}}{d t}-M \frac{d i_{2}}{d t}=0 \\
i_{2} R_{2}+L_{2} \frac{d i_{2}}{d t}-M \frac{d i_{1}}{d t}=0 \tag{6.32}
\end{array}
$$

### The Procedure for Determining Dot Markings

We shift now to two methods of determining dot markings. The first assumes that we know the physical arrangement of the two coils and the mode of each winding in a magnetically coupled circuit. The following six steps, applied here to Fig. 6.23, determine a set of dot markings:
a) Arbitrarily select one terminal-say, the D terminal-of one coil and mark it with a dot.
b) Assign a current into the dotted terminal and label it $i_{\mathrm{D}}$.
c) Use the right-hand rule ${ }^{1}$ to determine the direction of the magnetic field established by $i_{\mathrm{D}}$ inside the coupled coils and label this field $\phi_{\mathrm{D}}$.
d) Arbitrarily pick one terminal of the second coil-say, terminal A-and assign a current into this terminal, showing the current as $i_{\mathrm{A}}$.
e) Use the right-hand rule to determine the direction of the flux established by $i_{\mathrm{A}}$ inside the coupled coils and label this flux $\phi_{\mathrm{A}}$.
f) Compare the directions of the two fluxes $\phi_{\mathrm{D}}$ and $\phi_{\mathrm{A}}$. If the fluxes have the same reference direction, place a dot on the terminal of the second coil where the test current $\left(i_{\mathrm{A}}\right)$ enters. (In Fig. 6.23, the fluxes $\phi_{\mathrm{D}}$ and $\phi_{\mathrm{A}}$ have the same reference direction, and therefore a dot goes on terminal A.) If the fluxes have different reference directions, place a dot on the terminal of the second coil where the test current leaves.

The relative polarities of magnetically coupled coils can also be determined experimentally. This capability is important because in some situations, determining how the coils are wound on the core is impossible. One experimental method is to connect a dc voltage source, a resistor, a switch, and a dc voltmeter to the pair of coils, as shown in Fig. 6.24. The shaded box covering the coils implies that physical inspection of the coils is not possible. The resistor $R$ limits the magnitude of the current supplied by the dc voltage source.

The coil terminal connected to the positive terminal of the dc source via the switch and limiting resistor receives a polarity mark, as shown in Fig. 6.24. When the switch is closed, the voltmeter deflection is observed.

### Example 6.6 Finding Mesh-Current Equations for a Circuit with Magnetically Coupled Coils

a) Write a set of mesh-current equations that describe the circuit in Fig. 6.25 in terms of the currents $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$.
b) Verify that if there is no energy stored in the circuit at $t=0$ and if $i_{\mathrm{g}}=16-16 e^{-5 t} \mathrm{~A}$, the solutions for $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$ are

$$
\begin{aligned}
& i_{1}=4+64 e^{-5 t}-68 e^{-4 t} \mathrm{~A} \\
& i_{2}=1-52 e^{-5 t}+51 e^{-4 t} \mathrm{~A}
\end{aligned}
$$

Figure 6.25 $\Delta$ The circuit for Example 6.6.

### Solution

a) Summing the voltages around the $i_{1}$ mesh yields
$4 \frac{d i_{1}}{d t}+8 \frac{d}{d t}\left(i_{g}-i_{2}\right)+20\left(i_{1}-i_{2}\right)+5\left(i_{1}-i_{g}\right)=0$.

The $i_{2}$ mesh equation is

$$
20\left(i_{2}-i_{1}\right)+60 i_{2}+16 \frac{d}{d t}\left(i_{2}-i_{g}\right)-8 \frac{d i_{1}}{d t}=0
$$

Note that the voltage across the 4 H coil due to the current $\left(i_{g}-i_{2}\right)$, that is, $8 d\left(i_{g}-i_{2}\right) / d t$, is a voltage drop in the direction of $i_{1}$. The voltage induced in the 16 H coil by the current $i_{1}$, that is, $8 d i_{1} / d t$, is a voltage rise in the direction of $i_{2}$.
b) To check the validity of $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$, we begin by testing the initial and final values of $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$. We know by hypothesis that $i_{1}(0)=i_{2}(0)=0$. From the given solutions we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& i_{1}(0)=4+64-68=0 \\
& i_{2}(0)=1-52+51=0
\end{aligned}
$$

Now we observe that as $t$ approaches infinity the source current $\left(i_{g}\right)$ approaches a constant value of 16 A , and therefore the magnetically coupled coils behave as short circuits. Hence at $t=\infty$ the circuit reduces to that shown in Fig. 6.26. From Fig. 6.26 we see that at $t=\infty$ the three resistors are in parallel across the 16 A source. The equivalent resistance is $3.75 \Omega$ and thus the voltage across the 16 A current source is 60 V . It follows that

$$
\begin{aligned}
& i_{1}(\infty)=\frac{60}{20}+\frac{60}{60}=4 \mathrm{~A} \\
& i_{2}(\infty)=\frac{60}{60}=1 \mathrm{~A}
\end{aligned}
$$

These values agree with the final values predicted by the solutions for $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$.

Finally we check the solutions by seeing if they satisfy the differential equations derived in (a). We will leave this final check to the reader via Problem 6.37.

## 6.5 A Closer Look at Mutual Inductance

In order to fully explain the circuit parameter mutual inductance, and to examine the limitations and assumptions made in the qualitative discussion presented in Section 6.4, we begin with a more quantitative description of self-inductance than was previously provided.

### A Review of Self-Inductance

The concept of inductance can be traced to Michael Faraday, who did pioneering work in this area in the early 1800s. Faraday postulated that a magnetic field consists of lines of force surrounding the current-carrying conductor. Visualize these lines of force as energy-storing elastic bands that close on themselves. As the current increases and decreases, the elastic bands (that is, the lines of force) spread and collapse about the conductor. The voltage induced in the conductor is proportional to the number of lines that collapse into, or cut, the conductor. This image of induced voltage is expressed by what is called Faraday's law; that is,

$$
\begin{equation*}
v=\frac{d \lambda}{d t} \tag{6.33}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\lambda$ is referred to as the flux linkage and is measured in weber-turns.
How do we get from Faraday's law to the definition of inductance presented in Section 6.1? We can begin to draw this connection using Fig. 6.27 as a reference.

The lines threading the $N$ turns and labeled $\phi$ represent the magnetic lines of force that make up the magnetic field. The strength of the magnetic field depends on the strength of the current, and the spatial orientation of the field depends on the direction of the current. The right-hand rule relates the orientation of the field to the direction of the current: When the fingers of the right hand are wrapped around the coil so that the fingers point in the direction of the current, the thumb points in the direction of that portion of the magnetic field inside the coil. The flux linkage is the product of the magnetic field $(\phi)$, measured in webers $(\mathrm{Wb})$, and the number of turns linked by the field $(N)$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
\lambda=N \phi \tag{6.34}
\end{equation*}
$$

The magnitude of the flux, $\phi$, is related to the magnitude of the coil current by the relationship

$$
\begin{equation*}
\phi=\mathscr{P} N i \tag{6.35}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $N$ is the number of turns on the coil, and $\mathscr{P}$ is the permeance of the space occupied by the flux. Permeance is a quantity that describes the magnetic properties of this space, and as such, a detailed discussion of permeance is outside the scope of this text. Here, we need only observe that, when the space containing the flux is made up of magnetic materials (such as iron, nickel, and cobalt), the permeance varies with the flux, giving a nonlinear relationship between $\phi$ and $i$. But when the space containing the flux is comprised of nonmagnetic materials, the permeance is constant, giving a linear relationship between $\phi$ and $i$. Note from Eq. 6.35 that the flux is also proportional to the number of turns on the coil.

Here, we assume that the core material-the space containing the fluxis nonmagnetic. Then, substituting Eqs. 6.34 and 6.35 into Eq. 6.33 yields

$$
\begin{align*}
v & =\frac{d \lambda}{d t}=\frac{d(N \phi)}{d t} \\
& =N \frac{d \phi}{d t}=N \frac{d}{d t}(\mathscr{P} N i) \\
& =N^{2} \mathscr{P} \frac{d i}{d t}=L \frac{d i}{d t} \tag{6.36}
\end{align*}
$$

which shows that self-inductance is proportional to the square of the number of turns on the coil. We make use of this observation later.

The polarity of the induced voltage in the circuit in Fig. 6.27 reflects the reaction of the field to the current creating the field. For example, when $i$ is increasing, $d i / d t$ is positive and $v$ is positive. Thus energy is required to establish the magnetic field. The product $v i$ gives the rate at which energy is stored in the field. When the field collapses, $d i / d t$ is negative, and again the polarity of the induced voltage is in opposition to the change. As the field collapses about the coil, energy is returned to the circuit.

Keeping in mind this further insight into the concept of self-inductance, we now turn back to mutual inductance.

Figure $6.28 \triangle$ Two magnetically coupled coils.

### The Concept of Mutual Inductance

Figure 6.28 shows two magnetically coupled coils. You should verify that the dot markings on the two coils agree with the direction of the coil windings and currents shown. The number of turns on each coil are $N_{1}$ and $N_{2}$, respectively. Coil 1 is energized by a time-varying current source that establishes the current $i_{1}$ in the $N_{1}$ turns. Coil 2 is not energized and is open. The coils are wound on a nonmagnetic core. The flux produced by the current $i_{1}$ can be divided into two components, labeled $\phi_{11}$ and $\phi_{21}$. The flux component $\phi_{11}$ is the flux produced by $i_{1}$ that links only the $N_{1}$ turns. The component $\phi_{21}$ is the flux produced by $i_{1}$ that links the $N_{2}$ turns and the $N_{1}$ turns. The first digit in the subscript to the flux gives the coil number, and the second digit refers to the coil current. Thus $\phi_{11}$ is a flux linking coil 1 and produced by a current in coil 1 , whereas $\phi_{21}$ is a flux linking coil 2 and produced by a current in coil 1.

The total flux linking coil 1 is $\phi_{1}$, the sum of $\phi_{11}$ and $\phi_{21}$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
\phi_{1}=\phi_{11}+\phi_{21} \tag{6.37}
\end{equation*}
$$

The flux $\phi_{1}$ and its components $\phi_{11}$ and $\phi_{21}$ are related to the coil current $i_{1}$ as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\phi_{1} & =\mathscr{P}_{1} N_{1} i_{1},  \tag{6.38}\\
\phi_{11} & =\mathscr{P}_{11} N_{1} i_{1}  \tag{6.39}\\
\phi_{21} & =\mathscr{P}_{21} N_{1} i_{1} \tag{6.40}
\end{align*}
$$

where $\mathscr{P}_{1}$ is the permeance of the space occupied by the flux $\phi_{1}, \mathscr{P}_{11}$ is the permeance of the space occupied by the flux $\phi_{11}$, and $\mathscr{P}_{21}$ is the permeance of the space occupied by the flux $\phi_{21}$. Substituting Eqs. 6.38, 6.39, and 6.40 into Eq. 6.37 yields the relationship between the permeance of the space occupied by the total flux $\phi_{1}$ and the permeances of the spaces occupied by its components $\phi_{11}$ and $\phi_{21}$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathscr{P}_{1}=\mathscr{P}_{11}+\mathscr{P}_{21} \tag{6.41}
\end{equation*}
$$

We use Faraday's law to derive expressions for $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ :

$$
\begin{align*}
v_{1} & =\frac{d \lambda_{1}}{d t}=\frac{d\left(N_{1} \phi_{1}\right)}{d t}=N_{1} \frac{d}{d t}\left(\phi_{11}+\phi_{21}\right) \\
& =N_{1}^{2}\left(\mathscr{P}_{11}+\mathscr{P}_{21}\right) \frac{d i_{1}}{d t}=N_{1}^{2} \mathscr{P}_{1} \frac{d i_{1}}{d t}=L_{1} \frac{d i_{1}}{d t} \tag{6.42}
\end{align*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{align*}
v_{2} & =\frac{d \lambda_{2}}{d t}=\frac{d\left(N_{2} \phi_{21}\right)}{d t}=N_{2} \frac{d}{d t}\left(\mathscr{P}_{21} N_{1} i_{1}\right) \\
& =N_{2} N_{1} \mathscr{P}_{21} \frac{d i_{1}}{d t} \tag{6.43}
\end{align*}
$$

The coefficient of $d i_{1} / d t$ in Eq. 6.42 is the self-inductance of coil 1. The coefficient of $d i_{1} / d t$ in Eq. 6.43 is the mutual inductance between coils 1 and 2. Thus

$$
\begin{equation*}
M_{21}=N_{2} N_{1} \mathscr{P}_{21} \tag{6.44}
\end{equation*}
$$

The subscript on $M$ specifies an inductance that relates the voltage induced in coil 2 to the current in coil 1.

The coefficient of mutual inductance gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{2}=M_{21} \frac{d i_{1}}{d t} \tag{6.45}
\end{equation*}
$$

Note that the dot convention is used to assign the polarity reference to $v_{2}$ in Fig. 6.28.

For the coupled coils in Fig. 6.28, exciting coil 2 from a time-varying current source $\left(i_{2}\right)$ and leaving coil 1 open produces the circuit arrangement
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_c10d55b585080950decbg-095.jpg?height=276&width=673&top_left_y=231&top_left_x=178)

Figure 6.29 A The magnetically coupled coils of Fig. 6.28, with coil 2 excited and coil 1 open.
shown in Fig. 6.29. Again, the polarity reference assigned to $v_{1}$ is based on the dot convention.

The total flux linking coil 2 is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\phi_{2}=\phi_{22}+\phi_{12} \tag{6.46}
\end{equation*}
$$

The flux $\phi_{2}$ and its components $\phi_{22}$ and $\phi_{12}$ are related to the coil current $i_{2}$ as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
& \phi_{2}=\mathscr{P}_{2} N_{2} i_{2},  \tag{6.47}\\
& \phi_{22}=\mathscr{P}_{22} N_{2} i_{2},  \tag{6.48}\\
& \phi_{12}=\mathscr{P}_{12} N_{2} i_{2} \tag{6.49}
\end{align*}
$$

The voltages $v_{2}$ and $v_{1}$ are

$$
\begin{gather*}
v_{2}=\frac{d \lambda_{2}}{d t}=N_{2}^{2} \mathscr{P}_{2} \frac{d i_{2}}{d t}=L_{2} \frac{d i_{2}}{d t}  \tag{6.50}\\
v_{1}=\frac{d \lambda_{1}}{d t}=\frac{d}{d t}\left(N_{1} \phi_{12}\right)=N_{1} N_{2} \mathscr{P}_{12} \frac{d i_{2}}{d t} . \tag{6.51}
\end{gather*}
$$

The coefficient of mutual inductance that relates the voltage induced in coil 1 to the time-varying current in coil 2 is the coefficient of $d i_{2} / d t$ in Eq. 6.51:

$$
\begin{equation*}
M_{12}=N_{1} N_{2} \mathscr{P}_{12} \tag{6.52}
\end{equation*}
$$

For nonmagnetic materials, the permeances $\mathscr{P}_{12}$ and $\mathscr{P}_{21}$ are equal, and therefore

$$
\begin{equation*}
M_{12}=M_{21}=M \tag{6.53}
\end{equation*}
$$

Hence for linear circuits with just two magnetically coupled coils, attaching subscripts to the coefficient of mutual inductance is not necessary.

### Mutual Inductance in Terms of Self-Inductance

The value of mutual inductance is a function of the self-inductances. We derive this relationship as follows. From Eqs. 6.42 and 6.50,

$$
\begin{align*}
& L_{1}=N_{1}^{2} \mathscr{P}_{1}  \tag{6.54}\\
& L_{2}=N_{2}^{2} \mathscr{P}_{2} \tag{6.55}
\end{align*}
$$

respectively. From Eqs. 6.54 and 6.55,

$$
\begin{equation*}
L_{1} L_{2}=N_{1}^{2} N_{2}^{2} \mathscr{P}_{1} \mathscr{P}_{2} \tag{6.56}
\end{equation*}
$$

We now use Eq. 6.41 and the corresponding expression for $\mathscr{P}_{2}$ to write

$$
\begin{equation*}
L_{1} L_{2}=N_{1}^{2} N_{2}^{2}\left(\mathscr{P}_{11}+\mathscr{P}_{21}\right)\left(\mathscr{P}_{22}+\mathscr{P}_{12}\right) \tag{6.57}
\end{equation*}
$$

But for a linear system, $\mathscr{P}_{21}=\mathscr{P}_{12}$, so Eq. 6.57 becomes

$$
\begin{align*}
L_{1} L_{2} & =\left(N_{1} N_{2} \mathscr{P}_{12}\right)^{2}\left(1+\frac{\mathscr{P}_{11}}{\mathscr{P}_{12}}\right)\left(1+\frac{\mathscr{P}_{22}}{\mathscr{P}_{12}}\right) \\
& =M^{2}\left(1+\frac{\mathscr{P}_{11}}{\mathscr{P}_{12}}\right)\left(1+\frac{\mathscr{P}_{22}}{\mathscr{P}_{12}}\right) \tag{6.58}
\end{align*}
$$

Replacing the two terms involving permeances by a single constant expresses Eq. 6.58 in a more meaningful form:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{k^{2}}=\left(1+\frac{\mathscr{P}_{11}}{\mathscr{P}_{12}}\right)\left(1+\frac{\mathscr{P}_{22}}{\mathscr{P}_{12}}\right) \tag{6.59}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substituting Eq. 6.59 into Eq. 6.58 yields

$$
M^{2}=k^{2} L_{1} L_{2}
$$

or

$$
\begin{equation*}
M=k \sqrt{L_{1} L_{2}} \tag{6.60}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the constant $k$ is called the coefficient of coupling. According to Eq. $6.59,1 / k^{2}$ must be greater than 1 , which means that $k$ must be less than 1 . In fact, the coefficient of coupling must lie between 0 and 1 , or

$$
\begin{equation*}
0 \leq k \leq 1 \tag{6.61}
\end{equation*}
$$

The coefficient of coupling is 0 when the two coils have no common flux; that is, when $\phi_{12}=\phi_{21}=0$. This condition implies that $\mathscr{P}_{12}=0$, and Eq. 6.59 indicates that $1 / k^{2}=\infty$, or $k=0$. If there is no flux linkage between the coils, obviously $M$ is 0 .

The coefficient of coupling is equal to 1 when $\phi_{11}$ and $\phi_{22}$ are 0 . This condition implies that all the flux that links coil 1 also links coil 2. In terms of Eq. $6.59, \mathscr{P}_{11}=\mathscr{P}_{22}=0$, which obviously represents an ideal state; in reality, winding two coils so that they share precisely the same flux is physically impossible. Magnetic materials (such as alloys of iron, cobalt, and nickel) create a space with high permeance and are used to establish coefficients of coupling that approach unity. (We say more about this important quality of magnetic materials in Chapter 9.)

NOTE: Assess your understanding of this material by trying Chapter Problems 6.46 and 6.50.

### Energy Calculations

We conclude our first look at mutual inductance with a discussion of the total energy stored in magnetically coupled coils. In doing so, we will confirm two observations made earlier: For linear magnetic coupling, (1) $M_{12}=M_{21}=M$, and (2) $M=k \sqrt{L_{1} L_{2}}$, where $0 \leq k \leq 1$.

4 Relating self-inductances and mutual inductance using coupling coefficient
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_c10d55b585080950decbg-097.jpg?height=267&width=450&top_left_y=210&top_left_x=290)

Figure $6.30 \triangle$ The cirund used to derive the basic energy relationships.

We use the circuit shown in Fig. 6.30 to derive the expression for the total energy stored in the magnetic fields associated with a pair of linearly coupled coils. We begin by assuming that the currents $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$ are zero and that this zero-current state corresponds to zero energy stored in the coils. Then we let $i_{1}$ increase from zero to some arbitrary value $I_{1}$ and compute the energy stored when $i_{1}=I_{1}$. Because $i_{2}=0$, the total power input into the pair of coils is $v_{1} i_{1}$, and the energy stored is

$$
\begin{gather*}
\int_{0}^{W_{1}} d w=L_{1} \int_{0}^{I_{1}} i_{1} d i_{1} \\
W_{1}=\frac{1}{2} L_{1} I_{1}^{2} \tag{6.62}
\end{gather*}
$$

Now we hold $i_{1}$ constant at $I_{1}$ and increase $i_{2}$ from zero to some arbitrary value $I_{2}$. During this time interval, the voltage induced in coil 2 by $i_{1}$ is zero because $I_{1}$ is constant. The voltage induced in coil 1 by $i_{2}$ is $M_{12} d i_{2} / d t$. Therefore, the power input to the pair of coils is

$$
p=I_{1} M_{12} \frac{d i_{2}}{d t}+i_{2} v_{2}
$$

The total energy stored in the pair of coils when $i_{2}=I_{2}$ is

$$
\int_{W_{1}}^{W} d w=\int_{0}^{I_{2}} I_{1} M_{12} d i_{2}+\int_{0}^{I_{2}} L_{2} i_{2} d i_{2}
$$

or

$$
\begin{align*}
W & =W_{1}+I_{1} I_{2} M_{12}+\frac{1}{2} L_{2} I_{2}^{2} \\
& =\frac{1}{2} L_{1} I_{1}^{2}+\frac{1}{2} L_{2} I_{2}^{2}+I_{1} I_{2} M_{12} \tag{6.63}
\end{align*}
$$

If we reverse the procedure-that is, if we first increase $i_{2}$ from zero to $I_{2}$ and then increase $i_{1}$ from zero to $I_{1}$-the total energy stored is

$$
\begin{equation*}
W=\frac{1}{2} L_{1} I_{1}^{2}+\frac{1}{2} L_{2} I_{2}^{2}+I_{1} I_{2} M_{21} \tag{6.64}
\end{equation*}
$$

Equations 6.63 and 6.64 express the total energy stored in a pair of linearly coupled coils as a function of the coil currents, the self-inductances, and the mutual inductance. Note that the only difference between these equations is the coefficient of the current product $I_{1} I_{2}$. We use Eq. 6.63 if $i_{1}$ is established first and Eq. 6.64 if $i_{2}$ is established first.

When the coupling medium is linear, the total energy stored is the same regardless of the order used to establish $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$. The reason is that in a linear coupling, the resultant magnetic flux depends only on the final values of $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$, not on how the currents reached their final values. If the resultant flux is the same, the stored energy is the same. Therefore, for linear coupling, $M_{12}=M_{21}$. Also, because $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ are arbitrary values of $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$, respectively, we represent the coil currents by their instantaneous values $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$. Thus, at any instant of time, the total energy stored in the coupled coils is

$$
\begin{equation*}
w(t)=\frac{1}{2} L_{1} i_{1}^{2}+\frac{1}{2} L_{2} i_{2}^{2}+M i_{1} i_{2} \tag{6.65}
\end{equation*}
$$

We derived Eq. 6.65 by assuming that both coil currents entered polarity-marked terminals. We leave it to you to verify that, if one current enters a polarity-marked terminal while the other leaves such a terminal, the algebraic sign of the term $M i_{1} i_{2}$ reverses. Thus, in general,

$$
\begin{equation*}
w(t)=\frac{1}{2} L_{1} i_{1}^{2}+\frac{1}{2} L_{2} i_{2}^{2} \pm M i_{1} i_{2} \tag{6.66}
\end{equation*}
$$

We use Eq. 6.66 to show that $M$ cannot exceed $\sqrt{L_{1} L_{2}}$. The magnetically coupled coils are passive elements, so the total energy stored can never be negative. If $w(t)$ can never be negative, Eq. 6.66 indicates that the quantity

$$
\frac{1}{2} L_{1} i_{1}^{2}+\frac{1}{2} L_{2} i_{2}^{2}-M i_{1} i_{2}
$$

must be greater than or equal to zero when $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$ are either both positive or both negative. The limiting value of $M$ corresponds to setting the quantity equal to zero:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{2} L_{1} i_{1}^{2}+\frac{1}{2} L_{2} i_{2}^{2}-M i_{1} i_{2}=0 \tag{6.67}
\end{equation*}
$$

To find the limiting value of $M$ we add and subtract the term $i_{1} i_{2} \sqrt{L_{1} L_{2}}$ to the left-hand side of Eq. 6.67. Doing so generates a term that is a perfect square:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left(\sqrt{\frac{L_{1}}{2}} i_{1}-\sqrt{\frac{L_{2}}{2}} i_{2}\right)^{2}+i_{1} i_{2}\left(\sqrt{L_{1} L_{2}}-M\right)=0 \tag{6.68}
\end{equation*}
$$

The squared term in Eq. 6.68 can never be negative, but it can be zero. Therefore $w(t) \geq 0$ only if

$$
\begin{equation*}
\sqrt{L_{1} L_{2}} \geq M \tag{6.69}
\end{equation*}
$$

4 Energy stored in magnetically-coupled coils
which is another way of saying that

$$
M=k \sqrt{L_{1} L_{2}} \quad(0 \leq k \leq 1)
$$

We derived Eq. 6.69 by assuming that $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$ are either both positive or both negative. However, we get the same result if $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$ are of opposite sign, because in this case we obtain the limiting value of $M$ by selecting the plus sign in Eq. 6.66.

Practical Perspective

Capacitive Touch Screens

Capacitive touch screens are often used in applications where two or more simultaneous touch points must be detected. We will discuss two designs for a multi-touch screen. The first design employs a grid of electrodes, as shown in Fig. 6.31. When energized, a small parasitic capacitance, $C_{p}$, exists between each electrode strip and ground, as shown in Fig. 6.32(a). When the screen is touched, say at the position $x, y$ on the screen, a second capacitance exists due to the transfer of a small amount of charge from the screen to the human body, which acts like a conductor. The effect is to introduce a second capacitance at the point of touch with respect to ground, as shown in Fig. 6.32(b).

Figure $6.31 \boldsymbol{\Delta}$ Multi-touch screen with grid of electrodes.

The touchscreen controller is continually monitoring the capacitance between the electrodes in the grid and ground. If the screen is not being touched, the capacitance between every electrode in the $x$-grid and ground is $C_{p}$; the same is true for the capacitance between every electrode in the $y$-grid and ground.

When the screen is touched at a single point, $C_{t}$ and $C_{p}$ combine in parallel. The equivalent capacitance between the $x$-grid electrode closest to the touch point and ground is now

$$
C_{t x}=C_{t}+C_{p}
$$

Figure 6.32 A (a) Parasitic capacitance between electrode and ground with no touch; (b) Additional capacitance introduced by a touch.

Likewise, the equivalent capacitance between the $y$-grid electrode closest to the touch point and ground is now

$$
C_{t y}=C_{t}+C_{p}
$$

Thus, a screen touch increases the capacitance between the electrodes and ground for the $x$ - and $y$-grid electrodes closest to the touch point.

Now consider what happens when there are two simultaneous points where the screen is touched. Assume that the first touch point has coordinates $x_{1}, y_{1}$ and the second touch point has coordinates $x_{2}, y_{2}$. Now there are four screen locations that correspond to an increase in capacitance: $x_{1}, y_{1} ; x_{1}, y_{2} ; x_{2}, y_{1}$; and $x_{2}, y_{2}$. Two of those screen locations match the two touch points, and the other two points are called "ghost" points, because the screen was not touched at those points. Therefore, this method for implementing a capacitive touch screen cannot accurately identify more than a single touch point.

Most modern capacitive touch screens do not use the "self-capacitance" design discussed above. Instead of measuring the capacitance between each $x$-grid electrode and ground, and each $y$-grid electrode and ground, the capacitance between each $x$-grid electrode and each $y$-grid electrode is measured. This capacitance is known as "mutual" capacitance and is shown in Fig. 6.33(a).

When the screen is touched, say at the position $x, y$ on the screen, a second capacitance again exists due to the transfer of a small amount of charge from the screen to the human body. A second capacitance exists at the point of touch with respect to ground, as shown in Fig. 6.33(b). Therefore, whenever there is a change in the mutual capacitance, $C_{m x y}$, the screen touch point can be uniquely identified as $x, y$. If the screen is touched at the points $x_{1}, y_{1}$ and $x_{2}, y_{2}$ then there will be precisely two mutual capacitances that change: $C_{m x_{1} y_{1}}$ and $C_{m x_{2} y_{2}}$. There are no "ghost"

points identified, as there were in the self-capacitance design, so the mutual capacitance design truly produces a multi-touch screen capable of identifying two or more touch points uniquely and accurately.

## Summary

- Inductance is a linear circuit parameter that relates the voltage induced by a time-varying magnetic field to the current producing the field. (See page 176.)
- Capacitance is a linear circuit parameter that relates the current induced by a time-varying electric field to the voltage producing the field. (See page 182.)
- Inductors and capacitors are passive elements; they can store and release energy, but they cannot generate or dissipate energy. (See page 176.)
- The instantaneous power at the terminals of an inductor or capacitor can be positive or negative, depending on whether energy is being delivered to or extracted from the element.
- An inductor:
- does not permit an instantaneous change in its terminal current,
- does permit an instantaneous change in its teminal voltage, and
- behaves as a short circuit in the presence of a constant terminal current. (See page 188.)
- A capacitor:
- does not permit an instantaneous change in its terminal voltage,
- does permit an instantaneous change in its terminal current, and
- behaves as an open circuit in the presence of a constant terminal voltage. (See page 183.)
- Equations for voltage, current, power, and energy in ideal inductors and capacitors are given in Table 6.1.
- Inductors in series or in parallel can be replaced by an equivalent inductor. Capacitors in series or in parallel can be replaced by an equivalent capacitor. The equations are summarized in Table 6.2. See Section 6.3 for a discussion on how to handle the initial conditions for series and parallel equivalent circuits involving inductors and capacitors.
- Mutual inductance, $M$, is the circuit parameter relating the voltage induced in one circuit to a time-varying current in another circuit. Specifically,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& v_{1}=L_{1} \frac{d i_{1}}{d t}+M_{12} \frac{d i_{2}}{d t} \\
& v_{2}=M_{21} \frac{d i_{1}}{d t}+L_{2} \frac{d i_{2}}{d t}
\end{aligned}
$$

where $v_{1}$ and $i_{1}$ are the voltage and current in circuit 1, and $v_{2}$ and $i_{2}$ are the voltage and current in circuit 2. For coils wound on nonmagnetic cores, $M_{12}=M_{21}=\mathrm{M}$. (See page 190.)

- The dot convention establishes the polarity of mutually induced voltages:

When the reference direction for a current enters the dotted terminal of a coil, the reference polarity of the voltage that it induces in the other coil is positive at its dotted terminal.
Or, alternatively,

When the reference direction for a current leaves the dotted terminal of a coil, the reference polarity of the voltage that it induces in the other coil is negative at its dotted terminal.
(See page 190.)

- The relationship between the self-inductance of each winding and the mutual inductance between windings is

$$
M=k \sqrt{L_{1} L_{2}}
$$

The coefficient of coupling, $k$, is a measure of the degree of magnetic coupling. By definition, $0 \leq k \leq 1$. (See page 197.)

- The energy stored in magnetically coupled coils in a linear medium is related to the coil currents and inductances by the relationship

$$
w=\frac{1}{2} L_{1} i_{1}^{2}+\frac{1}{2} L_{2} i_{2}^{2} \pm M i_{1} i_{2}
$$
