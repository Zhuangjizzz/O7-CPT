Rest assured that the circuit analysis techniques discussed in Chapters 3 and 4 are applicable to circuits incorporating inductors and capacitors. Therefore, once you comprehend the terminal behavior of these elements concerning current and voltage, you can employ Kirchhoff's laws to describe any interconnections with other fundamental elements. Similar to other components, inductors and capacitors are more straightforward to describe using circuit variables rather than electromagnetic field variables. However, before delving into circuit descriptions, a concise review of the field concepts underlying these basic elements is necessary.\n\nAn inductor is an electrical component that resists any change in electrical current. It consists of a coil of wire wrapped around a supporting core, which may be either magnetic or nonmagnetic. The behavior of inductors is rooted in phenomena associated with magnetic fields. The origin of the magnetic field is moving charge, or current. If the current varies over time, the magnetic field also varies. A time-varying magnetic field induces a voltage in any conductor connected by the field. The circuit parameter of inductance relates this induced voltage to the current, a relationship discussed in Section 6.1.\n\nA capacitor is an electrical component comprising two conductors separated by an insulator or dielectric material. The capacitor is the sole device, aside from a battery, capable of storing electrical charge. The behavior of capacitors is based on phenomena related to electric fields. The source of the electric field is the separation of charge, or voltage. If the voltage varies over time, the electric field also varies. A time-varying electric field generates a displacement current in the space occupied by the field. The circuit parameter of capacitance relates this displacement current to the voltage, where the displacement current equals the conduction current at the capacitor's terminals. This quantitative relationship is explored in Section 6.2.\n\n**Practical Perspective**\n\n**Capacitive Touch Screens**\n\nThe Practical Perspective in Chapter 3 illustrated how a grid of resistors is utilized to create a touch screen for phones or computer monitors. However, resistive touch screens have limitations, the most significant being their inability to process multiple touches simultaneously (refer to Problem 3.75). For instance, a resistive touch screen cannot handle the \"pinch\" gesture used by many devices to zoom in or out on an image.\n\nMulti-touch screens employ a different component within a grid beneath the screen—capacitors. As you will soon discover in this chapter, a capacitor is a circuit element whose terminal characteristics are governed by electric fields. When you touch a capacitive touch screen, you alter the capacitor's value, causing a voltage change. Once you understand the basic behavior of capacitors and how they combine in series and parallel, we will present two potential designs for a multi-touch screen using a capacitor grid. These designs are featured in the Practical Perspective example at the end of this chapter.\n\n**Image Description:**\nThe image depicts a digital tablet with a capacitive touch screen, a prevalent touchscreen technology in modern devices. The screen displays a user interface with various application icons arranged in a grid against a blue background. These icons represent different applications, such as a web browser, calculator, music player, and calendar. The top of the screen features a status bar indicating battery life, signal strength, and the current time (4:44 PM).\n\n1. **Identification of Components and Structure:**\n   - The primary component is the tablet's capacitive touch screen.\n   - The screen shows colorful application icons, each symbolizing a specific function or app.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n   - The capacitive touch screen detects changes in the electric field when touched, enabling interaction with the displayed applications.\n   - No visible physical connections or wiring are present, focusing on the screen interface.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n   - The top status bar provides essential information like time, battery status, and signal strength.\n   - Icons are distinct, clearly representing their respective applications.\n   - The bottom of the screen includes navigation arrows, indicating the ability to scroll or switch between screens or menus.\n\n**Image Description:**\nThe image shows three common hand gestures used on touch screen devices, each illustrated with a simple line drawing of a hand and directional arrows indicating movement.\n\n1. **Top Right Gesture:** A hand pinches with the thumb and index finger, moving closer together, typically used for zooming out.\n\n2. **Bottom Right Gesture:** The hand shows the thumb and index finger moving apart, usually indicating zooming in.\n\n3. **Left Gesture:** A hand with the thumb and index finger sliding downwards, often used for scrolling down or swiping.\n\nThe gestures are accompanied by red arrows showing finger movement directions and blue circles highlighting contact points on the screen, aiding in understanding basic touch screen interactions.\n\n**The Inductor $v-i$ Equation**\n**Image Description:**\n- The diagram depicts an inductor with inductance L connected between nodes N1 and N2.\n- The inductor follows the passive sign convention, with indicated voltage v and current i directions.\n\n**Figure 6.1 (a)** The graphic symbol for an inductor with an inductance of $L$ henrys. **(b)** Assigning reference voltage and current to the inductor, adhering to the passive sign convention.\n\nSection 6.3 outlines techniques for simplifying circuits with series or parallel combinations of capacitors or inductors.\n\nEnergy can be stored in both magnetic and electric fields, so it's unsurprising that inductors and capacitors can store energy. For example, an inductor can store energy and release it to fire a spark plug, while a capacitor can store energy and release it to fire a flashbulb. In ideal inductors and capacitors, only the stored energy can be extracted. Since they cannot generate energy, they are classified as passive elements.\n\nSections 6.4 and 6.5 examine the scenario where two circuits are linked by a magnetic field, termed magnetically coupled. In this case, the voltage induced in the second circuit relates to the time-varying current in the first circuit through a parameter called mutual inductance. The practical importance of magnetic coupling becomes apparent as we study the relationships between current, voltage, power, and new parameters specific to mutual inductance. We introduce these relationships here and later describe their application in a device known as a transformer in Chapters 9 and 10."

Rest assured, the circuit analysis techniques from Chapters 3 and 4 are applicable to circuits containing these elements. Therefore, once you grasp the terminal behavior of these elements concerning current and voltage, you can employ Kirchhoff's laws to describe their interconnections with other basic elements. Like other components, inductors and capacitors are more straightforward to describe using circuit variables rather than electromagnetic field variables. Nonetheless, a brief review of the field concepts underlying these elements is essential before delving into circuit descriptions.\n\nAn inductor is an electrical component that resists changes in electrical current. It consists of a coil of wire wound around a core, which may be either magnetic or nonmagnetic. The behavior of inductors is rooted in phenomena related to magnetic fields. The magnetic field's source is moving charge, or current. If the current varies over time, the magnetic field also varies. A time-varying magnetic field induces a voltage in any conductor it links. The circuit parameter of inductance connects this induced voltage to the current, a relationship discussed in Section 6.1.\n\nA capacitor is an electrical component comprising two conductors separated by an insulator or dielectric material. Besides a battery, a capacitor is the only device capable of storing electrical charge. Its behavior is based on phenomena associated with electric fields. The electric field's source is the separation of charge, or voltage. If the voltage varies over time, the electric field also varies. A time-varying electric field generates a displacement current in the field's space. The circuit parameter of capacitance relates this displacement current to the voltage, where the displacement current equals the conduction current at the capacitor's terminals. This quantitative relationship is explored in Section 6.2.\n\n**Practical Perspective**\n\n**Capacitive Touch Screens**\n\nThe Practical Perspective in Chapter 3 demonstrated how a grid of resistors is utilized to create a touch screen for phones or computer monitors. However, resistive touch screens have limitations, the most significant being their inability to process multiple touches simultaneously (refer to Problem 3.75). For instance, a resistive touch screen cannot handle the \"pinch\" gesture used to zoom in or out on many devices.\n\nMulti-touch screens employ a different component within their grid beneath the screen: capacitors. As you will soon learn in this chapter, a capacitor is a circuit element whose terminal characteristics are governed by electric fields. When you touch a capacitive touch screen, you alter a capacitor's value, causing a voltage change. After understanding the basic behavior of capacitors and how they combine in series and parallel, we will present two potential designs for a multi-touch screen using a capacitor grid.

    "text": "Inductance is a circuit parameter that characterizes an inductor. Represented by the symbol $L$, it is measured in henrys $(\\mathrm{H})$ and graphically depicted as a coiled wire, signifying that inductance arises from a conductor interacting with a magnetic field. Figure 6.1(a) illustrates an inductor. By designating the current reference direction as the direction of the voltage drop across the inductor's terminals, as depicted in Fig. 6.1(b), we derive the equation\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv=L \\frac{d i}{d t} \\tag{6.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $v$ is in volts, $L$ in henrys, $i$ in amperes, and $t$ in seconds. Equation 6.1 adheres to the passive sign convention shown in Fig. 6.1(b), indicating that the current reference aligns with the voltage drop direction. If the current reference points towards the voltage rise, Eq. 6.1 incorporates a minus sign.\n\nFrom Eq. 6.1, it is evident that the voltage across an inductor's terminals is directly proportional to the rate of change of current through it. Two key insights can be derived: Firstly, a constant current results in zero voltage across an ideal inductor, effectively behaving as a short circuit under steady-state or dc conditions. Secondly, the current in an inductor cannot change instantaneously; such a change would necessitate an infinite voltage, which is impractical. For instance, opening a switch in an inductive circuit leads to initial current flow through the air gap, known as arcing, preventing an instantaneous current drop to zero. Managing inductive circuit switching is crucial in engineering to mitigate arcing and voltage spikes that could damage equipment. Understanding this issue begins with mastering the foundational concepts outlined in this and the subsequent two chapters. Example 6.1 demonstrates the application of Eq. 6.1 to a basic circuit.\n\n#### Example 6.1 Determining the Voltage, Given the Current, at the Terminals of an Inductor\n\nThe circuit in Fig. 6.2 features an independent current source that produces zero current for $t<0$ and a pulse of $10 t e^{-5 t} \\mathrm{~A}$ for $t>0$.\nimage_name:Figure 6.2\ndescription:\n[\n'name': 'i', 'type': 'CurrentSource', 'value': 'i', 'ports': {'Np': 'b', 'Nn': 'a'\n'name': 'L1', 'type': 'Inductor', 'value': '100mH', 'ports': {'N1': 'a', 'N2': 'b'\n]\nextrainfo:The circuit comprises a current source and a 100 mH inductor in parallel.

Hence, for $t>0$, the current is calculated as:\n\n$$\ni = \\frac{1}{0.1} \\int_{0}^{t} 20 \\tau e^{-10 \\tau} d \\tau + 0\n$$\n\n$$\n= \\left. 200\\left[\\frac{-e^{-10 \\tau}}{100}(10 \\tau + 1)\\right]\\right|_{0}^{t} = 2\\left(1 - 10 t e^{-10 t} - e^{-10 t}\\right) \\mathrm{A}, \\quad t>0\n$$\n\nc) The current as a function of time is illustrated in Figure 6.7. Note that in Example 6.2, as $t$ increases, $i$ approaches a constant value of 2 A. Further discussion on this behavior is provided after the section on energy storage in an inductor.\n\n**Power and Energy in the Inductor**\n\nThe power and energy relationships for an inductor can be derived from the current-voltage relationships. If the current's reference direction is the same as the voltage drop across the inductor's terminals, the power is given by:\n\n$$\np = v i \\tag{6.7}\n$$\n\nWith power measured in watts, voltage in volts, and current in amperes, if we express the inductor's voltage as a function of current, Equation 6.7 becomes:\n\n$$\np = L i \\frac{d i}{d t} \\tag{6.8}\n$$\n\nPower in an inductor can also be expressed in terms of voltage:\n\n$$\np = v\\left[\\frac{1}{L} \\int_{t_0}^{t} v d \\tau + i(t_0)\\right] \\tag{6.9}\n$$\n\nEquation 6.8 is useful for expressing the energy stored in the inductor. Since power is the rate at which energy is expended, we have:\n\n$$\np = \\frac{d w}{d t} = L i \\frac{d i}{d t} \\tag{6.10}\n$$\n\nMultiplying both sides of Equation 6.10 by a differential time yields the differential relationship:\n\n$$\nd w = L i d i \\tag{6.11}\n$$\n\nIntegrating both sides of Equation 6.11, with the understanding that zero energy corresponds to zero current, gives:\n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{w} d x = L \\int_{0}^{i} y d y \\\\\nw = \\frac{1}{2} L i^2 \\tag{6.12}\n$$\n\nUsing different symbols for integration avoids confusion with the limits on the integrals. In Equation 6.12, energy is measured in joules, inductance in henrys, and current in amperes. Examples 6.1 and 6.2 illustrate the application of Equations 6.7 and 6.12, as discussed in Example 6.3.\n\n**Example 6.3: Determining Current, Voltage, Power, and Energy for an Inductor**\n\na) For Example 6.1, plot $i, v, p$, and $w$ versus time, aligning the plots vertically for easy comparison.\nb) Determine the time interval during which energy is stored in the inductor.\nc) Identify the time interval during which energy is extracted from the inductor.\nd) Calculate the maximum energy stored in the inductor.\ne) Evaluate the integrals\n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{0.2} p d t \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\int_{0.2}^{\\infty} p d t\n$$\n\nand discuss their significance.\nf) Repeat (a)-(c) for Example 6.2.\ng) Explain why there is a sustained current in the inductor as the voltage approaches zero in Example 6.2.\n\n**Solution:**\n\na) The plots of $i, v, p$, and $w$ are derived from the expressions for $i$ and $v$ obtained in Example 6.1 and shown in Figure 6.8. Specifically, $p = v i$ and $w = \\frac{1}{2} L i^2$.\nb) An increasing energy curve indicates energy storage, which occurs from 0 to 0.2 s. This corresponds to the interval when $p > 0$.\nc) A decreasing energy curve indicates energy extraction, which happens from 0.2 s to $\\infty$. This corresponds to the interval when $p < 0$.\nd) The maximum energy storage occurs when the current is at its maximum, as confirmed by the graphs. From Example 6.1, the maximum current is 0.736 A, leading to a maximum energy of $w_{\\max} = 27.07$ mJ.\ne) Using the expressions for $i$ and $v$ from Example 6.1,\n\n$$\ni = 10 t e^{-5 t} \\mathrm{~A} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad v = e^{-5 t}(1 - 5 t) \\mathrm{V}\n$$\n\nthe power is calculated as:\n\n$$\np = v i = 10 t e^{-10 t} - 50 t^2 e^{-10 t} \\mathrm{~W}\n$$\n\nIntegrating $p$ over the specified intervals gives the energy stored and extracted from the inductor.\n\nf) The plots of $v, i, p$, and $w$ for Example 6.2 are shown in Figure 6.9. In this case, power remains positive, indicating continuous energy storage during the voltage pulse.\n\ng) The application of the voltage pulse stores energy in the inductor. As the inductor is ideal, this energy cannot dissipate after the voltage drops to zero, leading to a sustained current. An ideal inductor is a theoretical circuit element; real-world inductors require a resistor in the circuit model (discussed later).\n\n**Figure 6.9** in Figure 6.9 shows the variables $v, i, p$, and $w$ versus $t$ for Example 6.2.\n\n**ASSESSMENT PROBLEM**\n\nObjective 1—Understand and apply the equations for voltage, current, power, and energy in an inductor.\n\n6.1 In the circuit shown, the current source generates the current pulse:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\ni_g(t) = 0, & t<0 \\\\\ni_g(t) = 8 e^{-300 t} - 8 e^{-1200 t} \\mathrm{~A}, & t \\geq 0\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n**Answer:**\n\n(a) 28.8 V;\n(b) 1.54 ms;\n(c) $-76.8 e^{-600 t} + 384 e^{-1500 t} - 307.2 e^{-2400 t} \\mathrm{~W}, t \\geq 0$;\n(d) $411.05 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$;\n(e) 32.72 W;\n(f) 1.54 ms;\n(g) 28.57 mJ.\n\n**NOTE:** Also try Chapter Problems 6.2 and 6.8.\n\n**Figure 6.10 (a)** shows the circuit symbol for a capacitor, with the voltage and current assigned according to the passive sign convention."

Given that a farad represents an exceptionally large unit of capacitance, typical capacitors in practical applications range from picofarads (pF) to microfarads ($\\mu$F).\n\nThe graphical symbol for capacitors signifies that capacitance is formed when conductive materials are separated by a dielectric, or non-conducting, material. This setup implies that electric charge does not flow through the dielectric. While applying voltage to the capacitor's terminals does not allow charge to pass through the dielectric, it does cause a displacement of charge within it. This displacement varies with the fluctuations in voltage over time, generating what is referred to as displacement current.\n\nAt the terminals, the displacement current appears identical to a conduction current. The magnitude of this current is directly proportional to how swiftly the voltage across the capacitor changes over time, which can be mathematically expressed as:\n\n$$\ni = C \\frac{d v}{d t}\n$$\n\nHere, $i$ is measured in amperes, $C$ in farads, $v$ in volts, and $t$ in seconds. Equation 6.13 adheres to the passive sign convention shown in Fig. 6.10(b), meaning the direction of the current reference is aligned with the voltage drop across the capacitor. If the current reference were aligned with the voltage rise, a negative sign would be applied to Eq. 6.13.\n\nTwo significant insights arise from Eq. 6.13. Firstly, the voltage across the capacitor's terminals cannot change abruptly. An instantaneous change would, according to the equation, result in infinite current, which is physically unfeasible. Secondly, if the voltage across the terminals is unchanging, the capacitor current is zero. This occurs because a conduction current cannot be sustained in the dielectric material of the capacitor. Only when the voltage is time-varying does a displacement current appear. Therefore, a capacitor acts as an open circuit when subjected to a constant voltage.\n\nEq. 6.13 describes the capacitor current in terms of its voltage. To express voltage as a function of current, we multiply both sides of Eq. 6.13 by a differential time $d t$ and then integrate the resulting equation:\n\n$$\ni d t = C d v \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\int_{v(t_0)}^{v(t)} d x = \\frac{1}{C} \\int_{t_0}^{t} i d \\tau\n$$\n\nUpon integrating the left-hand side of the second equation, we obtain:\n\n$$\nv(t) = \\frac{1}{C} \\int_{t_0}^{t} i d \\tau + v(t_0)\n$$\n\nThis is the capacitor $v-i$ equation.\n\nIn many practical uses of Eq. 6.14, the starting time is zero, i.e., $t_0 = 0$. Consequently, Eq. 6.14 simplifies to:\n\n$$\nv(t) = \\frac{1}{C} \\int_{0}^{t} i d \\tau + v(0)\n$$\n\nFrom this, we can derive the relationships for power and energy in a capacitor.

    "text": "The capacitance in an electrical circuit is denoted by the symbol \\( C \\) and is measured in units called farads (F). It is typically depicted graphically by two closely spaced parallel conductive plates, as seen in Fig. 6.10(a). Given that a farad represents a substantial amount of capacitance, actual capacitors usually have values in the picofarad (pF) to microfarad (\\(\\mu F\\)) range.\n\nThe symbol for a capacitor signifies that capacitance is present when electrical conductors are separated by a dielectric, or insulating, material. This arrangement indicates that electric charge does not flow through the capacitor. While applying voltage to the capacitor terminals does not allow charge to pass through the dielectric, it does cause charge to move within the dielectric. As the voltage changes over time, the movement of charge within the dielectric also changes, creating what is known as displacement current.\n\nAt the terminals of the capacitor, displacement current appears identical to conduction current. This current is proportional to the rate at which the voltage across the capacitor changes over time, which can be mathematically expressed as:\n\n\\[ i = C \\frac{dv}{dt} \\]\n\nHere, \\( i \\) is measured in amperes, \\( C \\) in farads, \\( v \\) in volts, and \\( t \\) in seconds. Equation 6.13, in accordance with the passive sign convention shown in Fig. 6.10(b), indicates that the current reference direction is that of the voltage drop across the capacitor. If the current reference were in the direction of the voltage rise, Equation 6.13 would be written with a negative sign.\n\nTwo key insights arise from Equation 6.13. Firstly, the voltage across a capacitor's terminals cannot change abruptly. Equation 6.13 suggests that such a change would result in infinite current, which is physically impossible. Secondly, if the voltage across the terminals is constant, the capacitor current is zero, as no conduction current can exist in the dielectric material of the capacitor. Only a voltage that varies with time can produce a displacement current, causing a capacitor to behave as an open circuit under steady voltage conditions.\n\nEquation 6.13 expresses the capacitor current as a function of its voltage. It is also useful to express the voltage as a function of the current. To achieve this, both sides of Equation 6.13 are multiplied by a differential time \\( dt \\) and the resulting differentials are integrated:\n\n\\[ i dt = C dv \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\int_{v(t_0)}^{v(t)} dx = \\frac{1}{C} \\int_{t_0}^{t} i d\\tau \\]\n\nPerforming the integration on the left-hand side of the second equation gives:\n\n\\[ v(t) = \\frac{1}{C} \\int_{t_0}^{t} i d\\tau + v(t_0) \\]\n\nIn many practical applications of Equation 6.14, the initial time is taken as zero, i.e., \\( t_0 = 0 \\). Therefore, Equation 6.14 simplifies to:\n\n\\[ v(t) = \\frac{1}{C} \\int_{0}^{t} i d\\tau + v(0) \\]\n\nThe power and energy relationships for the capacitor can be readily derived. From the definition of power:\n\n\\[ p = vi = Cv \\frac{dv}{dt} \\]\n\nBy combining the definition of energy with Equation 6.16, we get:\n\n\\[ dw = C v dv \\]\n\nIntegrating this expression yields:\n\n\\[ \\int_{0}^{w} dx = C \\int_{0}^{v} y dy \\]\n\nOr, the capacitor energy equation:\n\n\\[ w = \\frac{1}{2} C v^2 \\]\n\nIn deriving Equation 6.18, the zero energy reference corresponds to zero voltage.\n\nExamples 6.4 and 6.5 demonstrate the application of the current, voltage, power, and energy relationships for a capacitor."

It defines the capacitance parameter represented by \\( C \\), measured in farads (F), and visually depicted by two parallel plates. Due to the large scale of a farad, typical capacitors range from picofarads (pF) to microfarads (µF).\n\nThe graphical symbol for a capacitor signifies the presence of capacitance when conductive materials are separated by a dielectric, preventing charge transport but allowing charge displacement within the dielectric in response to voltage changes. This displacement generates a displacement current that behaves similarly to a conduction current at the terminals. The rate of voltage change across the capacitor directly influences the current, as expressed by the equation \\( i = C \\frac{d v}{d t} \\).\n\nTwo significant observations arise from this equation. First, voltage changes across a capacitor cannot be instantaneous, as it would theoretically result in infinite current, which is physically impossible. Second, with a constant voltage, the capacitor current is zero since conduction current cannot exist in the dielectric; only a time-varying voltage can produce a displacement current, making the capacitor behave as an open circuit under steady voltage.\n\nThe text also derives the relationships for voltage as a function of current, as well as power and energy equations for capacitors. The power equation \\( p = v i \\) and the energy equation \\( w = \\frac{1}{2} C v^{2} \\) are discussed, with the latter indicating that zero energy corresponds to zero voltage.\n\nThe examples provided illustrate these concepts with specific voltage pulses applied to capacitors, demonstrating the calculations for current, power, and energy, and their behaviors over time.

    "text": "To provide a comprehensive explanation of the mutual inductance in circuits and to address the constraints and suppositions within the qualitative dialogue in Section 6.4, we commence with a quantitatively precise delineation of self-inductance, building upon the initial description given.\n\nAn Examination of Self-Inductance\n\nInductance as a concept finds its roots in the groundbreaking work of Michael Faraday in the early 19th century. Faraday postulated that magnetic fields consist of force lines encircling a conductor through which current flows. Imagine these force lines as elastic bands that loop back on themselves, storing energy. As the current fluctuates, these elastic bands, or force lines, expand and contract around the conductor. The voltage generated within the conductor is proportional to the number of lines collapsing into or intersecting the conductor. This depiction of induced voltage is encapsulated in Faraday's law, expressed as:\n\n$$\nv=\\frac{d \\lambda}{d t} \\tag{6.33}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\lambda$ signifies the flux linkage and is quantified in weber-turns. Transitioning from Faraday's law to the inductance definition in Section 6.1, we can begin to draw this connection by referring to Fig. 6.27.\n\nIn Fig. 6.27, the lines passing through the $N$ turns and denoted as $\\phi$ illustrate the magnetic force lines constituting the magnetic field. The field's intensity depends on the current's strength, and its spatial orientation is dictated by the current's direction. The right-hand rule connects the field's orientation to the current's direction: wrapping the fingers of the right hand around the coil such that the fingers indicate the current's path, the thumb points in the direction of the magnetic field within the coil. Flux linkage is the product of the magnetic field $(\\phi)$, measured in webers $(\\mathrm{Wb})$, and the number of turns encompassed by the field $(N)$ :\n\n$$\n\\lambda=N \\phi \\tag{6.34}\n$$\n\nThe magnitude of the flux, $\\phi$, correlates with the coil current through the relationship\n\n$$\n\\phi=\\mathscr{P} N i \\tag{6.35}\n$$\n\nwhere $N$ represents the number of turns on the coil, and $\\mathscr{P}$ is the permeance of the space hosting the flux. Permeance is a measure of the space's magnetic characteristics, a topic beyond the scope of this text. However, we note that when the flux-containing space consists of magnetic materials (e.g., iron, nickel, and cobalt), the permeance varies with the flux, establishing a nonlinear relationship between $\\phi$ and $i$. Conversely, when the flux space is composed of nonmagnetic materials, the permeance remains constant, yielding a linear relationship between $\\phi$ and $i$. From Eq. 6.35, it's also clear that the flux is proportional to the number of turns on the coil.\n\nAssuming the core material—the space encompassing the flux—is nonmagnetic, substituting Eqs. 6.34 and 6.35 into Eq. 6.33 results in\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv &=\\frac{d \\lambda}{d t}=\\frac{d(N \\phi)}{d t} \\\\\n& =N \\frac{d \\phi}{d t}=N \\frac{d}{d t}(\\mathscr{P} N i) \\\\\n& =N^{2} \\mathscr{P} \\frac{d i}{d t}=L \\frac{d i}{d t} \\tag{6.36}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nindicating that self-inductance is proportional to the square of the number of turns on the coil—a fact we will utilize later.\n\nThe induced voltage's polarity in the circuit depicted in Fig. 6.27 mirrors the field's response to the current generating it. For instance, when $i$ is rising, $d i / d t$ is positive, and $v$ is positive. Hence, energy is required to generate the magnetic field. The product $v i$ indicates the rate at which energy is stored in the field. When the field collapses, $d i / d t$ becomes negative, and the induced voltage's polarity contradicts the change. As the field collapses around the coil, energy is fed back into the circuit.\n\nWith this deeper understanding of self-inductance, we now revisit mutual inductance.\n\nFigure 6.28 exhibits two magnetically interconnected coils. It is crucial to confirm that the dot markings on the coils align with the depicted winding directions and currents. The coils have $N_{1}$ and $N_{2}$ turns, respectively. Coil 1 is activated by a time-varying current source, establishing current $i_{1}$ through the $N_{1}$ turns. Coil 2 remains inactive and open. The coils are wound around a nonmagnetic core. The flux generated by $i_{1}$ divides into two components, denoted as $\\phi_{11}$ and $\\phi_{21}$. The $\\phi_{11}$ component is the flux produced by $i_{1}$ that interlinks only the $N_{1}$ turns. The $\\phi_{21}$ component is the flux produced by $i_{1}$ that interlinks both the $N_{2}$ and $N_{1}$ turns. The first subscript in the flux symbol indicates the coil number, while the second refers to the coil current. Hence, $\\phi_{11}$ signifies the flux interlinking coil 1 and generated by a current in coil 1, whereas $\\phi_{21}$ represents the flux interlinking coil 2 and generated by a current in coil 1.\n\nThe cumulative flux interlinking coil 1 is $\\phi_{1}$, the sum of $\\phi_{11}$ and $\\phi_{21}$ :\n\n$$\n\\phi_{1}=\\phi_{11}+\\phi_{21} \\tag{6.37}\n$$\n\nThe flux $\\phi_{1}$ and its components $\\phi_{11}$ and $\\phi_{21}$ correlate with the coil current $i_{1}$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\phi_{1} & =\\mathscr{P}_{1} N_{1} i_{1},  \\tag{6.38}\\\\\n\\phi_{11} & =\\mathscr{P}_{11} N_{1} i_{1}  \\tag{6.39}\\\\\n\\phi_{21} & =\\mathscr{P}_{21} N_{1} i_{1} \\tag{6.40}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathscr{P}_{1}$ is the permeance of the space occupied by the flux $\\phi_{1}, \\mathscr{P}_{11}$ is the permeance of the space occupied by the flux $\\phi_{11}$, and $\\mathscr{P}_{21}$ is the permeance of the space occupied by the flux $\\phi_{21}$. Substituting Eqs. 6.38, 6.39, and 6.40 into Eq. 6.37 yields the relationship between the permeance of the space occupied by the total flux $\\phi_{1}$ and the permeances of the spaces occupied by its components $\\phi_{11}$ and $\\phi_{21}$ :\n\n$$\n\\mathscr{P}_{1}=\\mathscr{P}_{11}+\\mathscr{P}_{21} \\tag{6.41}\n$$\n\nUsing Faraday's law, we derive expressions for $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv_{1} & =\\frac{d \\lambda_{1}}{d t}=\\frac{d\\left(N_{1} \\phi_{1}\\right)}{d t}=N_{1} \\frac{d}{d t}\\left(\\phi_{11}+\\phi_{21}\\right) \\\\\n& =N_{1}^{2}\\left(\\mathscr{P}_{11}+\\mathscr{P}_{21}\\right) \\frac{d i_{1}}{d t}=N_{1}^{2} \\mathscr{P}_{1} \\frac{d i_{1}}{d t}=L_{1} \\frac{d i_{1}}{d t} \\tag{6.42}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv_{2} & =\\frac{d \\lambda_{2}}{d t}=\\frac{d\\left(N_{2} \\phi_{21}\\right)}{d t}=N_{2} \\frac{d}{d t}\\left(\\mathscr{P}_{21} N_{1} i_{1}\\right) \\\\\n& =N_{2} N_{1} \\mathscr{P}_{21} \\frac{d i_{1}}{d t} \\tag{6.43}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe coefficient of $d i_{1} / d t$ in Eq. 6.42 denotes the self-inductance of coil 1.

    "text": "To delve into the concept of circuit parameter mutual inductance and to scrutinize the boundaries and presumptions outlined in the qualitative examination from Section 6.4, we initiate with a more precise depiction of self-inductance than what has been previously introduced.\n\nA Self-Inductance Recapitulation\n\nThe notion of inductance finds its roots in the groundbreaking work of Michael Faraday in the early 19th century. Faraday hypothesized that a magnetic field consists of lines of force encircling a current-carrying conductor. Imagine these lines of force as elastic bands that store energy and loop back on themselves. As the current fluctuates, these elastic bands, or lines of force, expand and contract around the conductor. The voltage induced in the conductor is directly proportional to the number of lines that collapse into, or intersect, the conductor. This visualization of induced voltage is encapsulated by Faraday's law, expressed as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv=\\frac{d \\lambda}{d t} \\tag{6.33}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\lambda$ denotes the flux linkage and is measured in weber-turns. How do we bridge the gap from Faraday's law to the definition of inductance presented in Section 6.1? We can establish this connection by referring to Fig. 6.27.\n\nThe lines weaving through the $N$ turns and denoted as $\\phi$ signify the magnetic lines of force that constitute the magnetic field. The intensity of the magnetic field is dictated by the current's strength, and the field's spatial orientation depends on the current's direction. The right-hand rule associates the field's orientation with the current's direction: When the fingers of the right hand encircle the coil such that the fingers indicate the current's direction, the thumb points towards the direction of that segment of the magnetic field within the coil. Flux linkage is the product of the magnetic field $(\\phi)$, measured in webers $(\\mathrm{Wb})$, and the number of turns intertwined by the field $(N)$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\lambda=N \\phi \\tag{6.34}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe magnitude of the flux, $\\phi$, correlates with the magnitude of the coil current through the relationship:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\phi=\\mathscr{P} N i \\tag{6.35}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHere, $N$ represents the number of turns on the coil, and $\\mathscr{P}$ denotes the permeance of the space encompassed by the flux. Permeance characterizes the magnetic attributes of this space; however, an exhaustive discussion of permeance lies beyond the scope of this text. It is sufficient to acknowledge that when the flux-containing space is composed of magnetic materials (such as iron, nickel, and cobalt), the permeance fluctuates with the flux, establishing a nonlinear relationship between $\\phi$ and $i$. Conversely, when the flux-containing space is composed of nonmagnetic materials, the permeance remains constant, establishing a linear relationship between $\\phi$ and $i$. It is also worth noting from Eq. 6.35 that the flux is directly proportional to the number of turns on the coil.\n\nHere, we postulate that the core material—the space harboring the flux—is nonmagnetic. Substituting Eqs. 6.34 and 6.35 into Eq. 6.33 yields:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv & =\\frac{d \\lambda}{d t}=\\frac{d(N \\phi)}{d t} \\\\\n& =N \\frac{d \\phi}{d t}=N \\frac{d}{d t}(\\mathscr{P} N i) \\\\\n& =N^{2} \\mathscr{P} \\frac{d i}{d t}=L \\frac{d i}{d t} \\tag{6.36}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis demonstrates that self-inductance is directly proportional to the square of the number of turns on the coil. We capitalize on this observation subsequently.\n\nThe polarity of the induced voltage in the circuit depicted in Fig. 6.27 mirrors the field's response to the current that generates it. For instance, when $i$ is ascending, $d i / d t$ is positive, and $v$ is positive. Consequently, energy is required to establish the magnetic field. The product $v i$ quantifies the rate at which energy is stored in the field. When the field collapses, $d i / d t$ is negative, and the induced voltage's polarity contradicts the change. As the field collapses around the coil, energy is reverted to the circuit.\n\nWith this enriched understanding of self-inductance, we now redirect our focus to mutual inductance.\n\n[Image Description: The circuit depicted in Figure 6.28 showcases two magnetically coupled coils, with a current source propelling the primary coil N1. The secondary coil N2 remains open and unpowered. Mutual inductance effects are symbolized by the flux lines phi11 and phi21.]\n\nFigure $6.28 \\triangle$ Two magnetically coupled coils.\n\nThe Mutual Inductance Concept\n\nFigure 6.28 portrays two magnetically coupled coils. It is crucial to confirm that the dot markings on the coils align with the winding and current directions indicated. The coils possess $N_{1}$ and $N_{2}$ turns, respectively. Coil 1 is activated by a time-varying current source, instigating the current $i_{1}$ within the $N_{1}$ turns. Coil 2 remains dormant and open. The coils are wound around a nonmagnetic core. The flux generated by the current $i_{1}$ can be segmented into two components, designated as $\\phi_{11}$ and $\\phi_{21}$. The flux component $\\phi_{11}$ is the flux generated by $i_{1}$ that exclusively links the $N_{1}$ turns. The component $\\phi_{21}$ is the flux generated by $i_{1}$ that interlinks the $N_{2}$ turns and the $N_{1}$ turns. The first digit in the subscript of the flux signifies the coil number, while the second digit pertains to the coil current. Hence, $\\phi_{11}$ denotes a flux linking coil 1 and generated by a current in coil 1, whereas $\\phi_{21}$ denotes a flux linking coil 2 and generated by a current in coil 1.\n\nThe cumulative flux linking coil 1 is $\\phi_{1}$, the sum of $\\phi_{11}$ and $\\phi_{21}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\phi_{1}=\\phi_{11}+\\phi_{21} \\tag{6.37}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe flux $\\phi_{1}$ and its components $\\phi_{11}$ and $\\phi_{21}$ correlate with the coil current $i_{1}$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\phi_{1} & =\\mathscr{P}_{1} N_{1} i_{1},  \\tag{6.38}\\\\\n\\phi_{11} & =\\mathscr{P}_{11} N_{1} i_{1}  \\tag{6.39}\\\\\n\\phi_{21} & =\\mathscr{P}_{21} N_{1} i_{1} \\tag{6.40}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\mathscr{P}_{1}$ denotes the permeance of the space occupied by the flux $\\phi_{1}$, $\\mathscr{P}_{11}$ denotes the permeance of the space occupied by the flux $\\phi_{11}$, and $\\mathscr{P}_{21}$ denotes the permeance of the space occupied by the flux $\\phi_{21}$. Incorporating Eqs. 6.38, 6.39, and 6.40 into Eq. 6.37 reveals the relationship between the permeance of the space occupied by the total flux $\\phi_{1}$ and the permeances of the spaces occupied by its components $\\phi_{11}$ and $\\phi_{21}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathscr{P}_{1}=\\mathscr{P}_{11}+\\mathscr{P}_{21} \\tag{6.41}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWe employ Faraday's law to derive expressions for $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv_{1} & =\\frac{d \\lambda_{1}}{d t}=\\frac{d\\left(N_{1} \\phi_{1}\\right)}{d t}=N_{1} \\frac{d}{d t}\\left(\\phi_{11}+\\phi_{21}\\right) \\\\\n& =N_{1}^{2}\\left(\\mathscr{P}_{11}+\\mathscr{P}_{21}\\right) \\frac{d i_{1}}{d t}=N_{1}^{2} \\mathscr{P}_{1} \\frac{d i_{1}}{d t}=L_{1} \\frac{d i_{1}}{d t} \\tag{6.42}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv_{2} & =\\frac{d \\lambda_{2}}{d t}=\\frac{d\\left(N_{2} \\phi_{21}\\right)}{d t}=N_{2} \\frac{d}{d t}\\left(\\mathscr{P}_{21} N_{1} i_{1}\\right) \\\\\n& =N_{2} N_{1} \\mathscr{P}_{21} \\frac{d i_{1}}{d t} \\tag{6.43}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe coefficient of $d i_{1} / d t$ in Eq. 6.42 corresponds to the self-inductance of coil 1. The coefficient of $d i_{1} / d t$ in Eq. 6.43 corresponds to the mutual inductance between coils 1 and 2. Therefore:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nM_{21}=N_{2} N_{1} \\mathscr{P}_{21} \\tag{6.44}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe subscript on $M$ specifies the inductance linking the voltage induced in coil 2 to the current in coil 1.\n\nThe mutual inductance coefficient yields:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{2}=M_{21} \\frac{d i_{1}}{d t} \\tag{6.45}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIt is important to note that the dot convention dictates the polarity reference assigned to $v_{2}$ in Fig. 6.28.\n\nFor the coupled coils in Fig. 6.28, stimulating coil 2 with a time-varying current source $\\left(i_{2}\\right)$ while leaving coil 1 open yields the circuit configuration presented in Fig. 6.29. Once again, the polarity reference assigned to $v_{1}$ adheres to the dot convention.\n\nThe aggregate flux linking coil 2 is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\phi_{2}=\\phi_{22}+\\phi_{12} \\tag{6.46}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe flux $\\phi_{2}$ and its components $\\phi_{22}$ and $\\phi_{12}$ correlate with the coil current $i_{2}$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& \\phi_{2}=\\mathscr{P}_{2} N_{2} i_{2},  \\tag{6.47}\\\\\n& \\phi_{22}=\\mathscr{P}_{22} N_{2} i_{2},  \\tag{6.48}\\\\\n& \\phi_{12}=\\mathscr{P}_{12} N_{2} i_{2} \\tag{6.49}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe voltages $v_{2}$ and $v_{1}$ are:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gather*}\nv_{2}=\\frac{d \\lambda_{2}}{d t}=N_{2}^{2} \\mathscr{P}_{2} \\frac{d i_{2}}{d t}=L_{2} \\frac{d i_{2}}{d t}  \\tag{6.50}\\\\\nv_{1}=\\frac{d \\lambda_{1}}{d t}=\\frac{d}{d t}\\left(N_{1} \\phi_{12}\\right)=N_{1} N_{2} \\mathscr{P}_{12} \\frac{d i_{2}}{d t} . \\tag{6.51}\n\\end{gather*}\n$$\n\nThe mutual inductance coefficient linking the voltage induced in coil 1 to the time-varying current in coil 2 is the coefficient of $d i_{2} / d t$ in Eq. 6.51:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nM_{12}=N_{1} N_{2} \\mathscr{P}_{12} \\tag{6.52}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor nonmagnetic materials, the permeances $\\mathscr{P}_{12}$ and $\\mathscr{P}_{21}$ are equivalent, and thus:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nM_{12}=M_{21}=M \\tag{6.53}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nConsequently, for linear circuits featuring only two magnetically coupled coils, designating subscripts to the mutual inductance coefficient is unnecessary.\n\nMutual Inductance in Relation to Self-Inductance\n\nThe value of mutual inductance is contingent upon the self-inductances. We derive this relationship as follows. From Eqs. 6.42 and 6.50,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& L_{1}=N_{1}^{2} \\mathscr{P}_{1}  \\tag{6.54}\\\\\n& L_{2}=N_{2}^{2} \\mathscr{P}_{2} \\tag{6.55}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nrespectively. From Eqs. 6.54 and 6.55,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nL_{1} L_{2}=N_{1}^{2} N_{2}^{2} \\mathscr{P}_{1} \\mathscr{P}_{2} \\tag{6.56}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWe now invoke Eq. 6.41 and the corresponding expression for $\\mathscr{P}_{2}$ to write:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nL_{1} L_{2}=N_{1}^{2} N_{2}^{2}\\left(\\mathscr{P}_{11}+\\mathscr{P}_{21}\\right)\\left(\\mathscr{P}_{22}+\\mathscr{P}_{12}\\right) \\tag{6.57}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHowever, for a linear system, $\\mathscr{P}_{21}=\\mathscr{P}_{12}$, rendering Eq. 6.57 as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nL_{1} L_{2} & =\\left(N_{1} N_{2} \\mathscr{P}_{12}\\right)^{2}\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathscr{P}_{11}}{\\mathscr{P}_{12}}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathscr{P}_{22}}{\\mathscr{P}_{12}}\\right) \\\\\n& =M^{2}\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathscr{P}_{11}}{\\mathscr{P}_{12}}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathscr{P}_{22}}{\\mathscr{P}_{12}}\\right) \\tag{6.58}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the permeance-related terms with a single constant transforms Eq. 6.58 into a more meaningful form:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{1}{k^{2}}=\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathscr{P}_{11}}{\\mathscr{P}_{12}}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathscr{P}_{22}}{\\mathscr{P}_{12}}\\right) \\tag{6.59}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIncorporating Eq. 6.59 into Eq. 6.58 yields:\n\n$$\nM^{2}=k^{2} L_{1} L_{2}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nM=k \\sqrt{L_{1} L_{2}} \\tag{6.60}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHere, the constant $k$ is referred to as the coupling coefficient. According to Eq. $6.59$, $1 / k^{2}$ must exceed 1, implying that $k$ must be less than 1$. In reality, the coupling coefficient must reside within the range of 0 to 1, or:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n0 \\leq k \\leq 1 \\tag{6.61}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe coupling coefficient equals 0 when the two coils exhibit no shared flux; that is, when $\\phi_{12}=\\phi_{21}=0$. This condition implies that $\\mathscr{P}_{12}=0$, and Eq. 6.59 indicates that $1 / k^{2}=\\infty$, or $k=0$. If there is no flux linkage between the coils, it follows that $M$ is 0.\n\nThe coupling coefficient equals 1 when $\\phi_{11}$ and $\\phi_{22}$ are 0. This condition implies that all the flux linking coil 1 also interlinks coil 2. In terms of Eq. $6.59$, $\\mathscr{P}_{11}=\\mathscr{P}_{22}=0$, which epitomizes an ideal state; however, physically achieving perfect flux sharing between two coils is impractical. Magnetic materials (such as alloys of iron, cobalt, and nickel) contribute to spaces with high permeance, facilitating coefficients of coupling that approximate unity. (We delve deeper into this pivotal quality of magnetic materials in Chapter 9.)\n\nPlease attempt Chapter Problems 6.46 and 6.50 to solidify your comprehension of this material.\n\nEnergy Calculations\n\nWe conclude our initial exploration of mutual inductance with an analysis of the total energy stored in magnetically coupled coils. This will validate two previously made observations: For linear magnetic coupling, (1) $M_{12}=M_{21}=M$, and (2) $M=k \\sqrt{L_{1} L_{2}}$, where $0 \\leq k \\leq 1$.\n\n[Image Description: The circuit depicted in Figure 6."

The right-hand rule connects the field's orientation to the current's direction: When the fingers of the right hand are wrapped around the coil such that the fingers indicate the current's direction, the thumb points toward the portion of the magnetic field within the coil.

Permeance characterizes the magnetic properties of this space, and its detailed discussion lies beyond this text's scope. Here, we merely note that, when the flux-containing space is composed of magnetic materials (like iron, nickel, and cobalt), the permeance fluctuates with the flux, yielding a nonlinear relationship between $\\phi$ and $i$.

Equation 6.35 also indicates that the flux is proportional to the number of loops on the coil.\n\nAssuming the core material—the space housing the flux—is nonmagnetic, substituting Eqs. 6.34 and 6.35 into Eq. 6.33 yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv & =\\frac{d \\lambda}{d t}=\\frac{d(N \\phi)}{d t} \\\\\n& =N \\frac{d \\phi}{d t}=N \\frac{d}{d t}(\\mathscr{P} N i) \\\\\n& =N^{2} \\mathscr{P} \\frac{d i}{d t}=L \\frac{d i}{d t}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis demonstrates that self-inductance is proportional to the square of the number of loops on the coil—an observation we exploit later.\n\nThe polarity of the induced electromotive force in the circuit of Fig. 6.27 mirrors the field's response to the current generating it.

    "text": "To fully elucidate the concept of circuit parameter mutual inductance and to scrutinize the limitations and assumptions outlined in Section 6.4's qualitative discourse, we commence by offering a more precise account of self-inductance than what was previously presented.\n\nInspection of Self-Inductance\n\nThe principle of inductance is an intellectual offspring of Michael Faraday, whose groundbreaking contributions in the early 1800s laid the foundation for this field. Faraday conjectured that a magnetic field encompasses lines of force that encompass the conductor through which current flows. Envision these lines as energy-storing elastic bands that contract and expand around the conductor. As the current surges or diminishes, the elastic bands (or lines of force) extend and retract around the conductor. The voltage invoked in the conductor is directly related to the count of lines that contract into or intersect the conductor. This concept of induced voltage is encapsulated in Faraday's law, which states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv=\\frac{d \\lambda}{d t} \\tag{6.33}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ denotes the flux linkage, measured in weber-turns.\n\nHow do we derive Faraday's law to arrive at the definition of inductance presented in Section 6.1? We can establish this connection by referencing Figure 6.27.\n\nThe lines passing through the $N$ turns and labeled $\\phi$ symbolize the magnetic lines of force that constitute the magnetic field. The intensity of the magnetic field hinges on the current's strength, and the spatial arrangement of the field hinges on the current's direction. The right-hand rule interconnects the field's orientation to the current's direction: When the fingers of the right hand are curled around the coil such that the fingers face the direction of the current, the thumb points toward the direction of the magnetic field within the coil. The flux linkage is the product of the magnetic field $(\\phi)$, measured in webers $(\\mathrm{Wb})$, and the number of turns intertwined by the field $(N)$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\lambda=N \\phi \\tag{6.34}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe magnitude of the flux, $\\phi$, is associated with the magnitude of the coil current via the equation:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\phi=\\mathscr{P} N i \\tag{6.35}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $N$ is the number of turns on the coil, and $\\mathscr{P}$ is the permeance of the space occupied by the flux. Permeance is a metric that delineates the magnetic characteristics of this space, and, as such, a detailed discourse on permeance is beyond the scope of this text. Nevertheless, it is pertinent to note that when the flux's space is occupied by magnetic materials (like iron, nickel, and cobalt), permeance varies with the flux, resulting in a nonlinear correlation between $\\phi$ and $i$. Conversely, when the flux's space is composed of nonmagnetic materials, permeance is constant, yielding a linear relationship between $\\phi$ and $i$. From Equation 6.35, it is evident that the flux is also proportional to the number of turns on the coil.\n\nUnder the assumption that the core material—the space harboring the flux—is nonmagnetic, substituting Equations 6.34 and 6.35 into Equation 6.33 yields:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv & =\\frac{d \\lambda}{d t}=\\frac{d(N \\phi)}{d t} \\\\\n& =N \\frac{d \\phi}{d t}=N \\frac{d}{d t}(\\mathscr{P} N i) \\\\\n& =N^{2} \\mathscr{P} \\frac{d i}{d t}=L \\frac{d i}{d t} \\tag{6.36}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhich demonstrates that self-inductance is proportional to the square of the number of turns on the coil. We will make use of this observation later.\n\nThe polarity of the induced voltage in the circuit depicted in Figure 6.27 is a reflection of the field's reaction to the current generating the field. For instance, when $i$ is ascending, $d i / d t$ is positive and $v$ is positive, indicating that energy must be exerted to establish the magnetic field. The product $v i$ conveys the rate at which energy is stored in the field. As the field collapses, $d i / d t$ is negative, and the induced voltage's polarity is once more in opposition to the change. As the field collapses around the coil, energy is returned to the circuit.\n\nWith this enhanced comprehension of self-inductance in mind, we now revert to mutual inductance."

    "text": "In exploring the concept of mutual inductance and the constraints and premises underlying the qualitative discussion in Section 6.4, we commence with a more quantitative depiction of self-inductance than was previously outlined.\n\nA Revisitation of Self-Inductance\n\nInductance traces its origins to Michael Faraday, whose groundbreaking work in the early 1800s laid its foundation. Faraday posited that a magnetic field comprises lines of force encircling the current-carrying conductor. Envision these lines of force as energy-storing elastic bands that loop back on themselves. As the current fluctuates, the elastic bands, or lines of force, expand and contract around the conductor. The voltage generated within the conductor is proportional to the number of lines that collapse into or intersect the conductor. This depiction of induced voltage is encapsulated in Faraday's law, stated as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv=\\frac{d \\lambda}{d t} \\tag{6.33}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\lambda$ denotes the flux linkage, measured in weber-turns. Our transition from Faraday's law to the definition of inductance introduced in Section 6.1 begins with reference to Fig. 6.27.\n\nThe lines threading the $N$ turns and denoted as $\\phi$ signify the magnetic lines of force constituting the magnetic field. The field's intensity depends on the current's strength, and its spatial orientation is dictated by the current's direction. The right-hand rule associates the field's orientation with the current's direction: When the fingers of the right hand encircle the coil such that they point along the current's path, the thumb indicates the direction of the magnetic field within the coil. Flux linkage is the product of the magnetic field $(\\phi)$, measured in webers $(\\mathrm{Wb})$, and the number of turns influenced by the field $(N)$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\lambda=N \\phi \\tag{6.34}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe magnitude of the flux, $\\phi$, correlates with the current through the coil's relationship:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\phi=\\mathscr{P} N i \\tag{6.35}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHere, $N$ represents the coil's number of turns, and $\\mathscr{P}$ denotes the permeance of the space occupied by the flux. Permeance characterizes the magnetic attributes of this space, and a comprehensive analysis of permeance lies beyond this text's scope. We simply note that when the flux-containing space comprises magnetic materials (e.g., iron, nickel, cobalt), the permeance fluctuates with the flux, yielding a nonlinear relationship between $\\phi$ and $i$. Conversely, when the flux-containing space consists of nonmagnetic materials, the permeance remains constant, establishing a linear relationship between $\\phi$ and $i$. Equation 6.35 also indicates that the flux is proportional to the number of turns on the coil.\n\nAssuming the core material—the space housing the flux—is nonmagnetic, substituting Eqs. 6.34 and 6.35 into Eq. 6.33 yields:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv & =\\frac{d \\lambda}{d t}=\\frac{d(N \\phi)}{d t} \\\\\n& =N \\frac{d \\phi}{d t}=N \\frac{d}{d t}(\\mathscr{P} N i) \\\\\n& =N^{2} \\mathscr{P} \\frac{d i}{d t}=L \\frac{d i}{d t} \\tag{6.36}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis demonstrates that self-inductance is proportional to the square of the number of turns on the coil, a observation we utilize subsequently.\n\nThe polarity of the induced voltage in the circuit depicted in Fig. 6.27 mirrors the field's response to the current generating it. For instance, when $i$ is rising, $d i / d t$ is positive, and $v$ is positive. Consequently, energy is necessary to establish the magnetic field. The product $v i$ quantifies the rate at which energy is stored in the field. As the field dissipates, $d i / d t$ becomes negative, and the induced voltage's polarity counters this change. As the field collapses around the coil, energy is released back into the circuit.\n\nWith this deeper understanding of self-inductance, we now revisit mutual inductance.\n\nFigure $6.28 \\triangle$ Two magnetically coupled coils.\n\nThe Concept of Mutual Inductance\n\nFigure 6.28 presents two magnetically coupled coils. It is essential to confirm that the dot markings on the coils align with the depicted winding and current directions. The coils have $N_{1}$ and $N_{2}$ turns, respectively. Coil 1 is activated by a time-varying current source, generating current $i_{1}$ in the $N_{1}$ turns. Coil 2 remains unpowered and open. The coils are wound around a nonmagnetic core. The flux generated by $i_{1}$ bifurcates into two components, labeled $\\phi_{11}$ and $\\phi_{21}$. The flux component $\\phi_{11}$ is produced by $i_{1}$ and exclusively links the $N_{1}$ turns. The component $\\phi_{21}$ is produced by $i_{1}$ and links both $N_{2}$ and $N_{1}$ turns. The subscript's first digit identifies the coil, while the second digit pertains to the coil current. Thus, $\\phi_{11}$ signifies flux linking coil 1 and generated by coil 1's current, whereas $\\phi_{21}$ represents flux linking coil 2 and generated by coil 1's current.\n\nThe total flux linking coil 1, $\\phi_{1}$, is the sum of $\\phi_{11}$ and $\\phi_{21}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\phi_{1}=\\phi_{11}+\\phi_{21} \\tag{6.37}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe flux $\\phi_{1}$ and its components $\\phi_{11}$ and $\\phi_{21}$ relate to the coil current $i_{1}$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\phi_{1} & =\\mathscr{P}_{1} N_{1} i_{1},  \\tag{6.38}\\\\\n\\phi_{11} & =\\mathscr{P}_{11} N_{1} i_{1}  \\tag{6.39}\\\\\n\\phi_{21} & =\\mathscr{P}_{21} N_{1} i_{1} \\tag{6.40}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\mathscr{P}_{1}$ denotes the permeance of the space occupied by the flux $\\phi_{1}$, $\\mathscr{P}_{11}$ represents the permeance of the space occupied by the flux $\\phi_{11}$, and $\\mathscr{P}_{21}$ signifies the permeance of the space occupied by the flux $\\phi_{21}$. Incorporating Eqs. 6.38, 6.39, and 6.40 into Eq. 6.37 establishes the relationship between the permeance of the space occupied by the total flux $\\phi_{1}$ and the permeances of the spaces occupied by its components $\\phi_{11}$ and $\\phi_{21}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathscr{P}_{1}=\\mathscr{P}_{11}+\\mathscr{P}_{21} \\tag{6.41}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWe employ Faraday's law to derive expressions for $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv_{1} & =\\frac{d \\lambda_{1}}{d t}=\\frac{d\\left(N_{1} \\phi_{1}\\right)}{d t}=N_{1} \\frac{d}{d t}\\left(\\phi_{11}+\\phi_{21}\\right) \\\\\n& =N_{1}^{2}\\left(\\mathscr{P}_{11}+\\mathscr{P}_{21}\\right) \\frac{d i_{1}}{d t}=N_{1}^{2} \\mathscr{P}_{1} \\frac{d i_{1}}{d t}=L_{1} \\frac{d i_{1}}{d t} \\tag{6.42}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv_{2} & =\\frac{d \\lambda_{2}}{d t}=\\frac{d\\left(N_{2} \\phi_{21}\\right)}{d t}=N_{2} \\frac{d}{d t}\\left(\\mathscr{P}_{21} N_{1} i_{1}\\right) \\\\\n& =N_{2} N_{1} \\mathscr{P}_{21} \\frac{d i_{1}}{d t} \\tag{6.43}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe coefficient of $d i_{1} / d t$ in Eq. 6.42 represents coil 1's self-inductance. The coefficient of $d i_{1} / d t$ in Eq. 6.43 denotes the mutual inductance between coils 1 and 2. Therefore:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nM_{21}=N_{2} N_{1} \\mathscr{P}_{21} \\tag{6.44}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe subscript on $M$ indicates an inductance linking the voltage induced in coil 2 to the current in coil 1.\n\nThe mutual inductance coefficient yields:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{2}=M_{21} \\frac{d i_{1}}{d t} \\tag{6.45}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe dot convention assigns the polarity reference to $v_{2}$ in Fig. 6.28.\n\nFor the coupled coils in Fig. 6.28, energizing coil 2 with a time-varying current source $(i_{2})$ and leaving coil 1 open yields the circuit configuration depicted in Fig. 6.29. Once again, the polarity reference assigned to $v_{1}$ adheres to the dot convention.\n\nThe total flux linking coil 2 is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\phi_{2}=\\phi_{22}+\\phi_{12} \\tag{6.46}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe flux $\\phi_{2}$ and its components $\\phi_{22}$ and $\\phi_{12}$ correlate with the coil current $i_{2}$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& \\phi_{2}=\\mathscr{P}_{2} N_{2} i_{2},  \\tag{6.47}\\\\\n& \\phi_{22}=\\mathscr{P}_{22} N_{2} i_{2},  \\tag{6.48}\\\\\n& \\phi_{12}=\\mathscr{P}_{12} N_{2} i_{2} \\tag{6.49}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe voltages $v_{2}$ and $v_{1}$ are:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gather*}\nv_{2}=\\frac{d \\lambda_{2}}{d t}=N_{2}^{2} \\mathscr{P}_{2} \\frac{d i_{2}}{d t}=L_{2} \\frac{d i_{2}}{d t}  \\tag{6.50}\\\\\nv_{1}=\\frac{d \\lambda_{1}}{d t}=\\frac{d}{d t}\\left(N_{1} \\phi_{12}\\right)=N_{1} N_{2} \\mathscr{P}_{12} \\frac{d i_{2}}{d t} . \\tag{6.51}\n\\end{gather*}\n$$\n\nThe coefficient of mutual inductance connecting the voltage induced in coil 1 to coil 2's time-varying current is the coefficient of $d i_{2} / d t$ in Eq. 6.51:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nM_{12}=N_{1} N_{2} \\mathscr{P}_{12} \\tag{6.52}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor nonmagnetic materials, the permeances $\\mathscr{P}_{12}$ and $\\mathscr{P}_{21}$ are equal, hence:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nM_{12}=M_{21}=M \\tag{6.53}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nConsequently, for linear circuits with two magnetically coupled coils, designating subscripts to the mutual inductance coefficient is unnecessary.\n\nMutual Inductance in Terms of Self-Inductance\n\nThe mutual inductance's value is a function of the self-inductances. We derive this relationship as follows. From Eqs. 6.42 and 6.50:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& L_{1}=N_{1}^{2} \\mathscr{P}_{1}  \\tag{6.54}\\\\\n& L_{2}=N_{2}^{2} \\mathscr{P}_{2} \\tag{6.55}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nrespectively. From Eqs. 6.54 and 6.55:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nL_{1} L_{2}=N_{1}^{2} N_{2}^{2} \\mathscr{P}_{1} \\mathscr{P}_{2} \\tag{6.56}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nUtilizing Eq. 6.41 and its equivalent for $\\mathscr{P}_{2}$, we write:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nL_{1} L_{2}=N_{1}^{2} N_{2}^{2}\\left(\\mathscr{P}_{11}+\\mathscr{P}_{21}\\right)\\left(\\mathscr{P}_{22}+\\mathscr{P}_{12}\\right) \\tag{6.57}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor a linear system, $\\mathscr{P}_{21}=\\mathscr{P}_{12}$, simplifying Eq. 6.57 to:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nL_{1} L_{2} & =\\left(N_{1} N_{2} \\mathscr{P}_{12}\\right)^{2}\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathscr{P}_{11}}{\\mathscr{P}_{12}}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathscr{P}_{22}}{\\mathscr{P}_{12}}\\right) \\\\\n& =M^{2}\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathscr{P}_{11}}{\\mathscr{P}_{12}}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathscr{P}_{22}}{\\mathscr{P}_{12}}\\right) \\tag{6.58}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nExpressing Eq. 6.58 in a more meaningful form by replacing the permeance terms with a single constant yields:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{1}{k^{2}}=\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathscr{P}_{11}}{\\mathscr{P}_{12}}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathscr{P}_{22}}{\\mathscr{P}_{12}}\\right) \\tag{6.59}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSubstituting Eq. 6.59 into Eq. 6.58 gives:\n\n$$\nM^{2}=k^{2} L_{1} L_{2}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nM=k \\sqrt{L_{1} L_{2}} \\tag{6.60}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHere, the constant $k$ is known as the coefficient of coupling. According to Eq. $6.59,1 / k^{2}$ must exceed 1, implying that $k$ must be less than 1$. In fact, the coefficient of coupling must fall within 0 and 1, or:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n0 \\leq k \\leq 1 \\tag{6.61}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe coefficient of coupling equals 0 when the coils share no common flux, i.e., when $\\phi_{12}=\\phi_{21}=0$. This condition implies $\\mathscr{P}_{12}=0$, leading to $1 / k^{2}=\\infty$, or $k=0$. If no flux interlinks the coils, $M$ is naturally 0.\n\nThe coefficient of coupling reaches 1 when $\\phi_{11}$ and $\\phi_{22}$ are 0. This scenario implies that all flux linking coil 1 also links coil 2. In terms of Eq. $6.59, \\mathscr{P}_{11}=\\mathscr{P}_{22}=0$, signifying an ideal condition; in reality, achieving precise flux sharing between coils is physically unattainable. Magnetic materials (such as iron, cobalt, and nickel alloys) create spaces with high permeance, enabling coefficients of coupling approaching unity. (Further insights into magnetic materials' properties are provided in Chapter 9.)\n\nEnergy Calculations\n\nWe conclude our initial exploration of mutual inductance with a discussion of the total energy stored in magnetically coupled coils. This analysis confirms two earlier observations: For linear magnetic coupling, (1) $M_{12}=M_{21}=M$, and (2) $M=k \\sqrt{L_{1} L_{2}}$, where $0 \\leq k \\leq 1$.\n\nFigure $6.30 \\triangle$ The circuit used to derive the fundamental energy relationships.\n\nWe employ the circuit depicted in Fig. 6.30 to derive the expression for the total energy stored in the magnetic fields associated with a pair of linearly coupled coils. We assume that the currents $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$ are zero, corresponding to zero energy stored in the coils. Then we allow $i_{1}$ to increase from zero to an arbitrary value $I_{1}$ and calculate the energy stored at $i_{1}=I_{1}$. Since $i_{2}=0$, the total power input into the coil pair is $v_{1} i_{1}$, and the energy stored is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gather*}\n\\int_{0}^{W_{1}} d w=L_{1} \\int_{0}^{I_{1}} i_{1} d i_{1} \\\\\nW_{1}=\\frac{1}{2} L_{"

We begin by assuming that the currents $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$ are zero, corresponding to zero energy stored in the coils. Then we allow $i_{1}$ to increase from zero to some arbitrary value $I_{1}$ and calculate the energy stored when $i_{1}=I_{1}$. Since $i_{2}=0$, the total power input into the pair of coils is $v_{1} i_{1}$, and the energy stored is:\n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{W_{1}} d w=L_{1} \\int_{0}^{I_{1}} i_{1} d i_{1}\n$$\n\n$$\nW_{1}=\\frac{1}{2} L_{1} I_{1}^{2}\n$$\n\nNow we maintain $i_{1}$ constant at $I_{1}$ and increase $i_{2}$ from zero to some arbitrary value $I_{2}$. During this time interval, the voltage induced in coil 2 by $i_{1}$ is zero because $I_{1}$ is constant. The voltage induced in coil 1 by $i_{2}$ is $M_{12} d i_{2} / d t$. Hence, the power input to the pair of coils is:\n\n$$\np=I_{1} M_{12} \\frac{d i_{2}}{d t}+i_{2} v_{2}\n$$\n\nThe total energy stored in the pair of coils when $i_{2}=I_{2}$ is:\n\n$$\n\\int_{W_{1}}^{W} d w=\\int_{0}^{I_{2}} I_{1} M_{12} d i_{2}+\\int_{0}^{I_{2}} L_{2} i_{2} d i_{2}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nW=W_{1}+I_{1} I_{2} M_{12}+\\frac{1}{2} L_{2} I_{2}^{2}=\\frac{1}{2} L_{1} I_{1}^{2}+\\frac{1}{2} L_{2} I_{2}^{2}+I_{1} I_{2} M_{12}\n$$\n\nIf we reverse the procedure—that is, if we first increase $i_{2}$ from zero to $I_{2}$ and then increase $i_{1}$ from zero to $I_{1}$—the total energy stored is:\n\n$$\nW=\\frac{1}{2} L_{1} I_{1}^{2}+\\frac{1}{2} L_{2} I_{2}^{2}+I_{1} I_{2} M_{21}\n$$\n\nEqs. 6.63 and 6.64 express the total energy stored in a pair of linearly coupled coils as a function of the coil currents, the self-inductances, and the mutual inductance.

    "text": "To fully understand and examine the mutual inductance in circuits, as well as the limitations and assumptions in Section 6.4's qualitative discussion, we need to delve into a more detailed quantitative analysis of self-inductance than we've previously provided.\n\nExploring Self-Inductance\n\nThe concept of inductance was first introduced by Michael Faraday in the early 1800s. He proposed that a magnetic field consists of lines of force encircling a current-carrying conductor. Imagine these lines of force as elastic bands that store energy and loop back on themselves. As the current fluctuates, these elastic bands, or lines of force, expand and contract around the conductor. The voltage induced in the conductor is proportional to the number of lines that collapse into or intersect the conductor. This concept of induced voltage is encapsulated in Faraday's law, expressed as:\n\n$$\nv=\\frac{d \\lambda}{d t}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\lambda$ refers to the flux linkage, measured in weber-turns.\n\nTo connect Faraday's law to the inductance definition provided in Section 6.1, we can refer to Fig. 6.27. The lines threading the $N$ turns and labeled $\\phi$ represent the magnetic lines of force that form the magnetic field. The field's strength depends on the current's strength, and its orientation depends on the current's direction. The right-hand rule connects the field's orientation to the current's direction: If the fingers of your right hand curl around the coil so that they point in the direction of the current, your thumb points in the direction of the magnetic field inside the coil. Flux linkage is the product of the magnetic field $(\\phi)$, measured in webers $(\\mathrm{Wb})$, and the number of turns linked by the field $(N)$:\n\n$$\n\\lambda=N \\phi\n$$\n\nThe magnitude of the flux, $\\phi$, is related to the coil current by:\n\n$$\n\\phi=\\mathscr{P} N i\n$$\n\nHere, $N$ is the number of turns on the coil, and $\\mathscr{P}$ is the permeance of the space occupied by the flux. Permeance describes the magnetic properties of this space, and a detailed discussion of it is beyond the scope of this text. For our purposes, it's enough to know that when the space containing the flux consists of magnetic materials (like iron, nickel, and cobalt), the permeance varies with the flux, creating a nonlinear relationship between $\\phi$ and $i$. However, when the space is filled with nonmagnetic materials, the permeance remains constant, resulting in a linear relationship between $\\phi$ and $i$. Equation 6.35 also shows that the flux is proportional to the number of turns on the coil.\n\nAssuming the core material—the space containing the flux—is nonmagnetic, substituting Eqs. 6.34 and 6.35 into Eq. 6.33 gives:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv & =\\frac{d \\lambda}{d t}=\\frac{d(N \\phi)}{d t} \\\\\n& =N \\frac{d \\phi}{d t}=N \\frac{d}{d t}(\\mathscr{P} N i) \\\\\n& =N^{2} \\mathscr{P} \\frac{d i}{d t}=L \\frac{d i}{d t}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis shows that self-inductance is proportional to the square of the number of turns on the coil. We'll use this observation later.\n\nThe polarity of the induced voltage in the circuit in Fig. 6.27 reflects the field's reaction to the current that creates it. For instance, when $i$ increases, $d i / d t$ is positive, and $v$ is positive. Thus, energy is required to establish the magnetic field. The product $v i$ represents the rate at which energy is stored in the field. When the field collapses, $d i / d t$ is negative, and the induced voltage's polarity opposes this change. As the field collapses around the coil, energy is returned to the circuit.\n\nWith this deeper understanding of self-inductance, we can now explore mutual inductance further."

    "text": "In this section, we delve into a detailed examination of the circuit parameter known as mutual inductance, building upon the foundational concepts introduced in Section 6.4. We start by providing a more precise quantitative explanation of self-inductance, which was only touched upon previously.\n\nA Quantitative Look at Self-Inductance\n\nThe principle of inductance was first postulated by Michael Faraday in the early 19th century. Faraday envisioned magnetic fields as lines of force encircling conductors through which electric current flows. Imagine these lines of force as elastic bands that loop back on themselves, storing energy. As the current fluctuates, these elastic bands, or lines of force, expand and contract around the conductor. The voltage induced in the conductor is directly proportional to the number of lines of force that converge on or intersect the conductor. This visualization of induced voltage is encapsulated in Faraday's law, mathematically expressed as:\n\n$$\nv=\\frac{d \\lambda}{d t}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\lambda$ denotes the flux linkage, measured in weber-turns.\n\nTo bridge the gap between Faraday's law and the definition of inductance introduced in Section 6.1, we can refer to Fig. 6.27.\n\nIn Fig. 6.27, the lines threading the $N$ turns and labeled $\\phi$ represent the magnetic lines of force that constitute the magnetic field. The intensity of the magnetic field depends on the current's strength, while the field's orientation is dictated by the current's direction. The right-hand rule helps to determine the field's orientation relative to the current: when the fingers of the right hand curl around the coil in the direction of the current, the thumb points in the direction of the magnetic field within the coil. Flux linkage is defined as the product of the magnetic field $(\\phi)$, measured in webers $(\\mathrm{Wb})$, and the number of turns linked by the field $(N)$:\n\n$$\n\\lambda=N \\phi\n$$\n\nThe magnitude of the flux, $\\phi$, is related to the coil current by the following relationship:\n\n$$\n\\phi=\\mathscr{P} N i\n$$\n\nHere, $N$ represents the number of turns on the coil, and $\\mathscr{P}$ is the permeance of the space occupied by the flux. Permeance is a measure of the magnetic characteristics of this space, and its detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this text. It suffices to note that when the flux-containing space is composed of magnetic materials (such as iron, nickel, and cobalt), the permeance varies with the flux, resulting in a nonlinear relationship between $\\phi$ and $i$. Conversely, when the flux-containing space is made up of nonmagnetic materials, the permeance remains constant, yielding a linear relationship between $\\phi$ and $i$. Additionally, Eq. 6.35 indicates that the flux is also proportional to the number of turns on the coil.\n\nAssuming that the core material—the space containing the flux—is nonmagnetic, substituting Eqs. 6.34 and 6.35 into Eq. 6.33 gives:\n\n$$\nv=\\frac{d \\lambda}{d t}=\\frac{d(N \\phi)}{d t}=N \\frac{d \\phi}{d t}=N \\frac{d}{d t}(\\mathscr{P} N i)=N^{2} \\mathscr{P} \\frac{d i}{d t}=L \\frac{d i}{d t}\n$$\n\nThis equation demonstrates that self-inductance is proportional to the square of the number of turns on the coil. We will make use of this observation later.\n\nThe polarity of the induced voltage in the circuit depicted in Fig. 6.27 reflects the field's response to the current that generates it. For instance, when $i$ is increasing, $d i / d t$ is positive, and $v$ is positive. Consequently, energy is required to establish the magnetic field. The product $v i$ represents the rate at which energy is stored in the field. When the field collapses, $d i / d t$ is negative, and the induced voltage's polarity opposes the change. As the field collapses around the coil, energy is returned to the circuit.\n\nArmed with this deeper understanding of self-inductance, we now turn our attention to mutual inductance.\n\nFigure 6.28 depicts two magnetically coupled coils. The dot markings on the coils should align with the direction of the windings and currents shown. The coils have $N_{1}$ and $N_{2}$ turns, respectively. Coil 1 is powered by a time-varying current source, creating a current $i_{1}$ in the $N_{1}$ turns. Coil 2 remains unpowered and open. The coils are wound around a nonmagnetic core. The flux generated by the current $i_{1}$ can be divided into two components, labeled $\\phi_{11}$ and $\\phi_{21}$. The component $\\phi_{11}$ is the flux produced by $i_{1}$ that links only the $N_{1}$ turns. The component $\\phi_{21}$ is the flux produced by $i_{1}$ that links both the $N_{2}$ turns and the $N_{1}$ turns. The first digit in the subscript of the flux denotes the coil number, while the second digit refers to the coil current. Thus, $\\phi_{11}$ is the flux linking coil 1 and produced by a current in coil 1, whereas $\\phi_{21}$ is the flux linking coil 2 and produced by a current in coil 1.\n\nThe total flux linking coil 1 is $\\phi_{1}$, the sum of $\\phi_{11}$ and $\\phi_{21}$:\n\n$$\n\\phi_{1}=\\phi_{11}+\\phi_{21}\n$$\n\nThe flux $\\phi_{1}$ and its components $\\phi_{11}$ and $\\phi_{21}$ are related to the coil current $i_{1}$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\phi_{1} & =\\mathscr{P}_{1} N_{1} i_{1}, \\\\\n\\phi_{11} & =\\mathscr{P}_{11} N_{1} i_{1}, \\\\\n\\phi_{21} & =\\mathscr{P}_{21} N_{1} i_{1}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\mathscr{P}_{1}$ is the permeance of the space occupied by the flux $\\phi_{1}$, $\\mathscr{P}_{11}$ is the permeance of the space occupied by the flux $\\phi_{11}$, and $\\mathscr{P}_{21}$ is the permeance of the space occupied by the flux $\\phi_{21}$. Substituting Eqs. 6.38, 6.39, and 6.40 into Eq. 6.37 yields the relationship between the permeance of the space occupied by the total flux $\\phi_{1}$ and the permeances of the spaces occupied by its components $\\phi_{11}$ and $\\phi_{21}$:\n\n$$\n\\mathscr{P}_{1}=\\mathscr{P}_{11}+\\mathscr{P}_{21}\n$$\n\nWe apply Faraday's law to derive expressions for $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv_{1} & =\\frac{d \\lambda_{1}}{d t}=\\frac{d\\left(N_{1} \\phi_{1}\\right)}{d t}=N_{1} \\frac{d}{d t}\\left(\\phi_{11}+\\phi_{21}\\right) \\\\\n& =N_{1}^{2}\\left(\\mathscr{P}_{11}+\\mathscr{P}_{21}\\right) \\frac{d i_{1}}{d t}=N_{1}^{2} \\mathscr{P}_{1} \\frac{d i_{1}}{d t}=L_{1} \\frac{d i_{1}}{d t}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv_{2} & =\\frac{d \\lambda_{2}}{d t}=\\frac{d\\left(N_{2} \\phi_{21}\\right)}{d t}=N_{2} \\frac{d}{d t}\\left(\\mathscr{P}_{21} N_{1} i_{1}\\right) \\\\\n& =N_{2} N_{1} \\mathscr{P}_{21} \\frac{d i_{1}}{d t}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe coefficient of $d i_{1} / d t$ in Eq. 6.42 represents the self-inductance of coil 1, while the coefficient of $d i_{1} / d t$ in Eq. 6.43 denotes the mutual inductance between coils 1 and 2. Therefore:\n\n$$\nM_{21}=N_{2} N_{1} \\mathscr{P}_{21}\n$$\n\nThe subscript on $M$ indicates an inductance that connects the voltage induced in coil 2 to the current in coil 1. The mutual inductance coefficient yields:\n\n$$\nv_{2}=M_{21} \\frac{d i_{1}}{d t}\n$$\n\nIt is important to observe the dot convention used to assign the polarity reference to $v_{2}$ in Fig. 6.28.\n\nFor the coupled coils in Fig. 6.28, exciting coil 2 with a time-varying current source $(i_{2})$ while leaving coil 1 open results in the circuit configuration depicted in Fig. 6.29. The polarity reference assigned to $v_{1}$ is based on the dot convention.\n\nThe total flux linking coil 2 is:\n\n$$\n\\phi_{2}=\\phi_{22}+\\phi_{12}\n$$\n\nThe flux $\\phi_{2}$ and its components $\\phi_{22}$ and $\\phi_{12}$ are related to the coil current $i_{2}$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\phi_{2} & =\\mathscr{P}_{2} N_{2} i_{2}, \\\\\n\\phi_{22} & =\\mathscr{P}_{22} N_{2} i_{2}, \\\\\n\\phi_{12} & =\\mathscr{P}_{12} N_{2} i_{2}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe voltages $v_{2}$ and $v_{1}$ are given by:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gather*}\nv_{2}=\\frac{d \\lambda_{2}}{d t}=N_{2}^{2} \\mathscr{P}_{2} \\frac{d i_{2}}{d t}=L_{2} \\frac{d i_{2}}{d t} \\\\\nv_{1}=\\frac{d \\lambda_{1}}{d t}=\\frac{d}{d t}\\left(N_{1} \\phi_{12}\\right)=N_{1} N_{2} \\mathscr{P}_{12} \\frac{d i_{2}}{d t}\n\\end{gather*}\n$$\n\nThe coefficient of mutual inductance that connects the voltage induced in coil 1 to the time-varying current in coil 2 is the coefficient of $d i_{2} / d t$ in Eq. 6.51:\n\n$$\nM_{12}=N_{1} N_{2} \\mathscr{P}_{12}\n$$\n\nFor nonmagnetic materials, the permeances $\\mathscr{P}_{12}$ and $\\mathscr{P}_{21}$ are equal, leading to:\n\n$$\nM_{12}=M_{21}=M\n$$\n\nThus, in linear circuits with only two magnetically coupled coils, it is unnecessary to assign subscripts to the mutual inductance coefficient.\n\nExpressing Mutual Inductance in Terms of Self-Inductance\n\nThe value of mutual inductance is a function of the self-inductances. We derive this relationship as follows. From Eqs. 6.42 and 6.50:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nL_{1} & =N_{1}^{2} \\mathscr{P}_{1}, \\\\\nL_{2} & =N_{2}^{2} \\mathscr{P}_{2}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nrespectively. From Eqs. 6.54 and 6.55:\n\n$$\nL_{1} L_{2}=N_{1}^{2} N_{2}^{2} \\mathscr{P}_{1} \\mathscr{P}_{2}\n$$\n\nWe now use Eq. 6.41 and the corresponding expression for $\\mathscr{P}_{2}$ to write:\n\n$$\nL_{1} L_{2}=N_{1}^{2} N_{2}^{2}\\left(\\mathscr{P}_{11}+\\mathscr{P}_{21}\\right)\\left(\\mathscr{P}_{22}+\\mathscr{P}_{12}\\right)\n$$\n\nFor a linear system, $\\mathscr{P}_{21}=\\mathscr{P}_{12}$, so Eq. 6.57 simplifies to:\n\n$$\nL_{1} L_{2}=\\left(N_{1} N_{2} \\mathscr{P}_{12}\\right)^{2}\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathscr{P}_{11}}{\\mathscr{P}_{12}}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathscr{P}_{22}}{\\mathscr{P}_{12}}\\right)\n$$\n\nBy replacing the two permeance terms with a single constant, we express Eq. 6.58 in a more meaningful form:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{k^{2}}=\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathscr{P}_{11}}{\\mathscr{P}_{12}}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathscr{P}_{22}}{\\mathscr{P}_{12}}\\right)\n$$\n\nSubstituting Eq. 6.59 into Eq. 6.58 yields:\n\n$$\nM^{2}=k^{2} L_{1} L_{2}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nM=k \\sqrt{L_{1} L_{2}}\n$$\n\nwhere the constant $k$ is known as the coefficient of coupling.

(We will explore this important quality of magnetic materials further in Chapter 9.)\n\nEnergy Calculations\n\nWe conclude our initial exploration of mutual inductance with a discussion of the total energy stored in magnetically coupled coils. This will confirm two earlier observations: for linear magnetic coupling, (1) $M_{12}=M_{21}=M$, and (2) $M=k \\sqrt{L_{1} L_{2}}$, where $0 \\leq k \\leq 1$.\n\nWe use the circuit shown in Fig. 6.30 to derive the expression for the total energy stored in the magnetic fields associated with a pair of linearly coupled coils. We begin by assuming that the currents $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$ are zero and that this zero-current state corresponds to zero energy stored in the coils. Then we let $i_{1}$ increase from zero to some arbitrary value $I_{1}$ and calculate the energy stored when $i_{1}=I_{1}$. Since $i_{2}=0$, the total power input into the pair of coils is $v_{1} i_{1}$, and the energy stored is:\n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{W_{1}} d w=L_{1} \\int_{0}^{I_{1}} i_{1} d i_{1}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nW_{1}=\\frac{1}{2} L_{1} I_{1}^{2}\n$$\n\nNow we hold $i_{1}$ constant at $I_{1}$ and increase $i_{2}$ from zero to some arbitrary value $I_{2}$.

    "text": "The exploration of mutual inductance in a circuit requires a deeper dive into the self-inductance concept, building upon the initial qualitative discussion from Section 6.4. We delve into a more precise mathematical depiction of self-inductance.\n\nUnderstanding Self-Inductance\n\nInductance, a cornerstone of electromagnetic theory, has its roots in the groundbreaking work of Michael Faraday in the early 19th century. Faraday postulated that a magnetic field consists of force lines enveloping a current-carrying conductor. Imagine these force lines as elastic bands storing energy, looping back on themselves. As the current fluctuates, these bands stretch and contract around the conductor. The voltage induced in the conductor is proportional to the number of lines collapsing into or intersecting the conductor, encapsulated in Faraday's law:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv=\\frac{d \\lambda}{d t} \\tag{6.33}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\lambda$ represents the flux linkage, measured in weber-turns.\n\nTo bridge Faraday's law to the inductance definition in Section 6.1, we reference Fig. 6.27.\n\nThe lines threading the $N$ turns and labeled $\\phi$ illustrate the magnetic force lines constituting the magnetic field. The field's intensity depends on the current's strength, and its orientation hinges on the current's direction. The right-hand rule associates field orientation with current direction: curling the fingers of your right hand around the coil such that your fingers follow the current direction, your thumb points inward, indicating the magnetic field direction within the coil. Flux linkage is the product of the magnetic field $(\\phi)$, measured in webers $(\\mathrm{Wb})$, and the number of turns encompassed by the field $(N)$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\lambda=N \\phi \\tag{6.34}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe magnitude of flux, $\\phi$, relates to the coil current via:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\phi=\\mathscr{P} N i \\tag{6.35}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $N$ is the coil's turn count, and $\\mathscr{P}$ is the permeance of the space occupied by the flux. Permeance characterizes the magnetic attributes of this space; a detailed discussion is beyond our scope. We note that, in magnetic material environments (like iron, nickel, and cobalt), permeance varies with flux, creating a nonlinear $\\phi$-$i$ relationship. Conversely, in nonmagnetic material environments, permeance remains constant, leading to a linear $\\phi$-$i$ relationship. Equation 6.35 also indicates that flux is proportional to the number of coil turns.\n\nAssuming a nonmagnetic core, substituting Equations 6.34 and 6.35 into Equation 6.33 yields:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv & =\\frac{d \\lambda}{d t}=\\frac{d(N \\phi)}{d t} \\\\\n& =N \\frac{d \\phi}{d t}=N \\frac{d}{d t}(\\mathscr{P} N i) \\\\\n& =N^{2} \\mathscr{P} \\frac{d i}{d t}=L \\frac{d i}{d t} \\tag{6.36}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis demonstrates that self-inductance is proportional to the square of the number of turns. This insight is pivotal for subsequent discussions.\n\nThe induced voltage polarity in the circuit of Fig. 6.27 mirrors the field's response to the current generating it. For instance, if $i$ increases, $d i / d t$ is positive, and $v$ is positive, necessitating energy input to establish the magnetic field. The product $v i$ reflects the energy storage rate in the field. When the field collapses, $d i / d t$ becomes negative, and the induced voltage polarity opposes the change. As the field collapses around the coil, energy is released back into the circuit.\n\nWith a refined grasp of self-inductance, we now revisit mutual inductance.\n\nimage_name:Figure 6.28\ndescription:Two magnetically coupled coils are depicted, with a current source driving the primary coil N1. The secondary coil N2 is open and unpowered. Mutual inductance effects are visualized through flux lines phi11 and phi21.\n\nFigure $6.28 \\triangle$ Two magnetically coupled coils.\n\nUnderstandingual Inductance Explained\n\nFigure 6.28 showcases two magnetically coupled coils. The dot markings on the coils should align with the winding and current directions. The coils have $N_{1}$ and $N_{2}$ turns, respectively. Coil 1 is activated by a time-varying current source, generating current $i_{1}$ in the $N_{1}$ turns. Coil 2 remains unpowered and open. The coils are wound around a nonmagnetic core. The flux generated by $i_{1}$ splits into two components, labeled $\\phi_{11}$ and $\\phi_{21}$. The $\\phi_{11}$ component is the flux produced by $i_{1}$ that links solely the $N_{1}$ turns. The $\\phi_{21}$ component links both the $N_{2}$ and $N_{1}$ turns. The flux subscript's first digit denotes the coil number, and the second digit indicates the coil current. Thus, $\\phi_{11}$ links coil 1 and is produced by coil 1's current, whereas $\\phi_{21}$ links coil 2 and is produced by coil 1's current.\n\nThe total flux linking coil 1, $\\phi_{1}$, is the sum of $\\phi_{11}$ and $\\phi_{21}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\phi_{1}=\\phi_{11}+\\phi_{21} \\tag{6.37}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe flux $\\phi_{1}$ and its components $\\phi_{11}$ and $\\phi_{21}$ relate to the coil current $i_{1}$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\phi_{1} & =\\mathscr{P}_{1} N_{1} i_{1},  \\tag{6.38}\\\\\n\\phi_{11} & =\\mathscr{P}_{11} N_{1} i_{1}  \\tag{6.39}\\\\\n\\phi_{21} & =\\mathscr{P}_{21} N_{1} i_{1} \\tag{6.40}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathscr{P}_{1}$ is the permeance of the space occupied by $\\phi_{1}$, $\\mathscr{P}_{11}$ is the permeance of the space occupied by $\\phi_{11}$, and $\\mathscr{P}_{21}$ is the permeance of the space occupied by $\\phi_{21}$. Inserting Equations 6.38, 6.39, and 6.40 into Equation 6.37 reveals the relationship between the permeance of the space occupied by the total flux $\\phi_{1}$ and the permeances of the spaces occupied by its components $\\phi_{11}$ and $\\phi_{21}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathscr{P}_{1}=\\mathscr{P}_{11}+\\mathscr{P}_{21} \\tag{6.41}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWe employ Faraday's law to derive expressions for $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv_{1} & =\\frac{d \\lambda_{1}}{d t}=\\frac{d\\left(N_{1} \\phi_{1}\\right)}{d t}=N_{1} \\frac{d}{d t}\\left(\\phi_{11}+\\phi_{21}\\right) \\\\\n& =N_{1}^{2}\\left(\\mathscr{P}_{11}+\\mathscr{P}_{21}\\right) \\frac{d i_{1}}{d t}=N_{1}^{2} \\mathscr{P}_{1} \\frac{d i_{1}}{d t}=L_{1} \\frac{d i_{1}}{d t} \\tag{6.42}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv_{2} & =\\frac{d \\lambda_{2}}{d t}=\\frac{d\\left(N_{2} \\phi_{21}\\right)}{d t}=N_{2} \\frac{d}{d t}\\left(\\mathscr{P}_{21} N_{1} i_{1}\\right) \\\\\n& =N_{2} N_{1} \\mathscr{P}_{21} \\frac{d i_{1}}{d t} \\tag{6.43}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe coefficient of $d i_{1} / d t$ in Equation 6.42 denotes coil 1's self-inductance. The coefficient in Equation 6.43 signifies the mutual inductance between coils 1 and 2, expressed as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nM_{21}=N_{2} N_{1} \\mathscr{P}_{21} \\tag{6.44}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe subscript on $M$ indicates an inductance linking the voltage induced in coil 2 to the current in coil 1. The mutual inductance yields:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_{2}=M_{21} \\frac{d i_{1}}{d t} \\tag{6.45}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe dot convention in Fig. 6.28 assigns the polarity reference to $v_{2}$.\n\nFor the coupled coils in Fig. 6.28, exciting coil 2 with a time-varying current source $\\left(i_{2}\\right)$ and leaving coil 1 open yields the circuit arrangement depicted in Fig. 6.29. The polarity reference assigned to $v_{1}$ adheres to the dot convention.\n\nThe total flux linking coil 2 is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\phi_{2}=\\phi_{22}+\\phi_{12} \\tag{6.46}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe flux $\\phi_{2}$ and its components $\\phi_{22}$ and $\\phi_{12}$ relate to the coil current $i_{2}$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& \\phi_{2}=\\mathscr{P}_{2} N_{2} i_{2},  \\tag{6.47}\\\\\n& \\phi_{22}=\\mathscr{P}_{22} N_{2} i_{2},  \\tag{6.48}\\\\\n& \\phi_{12}=\\mathscr{P}_{12} N_{2} i_{2} \\tag{6.49}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe voltages $v_{2}$ and $v_{1}$ are:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gather*}\nv_{2}=\\frac{d \\lambda_{2}}{d t}=N_{2}^{2} \\mathscr{P}_{2} \\frac{d i_{2}}{d t}=L_{2} \\frac{d i_{2}}{d t}  \\tag{6.50}\\\\\nv_{1}=\\frac{d \\lambda_{1}}{d t}=\\frac{d}{d t}\\left(N_{1} \\phi_{12}\\right)=N_{1} N_{2} \\mathscr{P}_{12} \\frac{d i_{2}}{d t} . \\tag{6.51}\n\\end{gather*}\n$$\n\nThe mutual inductance coefficient linking the voltage induced in coil 1 to the time-varying current in coil 2 is the coefficient of $d i_{2} / d t$ in Equation 6.51:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nM_{12}=N_{1} N_{2} \\mathscr{P}_{12} \\tag{6.52}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn nonmagnetic environments, the permeances $\\mathscr{P}_{12}$ and $\\mathscr{P}_{21}$ are equal, hence:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nM_{12}=M_{21}=M \\tag{6.53}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThus, for linear circuits with two magnetically coupled coils, the mutual inductance coefficient does not require subscripts.\n\nExpressing Mutual Inductance in Terms of Self-Inductance\n\nMutual inductance's value depends on the self-inductances, as derived below. From Equations 6.42 and 6.50:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& L_{1}=N_{1}^{2} \\mathscr{P}_{1}  \\tag{6.54}\\\\\n& L_{2}=N_{2}^{2} \\mathscr{P}_{2} \\tag{6.55}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nFrom Equations 6.54 and 6.55:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nL_{1} L_{2}=N_{1}^{2} N_{2}^{2} \\mathscr{P}_{1} \\mathscr{P}_{2} \\tag{6.56}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEmploying Equation 6.41 and the corresponding expression for $\\mathscr{P}_{2}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nL_{1} L_{2}=N_{1}^{2} N_{2}^{2}\\left(\\mathscr{P}_{11}+\\mathscr{P}_{21}\\right)\\left(\\mathscr{P}_{22}+\\mathscr{P}_{12}\\right) \\tag{6.57}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIn a linear system, $\\mathscr{P}_{21}=\\mathscr{P}_{12}$, simplifying Equation 6.57 to:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nL_{1} L_{2} & =\\left(N_{1} N_{2} \\mathscr{P}_{12}\\right)^{2}\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathscr{P}_{11}}{\\mathscr{P}_{12}}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathscr{P}_{22}}{\\mathscr{P}_{12}}\\right) \\\\\n& =M^{2}\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathscr{P}_{11}}{\\mathscr{P}_{12}}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathscr{P}_{22}}{\\mathscr{P}_{12}}\\right) \\tag{6.58}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nReformulating Equation 6.58 by replacing the permeance terms with a single constant:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{1}{k^{2}}=\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathscr{P}_{11}}{\\mathscr{P}_{12}}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathscr{P}_{22}}{\\mathscr{P}_{12}}\\right) \\tag{6.59}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSubstituting Equation 6.59 into Equation 6.58 yields:\n\n$$\nM^{2}=k^{2} L_{1} L_{2}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nM=k \\sqrt{L_{1} L_{2}} \\tag{6.60}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHere, $k$ is the coefficient of coupling. According to Equation $6.59$, $1 / k^{2}$ must exceed 1, implying $k$ must be less than 1$. Indeed, the coefficient of coupling must lie between 0 and 1:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n0 \\leq k \\leq 1 \\tag{6.61}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nA coefficient of coupling of 0 signifies no shared flux between the coils, meaning $\\phi_{12}=\\phi_{21}=0$. This implies $\\mathscr{P}_{12}=0$, leading to $1 / k^{2}=\\infty$ or $k=0$. If no flux links the coils, $M$ is naturally 0.\n\nA coefficient of coupling of 1 implies $\\phi_{11}$ and $\\phi_{22}$ are 0, indicating all flux linking coil 1 also links coil 2. In terms of Equation $6.59$, $\\mathscr{P}_{11}=\\mathscr{P}_{22}=0$, an ideal but unattainable state. Magnetic materials (such as iron, cobalt, and nickel alloys) create high-permeance spaces, facilitating coefficients of coupling approaching unity (further discussed in Chapter 9).\n\nUnderstanding the material through Chapter Problems 6.46 and 6.50 is encouraged.\n\nCalculating Energy in Mag"

The lines threading the $N$ turns, denoted as $\\phi$, symbolize the magnetic field's lines of force. The field's intensity depends on the current's strength, and its orientation is dictated by the current's direction.

While a detailed discussion of permeance is beyond the scope of this text, it suffices to note that in magnetic materials, permeance varies with flux, resulting in a nonlinear relationship between $\\phi$ and $i$. Conversely, in nonmagnetic materials, permeance remains constant, yielding a linear relationship. Equation 6.35 also indicates that flux is proportional to the number of turns on the coil.\n\nAssuming a nonmagnetic core material, substituting Equations 6.34 and 6.35 into Equation 6.33 yields:\n\n$$\nv =\\frac{d \\lambda}{d t}=\\frac{d(N \\phi)}{d t} = N \\frac{d \\phi}{d t}=N \\frac{d}{d t}(\\mathscr{P} N i) = N^{2} \\mathscr{P} \\frac{d i}{d t}=L \\frac{d i}{d t}\n$$\n\nThis shows that self-inductance is proportional to the square of the number of turns on the coil, a fact we will revisit later.\n\nThe induced voltage's polarity in the circuit depicted in Figure 6.27 mirrors the field's reaction to the current that generates it. For instance, when $i$ increases, $d i / d t$ is positive, and $v$ is positive, requiring energy to establish the magnetic field. The product $v i$ reflects the rate at which energy is stored. As the field collapses, $d i / d t$ becomes negative, and the induced voltage opposes this change. Energy is then returned to the circuit as the field collapses around the coil.\n\nWith a refined understanding of self-inductance, we now turn our attention to mutual inductance. Figure 6.28 showcases two magnetically coupled coils, with coil 1 driven by a time-varying current source, establishing current $i_{1}$ in its $N_{1}$ turns, while coil 2 remains open and unpowered. The flux generated by $i_{1}$ splits into two components, labeled $\\phi_{11}$ and $\\phi_{21}$. $\\phi_{11}$ is the flux linking only coil 1, while $\\phi_{21}$ links both coil 1 and coil 2.

Deriving this relationship from Equations 6.42 and 6.50:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nL_{1} & =N_{1}^{2} \\mathscr{P}_{1}, \\\\\nL_{2} & =N_{2}^{2} \\mathscr{P}_{2}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nMultiplying these equations yields:\n\n$$\nL_{1} L_{2}=N_{1}^{2} N_{2}^{2} \\mathscr{P}_{1} \\mathscr{P}_{2}\n$$\n\nUsing Equation 6.41 and the corresponding expression for $\\mathscr{P}_{2}$:\n\n$$\nL_{1} L_{2}=N_{1}^{2} N_{2}^{2}\\left(\\mathscr{P}_{11}+\\mathscr{P}_{21}\\right)\\left(\\mathscr{P}_{22}+\\mathscr{P}_{12}\\right)\n$$\n\nFor a linear system, $\\mathscr{P}_{21}=\\mathscr{P}_{12}$, simplifying the equation to:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nL_{1} L_{2} & =\\left(N_{1} N_{2} \\mathscr{P}_{12}\\right)^{2}\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathscr{P}_{11}}{\\mathscr{P}_{12}}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathscr{P}_{22}}{\\mathscr{P}_{12}}\\right) \\\\\n& =M^{2}\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathscr{P}_{11}}{\\mathscr{P}_{12}}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathscr{P}_{22}}{\\mathscr{P}_{12}}\\right)\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nExpressing this in a more meaningful form:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{k^{2}}=\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathscr{P}_{11}}{\\mathscr{P}_{12}}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{\\mathscr{P}_{22}}{\\mathscr{P}_{12}}\\right)\n$$\n\nSubstituting into the previous equation gives:\n\n$$\nM^{2}=k^{2} L_{1} L_{2}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nM=k \\sqrt{L_{1} L_{2}}\n$$\n\nHere, $k$ is the coefficient of coupling, which must be between 0 and 1, inclusive:\n\n$$\n0 \\leq k \\leq 1\n$$\n\nA coefficient of coupling of 0 indicates no shared flux between the coils, meaning $\\phi_{12}=\\phi_{21}=0$ and $\\mathscr{P}_{12}=0$, resulting in $k=0$ and $M=0$. A coefficient of 1 signifies an ideal state where all flux linking coil 1 also links coil 2, with $\\mathscr{P}_{11}=\\mathscr{P}_{22}=0$. Magnetic materials like iron, cobalt, and nickel alloys are used to achieve coefficients of coupling close to unity.\n\nThe energy stored in magnetically coupled coils can be analyzed using the circuit in Figure 6.30. Assuming zero currents correspond to zero stored energy, increasing $i_{1}$ from zero to $I_{1}$ while $i_{2}=0$ results in energy storage:\n\n$$\nW_{1}=\\frac{1}{2} L_{1} I_{1}^{2}\n$$\n\nMaintaining $i_{1}$ at $I_{1}$ and increasing $i_{2}$ from zero to $I_{2}$, the power input to the coils is:\n\n$$\np=I_{1} M_{12} \\frac{d i_{2}}{d t}+i_{2} v_{2}\n$$\n\nThe total energy stored when $i_{2}=I_{2}$ is:\n\n$$\nW=W_{1}+I_{1} I_{2} M_{12}+\\frac{1}{2} L_{2} I_{2}^{2}\n$$\n\nReversing the process, the total energy stored is:\n\n$$\nW=\\frac{1}{2} L_{1} I_{1}^{2}+\\frac{1}{2} L_{2} I_{2}^{2}+I_{1} I_{2} M_{21}\n$$\n\nThese equations represent the total energy stored in linearly coupled coils as a function of coil currents, self-inductances, and mutual inductance. The only difference between them is the coefficient of the current product $I_{1} I_{2}$. Equation 6.63 applies when $i_{1}$ is established first, and Equation 6.64 applies when $i_{2}$ is established first.\n\nFor linear coupling, the total energy stored is independent of the order used to establish $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$. This is because the resulting magnetic flux depends only on the final values of $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$, not on how they reached those values. If the resulting flux is the same, the stored energy remains constant. Hence, for linear coupling, $M_{12}=M_{21}$. Using instantaneous values of coil currents, the total energy stored at any time is:\n\n$$\nw(t)=\\frac{1}{2} L_{1} i_{1}^{2}+\\frac{1}{2} L_{2} i_{2}^{2} \\pm M i_{1} i_{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation shows that $M$ cannot exceed $\\sqrt{L_{1} L_{2}}$. Since the coupled coils are passive elements, the total energy stored cannot be negative. The limiting value of $M$ is found by setting the expression to zero:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} L_{1} i_{1}^{2}+\\frac{1}{2} L_{2} i_{2}^{2}-M i_{1} i_{2}=0\n$$\n\nAdding and subtracting $i_{1} i_{2} \\sqrt{L_{1} L_{2}}$ to the left-hand side generates a perfect square:\n\n$$\n\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{L_{1}}{2}} i_{1}-\\sqrt{\\frac{L_{2}}{2}} i_{2}\\right)^{2}+i_{1} i_{2}\\left(\\sqrt{L_{1} L_{2}}-M\\right)=0\n$$\n\nThe squared term can never be negative, ensuring $w(t) \\geq 0$ only if:\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{L_{1} L_{2}} \\geq M\n$$\n\nThis confirms that $M=k \\sqrt{L_{1} L_{2}}$ where $0 \\leq k \\leq 1$.\n\nCapacitive touch screens, often used for detecting multiple simultaneous touch points, rely on two primary designs. The first design employs a grid of electrodes, as shown in Figure 6.31. When powered, a small parasitic capacitance $C_{p}$ exists between each electrode strip and ground. A touch introduces an additional capacitance $C_{t}$ due to the transfer of charge from the screen to the user's body, acting as a conductor. This increases the capacitance between the electrodes and ground at the touch point, as depicted in Figure 6.32.\n\nHowever, this design has limitations. When two points are touched simultaneously, the capacitance increases at four locations, only two of which correspond to the touch points. The other two are \"ghost\" points, leading to inaccuracies in identifying multiple touch points.\n\nModern capacitive touch screens utilize mutual capacitance, measuring the capacitance between each $x$-grid electrode and each $y$-grid electrode, as shown in Figure 6.33. A touch at any point on the screen introduces an additional capacitance, altering the mutual capacitance and uniquely identifying the touch point. This design allows for accurate detection of multiple touch points without ghosting.\n\nUnderstanding these concepts is crucial for assessing the functionality and limitations of capacitive touch screens."

    "text": "To thoroughly explain the circuit element known as mutual inductance and to scrutinize the constraints and presumptions made in the qualitative discussion from Section 6.4, we start with a more quantitative portrayal of self-inductance than was previously given.\n\nA Recap of Self-Inductance\n\nThe notion of inductance dates back to Michael Faraday, who pioneered work in this field in the early 19th century. Faraday proposed that a magnetic field is composed of lines of force encircling the current-carrying conductor. Envision these lines of force as energy-storing elastic bands that loop back on themselves. As the current fluctuates, the elastic bands (i.e., the lines of force) expand and contract around the conductor. The voltage generated in the conductor is proportional to the number of lines that collapse into, or intersect, the conductor. This depiction of induced voltage is encapsulated in what is known as Faraday's law; that is,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv=\\frac{d \\lambda}{d t} \\tag{6.33}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ denotes the flux linkage and is measured in weber-turns. How do we bridge the gap from Faraday's law to the definition of inductance introduced in Section 6.1? We can start to establish this connection using Fig. 6.27 as a reference.\n\nThe lines piercing the $N$ windings and marked as $\\phi$ signify the magnetic lines of force that constitute the magnetic field. The intensity of the magnetic field depends on the current's strength, and the spatial alignment of the field depends on the current's direction. The right-hand rule associates the field's orientation with the current's direction: When the fingers of the right hand are coiled around the coil so that the fingers indicate the current's direction, the thumb points towards the portion of the magnetic field inside the coil. Flux linkage is the product of the magnetic field $(\\phi)$, measured in webers $(\\mathrm{Wb})$, and the number of windings connected by the field $(N)$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\lambda=N \\phi \\tag{6.34}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe magnitude of the flux, $\\phi$, is related to the magnitude of the coil current by the relationship\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\phi=\\mathscr{P} N i \\tag{6.35}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $N$ is the number of windings on the coil, and $\\mathscr{P}$ is the permeance of the space occupied by the flux. Permeance is a measure that characterizes the magnetic attributes of this space, and a detailed examination of permeance is beyond the scope of this text. Here, we need only observe that, when the space encapsulating the flux is composed of magnetic materials (such as iron, nickel, and cobalt), the permeance fluctuates with the flux, yielding a nonlinear correlation between $\\phi$ and $i$. However, when the space encapsulating the flux is made up of nonmagnetic materials, the permeance remains constant, resulting in a linear correlation between $\\phi$ and $i$. It is noted from Eq. 6.35 that the flux is also proportional to the number of windings on the coil.\n\nHere, we presume that the core material—the space enveloping the flux—is nonmagnetic. Substituting Eqs. 6.34 and 6.35 into Eq. 6.33 leads to\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv & =\\frac{d \\lambda}{d t}=\\frac{d(N \\phi)}{d t} \\\\\n& =N \\frac{d \\phi}{d t}=N \\frac{d}{d t}(\\mathscr{P} N i) \\\\\n& =N^{2} \\mathscr{P} \\frac{d i}{d t}=L \\frac{d i}{d t} \\tag{6.36}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhich illustrates that self-inductance is proportional to the square of the number of windings on the coil. We harness this observation later.\n\nThe polarity of the induced voltage in the circuit depicted in Fig. 6.27 echoes the field's response to the current that generates the field. For instance, when $i$ is increasing, $d i / d t$ is positive and $v$ is positive. Hence, energy is necessary to establish the magnetic field. The product $v i$ represents the rate at which energy is stored in the field. When the field collapses, $d i / d t$ is negative, and once again, the polarity of the induced voltage contradicts the change. As the field collapses around the coil, energy is released back into the circuit.\n\nWith this deeper understanding of the self-inductance concept, we now revisit mutual inductance."
