Response of First-Order RL and RC Circuits

In Chapter 6, we noted that an important attribute of inductors and capacitors is their ability to store energy. We are now in a position to determine the currents and voltages that arise when energy is either released or acquired by an inductor or capacitor in response to an abrupt change in a dc voltage or current source. In this chapter, we will focus on circuits that consist only of sources, resistors, and either (but not both) inductors or capacitors. For brevity, such configurations are called $\boldsymbol{R L}$ (resistorinductor) and $\boldsymbol{R C}$ (resistor-capacitor) circuits.

Our analysis of $R L$ and $R C$ circuits will be divided into three phases. In the first phase, we consider the currents and voltages that arise when stored energy in an inductor or capacitor is suddenly released to a resistive network. This happens when the inductor or capacitor is abruptly disconnected from its dc source. Thus we can reduce the circuit to one of the two equivalent forms shown in Fig. 7.1 on page 214. The currents and voltages that arise in this configuration are referred to as the natural response of the circuit, to emphasize that the nature of the circuit itself, not external sources of excitation, determines its behavior.

In the second phase of our analysis, we consider the currents and voltages that arise when energy is being acquired by an inductor or capacitor due to the sudden application of a dc voltage or current source. This response is referred to as the step response. The process for finding both the natural and step responses is the same; thus, in the third phase of our analysis, we develop a general method that can be used to find the response of $R L$ and $R C$ circuits to any abrupt change in a dc voltage or current source.

Figure 7.2 on page 214 shows the four possibilities for the general configuration of $R L$ and $R C$ circuits. Note that when there are no independent sources in the circuit, the Thévenin voltage or Norton current is zero, and the circuit reduces to one of those shown in Fig. 7.1; that is, we have a natural-response problem.

Practical Perspective

Artificial Pacemaker

The muscle that makes up the heart contracts due to rhythmical electrical impulses. The frequency of the impulses is controlled by pacemaker cells. In adults, the pacemaker cells establish a resting heart rate of about 72 beats per minutes. But sometimes the pacemaker cells are damaged and may produce a very low resting heart rate (a condition known as bradycardia) or a very high resting heart rate (a condition known as tachycardia). A normal heart rhythm can be restored by implanting an artificial pacemaker that delivers electrical impulses to the heart, mimicking the pacemaker cells. An example of an artificial
pacemaker both outside and inside the body is shown in the figures below.

Artificial pacemakers are very small and lightweight. They have a programmable microprocessor that monitors a few parameters and adjusts the heart rate, an efficient battery with a life of up to 15 years, and circuitry that generates the pulse. The simplest circuit consists of a resistor and a capacitor. Once we have introduced the first-order RC circuit, we will look at an RC circuit design for artificial pacemakers.

$R L$ and $R C$ circuits are also known as first-order circuits, because their voltages and currents are described by first-order differential equations. No matter how complex a circuit may appear, if it can be reduced to a Thévenin or Norton equivalent connected to the terminals of an equivalent inductor or capacitor, it is a first-order circuit. (Note that if multiple inductors or capacitors exist in the original circuit, they must be interconnected so that they can be replaced by a single equivalent element.)

After introducing the techniques for analyzing the natural and step responses of first-order circuits, we discuss some special cases of interest. The first is that of sequential switching, involving circuits in which switching can take place at two or more instants in time. Next is the unbounded response. Finally, we analyze a useful circuit called the integrating amplifier.

## 7.1 The Natural Response of an RL Circuit

The natural response of an $R L$ circuit can best be described in terms of the circuit shown in Fig. 7.3. We assume that the independent current source generates a constant current of $I_{s} \mathrm{~A}$, and that the switch has been in a closed position for a long time. We define the phrase a long time more accurately later in this section. For now it means that all currents and voltages have reached a constant value. Thus only constant, or dc, currents can exist in the circuit just prior to the switch's being opened, and therefore the inductor appears as a short circuit $(L d i / d t=0)$ prior to the release of the stored energy.

Because the inductor appears as a short circuit, the voltage across the inductive branch is zero, and there can be no current in either $R_{0}$ or $R$. Therefore, all the source current $I_{s}$ appears in the inductive branch. Finding the natural response requires finding the voltage and current at the terminals of the resistor after the switch has been opened, that is, after the source has been disconnected and the inductor begins releasing energy. If we let $t=0$ denote the instant when the switch is opened, the problem becomes one of finding $v(t)$ and $i(t)$ for $t \geq 0$. For $t \geq 0$, the circuit shown in Fig. 7.3 reduces to the one shown in Fig. 7.4.

### Deriving the Expression for the Current

To find $i(t)$, we use Kirchhoff's voltage law to obtain an expression involving $i, R$, and $L$. Summing the voltages around the closed loop gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
L \frac{d i}{d t}+R i=0 \tag{7.1}
\end{equation*}
$$

where we use the passive sign convention. Equation 7.1 is known as a firstorder ordinary differential equation, because it contains terms involving the ordinary derivative of the unknown, that is, $d i / d t$. The highest order derivative appearing in the equation is 1 ; hence the term first-order.

We can go one step further in describing this equation. The coefficients in the equation, $R$ and $L$, are constants; that is, they are not functions of either the dependent variable $i$ or the independent variable $t$. Thus the equation can also be described as an ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients.

To solve Eq. 7.1, we divide by $L$, transpose the term involving $i$ to the right-hand side, and then multiply both sides by a differential time $d t$. The result is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d i}{d t} d t=-\frac{R}{L} i d t \tag{7.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

Next, we recognize the left-hand side of Eq. 7.2 as a differential change in the current $i$, that is, $d i$. We now divide through by $i$, getting

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d i}{i}=-\frac{R}{L} d t \tag{7.3}
\end{equation*}
$$

We obtain an explicit expression for $i$ as a function of $t$ by integrating both sides of Eq. 7.3. Using $x$ and $y$ as variables of integration yields

$$
\begin{equation*}
\int_{i\left(t_{0}\right)}^{i(t)} \frac{d x}{x}=-\frac{R}{L} \int_{t_{0}}^{t} d y \tag{7.4}
\end{equation*}
$$

in which $i\left(t_{0}\right)$ is the current corresponding to time $t_{0}$, and $i(t)$ is the current corresponding to time $t$. Here, $t_{0}=0$. Therefore, carrying out the indicated integration gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\ln \frac{i(t)}{i(0)}=-\frac{R}{L} t \tag{7.5}
\end{equation*}
$$

Based on the definition of the natural logarithm,

$$
\begin{equation*}
i(t)=i(0) e^{-(R / L) t} \tag{7.6}
\end{equation*}
$$

Recall from Chapter 6 that an instantaneous change of current cannot occur in an inductor. Therefore, in the first instant after the switch has been opened, the current in the inductor remains unchanged. If we use $0^{-}$ to denote the time just prior to switching, and $0^{+}$for the time immediately following switching, then

$$
i\left(0^{-}\right)=i\left(0^{+}\right)=I_{0}
$$

where, as in Fig. 7.1, $I_{0}$ denotes the initial current in the inductor. The initial current in the inductor is oriented in the same direction as the reference direction of $i$. Hence Eq. 7.6 becomes

$$
\begin{equation*}
i(t)=I_{0} e^{-(R / L) t}, \quad t \geq 0 \tag{7.7}
\end{equation*}
$$

which shows that the current starts from an initial value $I_{0}$ and decreases exponentially toward zero as $t$ increases. Figure 7.5 shows this response.

We derive the voltage across the resistor in Fig. 7.4 from a direct application of Ohm's law:

$$
\begin{equation*}
v=i R=I_{0} R e^{-(R / L) t}, \quad t \geq 0^{+} \tag{7.8}
\end{equation*}
$$

Note that in contrast to the expression for the current shown in Eq. 7.7, the voltage is defined only for $t>0$, not at $t=0$. The reason is that a step change occurs in the voltage at zero. Note that for $t<0$, the derivative of the current is zero, so the voltage is also zero. (This result follows from $v=L d i / d t=0$.) Thus

$$
\begin{align*}
& v\left(0^{-}\right)=0  \tag{7.9}\\
& v\left(0^{+}\right)=I_{0} R \tag{7.10}
\end{align*}
$$

where $v\left(0^{+}\right)$is obtained from Eq. 7.8 with $t=0^{+} .{ }^{1}$ With this step change at an instant in time, the value of the voltage at $t=0$ is unknown. Thus we use $t \geq 0^{+}$in defining the region of validity for these solutions.

Figure 7.5 $\boldsymbol{\Delta}$ The current response for the circuit shown in Fig. 7.4.

We derive the power dissipated in the resistor from any of the following expressions:

$$
\begin{equation*}
p=v i, \quad p=i^{2} R, \quad \text { or } \quad p=\frac{v^{2}}{R} \tag{7.11}
\end{equation*}
$$

Whichever form is used, the resulting expression can be reduced to

$$
\begin{equation*}
p=I_{0}^{2} R e^{-2(R / L) t}, \quad t \geq 0^{+} \tag{7.12}
\end{equation*}
$$

The energy delivered to the resistor during any interval of time after the switch has been opened is

$$
\begin{align*}
w & =\int_{0}^{t} p d x=\int_{0}^{t} I_{0}^{2} R e^{-2(R / L) x} d x \\
& =\frac{1}{2(R / L)} I_{0}^{2} R\left(1-e^{-2(R / L) t}\right) \\
& =\frac{1}{2} L I_{0}^{2}\left(1-e^{-2(R / L) t}\right), \quad t \geq 0 \tag{7.13}
\end{align*}
$$

Note from Eq. 7.13 that as $t$ becomes infinite, the energy dissipated in the resistor approaches the initial energy stored in the inductor.

### The Significance of the Time Constant

The expressions for $i(t)$ (Eq. 7.7) and $v(t)$ (Eq. 7.8) include a term of the form $e^{-(R / L) t}$. The coefficient of $t$-namely, $R / L-$ determines the rate at which the current or voltage approaches zero. The reciprocal of this ratio is the time constant of the circuit, denoted

$$
\begin{equation*}
\tau=\text { time constant }=\frac{L}{R} \tag{7.14}
\end{equation*}
$$

Using the time-constant concept, we write the expressions for current, voltage, power, and energy as

$$
\begin{align*}
i(t) & =I_{0} e^{-t / \tau}, \quad t \geq 0  \tag{7.15}\\
v(t) & =I_{0} R e^{-t / \tau}, \quad t \geq 0^{+}  \tag{7.16}\\
p & =I_{0}^{2} R e^{-2 t / \tau}, \quad t \geq 0^{+}  \tag{7.17}\\
w & =\frac{1}{2} L I_{0}^{2}\left(1-e^{-2 t / \tau}\right), \quad t \geq 0 \tag{7.18}
\end{align*}
$$

The time constant is an important parameter for first-order circuits, so mentioning several of its characteristics is worthwhile. First, it is convenient to think of the time elapsed after switching in terms of integral multiples of $\tau$. Thus one time constant after the inductor has begun to release its stored energy to the resistor, the current has been reduced to $e^{-1}$, or approximately 0.37 of its initial value.

Table 7.1 gives the value of $e^{-t / \tau}$ for integral multiples of $\tau$ from 1 to 10. Note that when the elapsed time exceeds five time constants, the current is less than $1 \%$ of its initial value. Thus we sometimes say that five time constants after switching has occurred, the currents and voltages have, for most practical purposes, reached their final values. For single time-constant circuits (first-order circuits) with $1 \%$ accuracy, the phrase a long time implies that five or more time constants have elapsed. Thus the existence of current in the $R L$ circuit shown in Fig. 7.1(a) is a momentary event and is referred to as the transient response of the circuit. The response that exists a long time after the switching has taken place is called the steady-state response. The phrase a long time then also means the time it takes the circuit to reach its steady-state value.

Any first-order circuit is characterized, in part, by the value of its time constant. If we have no method for calculating the time constant of such a circuit (perhaps because we don't know the values of its components), we can determine its value from a plot of the circuit's natural response. That's because another important characteristic of the time constant is that it gives the time required for the current to reach its final value if the current continues to change at its initial rate. To illustrate, we evaluate $d i / d t$ at $0^{+}$and assume that the current continues to change at this rate:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d i}{d t}\left(0^{+}\right)=-\frac{R}{L} I_{0}=-\frac{I_{0}}{\tau} \tag{7.19}
\end{equation*}
$$

Now, if $i$ starts as $I_{0}$ and decreases at a constant rate of $I_{0} / \tau$ amperes per second, the expression for $i$ becomes

$$
\begin{equation*}
i=I_{0}-\frac{I_{0}}{\tau} t . \tag{7.20}
\end{equation*}
$$

Equation 7.20 indicates that $i$ would reach its final value of zero in $\tau$ seconds. Figure 7.6 shows how this graphic interpretation is useful in estimating the time constant of a circuit from a plot of its natural response. Such a plot could be generated on an oscilloscope measuring output current. Drawing the tangent to the natural response plot at $t=0$ and reading the value at which the tangent intersects the time axis gives the value of $\tau$.

Calculating the natural response of an $R L$ circuit can be summarized as follows:

1. Find the initial current, $I_{0}$, through the inductor.
2. Find the time constant of the circuit, $\tau=L / R$.
3. Use Eq. $7.15, I_{0} e^{-t / \tau}$, to generate $i(t)$ from $I_{0}$ and $\tau$.

All other calculations of interest follow from knowing $i(t)$. Examples 7.1 and 7.2 illustrate the numerical calculations associated with the natural response of an $R L$ circuit.

### Example 7.1 Determining the Natural Response of an RL Circuit

The switch in the circuit shown in Fig. 7.7 has been closed for a long time before it is opened at $t=0$. Find
a) $i_{L}(t)$ for $t \geq 0$,
b) $i_{o}(t)$ for $t \geq 0^{+}$,
c) $v_{o}(t)$ for $t \geq 0^{+}$,
d) the percentage of the total energy stored in the 2 H inductor that is dissipated in the $10 \Omega$ resistor.

Figure $7.7 \triangle$ The circuit for Example 7.1.

### Solution

a) The switch has been closed for a long time prior to $t=0$, so we know the voltage across the inductor must be zero at $t=0^{-}$. Therefore the initial current in the inductor is 20 A at $t=0^{-}$. Hence, $i_{L}\left(0^{+}\right)$also is 20 A , because an instantaneous change in the current cannot occur in an inductor. We replace the resistive circuit connected to the terminals of the inductor with a single resistor of $10 \Omega$ :

$$
R_{\mathrm{eq}}=2+(40 \| 10)=10 \Omega
$$

The time constant of the circuit is $L / R_{\mathrm{eq}}$, or 0.2 s , giving the expression for the inductor current as

$$
i_{L}(t)=20 e^{-5 t} \mathrm{~A}, \quad t \geq 0
$$

b) We find the current in the $40 \Omega$ resistor most easily by using current division; that is,

$$
i_{o}=-i_{L} \frac{10}{10+40}
$$

Note that this expression is valid for $t \geq 0^{+}$ because $i_{o}=0$ at $t=0^{-}$. The inductor behaves as a short circuit prior to the switch being opened, producing an instantaneous change in the current $i_{o}$. Then,

$$
i_{o}(t)=-4 e^{-5 t} \mathrm{~A}, \quad t \geq 0^{+}
$$

c) We find the voltage $v_{o}$ by direct application of Ohm's law:

$$
v_{o}(t)=40 i_{o}=-160 e^{-5 t} \mathrm{~V}, \quad t \geq 0^{+}
$$

d) The power dissipated in the $10 \Omega$ resistor is

$$
p_{10 \Omega}(t)=\frac{v_{o}^{2}}{10}=2560 e^{-10 t} \mathrm{~W}, \quad t \geq 0^{+}
$$

The total energy dissipated in the $10 \Omega$ resistor is

$$
w_{10 \Omega}(t)=\int_{0}^{\infty} 2560 e^{-10 t} d t=256 \mathrm{~J}
$$

The initial energy stored in the 2 H inductor is

$$
w(0)=\frac{1}{2} L i^{2}(0)=\frac{1}{2}(2)(400)=400 \mathrm{~J}
$$

Therefore the percentage of energy dissipated in the $10 \Omega$ resistor is

$$
\frac{256}{400}(100)=64 \%
$$

### Example 7.2 Determining the Natural Response of an RL Circuit with Parallel Inductors

In the circuit shown in Fig. 7.8, the initial currents in inductors $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ have been established by sources not shown. The switch is opened at $t=0$.
a) Find $i_{1}, i_{2}$, and $i_{3}$ for $t \geq 0$.
b) Calculate the initial energy stored in the parallel inductors.
c) Determine how much energy is stored in the inductors as $t \rightarrow \infty$.
d) Show that the total energy delivered to the resistive network equals the difference between the results obtained in (b) and (c).

### Solution

a) The key to finding currents $i_{1}, i_{2}$, and $i_{3}$ lies in knowing the voltage $v(t)$. We can easily find $v(t)$ if we reduce the circuit shown in Fig. 7.8 to the equivalent form shown in Fig. 7.9. The parallel inductors simplify to an equivalent inductance of 4 H , carrying an initial current of 12 A . The resistive network reduces to a single resistance of $8 \Omega$. Hence the initial value of $i(t)$ is 12 A and the time constant is $4 / 8$, or 0.5 s . Therefore

$$
i(t)=12 e^{-2 t} \mathrm{~A}, \quad t \geq 0
$$

Now $v(t)$ is simply the product $8 i$, so

$$
v(t)=96 e^{-2 t} \mathrm{~V}, \quad t \geq 0^{+}
$$

The circuit shows that $v(t)=0$ at $t=0^{-}$, so the expression for $v(t)$ is valid for $t \geq 0^{+}$. After obtaining $v(t)$, we can calculate $i_{1}, i_{2}$, and $i_{3}$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
i_{1} & =\frac{1}{5} \int_{0}^{t} 96 e^{-2 x} d x-8 \\
& =1.6-9.6 e^{-2 t} \mathrm{~A}, \quad t \geq 0 \\
i_{2} & =\frac{1}{20} \int_{0}^{t} 96 e^{-2 x} d x-4
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =-1.6-2.4 e^{-2 t} \mathrm{~A}, \quad t \geq 0 \\
i_{3} & =\frac{v(t)}{10} \frac{15}{25}=5.76 e^{-2 t} \mathrm{~A}, \quad t \geq 0^{+}
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that the expressions for the inductor currents $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$ are valid for $t \geq 0$, whereas the expression for the resistor current $i_{3}$ is valid for $t \geq 0^{+}$.

Figure 7.9 $\triangle$ A simplification of the circuit shown in Fig. 7.8.
b) The initial energy stored in the inductors is

$$
w=\frac{1}{2}(5)(64)+\frac{1}{2}(20)(16)=320 \mathrm{~J}
$$

c) As $t \rightarrow \infty, \quad i_{1} \rightarrow 1.6 \mathrm{~A}$ and $i_{2} \rightarrow-1.6 \mathrm{~A}$. Therefore, a long time after the switch has been opened, the energy stored in the two inductors is

$$
w=\frac{1}{2}(5)(1.6)^{2}+\frac{1}{2}(20)(-1.6)^{2}=32 \mathrm{~J}
$$

d) We obtain the total energy delivered to the resistive network by integrating the expression for the instantaneous power from zero to infinity:

$$
\begin{aligned}
w & =\int_{0}^{\infty} p d t=\int_{0}^{\infty} 1152 e^{-4 t} d t \\
& =1152 \frac{e^{-4 t}}{-4} 2_{0}^{\infty}=288 \mathrm{~J}
\end{aligned}
$$

This result is the difference between the initially stored energy ( 320 J ) and the energy trapped in the parallel inductors ( 32 J ). The equivalent inductor for the parallel inductors (which predicts the terminal behavior of the parallel combination) has an initial energy of 288 J ; that is, the energy stored in the equivalent inductor represents the amount of energy that will be delivered to the resistive network at the terminals of the original inductors.

## 7.2 The Natural Response of an RC Circuit

As mentioned in Section 7.1, the natural response of an $R C$ circuit is analogous to that of an $R L$ circuit. Consequently, we don't treat the $R C$ circuit in the same detail as we did the $R L$ circuit.

The natural response of an $R C$ circuit is developed from the circuit shown in Fig. 7.10. We begin by assuming that the switch has been in position a for a long time, allowing the loop made up of the dc voltage source $V_{g}$, the resistor $R_{1}$, and the capacitor $C$ to reach a steady-state condition. Recall from Chapter 6 that a capacitor behaves as an open circuit in the presence of a constant voltage. Thus the voltage source cannot sustain a current, and so the source voltage appears across the capacitor terminals. In Section 7.3, we will discuss how the capacitor voltage actually builds to the steady-state value of the dc voltage source, but for now the important point is that when the switch is moved from position a to position b (at $t=0$ ), the voltage on the capacitor is $V_{g}$. Because there can be no instantaneous change in the voltage at the terminals of a capacitor, the problem reduces to solving the circuit shown in Fig. 7.11.

#V# Deriving the Expression for the Voltage

We can easily find the voltage $v(t)$ by thinking in terms of node voltages. Using the lower junction between $R$ and $C$ as the reference node and summing the currents away from the upper junction between $R$ and $C$ gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
C \frac{d v}{d t}+\frac{v}{R}=0 \tag{7.21}
\end{equation*}
$$

Comparing Eq. 7.21 with Eq. 7.1 shows that the same mathematical techniques can be used to obtain the solution for $v(t)$. We leave it to you to show that

$$
\begin{equation*}
v(t)=v(0) e^{-t / R C}, \quad t \geq 0 \tag{7.22}
\end{equation*}
$$

As we have already noted, the initial voltage on the capacitor equals the voltage source voltage $V_{g}$, or

$$
\begin{equation*}
v\left(0^{-}\right)=v(0)=v\left(0^{+}\right)=V_{g}=V_{0}, \tag{7.23}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $V_{0}$ denotes the initial voltage on the capacitor. The time constant for the $R C$ circuit equals the product of the resistance and capacitance, namely,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\tau=R C \tag{7.24}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substituting Eqs. 7.23 and 7.24 into Eq. 7.22 yields

$$
\begin{equation*}
v(t)=V_{0} e^{-t / \tau}, \quad t \geq 0 \tag{7.25}
\end{equation*}
$$

which indicates that the natural response of an $R C$ circuit is an exponential decay of the initial voltage. The time constant $R C$ governs the rate of decay. Figure 7.12 shows the plot of Eq. 7.25 and the graphic interpretation of the time constant.

After determining $v(t)$, we can easily derive the expressions for $i, p$, and $w$ :

$$
\begin{align*}
i(t) & =\frac{v(t)}{R}=\frac{V_{0}}{R} e^{-t / \tau}, \quad t \geq 0^{+}  \tag{7.26}\\
p & =v i=\frac{V_{0}^{2}}{R} e^{-2 t / \tau}, \quad t \geq 0^{+}  \tag{7.27}\\
w & =\int_{0}^{t} p d x=\int_{0}^{t} \frac{V_{0}^{2}}{R} e^{-2 x / \tau} d x \\
& =\frac{1}{2} C V_{0}^{2}\left(1-e^{-2 t / \tau}\right), \quad t \geq 0 \tag{7.28}
\end{align*}
$$

Figure 7.12 $\triangle$ The natural response of an $R C$ circuit.

Calculating the natural response of an $R C$ circuit

Calculating the natural response of an $R C$ circuit can be summarized as follows:

1. Find the initial voltage, $V_{0}$, across the capacitor.
2. Find the time constant of the circuit, $\tau=R C$.
3. Use Eq. 7.25, $v(t)=V_{0} e^{-t / \tau}$, to generate $v(t)$ from $V_{0}$ and $\tau$.

All other calculations of interest follow from knowing $v(t)$. Examples 7.3 and 7.4 illustrate the numerical calculations associated with the natural response of an $R C$ circuit.

### Example 7.3 Determining the Natural Response of an RC Circuit

The switch in the circuit shown in Fig. 7.13 has been in position $x$ for a long time. At $t=0$, the switch moves instantaneously to position $y$. Find
a) $v_{C}(t)$ for $t \geq 0$,
b) $v_{o}(t)$ for $t \geq 0^{+}$,
c) $i_{o}(t)$ for $t \geq 0^{+}$, and
d) the total energy dissipated in the $60 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ resistor.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_9710ae55a6ab0834368ag-021.jpg?height=321&width=722&top_left_y=1650&top_left_x=248)

Figure 7.13 $\triangle$ The circuit for Example 7.3.

### Solution

a) Because the switch has been in position $x$ for a long time, the 0.5 mF capacitor will charge to 100 V and be positive at the upper terminal. We can replace the resistive network connected to the capacitor at $t=0^{+}$with an equivalent resistance of $80 \mathrm{k} \Omega$. Hence the time constant of the circuit is $\left(0.5 \times 10^{-6}\right)\left(80 \times 10^{3}\right)$ or 40 ms . Then,

$$
v_{C}(t)=100 e^{-25 t} \mathrm{~V}, \quad t \geq 0
$$

b) The easiest way to find $v_{o}(t)$ is to note that the resistive circuit forms a voltage divider across the terminals of the capacitor. Thus

$$
v_{o}(t)=\frac{48}{80} v_{C}(t)=60 e^{-25 t} \mathrm{~V}, \quad t \geq 0^{+}
$$

This expression for $v_{o}(t)$ is valid for $t \geq 0^{+}$ because $v_{o}\left(0^{-}\right)$is zero. Thus we have an instantaneous change in the voltage across the $240 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ resistor.
c) We find the current $i_{o}(t)$ from Ohm's law:

$$
i_{o}(t)=\frac{v_{o}(t)}{60 \times 10^{3}}=e^{-25 t} \mathrm{~mA}, \quad t \geq 0^{+}
$$

d) The power dissipated in the $60 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ resistor is
$p_{60 \mathrm{k} \Omega}(t)=i_{o}^{2}(t)\left(60 \times 10^{3}\right)=60 e^{-50 t} \mathrm{~mW}, \quad t \geq 0^{+}$.

The total energy dissipated is

$$
w_{60 \mathrm{k} \Omega}=\int_{0}^{\infty} i_{o}^{2}(t)\left(60 \times 10^{3}\right) d t=1.2 \mathrm{~mJ}
$$

### Example 7.4 Determining the Natural Response of an RC Circuit with Series Capacitors

The initial voltages on capacitors $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ in the circuit shown in Fig. 7.14 have been established by sources not shown. The switch is closed at $t=0$.
a) Find $v_{1}(t), v_{2}(t)$, and $v(t)$ for $t \geq 0$ and $i(t)$ for $t \geq 0^{+}$.
b) Calculate the initial energy stored in the capacitors $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$.
c) Determine how much energy is stored in the capacitors as $t \rightarrow \infty$.
d) Show that the total energy delivered to the $250 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ resistor is the difference between the results obtained in (b) and (c).

### Solution

a) Once we know $v(t)$, we can obtain the current $i(t)$ from Ohm's law. After determining $i(t)$, we can calculate $v_{1}(t)$ and $v_{2}(t)$ because the voltage across a capacitor is a function of the capacitor current. To find $v(t)$, we replace the series-connected capacitors with an equivalent capacitor. It has a capacitance of $4 \mu \mathrm{~F}$ and is charged to a voltage of 20 V. Therefore, the circuit shown in Fig. 7.14 reduces to the one shown in Fig. 7.15, which reveals that the initial value of $v(t)$ is 20 V , and that the time constant of the circuit is $(4)(250) \times 10^{-3}$, or 1 s . Thus the expression for $v(t)$ is

$$
v(t)=20 e^{-t} \mathrm{~V}, \quad t \geq 0
$$

The current $i(t)$ is

$$
i(t)=\frac{v(t)}{250,000}=80 e^{-t} \mu \mathrm{~A}, \quad t \geq 0^{+}
$$

Knowing $i(t)$, we calculate the expressions for $v_{1}(t)$ and $v_{2}(t)$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_{1}(t) & =-\frac{10^{6}}{5} \int_{0}^{t} 80 \times 10^{-6} e^{-x} d x-4 \\
& =\left(16 e^{-t}-20\right) \mathrm{V}, \quad t \geq 0 \\
v_{2}(t) & =-\frac{10^{6}}{20} \int_{0}^{t} 80 \times 10^{-6} e^{-x} d x+24 \\
& =\left(4 e^{-t}+20\right) \mathrm{V}, \quad t \geq 0
\end{aligned}
$$

b) The initial energy stored in $C_{1}$ is

$$
w_{1}=\frac{1}{2}\left(5 \times 10^{-6}\right)(16)=40 \mu \mathrm{~J}
$$

The initial energy stored in $C_{2}$ is

$$
w_{2}=\frac{1}{2}\left(20 \times 10^{-6}\right)(576)=5760 \mu \mathrm{~J}
$$

Figure 7.15 A A simplification of the circuit shown in Fig. 7.14.

The total energy stored in the two capacitors is

$$
w_{o}=40+5760=5800 \mu \mathrm{~J}
$$

c) As $t \rightarrow \infty$,

$$
v_{1} \rightarrow-20 \mathrm{~V} \quad \text { and } \quad v_{2} \rightarrow+20 \mathrm{~V}
$$

Therefore the energy stored in the two capacitors is

$$
w_{\infty}=\frac{1}{2}(5+20) \times 10^{-6}(400)=5000 \mu \mathrm{~J}
$$

d) The total energy delivered to the $250 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ resistor is

$$
w=\int_{0}^{\infty} p d t=\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{400 e^{-2 t}}{250,000} d t=800 \mu \mathrm{~J}
$$

Comparing the results obtained in (b) and (c) shows that

$$
800 \mu \mathrm{~J}=(5800-5000) \mu \mathrm{J}
$$

The energy stored in the equivalent capacitor in Fig. 7.15 is $\frac{1}{2}\left(4 \times 10^{-6}\right)(400)$, or $800 \mu \mathrm{~J}$. Because this capacitor predicts the terminal behavior of the original series-connected capacitors, the energy stored in the equivalent capacitor is the energy delivered to the $250 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ resistor.

Figure $7.16 \boldsymbol{\Delta}$ A circuit used to illustrate the step response of a first-order $R L$ circuit.

## 7.3 The Step Response of RL and $R C$ Circuits

We are now ready to discuss the problem of finding the currents and voltages generated in first-order $R L$ or $R C$ circuits when either dc voltage or current sources are suddenly applied. The response of a circuit to the sudden application of a constant voltage or current source is referred to as the step response of the circuit. In presenting the step response, we show how the circuit responds when energy is being stored in the inductor or capacitor. We begin with the step response of an $R L$ circuit.

### The Step Response of an RL Circuit

To begin, we modify the first-order circuit shown in Fig. 7.2(a) by adding a switch. We use the resulting circuit, shown in Fig. 7.16, in developing the step response of an $R L$ circuit. Energy stored in the inductor at the time the switch is closed is given in terms of a nonzero initial current $i(0)$. The task is to find the expressions for the current in the circuit and for the voltage across the inductor after the switch has been closed. The procedure is the same as that used in Section 7.1; we use circuit analysis to derive the
differential equation that describes the circuit in terms of the variable of interest, and then we use elementary calculus to solve the equation.

After the switch in Fig. 7.16 has been closed, Kirchhoff's voltage law requires that

$$
\begin{equation*}
V_{s}=R i+L \frac{d i}{d t} \tag{7.29}
\end{equation*}
$$

which can be solved for the current by separating the variables $i$ and $t$ and then integrating. The first step in this approach is to solve Eq. 7.29 for the derivative $d i / d t$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d i}{d t}=\frac{-R i+V_{s}}{L}=\frac{-R}{L}\left(i-\frac{V_{s}}{R}\right) \tag{7.30}
\end{equation*}
$$

Next, we multiply both sides of Eq. 7.30 by a differential time $d t$. This step reduces the left-hand side of the equation to a differential change in the current. Thus

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d i}{d t} d t=\frac{-R}{L}\left(i-\frac{V_{s}}{R}\right) d t \tag{7.31}
\end{equation*}
$$

or

$$
d i=\frac{-R}{L}\left(i-\frac{V_{s}}{R}\right) d t
$$

We now separate the variables in Eq. 7.31 to get

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d i}{i-\left(V_{s} / R\right)}=\frac{-R}{L} d t \tag{7.32}
\end{equation*}
$$

and then integrate both sides of Eq. 7.32. Using $x$ and $y$ as variables for the integration, we obtain

$$
\begin{equation*}
\int_{I_{0}}^{i(t)} \frac{d x}{x-\left(V_{s} / R\right)}=\frac{-R}{L} \int_{0}^{t} d y \tag{7.33}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $I_{0}$ is the current at $t=0$ and $i(t)$ is the current at any $t>0$. Performing the integration called for in Eq. 7.33 generates the expression

$$
\begin{equation*}
\ln \frac{i(t)-\left(V_{s} / R\right)}{I_{0}-\left(V_{s} / R\right)}=\frac{-R}{L} t \tag{7.34}
\end{equation*}
$$

from which

$$
\frac{i(t)-\left(V_{s} / R\right)}{I_{0}-\left(V_{s} / R\right)}=e^{-(R / L) t}
$$

or

$$
\begin{equation*}
i(t)=\frac{V_{s}}{R}+\left(I_{0}-\frac{V_{s}}{R}\right) e^{-(R / L) t} \tag{7.35}
\end{equation*}
$$

Step response of RL circuit

When the initial energy in the inductor is zero, $I_{0}$ is zero. Thus Eq. 7.35 reduces to

$$
\begin{equation*}
i(t)=\frac{V_{s}}{R}-\frac{V_{s}}{R} e^{-(R / L) t} \tag{7.36}
\end{equation*}
$$

Equation 7.36 indicates that after the switch has been closed, the current increases exponentially from zero to a final value of $V_{s} / R$. The time constant of the circuit, $L / R$, determines the rate of increase. One time
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_9710ae55a6ab0834368ag-025.jpg?height=547&width=702&top_left_y=1548&top_left_x=164)

Figure $7.17 \triangle$ The step response of the $R L$ circuit shown in Fig. 7.16 when $I_{0}=0$.

Figure 7.18 $\triangle$ Inductor voltage versus time.
constant after the switch has been closed, the current will have reached approximately $63 \%$ of its final value, or

$$
\begin{equation*}
i(\tau)=\frac{V_{s}}{R}-\frac{V_{s}}{R} e^{-1} \approx 0.6321 \frac{V_{s}}{R} \tag{7.37}
\end{equation*}
$$

If the current were to continue to increase at its initial rate, it would reach its final value at $t=\tau$; that is, because

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d i}{d t}=\frac{-V_{s}}{R}\left(\frac{-1}{\tau}\right) e^{-t / \tau}=\frac{V_{s}}{L} e^{-t / \tau} \tag{7.38}
\end{equation*}
$$

the initial rate at which $i(t)$ increases is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d i}{d t}(0)=\frac{V_{s}}{L} \tag{7.39}
\end{equation*}
$$

If the current were to continue to increase at this rate, the expression for $i$ would be

$$
\begin{equation*}
i=\frac{V_{s}}{L} t \tag{7.40}
\end{equation*}
$$

from which, at $t=\tau$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
i=\frac{V_{s}}{L} \frac{L}{R}=\frac{V_{s}}{R} \tag{7.41}
\end{equation*}
$$

Equations 7.36 and 7.40 are plotted in Fig. 7.17. The values given by Eqs. 7.37 and 7.41 are also shown in this figure.

The voltage across an inductor is $L d i / d t$, so from Eq. 7.35 , for $t \geq 0^{+}$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
v=L\left(\frac{-R}{L}\right)\left(I_{0}-\frac{V_{s}}{R}\right) e^{-(R / L) t}=\left(V_{s}-I_{0} R\right) e^{-(R / L) t} \tag{7.42}
\end{equation*}
$$

The voltage across the inductor is zero before the switch is closed. Equation 7.42 indicates that the inductor voltage jumps to $V_{s}-I_{0} R$ at the instant the switch is closed and then decays exponentially to zero.

Does the value of $v$ at $t=0^{+}$make sense? Because the initial current is $I_{0}$ and the inductor prevents an instantaneous change in current, the current is $I_{0}$ in the instant after the switch has been closed. The voltage drop across the resistor is $I_{0} R$, and the voltage impressed across the inductor is the source voltage minus the voltage drop, that is, $V_{s}-I_{0} R$.

When the initial inductor current is zero, Eq. 7.42 simplifies to

$$
\begin{equation*}
v=V_{s} e^{-(R / L) t} \tag{7.43}
\end{equation*}
$$

If the initial current is zero, the voltage across the inductor jumps to $V_{s}$. We also expect the inductor voltage to approach zero as $t$ increases, because the current in the circuit is approaching the constant value of $V_{s} / R$. Figure 7.18 shows the plot of Eq. 7.43 and the relationship between the time constant and the initial rate at which the inductor voltage is decreasing.

If there is an initial current in the inductor, Eq. 7.35 gives the solution for it. The algebraic sign of $I_{0}$ is positive if the initial current is in the same direction as $i$; otherwise, $I_{0}$ carries a negative sign. Example 7.5 illustrates the application of Eq. 7.35 to a specific circuit.

### Example 7.5 Determining the Step Response of an RL Circuit

The switch in the circuit shown in Fig. 7.19 has been in position a for a long time. At $t=0$, the switch moves from position a to position b . The switch is a make-before-break type; that is, the connection at position b is established before the connection at position a is broken, so there is no interruption of current through the inductor.
a) Find the expression for $i(t)$ for $t \geq 0$.
b) What is the initial voltage across the inductor just after the switch has been moved to position b ?
c) How many milliseconds after the switch has been moved does the inductor voltage equal 24 V ?
d) Does this initial voltage make sense in terms of circuit behavior?
e) Plot both $i(t)$ and $v(t)$ versus $t$.

Figure 7.19 A The circuit for Example 7.5.

### Solution

a) The switch has been in position a for a long time, so the 200 mH inductor is a short circuit across the 8 A current source. Therefore, the inductor carries an initial current of 8 A . This current is oriented opposite to the reference direction for $i$; thus $I_{0}$ is -8 A . When the switch is in position b , the final value of $i$ will be $24 / 2$, or 12 A . The time constant of the circuit is $200 / 2$, or 100 ms . Substituting these values into Eq. 7.35 gives

$$
\begin{aligned}
i & =12+(-8-12) e^{-t / 0.1} \\
& =12-20 e^{-10 t} \mathrm{~A}, \quad t \geq 0
\end{aligned}
$$

b) The voltage across the inductor is

$$
\begin{aligned}
v & =L \frac{d i}{d t} \\
& =0.2\left(200 e^{-10 t}\right) \\
& =40 e^{-10 t} \mathrm{~V}, \quad t \geq 0^{+}
\end{aligned}
$$

The initial inductor voltage is

$$
v\left(0^{+}\right)=40 \mathrm{~V}
$$

c) Yes; in the instant after the switch has been moved to position b, the inductor sustains a current of 8 A counterclockwise around the newly formed closed path. This current causes a 16 V drop across the $2 \Omega$ resistor. This voltage drop adds to the drop across the source, producing a 40 V drop across the inductor.
d) We find the time at which the inductor voltage equals 24 V by solving the expression

$$
24=40 e^{-10 t}
$$

for $t$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
t & =\frac{1}{10} \ln \frac{40}{24} \\
& =51.08 \times 10^{-3} \\
& =51.08 \mathrm{~ms} .
\end{aligned}
$$

e) Figure 7.20 shows the graphs of $i(t)$ and $v(t)$ versus $t$. Note that the instant of time when the current equals zero corresponds to the instant of time when the inductor voltage equals the source voltage of 24 V , as predicted by Kirchhoff's voltage law.

### ASSESSMENT PROBLEM

#### Objective 2-Be able to determine the step response of both RL and RC circuits

7.5 Assume that the switch in the circuit shown in Fig. 7.19 has been in position $b$ for a long time, and at $t=0$ it moves to position a. Find

(b) -200 V ;
(c) 20 ms ;
(d) $-8+20 e^{-50 t} \mathrm{~A}, t \geq 0$;
(e) $-200 e^{-50 t} \mathrm{~V}, t \geq 0^{+}$.

NOTE: Also try Chapter Problems 7.35-7.37.

We can also describe the voltage $v(t)$ across the inductor in Fig. 7.16 directly, not just in terms of the circuit current. We begin by noting that the voltage across the resistor is the difference between the source voltage and the inductor voltage. We write

$$
\begin{equation*}
i(t)=\frac{V_{s}}{R}-\frac{v(t)}{R} \tag{7.44}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $V_{s}$ is a constant. Differentiating both sides with respect to time yields

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d i}{d t}=-\frac{1}{R} \frac{d v}{d t} \tag{7.45}
\end{equation*}
$$

Then, if we multiply each side of Eq. 7.45 by the inductance $L$, we get an expression for the voltage across the inductor on the left-hand side, or

$$
\begin{equation*}
v=-\frac{L}{R} \frac{d v}{d t} \tag{7.46}
\end{equation*}
$$

Putting Eq. 7.46 into standard form yields

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d v}{d t}+\frac{R}{L} v=0 \tag{7.47}
\end{equation*}
$$

You should verify (in Problem 7.38) that the solution to Eq. 7.47 is identical to that given in Eq. 7.42.

At this point, a general observation about the step response of an $R L$ circuit is pertinent. (This observation will prove helpful later.) When we derived the differential equation for the inductor current, we obtained Eq. 7.29. We now rewrite Eq. 7.29 as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d i}{d t}+\frac{R}{L} i=\frac{V_{s}}{L} \tag{7.48}
\end{equation*}
$$

Observe that Eqs. 7.47 and 7.48 have the same form. Specifically, each equates the sum of the first derivative of the variable and a constant times the variable to a constant value. In Eq. 7.47, the constant on the right-hand side happens to be zero; hence this equation takes on the same form as the natural response equations in Section 7.1. In both Eq. 7.47 and Eq. 7.48, the constant multiplying the dependent variable is the reciprocal of the time constant, that is, $R / L=1 / \tau$. We encounter a similar situation in the derivations for the step response of an $R C$ circuit. In Section 7.4, we will use these observations to develop a general approach to finding the natural and step responses of $R L$ and $R C$ circuits.

### The Step Response of an RC Circuit

We can find the step response of a first-order $R C$ circuit by analyzing the circuit shown in Fig. 7.21. For mathematical convenience, we choose the Norton equivalent of the network connected to the equivalent capacitor. Summing the currents away from the top node in Fig. 7.21 generates the differential equation

$$
\begin{equation*}
C \frac{d v_{C}}{d t}+\frac{v_{C}}{R}=I_{s} \tag{7.49}
\end{equation*}
$$

Division of Eq. 7.49 by $C$ gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d v_{C}}{d t}+\frac{v_{C}}{R C}=\frac{I_{s}}{C} \tag{7.50}
\end{equation*}
$$

Comparing Eq. 7.50 with Eq. 7.48 reveals that the form of the solution for $v_{C}$ is the same as that for the current in the inductive circuit, namely, Eq. 7.35. Therefore, by simply substituting the appropriate variables and coefficients, we can write the solution for $v_{C}$ directly. The translation requires that $I_{s}$ replace $V_{s}, C$ replace $L, 1 / R$ replace $R$, and $V_{0}$ replace $I_{0}$. We get

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{C}=I_{s} R+\left(V_{0}-I_{s} R\right) e^{-t / R C}, \quad t \geq 0 \tag{7.51}
\end{equation*}
$$

A similar derivation for the current in the capacitor yields the differential equation

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d i}{d t}+\frac{1}{R C} i=0 \tag{7.52}
\end{equation*}
$$

Equation 7.52 has the same form as Eq. 7.47 , hence the solution for $i$ is obtained by using the same translations used for the solution of Eq. 7.50. Thus

$$
\begin{equation*}
i=\left(I_{s}-\frac{V_{0}}{R}\right) e^{-t / R C}, \quad t \geq 0^{+} \tag{7.53}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $V_{0}$ is the initial value of $v_{C}$, the voltage across the capacitor.
We obtained Eqs. 7.51 and 7.53 by using a mathematical analogy to the solution for the step response of the inductive circuit. Let's see whether these solutions for the $R C$ circuit make sense in terms of known circuit behavior. From Eq. 7.51, note that the initial voltage across the capacitor is $V_{0}$, the final voltage across the capacitor is $I_{s} R$, and the time constant of the circuit is $R C$. Also note that the solution for $v_{C}$ is valid for $t \geq 0$. These observations are consistent with the behavior of a capacitor in parallel with a resistor when driven by a constant current source.

Equation 7.53 predicts that the current in the capacitor at $t=0^{+}$is $I_{s}-V_{0} / R$. This prediction makes sense because the capacitor voltage cannot change instantaneously, and therefore the initial current in the resistor is $V_{0} / R$. The capacitor branch current changes instantaneously from zero at $t=0^{-}$to $I_{s}-V_{0} / R$ at $t=0^{+}$. The capacitor current is zero at $t=\infty$. Also note that the final value of $v=I_{s} R$.

Example 7.6 illustrates how to use Eqs. 7.51 and 7.53 to find the step response of a first-order $R C$ circuit.

Figure 7.22 - The circuit for Example 7.6.

### Solution

a) The switch has been in position 1 for a long time, so the initial value of $v_{o}$ is $40(60 / 80)$, or 30 V . To take advantage of Eqs. 7.51 and 7.53 , we find the Norton equivalent with respect to the terminals of the capacitor for $t \geq 0$. To do this, we begin by computing the open-circuit voltage, which is given by the -75 V source divided across the $40 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ and $160 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ resistors:

$$
V_{\mathrm{oc}}=\frac{160 \times 10^{3}}{(40+160) \times 10^{3}}(-75)=-60 \mathrm{~V}
$$

Next, we calculate the Thévenin resistance, as seen to the right of the capacitor, by shorting the -75 V source and making series and parallel combinations of the resistors:

$$
R_{\mathrm{Th}}=8000+40,000 \| 160,000=40 \mathrm{k} \Omega
$$

The value of the Norton current source is the ratio of the open-circuit voltage to the Thévenin resistance, or $-60 /\left(40 \times 10^{3}\right)=-1.5 \mathrm{~mA}$. The resulting Norton equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 7.23. From Fig. 7.23, $I_{s} R=-60 \mathrm{~V}$ and $R C=10 \mathrm{~ms}$. We have already noted that $v_{o}(0)=30 \mathrm{~V}$, so the solution for $v_{o}$ is

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_{o} & =-60+[30-(-60)] e^{-100 t} \\
& =-60+90 e^{-100 t} \mathrm{~V}, \quad t \geq 0
\end{aligned}
$$

b) We write the solution for $i_{o}$ directly from Eq. 7.53 by noting that $I_{s}=-1.5 \mathrm{~mA}$ and $V_{o} / R=(30 / 40) \times 10^{-3}$, or 0.75 mA :

$$
i_{o}=-2.25 e^{-100 t} \mathrm{~mA}, \quad t \geq 0^{+}
$$

We check the consistency of the solutions for $v_{o}$ and $i_{o}$ by noting that

$$
\begin{aligned}
i_{o} & =C \frac{d v_{o}}{d t}=\left(0.25 \times 10^{-6}\right)\left(-9000 e^{-100 t}\right) \\
& =-2.25 e^{-100 t} \mathrm{~mA}
\end{aligned}
$$

Because $d v_{o}\left(0^{-}\right) / d t=0$, the expression for $i_{o}$ clearly is valid only for $t \geq 0^{+}$.

### ASSESSMENT PROBLEM

#### Objective 2-Be able to determine the step response of both RL and RC circuits

7.6 a) Find the expression for the voltage across the $160 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ resistor in the circuit shown in Fig. 7.22. Let this voltage be denoted $v_{A}$, and assume that the reference polarity for the voltage is positive at the upper terminal of the $160 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ resistor.

NOTE: Also try Chapter Problems 7.53 and 7.54.

## 7.4 A General Solution for Step and Natural Responses

The general approach to finding either the natural response or the step response of the first-order $R L$ and $R C$ circuits shown in Fig. 7.24 is based on their differential equations having the same form (compare Eq. 7.48 and Eq. 7.50). To generalize the solution of these four possible circuits, we let $x(t)$ represent the unknown quantity, giving $x(t)$ four possible values. It can represent the current or voltage at the terminals of an inductor or the current or voltage at the terminals of a capacitor. From Eqs. 7.47, 7.48, 7.50 , and 7.52 , we know that the differential equation describing any one of the four circuits in Fig. 7.24 takes the form

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d x}{d t}+\frac{x}{\tau}=K \tag{7.54}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the value of the constant $K$ can be zero. Because the sources in the circuit are constant voltages and/or currents, the final value of $x$ will be constant; that is, the final value must satisfy Eq. 7.54, and, when $x$ reaches its final value, the derivative $d x / d t$ must be zero. Hence

$$
\begin{equation*}
x_{f}=K \tau \tag{7.55}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $x_{f}$ represents the final value of the variable.
We solve Eq. 7.54 by separating the variables, beginning by solving for the first derivative:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d x}{d t}=\frac{-x}{\tau}+K=\frac{-(x-K \tau)}{\tau}=\frac{-\left(x-x_{f}\right)}{\tau} \tag{7.56}
\end{equation*}
$$

b) Specify the interval of time for which the expression obtained in (a) is valid.

Answer:
(a) $-60+72 e^{-100 t} \mathrm{~V}$;
(b) $t \geq 0^{+}$.

### General solution for natural and step responses of $R L$ and $R C$ circuits -

Calculating the natural or step response of $R L$ or $R C$ circuits

In writing Eq. 7.56 , we used Eq. 7.55 to substitute $x_{f}$ for $K \tau$. We now multiply both sides of Eq. 7.56 by $d t$ and divide by $x-x_{f}$ to obtain

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d x}{x-x_{f}}=\frac{-1}{\tau} d t \tag{7.57}
\end{equation*}
$$

Next, we integrate Eq. 7.57. To obtain as general a solution as possible, we use time $t_{0}$ as the lower limit and $t$ as the upper limit. Time $t_{0}$ corresponds to the time of the switching or other change. Previously we assumed that $t_{0}=0$, but this change allows the switching to take place at any time. Using $u$ and $v$ as symbols of integration, we get

$$
\begin{equation*}
\int_{x\left(t_{0}\right)}^{x(t)} \frac{d u}{u-x_{f}}=-\frac{1}{\tau} \int_{t_{0}}^{t} d v \tag{7.58}
\end{equation*}
$$

Carrying out the integration called for in Eq. 7.58 gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
x(t)=x_{f}+\left[x\left(t_{0}\right)-x_{f}\right] e^{-\left(t-t_{0}\right) / \tau} \tag{7.59}
\end{equation*}
$$

The importance of Eq. 7.59 becomes apparent if we write it out in words:

$$
\begin{array}{lr}
\text { the unknown } & \text { the final } \\
\text { variable as a } & =\text { value of the } \\
\text { function of time } & \text { variable } \\
+\left[\begin{array}{rr}
\text { the initial } & \text { the final } \\
\text { value of the } & - \text { value of the } \\
\text { variable } & \text { variable }
\end{array}\right] \times e \frac{-[t-\text { (time of switching) }]}{\text { (time constant) }} \tag{7.60}
\end{array}
$$

In many cases, the time of switching-that is, $t_{0}$-is zero.
When computing the step and natural responses of circuits, it may help to follow these steps:

1. Identify the variable of interest for the circuit. For $R C$ circuits, it is most convenient to choose the capacitive voltage; for $R L$ circuits, it is best to choose the inductive current.
2. Determine the initial value of the variable, which is its value at $t_{0}$. Note that if you choose capacitive voltage or inductive current as your variable of interest, it is not necessary to distinguish between $t=t_{0}^{-}$and $t=t_{0}^{+}$. This is because they both are continuous variables. If you choose another variable, you need to remember that its initial value is defined at $t=t_{0}^{+}$.
3. Calculate the final value of the variable, which is its value as $t \rightarrow \infty$.
4. Calculate the time constant for the circuit.

With these quantities, you can use Eq. 7.60 to produce an equation describing the variable of interest as a function of time. You can then find equations for other circuit variables using the circuit analysis techniques introduced in Chapters 3 and 4 or by repeating the preceding steps for the other variables.

Examples 7.7-7.9 illustrate how to use Eq. 7.60 to find the step response of an $R C$ or $R L$ circuit.

### Example 7.7 Using the General Solution Method to Find an RC Circuit's Step Response

The switch in the circuit shown in Fig. 7.25 has been in position a for a long time. At $t=0$ the switch is moved to position b.
a) What is the initial value of $v_{C}$ ?
b) What is the final value of $v_{C}$ ?
c) What is the time constant of the circuit when the switch is in position b?
d) What is the expression for $v_{C}(t)$ when $t \geq 0$ ?
e) What is the expression for $i(t)$ when $t \geq 0^{+}$?
f) How long after the switch is in position b does the capacitor voltage equal zero?
g) Plot $v_{C}(t)$ and $i(t)$ versus $t$.

### Solution

a) The switch has been in position a for a long time, so the capacitor looks like an open circuit. Therefore the voltage across the capacitor is the voltage across the $60 \Omega$ resistor. From the voltagedivider rule, the voltage across the $60 \Omega$ resistor is $40 \times[60 /(60+20)]$, or 30 V . As the reference for $v_{C}$ is positive at the upper terminal of the capacitor, we have $v_{C}(0)=-30 \mathrm{~V}$.
b) After the switch has been in position b for a long time, the capacitor will look like an open circuit in terms of the 90 V source. Thus the final value of the capacitor voltage is +90 V .
c) The time constant is

$$
\begin{aligned}
\tau & =R C \\
& =\left(400 \times 10^{3}\right)\left(0.5 \times 10^{-6}\right) \\
& =0.2 \mathrm{~s}
\end{aligned}
$$

d) Substituting the appropriate values for $v_{f}, v(0)$, and $t$ into Eq. 7.60 yields

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_{C}(t) & =90+(-30-90) e^{-5 t} \\
& =90-120 e^{-5 t} \mathrm{~V}, \quad t \geq 0
\end{aligned}
$$

e) Here the value for $\tau$ doesn't change. Thus we need to find only the initial and final values for the current in the capacitor. When obtaining the initial value, we must get the value of $i\left(0^{+}\right)$, because the current in the capacitor can change instantaneously. This current is equal to the current in the resistor, which from Ohm's law is $[90-(-30)] /\left(400 \times 10^{3}\right)=300 \mu \mathrm{~A}$. Note that when applying Ohm's law we recognized that the
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_9710ae55a6ab0834368ag-032.jpg?height=298&width=733&top_left_y=340&top_left_x=1284)

Figure 7.25 A The circuit for Example 7.7.
capacitor voltage cannot change instantaneously. The final value of $i(t)=0$, so

$$
\begin{aligned}
i(t) & =0+(300-0) e^{-5 t} \\
& =300 e^{-5 t} \mu \mathrm{~A}, \quad t \geq 0^{+}
\end{aligned}
$$

We could have obtained this solution by differentiating the solution in (d) and multiplying by the capacitance. You may want to do so for yourself. Note that this alternative approach to finding $i(t)$ also predicts the discontinuity at $t=0$.
f) To find how long the switch must be in position $b$ before the capacitor voltage becomes zero, we solve the equation derived in (d) for the time when $v_{C}(t)=0$ :

$$
120 e^{-5 t}=90 \quad \text { or } \quad e^{5 t}=\frac{120}{90}
$$

so

$$
\begin{aligned}
t & =\frac{1}{5} \ln \left(\frac{4}{3}\right) \\
& =57.54 \mathrm{~ms}
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that when $v_{C}=0, i=225 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ and the voltage drop across the $400 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ resistor is 90 V .
g) Figure 7.26 shows the graphs of $v_{C}(t)$ and $i(t)$ versus $t$.

### Example 7.8 Using the General Solution Method with Zero Initial Conditions

The switch in the circuit shown in Fig. 7.27 has been open for a long time. The initial charge on the capacitor is zero. At $t=0$, the switch is closed. Find the expression for
a) $i(t)$ for $t \geq 0^{+}$and
b) $v(t)$ when $t \geq 0^{+}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_9710ae55a6ab0834368ag-033.jpg?height=293&width=716&top_left_y=663&top_left_x=248)

Figure 7.27 A The circuit for Example 7.8.

### Solution

a) Because the initial voltage on the capacitor is zero, at the instant when the switch is closed the current in the $30 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ branch will be

$$
\begin{aligned}
i\left(0^{+}\right) & =\frac{(7.5)(20)}{50} \\
& =3 \mathrm{~mA}
\end{aligned}
$$

The final value of the capacitor current will be zero because the capacitor eventually will appear as an open circuit in terms of dc current. Thus $i_{f}=0$. The time constant of the circuit will equal the product of the Thévenin resistance (as seen from the capacitor) and the capacitance.

Therefore $\tau=(20+30) 10^{3}(0.1) \times 10^{-6}=5 \mathrm{~ms}$. Substituting these values into Eq. 7.60 generates the expression

$$
\begin{aligned}
i(t) & =0+(3-0) e^{-t / 5 \times 10^{-3}} \\
& =3 e^{-200 t} \mathrm{~mA}, \quad t \geq 0^{+}
\end{aligned}
$$

b) To find $v(t)$, we note from the circuit that it equals the sum of the voltage across the capacitor and the voltage across the $30 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ resistor. To find the capacitor voltage (which is a drop in the direction of the current), we note that its initial value is zero and its final value is (7.5)(20), or 150 V . The time constant is the same as before, or 5 ms . Therefore we use Eq. 7.60 to write

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_{C}(t) & =150+(0-150) e^{-200 t} \\
& =\left(150-150 e^{-200 t}\right) \mathrm{V}, \quad t \geq 0
\end{aligned}
$$

Hence the expression for the voltage $v(t)$ is

$$
\begin{aligned}
v(t) & =150-150 e^{-200 t}+(30)(3) e^{-200 t} \\
& =\left(150-60 e^{-200 t}\right) \mathrm{V}, \quad t \geq 0^{+}
\end{aligned}
$$

As one check on this expression, note that it predicts the initial value of the voltage across the $20 \Omega$ resistor as $150-60$, or 90 V . The instant the switch is closed, the current in the $20 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ resistor is $(7.5)(30 / 50)$, or 4.5 mA . This current produces a 90 V drop across the $20 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ resistor, confirming the value predicted by the solution.

### Example 7.9 Using the General Solution Method to Find an RL Circuit's Step Response

The switch in the circuit shown in Fig. 7.28 has been open for a long time. At $t=0$ the switch is closed. Find the expression for
a) $v(t)$ when $t \geq 0^{+}$and
b) $i(t)$ when $t \geq 0$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_9710ae55a6ab0834368ag-033.jpg?height=384&width=716&top_left_y=2253&top_left_x=248)

Figure 7.28 ■ The circuit for Example 7.9.

### Solution

a) The switch has been open for a long time, so the initial current in the inductor is 5 A , oriented from top to bottom. Immediately after the switch closes, the current still is 5 A , and therefore the initial voltage across the inductor becomes $20-5(1)$, or 15 V . The final value of the inductor voltage is 0 V . With the switch closed, the time constant is $80 / 1$, or 80 ms . We use Eq. 7.60 to write the expression for $v(t)$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
v(t) & =0+(15-0) e^{-t / 80 \times 10^{-3}} \\
& =15 e^{-12.5 t} \mathrm{~V}, \quad t \geq 0^{+}
\end{aligned}
$$

b) We have already noted that the initial value of the inductor current is 5 A . After the switch has
been closed for a long time, the inductor current reaches $20 / 1$, or 20 A . The circuit time constant is 80 ms , so the expression for $i(t)$ is

$$
\begin{aligned}
i(t) & =20+(5-20) e^{-12.5 t} \\
& =\left(20-15 e^{-12.5 t}\right) \mathrm{A}, \quad t \geq 0
\end{aligned}
$$

We determine that the solutions for $v(t)$ and $i(t)$ agree by noting that

$$
\begin{aligned}
v(t) & =L \frac{d i}{d t} \\
& =80 \times 10^{-3}\left[15(12.5) e^{-12.5 t}\right] \\
& =15 e^{-12.5 t} \mathrm{~V}, \quad t \geq 0^{+}
\end{aligned}
$$

NOTE: Assess your understanding of the general solution method by trying Chapter Problems 7.51 and 7.53.

Example 7.10 shows that Eq. 7.60 can even be used to find the step response of some circuits containing magnetically coupled coils.

### Example 7.10 Determining Step Response of a Circuit with Magnetically Coupled Coils

There is no energy stored in the circuit in Fig. 7.29 at the time the switch is closed.
a) Find the solutions for $i_{o}, v_{o}, i_{1}$, and $i_{2}$.
b) Show that the solutions obtained in (a) make sense in terms of known circuit behavior.

### Solution

a) For the circuit in Fig. 7.29, the magnetically coupled coils can be replaced by a single inductor having an inductance of

$$
L_{\mathrm{eq}}=\frac{L_{1} L_{2}-M^{2}}{L_{1}+L_{2}-2 M}=\frac{45-36}{18-12}=1.5 \mathrm{H}
$$

(See Problem 6.41.) It follows that the circuit in Fig. 7.29 can be simplified as shown in Fig. 7.30.

By hypothesis the initial value of $i_{o}$ is zero. From Fig. 7.30 we see that the final value of $i_{o}$ will be $120 / 7.5$ or 16 A . The time constant of the circuit is $1.5 / 7.5$ or 0.2 s . It follows directly from Eq. 7.60 that

$$
i_{o}=16-16 e^{-5 t} \mathrm{~A}, \quad t \geq 0
$$

The voltage $v_{o}$ follows from Kirchhoff's voltage law. Thus,

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_{o} & =120-7.5 i_{o} \\
& =120 e^{-5 t} \mathrm{~V}, \quad t \geq 0^{+}
\end{aligned}
$$

To find $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$ we first note from
Fig. 7.29 that

$$
3 \frac{d i_{1}}{d t}+6 \frac{d i_{2}}{d t}=6 \frac{d i_{1}}{d t}+15 \frac{d i_{2}}{d t}
$$

or

$$
\frac{d i_{1}}{d t}=-3 \frac{d i_{2}}{d t}
$$

Figure $7.30 \triangle$ The circuit in Fig. 7.29 with the magnetically coupled coils replaced by an equivalent coil.

It also follows from Fig. 7.29 that because $i_{o}=i_{1}+i_{2}$,

$$
\frac{d i_{o}}{d t}=\frac{d i_{1}}{d t}+\frac{d i_{2}}{d t}
$$

Therefore

$$
80 e^{-5 t}=-2 \frac{d i_{2}}{d t}
$$

Because $i_{2}(0)$ is zero we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
i_{2} & =\int_{0}^{t}-40 e^{-5 x} d x \\
& =-8+8 e^{-5 t} \mathrm{~A}, \quad t \geq 0
\end{aligned}
$$

Using Kirchhoff's current law we get

$$
i_{1}=24-24 e^{-5 t} \mathrm{~A}, \quad t \geq 0
$$

b) First we observe that $i_{o}(0), i_{1}(0)$, and $i_{2}(0)$ are all zero, which is consistent with the statement that
no energy is stored in the circuit at the instant the switch is closed.

Next we observe $v_{o}\left(0^{+}\right)=120 \mathrm{~V}$, which is consistent with the fact that $i_{o}(0)=0$.

Now we observe the solutions for $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$ are consistent with the solution for $v_{o}$ by observing

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_{o} & =3 \frac{d i_{1}}{d t}+6 \frac{d i_{2}}{d t} \\
& =360 e^{-5 t}-240 e^{-5 t} \\
& =120 e^{-5 t} \mathrm{~V}, \quad t \geq 0^{+}
\end{aligned}
$$

or

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_{o} & =6 \frac{d i_{1}}{d t}+15 \frac{d i_{2}}{d t} \\
& =720 e^{-5 t}-600 e^{-5 t} \\
& =120 e^{-5 t} \mathrm{~V}, \quad t \geq 0^{+}
\end{aligned}
$$

The final values of $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$ can be checked using flux linkages. The flux linking the 3 H coil $\left(\lambda_{1}\right)$ must be equal to the flux linking the 15 H coil $\left(\lambda_{2}\right)$, because

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_{o} & =\frac{d \lambda_{1}}{d t} \\
& =\frac{d \lambda_{2}}{d t}
\end{aligned}
$$

Now

$$
\lambda_{1}=3 i_{1}+6 i_{2} \mathrm{~Wb} \text {-turns }
$$

and

$$
\lambda_{2}=6 i_{1}+15 i_{2} \text { Wb-turns. }
$$

Regardless of which expression we use, we obtain

$$
\lambda_{1}=\lambda_{2}=24-24 e^{-5 t} \mathrm{~Wb} \text {-turns. }
$$

Note the solution for $\lambda_{1}$ or $\lambda_{2}$ is consistent with the solution for $v_{o}$.

The final value of the flux linking either coil 1 or coil 2 is 24 Wb -turns, that is,

$$
\lambda_{1}(\infty)=\lambda_{2}(\infty)=24 \text { Wb-turns. }
$$

The final value of $i_{1}$ is

$$
i_{1}(\infty)=24 \mathrm{~A}
$$

and the final value of $i_{2}$ is

$$
i_{2}(\infty)=-8 \mathrm{~A}
$$

The consistency between these final values for $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$ and the final value of the flux linkage can be seen from the expressions:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\lambda_{1}(\infty) & =3 i_{1}(\infty)+6 i_{2}(\infty) \\
& =3(24)+6(-8)=24 \text { Wb-turns } \\
\lambda_{2}(\infty) & =6 i_{1}(\infty)+15 i_{2}(\infty) \\
& =6(24)+15(-8)=24 \mathrm{~Wb}-\text { turns. }
\end{aligned}
$$

It is worth noting that the final values of $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$ can only be checked via flux linkage because at $t=\infty$ the two coils are ideal short circuits. The division of current between ideal short circuits cannot be found from Ohm's law.

NOTE: Assess your understanding of this material by using the general solution method to solve Chapter Problems 7.68 and 7.71.

## 7.5 Sequential Switching

Whenever switching occurs more than once in a circuit, we have sequential switching. For example, a single, two-position switch may be switched back and forth, or multiple switches may be opened or closed in sequence. The time reference for all switchings cannot be $t=0$. We determine the voltages and currents generated by a switching sequence by using the techniques described previously in this chapter. We derive the expressions for $v(t)$ and $i(t)$ for a given position of the switch or switches and then use these solutions to determine the initial conditions for the next position of the switch or switches.

With sequential switching problems, a premium is placed on obtaining the initial value $x\left(t_{0}\right)$. Recall that anything but inductive currents and capacitive voltages can change instantaneously at the time of switching. Thus solving first for inductive currents and capacitive voltages is even more pertinent in sequential switching problems. Drawing the circuit that pertains to each time interval in such a problem is often helpful in the solution process.

Examples 7.11 and 7.12 illustrate the analysis techniques for circuits with sequential switching. The first is a natural response problem with two switching times, and the second is a step response problem.

### Example 7.11 Analyzing an RL Circuit that has Sequential Switching

The two switches in the circuit shown in Fig. 7.31 have been closed for a long time. At $t=0$, switch 1 is opened. Then, 35 ms later, switch 2 is opened.
a) Find $i_{L}(t)$ for $0 \leq t \leq 35 \mathrm{~ms}$.
b) Find $i_{L}$ for $t \geq 35 \mathrm{~ms}$.
c) What percentage of the initial energy stored in the 150 mH inductor is dissipated in the $18 \Omega$ resistor?
d) Repeat (c) for the $3 \Omega$ resistor.
e) Repeat (c) for the $6 \Omega$ resistor.

Figure $7.31 \Delta$ The circuit for Example 7.11.

### Solution

a) For $t<0$ both switches are closed, causing the 150 mH inductor to short-circuit the $18 \Omega$ resistor. The equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 7.32. We determine the initial current in the inductor by solving for $i_{L}\left(0^{-}\right)$in the circuit shown in Fig. 7.32. After making several source transformations, we find $i_{L}\left(0^{-}\right)$to be 6 A . For $0 \leq t \leq 35 \mathrm{~ms}$, switch 1 is open (switch 2 is closed), which disconnects the 60 V voltage source and the $4 \Omega$ and $12 \Omega$ resistors from the circuit. The inductor is no longer behaving as a short circuit (because the dc source is no longer in the circuit), so the $18 \Omega$ resistor is no longer short-circuited. The equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 7.33. Note that the equivalent resistance across the terminals of the inductor is the parallel combination of $9 \Omega$ and $18 \Omega$, or $6 \Omega$. The time constant of the circuit is $(150 / 6) \times 10^{-3}$, or 25 ms . Therefore the expression for $i_{L}$ is

$$
i_{L}=6 e^{-40 t} \mathrm{~A}, \quad 0 \leq t \leq 35 \mathrm{~ms}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_9710ae55a6ab0834368ag-036.jpg?height=275&width=696&top_left_y=569&top_left_x=1276)

Figure 7.32 - The circuit shown in Fig. 7.31, for $t<0$.

b) When $t=35 \mathrm{~ms}$, the value of the inductor current is

$$
i_{L}=6 e^{-1.4}=1.48 \mathrm{~A}
$$

Thus, when switch 2 is opened, the circuit reduces to the one shown in Fig. 7.34, and the time constant changes to $(150 / 9) \times 10^{-3}$, or 16.67 ms . The expression for $i_{L}$ becomes

$$
i_{L}=1.48 e^{-60(t-0.035)} \mathrm{A}, \quad t \geq 35 \mathrm{~ms}
$$

Note that the exponential function is shifted in time by 35 ms .
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_9710ae55a6ab0834368ag-036.jpg?height=272&width=588&top_left_y=1963&top_left_x=1336)

Figure $7.34 \boldsymbol{\Delta}$ The circuit shown in Fig. 7.31, for $t \geq 35 \mathrm{~ms}$.
c) The $18 \Omega$ resistor is in the circuit only during the first 35 ms of the switching sequence. During this interval, the voltage across the resistor is

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_{L} & =0.15 \frac{d}{d t}\left(6 e^{-40 t}\right) \\
& =-36 e^{-40 t} \mathrm{~V}, \quad 0<t<35 \mathrm{~ms}
\end{aligned}
$$

The power dissipated in the $18 \Omega$ resistor is

$$
p=\frac{v_{L}^{2}}{18}=72 e^{-80 t} \mathrm{~W}, \quad 0<t<35 \mathrm{~ms}
$$

Hence the energy dissipated is

$$
\begin{aligned}
w & =\int_{0}^{0.035} 72 e^{-80 t} d t \\
& =\left.\frac{72}{-80} e^{-80 t}\right|_{0} ^{0.035} \\
& =0.9\left(1-e^{-2.8}\right) \\
& =845.27 \mathrm{~mJ}
\end{aligned}
$$

The initial energy stored in the 150 mH inductor is

$$
w_{i}=\frac{1}{2}(0.15)(36)=2.7 \mathrm{~J}=2700 \mathrm{~mJ}
$$

Therefore $(845.27 / 2700) \times 100$, or $31.31 \%$ of the initial energy stored in the 150 mH inductor is dissipated in the $18 \Omega$ resistor.
d) For $0<t<35 \mathrm{~ms}$, the voltage across the $3 \Omega$ resistor is

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_{3 \Omega} & =\left(\frac{v_{L}}{9}\right)(3) \\
& =\frac{1}{3} v_{L} \\
& =-12 e^{-40 t} \mathrm{~V}
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore the energy dissipated in the $3 \Omega$ resistor in the first 35 ms is

$$
\begin{aligned}
w_{3 \Omega} & =\int_{0}^{0.035} \frac{144 e^{-80 t}}{3} d t \\
& =0.6\left(1-e^{-2.8}\right) \\
& =563.51 \mathrm{~mJ}
\end{aligned}
$$

For $t>35 \mathrm{~ms}$, the current in the $3 \Omega$ resistor is

$$
i_{3 \Omega}=i_{L}=\left(6 e^{-1.4}\right) e^{-60(t-0.035)} \mathrm{A}
$$

Hence the energy dissipated in the $3 \Omega$ resistor for $t>35 \mathrm{~ms}$ is

$$
\begin{aligned}
w_{3 \Omega} & =\int_{0.035}^{\infty} i_{3 \Omega}^{2} \times 3 d t \\
& =\int_{0.035}^{\infty} 3(36) e^{-2.8} e^{-120(t-0.035)} d t \\
& =108 e^{-2.8} \times\left.\frac{e^{-120(t-0.035)}}{-120}\right|_{0.035} ^{\infty} \\
& =\frac{108}{120} e^{-2.8}=54.73 \mathrm{~mJ}
\end{aligned}
$$

The total energy dissipated in the $3 \Omega$ resistor is

$$
\begin{aligned}
w_{3 \Omega}(\text { total }) & =563.51+54.73 \\
& =618.24 \mathrm{~mJ}
\end{aligned}
$$

The percentage of the initial energy stored is

$$
\frac{618.24}{2700} \times 100=22.90 \%
$$

e) Because the $6 \Omega$ resistor is in series with the $3 \Omega$ resistor, the energy dissipated and the percentage of the initial energy stored will be twice that of the $3 \Omega$ resistor:

$$
w_{6 \Omega}(\text { total })=1236.48 \mathrm{~mJ}
$$

and the percentage of the initial energy stored is $45.80 \%$. We check these calculations by observing that

$$
1236.48+618.24+845.27=2699.99 \mathrm{~mJ}
$$

and

$$
31.31+22.90+45.80=100.01 \%
$$

The small discrepancies in the summations are the result of roundoff errors.

### Example 7.12 Analyzing an RC Circuit that has Sequential Switching

The uncharged capacitor in the circuit shown in Fig. 7.35 is initially switched to terminal a of the three-position switch. At $t=0$, the switch is moved to position b, where it remains for 15 ms . After the 15 ms delay, the switch is moved to position c , where it remains indefinitely.
a) Derive the numerical expression for the voltage across the capacitor.
b) Plot the capacitor voltage versus time.
c) When will the voltage on the capacitor equal 200 V ?

### Solution

a) At the instant the switch is moved to position b, the initial voltage on the capacitor is zero. If the switch were to remain in position b, the capacitor would eventually charge to 400 V . The time constant of the circuit when the switch is in position $b$ is 10 ms . Therefore we can use Eq. 7.59 with $t_{0}=0$ to write the expression for the capacitor voltage:

$$
\begin{aligned}
v & =400+(0-400) e^{-100 t} \\
& =\left(400-400 e^{-100 t}\right) \mathrm{V}, \quad 0 \leq t \leq 15 \mathrm{~ms}
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that, because the switch remains in position b for only 15 ms , this expression is valid only for the time interval from 0 to 15 ms . After the switch has been in this position for 15 ms , the voltage on the capacitor will be

$$
v(15 \mathrm{~ms})=400-400 e^{-1.5}=310.75 \mathrm{~V}
$$

Therefore, when the switch is moved to position c , the initial voltage on the capacitor is 310.75 V . With the switch in position c , the final value of the capacitor voltage is zero, and the time constant is 5 ms . Again, we use Eq. 7.59 to write the expression for the capacitor voltage:

$$
\begin{aligned}
v & =0+(310.75-0) e^{-200(t-0.015)} \\
& =310.75 e^{-200(t-0.015)} \mathrm{V}, \quad 15 \mathrm{~ms} \leq t
\end{aligned}
$$

Figure 7.35 A The circuit for Example 7.12.

In writing the expression for $v$, we recognized that $t_{0}=15 \mathrm{~ms}$ and that this expression is valid only for $t \geq 15 \mathrm{~ms}$.
b) Figure 7.36 shows the plot of $v$ versus $t$.
c) The plot in Fig. 7.36 reveals that the capacitor voltage will equal 200 V at two different times: once in the interval between 0 and 15 ms and once after 15 ms . We find the first time by solving the expression

$$
200=400-400 e^{-100 t_{1}}
$$

which yields $t_{1}=6.93 \mathrm{~ms}$. We find the second time by solving the expression

$$
200=310.75 e^{-200\left(t_{2}-0.015\right)}
$$

In this case, $t_{2}=17.20 \mathrm{~ms}$.

Answer: (a) $\left(3-3 e^{-0.5 t}\right) \mathrm{A}, 0 \leq t \leq 1 \mathrm{~s}$;
(b) $\left(-4.8+5.98 e^{-1.25(t-1)}\right) \mathrm{A}, t \geq 1 \mathrm{~s}$.

## 7.6 Unbounded Response

A circuit response may grow, rather than decay, exponentially with time. This type of response, called an unbounded response, is possible if the circuit contains dependent sources. In that case, the Thévenin equivalent resistance with respect to the terminals of either an inductor or a capacitor may be negative. This negative resistance generates a negative time constant, and the resulting currents and voltages increase without limit. In an actual circuit, the response eventually reaches a limiting value when a component breaks down or goes into a saturation state, prohibiting further increases in voltage or current.

When we consider unbounded responses, the concept of a final value is confusing. Hence, rather than using the step response solution given in Eq. 7.59 , we derive the differential equation that describes the circuit containing the negative resistance and then solve it using the separation of variables technique. Example 7.13 presents an exponentially growing response in terms of the voltage across a capacitor.

### Example 7.13 Finding the Unbounded Response in an RC Circuit

a) When the switch is closed in the circuit shown in Fig. 7.37, the voltage on the capacitor is 10 V . Find the expression for $v_{o}$ for $t \geq 0$.
b) Assume that the capacitor short-circuits when its terminal voltage reaches 150 V . How many milliseconds elapse before the capacitor shortcircuits?
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_9710ae55a6ab0834368ag-040.jpg?height=302&width=704&top_left_y=684&top_left_x=320)

Figure 7.37 The circuit for Example 7.13.

### Solution

a) To find the Thévenin equivalent resistance with respect to the capacitor terminals, we use the testsource method described in Chapter 4. Figure 7.38 shows the resulting circuit, where $v_{T}$ is the test voltage and $i_{T}$ is the test current. For $v_{T}$ expressed in volts, we obtain

$$
i_{T}=\frac{v_{T}}{10}-7\left(\frac{v_{T}}{20}\right)+\frac{v_{T}}{20} \mathrm{~mA}
$$

Solving for the ratio $v_{T} / i_{T}$ yields the Thévenin resistance:

$$
R_{\mathrm{Th}}=\frac{v_{T}}{i_{T}}=-5 \mathrm{k} \Omega
$$

With this Thévenin resistance, we can simplify the circuit shown in Fig. 7.37 to the one shown in Fig. 7.39.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_9710ae55a6ab0834368ag-040.jpg?height=668&width=696&top_left_y=361&top_left_x=1275)

Figure $7.39 \triangle$ A simplification of the circuit shown in Fig. 7.37.

For $t \geq 0$, the differential equation describing the circuit shown in Fig. 7.39 is

$$
\left(5 \times 10^{-6}\right) \frac{d v_{o}}{d t}-\frac{v_{o}}{5} \times 10^{-3}=0
$$

Dividing by the coefficient of the first derivative yields

$$
\frac{d v_{o}}{d t}-40 v_{o}=0
$$

We now use the separation of variables technique to find $v_{o}(t)$ :

$$
v_{o}(t)=10 e^{40 t} \mathrm{~V}, \quad t \geq 0
$$

b) $v_{o}=150 \mathrm{~V}$ when $e^{40 t}=15$. Therefore, $40 t=\ln 15$, and $t=67.70 \mathrm{~ms}$.

NOTE: Assess your understanding of this material by trying Chapter Problems 7.86 and 7.88.

The fact that interconnected circuit elements may lead to everincreasing currents and voltages is important to engineers. If such interconnections are unintended, the resulting circuit may experience unexpected, and potentially dangerous, component failures.

## 7.7 The Integrating Amplifier

Recall from the introduction to Chapter 5 that one reason for our interest in the operational amplifier is its use as an integrating amplifier. We are now ready to analyze an integrating-amplifier circuit, which is shown in Fig. 7.40. The purpose of such a circuit is to generate an output voltage proportional to the integral of the input voltage. In Fig. 7.40, we added the branch currents $i_{f}$ and $i_{s}$, along with the node voltages $v_{n}$ and $v_{p}$, to aid our analysis.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_9710ae55a6ab0834368ag-040.jpg?height=370&width=747&top_left_y=2240&top_left_x=1371)

Figure $7.40 \triangle$ An integrating amplifier.

Figure 7.41 $\triangle$ An input voltage signal.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_08_9710ae55a6ab0834368ag-041.jpg?height=330&width=699&top_left_y=2237&top_left_x=171)

Figure $7.42 \triangle$ The output voltage of an integrating amplifier.

We assume that the operational amplifier is ideal. Thus we take advantage of the constraints

$$
\begin{align*}
i_{f}+i_{s} & =0  \tag{7.61}\\
v_{n} & =v_{p} \tag{7.62}
\end{align*}
$$

Because $v_{p}=0$,

$$
\begin{align*}
i_{s} & =\frac{v_{s}}{R_{s}}  \tag{7.63}\\
i_{f} & =C_{f} \frac{d v_{o}}{d t} \tag{7.64}
\end{align*}
$$

Hence, from Eqs. 7.61, 7.63, and 7.64,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d v_{o}}{d t}=-\frac{1}{R_{s} C_{f}} v_{s} \tag{7.65}
\end{equation*}
$$

Multiplying both sides of Eq. 7.65 by a differential time $d t$ and then integrating from $t_{0}$ to $t$ generates the equation

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{o}(t)=-\frac{1}{R_{s} C_{f}} \int_{t_{0}}^{t} v_{s} d y+v_{o}\left(t_{0}\right) \tag{7.66}
\end{equation*}
$$

In Eq. 7.66, $t_{0}$ represents the instant in time when we begin the integration. Thus $v_{o}\left(t_{0}\right)$ is the value of the output voltage at that time. Also, because $v_{n}=v_{p}=0, v_{o}\left(t_{0}\right)$ is identical to the initial voltage on the feedback capacitor $C_{f}$.

Equation 7.66 states that the output voltage of an integrating amplifier equals the initial value of the voltage on the capacitor plus an inverted (minus sign), scaled $\left(1 / R_{s} C_{f}\right)$ replica of the integral of the input voltage. If no energy is stored in the capacitor when integration commences, Eq. 7.66 reduces to

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{o}(t)=-\frac{1}{R_{s} C_{f}} \int_{t_{0}}^{t} v_{s} d y \tag{7.67}
\end{equation*}
$$

If $v_{s}$ is a step change in a dc voltage level, the output voltage will vary linearly with time. For example, assume that the input voltage is the rectangular voltage pulse shown in Fig. 7.41. Assume also that the initial value of $v_{o}(t)$ is zero at the instant $v_{s}$ steps from 0 to $V_{m}$. A direct application of Eq. 7.66 yields

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{o}=-\frac{1}{R_{s} C_{f}} V_{m} t+0, \quad 0 \leq t \leq t_{1} \tag{7.68}
\end{equation*}
$$

When $t$ lies between $t_{1}$ and $2 t_{1}$,

$$
\begin{align*}
v_{o} & =-\frac{1}{R_{s} C_{f}} \int_{t_{1}}^{t}\left(-V_{m}\right) d y-\frac{1}{R_{s} C_{f}} V_{m} t_{1} \\
& =\frac{V_{m}}{R_{s} C_{f}} t-\frac{2 V_{m}}{R_{s} C_{f}} t_{1}, \quad t_{1} \leq t \leq 2 t_{1} \tag{7.69}
\end{align*}
$$

Figure 7.42 shows a sketch of $v_{o}(t)$ versus $t$. Clearly, the output voltage is an inverted, scaled replica of the integral of the input voltage.

The output voltage is proportional to the integral of the input voltage only if the op amp operates within its linear range, that is, if it doesn't saturate. Examples 7.14 and 7.15 further illustrate the analysis of the integrating amplifier.

### Example 7.14 Analyzing an Integrating Amplifier

Assume that the numerical values for the signal voltage shown in Fig. 7.41 are $V_{m}=50 \mathrm{mV}$ and $t_{1}=1 \mathrm{~s}$. This signal voltage is applied to the integrating-amplifier circuit shown in Fig. 7.40. The circuit parameters of the amplifier are $R_{s}=100 \mathrm{k} \Omega$, $C_{f}=0.1 \mu \mathrm{~F}$, and $V_{C C}=6 \mathrm{~V}$. The initial voltage on the capacitor is zero.
a) Calculate $v_{o}(t)$.
b) Plot $v_{o}(t)$ versus $t$.

### Solution

### Example 7.15 Analyzing an Integrating Amplifier that has Sequential Switching

At the instant the switch makes contact with terminal a in the circuit shown in Fig. 7.44, the voltage on the $0.1 \mu \mathrm{~F}$ capacitor is 5 V . The switch remains at terminal a for 9 ms and then moves instantaneously to terminal b. How many milliseconds after making contact with terminal $b$ does the operational amplifier saturate?

Figure $7.44 \boldsymbol{4}$ The circuit for Example 7.15.

### Solution

The expression for the output voltage during the time the switch is at terminal a is

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_{o} & =-5-\frac{1}{10^{-2}} \int_{0}^{t}(-10) d y \\
& =(-5+1000 t) \mathrm{V}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, 9 ms after the switch makes contact with terminal a, the output voltage is $-5+9$, or 4 V .

The expression for the output voltage after the switch moves to terminal $b$ is

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_{o} & =4-\frac{1}{10^{-2}} \int_{9 \times 10^{-3}}^{t} 8 d y \\
& =4-800\left(t-9 \times 10^{-3}\right) \\
& =(11.2-800 t) \mathrm{V}
\end{aligned}
$$

During this time interval, the voltage is decreasing, and the operational amplifier eventually saturates at -6 V . Therefore we set the expression for $v_{o}$ equal to -6 V to obtain the saturation time $t_{s}$ :

$$
11.2-800 t_{s}=-6,
$$

or

$$
t_{s}=21.5 \mathrm{~ms}
$$

Thus the integrating amplifier saturates 21.5 ms after making contact with terminal b.

From the examples, we see that the integrating amplifier can perform the integration function very well, but only within specified limits that avoid saturating the op amp. The op amp saturates due to the accumulation of charge on the feedback capacitor. We can prevent it from saturating by placing a resistor in parallel with the feedback capacitor. We examine such a circuit in Chapter 8.

Note that we can convert the integrating amplifier to a differentiating amplifier by interchanging the input resistance $R_{s}$ and the feedback capacitor $C_{f}$. Then

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{o}=-R_{s} C_{f} \frac{d v_{s}}{d t} \tag{7.70}
\end{equation*}
$$

We leave the derivation of Eq. 7.70 as an exercise for you. The differentiating amplifier is seldom used because in practice it is a source of unwanted or noisy signals.

Finally, we can design both integrating- and differentiating-amplifier circuits by using an inductor instead of a capacitor. However, fabricating capacitors for integrated-circuit devices is much easier, so inductors are rarely used in integrating amplifiers.

Practical Perspective

### Artificial Pacemaker

We are now ready to analyze a simple RC circuit, shown in Fig. 7.45, which can generate periodic electrical impulses. This RC circuit can be used in an artificial pacemaker to establish a normal heart rhythm. The box labeled "controller" behaves as an open circuit until the voltage drop across the capacitor reaches a pre-set limit. Once that limit is reached, the capacitor discharges its stored energy in the form of an electrical impulse to the heart and starts to recharge and the process repeats.

Before we develop the analytical expressions that describe the behavior of the circuit, let us develop a feel for how that circuit works. First, when the controller behaves as an open circuit, the dc voltage source will charge the capacitor via the resistor $R$, toward a value of $V_{s}$ volts. But once the capacitor voltage reaches $V_{\max }$, the controller behaves like a short circuit, enabling the capacitor to discharge. Once the capacitor discharge is complete, the controller once again acts as an open circuit and the capacitor starts to recharge. This cycle of charging and discharging the capacitor establishes the desired heart rhythm, as shown in Fig. 7.46.

Figure $7.46 \boldsymbol{\Delta}$ Capacitor voltage versus time for the circuit in Fig. 7.45.

In drawing Fig. 7.46 we have chosen $t=0$ at the instant the capacitor starts to charge. This figure also assumes that the circuit has reached the repetitive stage of its operation, and that the time to discharge the capacitor is negligible when compared to the recharge time. The design of this artificial pacemaker circuit requires an equation for $v_{C}(t)$ as a function of $V_{\text {max }}, R$, and $C$.

To begin the analysis, we assume that the circuit has been in operation for a long time. Let $t=0$ at the instant when the capacitor has completely discharged and the controller is acting as an open circuit. From the circuit we find

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_{C}(\infty) & =V_{s^{\prime}} \\
v_{C}(0) & =0 \\
\tau & =R C .
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, while the capacitor is charging,

$$
v_{C}(t)=V_{s}\left(1-e^{-t / R C}\right)
$$

Suppose the controller has been programmed to fire an electrical pulse to stimulate the heart when $v_{C}=0.75 \mathrm{~V}_{s}$. Given values of $R$ and $C$ we can determine the resulting heart rate in beats per minute as follows:

$$
H=\frac{60}{-R C \ln 0.25}[\text { beats per minute }]
$$

A more realistic design problem requires you to calculate the value of resistance, $R$, given $V_{\max }$ as a percentage of $V_{s}, C$, and the desired heart rate in beats per minute. We leave you to develop an equation for resistance in Problem 7.106.

## Summary

- A first-order circuit may be reduced to a Thévenin (or Norton) equivalent connected to either a single equivalent inductor or capacitor. (See page 214.)
- The natural response is the currents and voltages that exist when stored energy is released to a circuit that contains no independent sources. (See page 212.)
- The time constant of an $R L$ circuit equals the equivalent inductance divided by the Thévenin resistance as viewed from the terminals of the equivalent inductor. (See page 216.)
- The time constant of an $R C$ circuit equals the equivalent capacitance times the Thévenin resistance as viewed from the terminals of the equivalent capacitor. (See page 221.)
- The step response is the currents and voltages that result from abrupt changes in dc sources connected to a circuit. Stored energy may or may not be present at the time the abrupt changes take place. (See page 224.)
- The solution for either the natural or step response of both $R L$ and $R C$ circuits involves finding the initial and final value of the current or voltage of interest and the time constant of the circuit. Equations 7.59 and 7.60 summarize this approach. (See page 232.)
- Sequential switching in first-order circuits is analyzed by dividing the analysis into time intervals corresponding to specific switch positions. Initial values for a particular interval are determined from the solution corresponding to the immediately preceding interval. (See page 236.)
- An unbounded response occurs when the Thévenin resistance is negative, which is possible when the first-order circuit contains dependent sources. (See page 240.)
- An integrating amplifier consists of an ideal op amp, a capacitor in the negative feedback branch, and a resistor in series with the signal source. It outputs the integral of the signal source, within specified limits that avoid saturating the op amp. (See page 241.)
