The natural response occurs when stored energy in an inductor or capacitor is suddenly released to a resistive network, typically when the inductor or capacitor is abruptly disconnected from its dc source. This response is determined by the nature of the circuit itself, without external sources of excitation. In contrast, the step response arises when energy is being acquired by an inductor or capacitor due to the sudden application of a dc voltage or current source. The step response involves the circuit's reaction to an external change."

This time constant is a measure of how quickly the current and voltage in the circuit decay to zero after the switch is opened.

Specifically, the current $i(t)$ at any time $t$ can be expressed as $i(t) = I_0 e^{-\\frac{t}{\\tau}}$ for $t \\geq 0$, and the voltage $v(t)$ across the resistor can be written as $v(t) = I_0 R e^{-\\frac{t}{\\tau}}$ for $t \\geq 0^+$.

Conversely, a smaller time constant, resulting from a smaller inductance or larger resistance, leads to a faster decay. The time constant thus provides a straightforward way to understand and predict how quickly the circuit will reach its new steady state (which is typically zero current and voltage in this scenario) after the switch is opened."

This means that when the power is cut off (the switch is opened), it will take approximately 5 seconds for the current to drop to 37% of its initial value. This information is crucial for designing the control system, as it ensures that the valve closes smoothly without abrupt changes, which could cause mechanical stress or operational issues."
