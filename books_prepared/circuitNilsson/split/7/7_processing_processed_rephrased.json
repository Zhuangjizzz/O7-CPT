Determine the natural response of both RL and RC circuits.\n2. Determine the step response of both RL and RC circuits.\n3. Analyze circuits with sequential switching.\n4. Analyze op amp circuits containing resistors and a single capacitor.\n\nResponse of First-Order RL and RC Circuits\n\nIn Chapter 6, we highlighted that inductors and capacitors possess the crucial ability to store energy. We are now equipped to explore the currents and voltages that emerge when energy is either released or acquired by an inductor or capacitor in response to a sudden change in a dc voltage or current source. This chapter focuses on circuits comprising sources, resistors, and either inductors or capacitors, but not both. For simplicity, these configurations are termed RL (resistor-inductor) and RC (resistor-capacitor) circuits.\n\nOur analysis of RL and RC circuits will be segmented into three stages. Initially, we examine the currents and voltages resulting from the sudden release of stored energy in an inductor or capacitor to a resistive network, which occurs when the inductor or capacitor is abruptly disconnected from its dc source. This reduces the circuit to one of the two equivalent forms depicted in Fig. 7.1 on page 214. The resulting currents and voltages are termed the natural response of the circuit, emphasizing that the circuit's inherent nature, not external excitations, dictates its behavior.\n\nIn the second stage, we investigate the currents and voltages that arise when energy is being acquired by an inductor or capacitor due to the sudden application of a dc voltage or current source, known as the step response. The methodology for determining both the natural and step responses is identical; hence, in the third stage, we develop a universal approach applicable to any abrupt change in a dc voltage or current source affecting RL and RC circuits.\n\nFigure 7.2 on page 214 illustrates the four potential configurations of RL and RC circuits. Note that in the absence of independent sources, the Thévenin voltage or Norton current is zero, simplifying the circuit to one of those shown in Fig. 7.1, indicating a natural-response scenario.\n\nPractical Perspective\n\nArtificial Pacemaker\n\nThe heart muscle contracts due to rhythmic electrical impulses, with the frequency of these impulses regulated by pacemaker cells. In adults, these cells maintain a resting heart rate of approximately 72 beats per minute. However, damage to pacemaker cells can result in either a very low resting heart rate (bradycardia) or a very high resting heart rate (tachycardia). An artificial pacemaker, which mimics the function of pacemaker cells by delivering electrical impulses to the heart, can restore normal heart rhythm. Examples of artificial pacemakers, both external and internal, are depicted in the accompanying figures.\n\nArtificial pacemakers are compact and lightweight, featuring a programmable microprocessor that monitors key parameters and adjusts the heart rate, a long-lasting battery (up to 15 years), and circuitry that generates pulses. The simplest circuit consists of a resistor and a capacitor. Once we introduce the first-order RC circuit, we will explore an RC circuit design relevant to artificial pacemakers.\n\nimage_name:Pacemaker outside the body\ndescription:\n1. **Identification of Components and Structure:**\n   - The first diagram depicts a pacemaker device with labeled components.

Analyze op amp circuits containing resistors and a single capacitor.\n\n**Response of First-Order RL and RC Circuits**\n\nIn Chapter 6, we highlighted that inductors and capacitors can store energy. We are now equipped to determine the currents and voltages resulting from energy release or acquisition by these components due to sudden changes in dc voltage or current sources. This chapter focuses on circuits comprising sources, resistors, and either inductors or capacitors, termed RL (resistor-inductor) and RC (resistor-capacitor) circuits.\n\nOur analysis of RL and RC circuits is divided into three stages. Initially, we examine the currents and voltages when stored energy in an inductor or capacitor is suddenly released to a resistive network, occurring when the component is abruptly disconnected from its dc source. This reduces the circuit to one of two forms shown in Fig. 7.1 on page 214, termed the natural response, emphasizing the circuit's inherent behavior.\n\nIn the second stage, we consider the currents and voltages when energy is acquired by an inductor or capacitor due to a sudden dc voltage or current source application, known as the step response. The process for determining both responses is identical, leading to the third stage where we develop a general method for analyzing RL and RC circuits under any abrupt dc voltage or current source change.\n\nFig. 7.2 on page 214 illustrates the four general RL and RC circuit configurations. Note that without independent sources, the Thévenin voltage or Norton current is zero, reducing the circuit to a natural-response scenario as in Fig. 7.1.\n\n**Practical Perspective**\n\n**Artificial Pacemaker**\n\nThe heart muscle contracts due to rhythmic electrical impulses, with their frequency controlled by pacemaker cells. In adults, these cells maintain a resting heart rate of approximately 72 beats per minute. Damaged pacemaker cells can cause bradycardia (low heart rate) or tachycardia (high heart rate). An artificial pacemaker, which mimics pacemaker cells by delivering electrical impulses, can restore normal rhythm. Figures below show examples of artificial pacemakers externally and internally.\n\nArtificial pacemakers are compact and lightweight, featuring a programmable microprocessor for heart rate monitoring, a long-lasting battery (up to 15 years), and pulse-generating circuitry. The simplest design involves a resistor and capacitor. After introducing first-order RC circuits, we will explore an RC circuit design for artificial pacemakers.\n\n**Image Descriptions**\n\n**Pacemaker Outside the Body**\n- **Components and Structure:** The first diagram depicts a pacemaker with labeled components, including wires connecting to an electrode, indicating flexibility and length to reach the heart.\n- **Implanted View:** The second diagram shows the pacemaker implanted beneath the skin in the chest, with wires leading to the heart's electrode, highlighting direct interaction.\n- **Labels and Features:** Key labels include \"Pacemaker,\" \"Wires,\" and \"Electrode,\" with anatomical context provided in the second diagram.\n\n**Pacemaker Inside the Body**\n- **Components and Structure:** The pacemaker is a small, rounded device under the chest skin, connected to the heart via leads and an electrode.\n- **Connections:** The pacemaker sends electrical signals through leads to the heart's electrode, regulating rhythm.\n- **Labels and Context:** Labels like \"Pacemaker,\" \"Wires,\" and \"Electrode\" are used, with anatomical details showing heart and major blood vessels.\n\n**Circuit Diagrams**\n\n- **Fig. 7.1 (a):** RL circuit with inductor Leq and resistor Req in series, connected to current source I0.\n- **Fig. 7.1 (b):** RC circuit with capacitor Ceq and resistor Req, connected to voltage source V0.\n- **Fig. 7.2 (a):** RL circuit with voltage source V_Th, resistor R_Th, and inductor L in series.\n- **Fig. 7.2 (b):** Norton equivalent RL circuit with current source VTh/RTh, resistor RTh, and inductor L.\n- **Fig. 7.2 (c):** RC circuit with voltage source VTh, resistor RTh, and capacitor C.\n- **Fig. 7.2 (d):** RC circuit with current source VTh/RTh, resistor RTh, and capacitor C.\n\n**Fig. 7.3:** RL circuit with current source Is, switches SW1 and SW2, inductor L, and resistor R, demonstrating behavior at t=0.\n\n**Fig. 7.4:** RL parallel circuit with current source Is, inductor L, and resistor R, showing behavior for t ≥ 0.\n\nRL and RC circuits, known as first-order circuits, are described by first-order differential equations.

We are now equipped to ascertain the currents and voltages that emerge when energy is either discharged or absorbed by an inductor or capacitor in reaction to a sudden change in a dc voltage or current source. This chapter will concentrate on circuits comprising solely sources, resistors, and either (but not both) inductors or capacitors. For simplicity, these setups are termed RL (resistor-inductor) and RC (resistor-capacitor) circuits.\n\nOur examination of RL and RC circuits will be segmented into three stages. Initially, we will explore the currents and voltages that arise when stored energy in an inductor or capacitor is abruptly released to a resistive network. This occurs when the inductor or capacitor is suddenly disconnected from its dc source. Consequently, we can simplify the circuit to one of the two equivalent configurations depicted in Fig. 7.1 on page 214. The resulting currents and voltages in this setup are known as the natural response of the circuit, emphasizing that the circuit's inherent nature, not external excitation sources, governs its behavior.\n\nIn the second stage of our analysis, we will investigate the currents and voltages that arise when energy is being absorbed by an inductor or capacitor due to the sudden application of a dc voltage or current source. This reaction is termed the step response. The methodology for determining both the natural and step responses is identical; hence, in the third stage of our analysis, we will develop a universal approach applicable to finding the response of RL and RC circuits to any abrupt change in a dc voltage or current source.\n\nFigure 7.2 on page 214 illustrates the four potential general configurations of RL and RC circuits.

The frequency of these impulses is regulated by pacemaker cells. In adults, pacemaker cells maintain a resting heart rate of approximately 72 beats per minute. However, when pacemaker cells are damaged, they may produce an excessively low resting heart rate (a condition known as bradycardia) or an excessively high resting heart rate (a condition known as tachycardia). A normal heart rhythm can be restored by implanting an artificial pacemaker that delivers electrical impulses to the heart, mimicking the function of pacemaker cells. Examples of an artificial pacemaker both outside and inside the body are illustrated in the accompanying figures.\n\nArtificial pacemakers are compact and lightweight. They feature a programmable microprocessor that monitors several parameters and adjusts the heart rate, an efficient battery with a lifespan of up to 15 years, and circuitry that generates the pulse. The simplest circuit consists of a resistor and a capacitor. Once we introduce the first-order RC circuit, we will examine an RC circuit design for artificial pacemakers.\n\n**Image Description: Pacemaker outside the body**\nThe image comprises two diagrams showing a pacemaker both outside and inside the body.\n\n1. **Identification of Components and Structure:**\n   - The first diagram depicts a pacemaker device with labeled components. The pacemaker is shown as a small, rounded device with wires attached to an electrode. The wires are coiled, indicating flexibility and sufficient length to reach the heart.\n   - The second diagram shows the pacemaker implanted within the human body. It is situated in the chest area, just beneath the skin, with wires leading to the heart. The electrode is positioned at the heart, indicating its role in transmitting electrical impulses.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n   - The wires serve as conduits for electrical signals from the pacemaker to the heart. These signals help regulate the heart's rhythm by delivering electrical impulses to the electrode, which contacts the heart muscle.\n   - The placement of the pacemaker in the chest and the routing of the wires highlight the direct connection and interaction between the device and the heart, ensuring effective pacing.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n   - Key labels such as \"Pacemaker,\" \"Wires,\" and \"Electrode\" identify the components in both diagrams.\n   - The anatomical illustration in the second diagram provides context for the pacemaker's placement relative to the heart and major blood vessels, aiding understanding of the device's function within the body.\n\n**Image Description: Pacemaker inside the body**\nThe image depicts the placement and components of a pacemaker both outside and inside the body.\n\n1. **Identification of Components and Structure:**\n   - **Pacemaker:** The device is shown as a small, rounded object placed under the skin of the chest, connected to the heart via leads.\n   - **Wires and Electrode:** The wires, also known as leads, extend from the pacemaker and connect to an electrode placed inside the heart to deliver electrical impulses.\n\n2. **Connections and Interactions:**\n   - The pacemaker is connected to the heart through the leads, which carry electrical signals. These signals regulate the heart's rhythm by sending pulses to the electrode implanted in the heart muscle.\n   - The diagram shows the pacemaker positioned subcutaneously, with leads running through blood vessels to reach the heart.\n\n3. **Labels, Annotations, and Key Features:**\n   - The image includes labels such as \"Pacemaker,\" \"Wires,\" and \"Electrode\" to identify the different components.\n   - The anatomical illustration shows the heart and major blood vessels, providing context for the placement of the pacemaker and its leads.\n\n**Image Description: (a)**\nThe circuit diagram (a) shows an RL circuit with an inductor Leq and a resistor Req in series, connected to a current source I0.

It demonstrates the behavior of the circuit at t=0 when the switch SW1 is activated. The inductor L and resistor R are in parallel, connected to the ground.\n\n**Figure 7.3** An RL circuit.\n\n**Image Description: Figure 7.4**\nThe circuit is an RL parallel circuit with a current source Is. The inductor L and resistor R are both connected to the same node V and to ground. The circuit demonstrates behavior at t=0 when the current source is active.\n\n**Figure 7.4** The circuit shown in Fig. 7.3, for t ≥ 0.\n\nRL and RC circuits are also referred to as first-order circuits because their voltages and currents are described by first-order differential equations. Regardless of a circuit's complexity, if it can be reduced to a Thévenin or Norton equivalent connected to the terminals of an equivalent inductor or capacitor, it qualifies as a first-order circuit. (Note that if multiple inductors or capacitors exist in the original circuit, they must be interconnected so that they can be replaced by a single equivalent element.)\n\nAfter introducing techniques for analyzing the natural and step responses of first-order circuits, we will discuss some special cases of interest. The first is sequential switching, involving circuits where switching occurs at two or more instances in time. The second is the unbounded response. Finally, we analyze a useful circuit known as the integrating amplifier."

    "text": "The natural response of an RL circuit can be effectively described using the circuit depicted in Fig. 7.3. It is assumed that the independent current source produces a constant current of \\( I_{s} \\mathrm{~A} \\) and that the switch has been closed for an extended period, which we will define more precisely later. For now, it signifies that all currents and voltages have stabilized at a constant value. Consequently, only constant, or dc, currents can exist in the circuit immediately before the switch is opened, and hence the inductor behaves as a short circuit ( \\( L d i / d t=0 \\) ) before the stored energy is released.\n\nSince the inductor acts as a short circuit, the voltage across the inductive branch is zero, and no current flows through \\( R_{0} \\) or \\( R \\). Therefore, all the source current \\( I_{s} \\) is directed through the inductive branch. To determine the natural response, we need to find the voltage and current at the resistor terminals after the switch is opened, that is, after the source is disconnected and the inductor starts releasing energy. If we define \\( t=0 \\) as the moment the switch is opened, the task becomes finding \\( v(t) \\) and \\( i(t) \\) for \\( t \\geq 0 \\). For \\( t \\geq 0 \\), the circuit shown in Fig. 7.3 simplifies to the one shown in Fig. 7.4.\n\nTo derive the expression for the current, we apply Kirchhoff's voltage law to obtain an equation involving \\( i, R \\), and \\( L \\). Summing the voltages around the closed loop yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nL \\frac{d i}{d t}+R i=0 \\tag{7.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis equation is known as a first-order ordinary differential equation because it contains terms involving the ordinary derivative of the unknown, that is, \\( d i / d t \\). The highest order derivative in the equation is 1, hence the term first-order.\n\nWe can further describe this equation by noting that the coefficients \\( R \\) and \\( L \\) are constants, meaning they are not functions of either the dependent variable \\( i \\) or the independent variable \\( t \\). Thus, the equation can also be characterized as an ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients.\n\nTo solve Eq. 7.1, we divide by \\( L \\), move the term involving \\( i \\) to the right-hand side, and then multiply both sides by a differential time \\( d t \\). This gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{d i}{d t} d t=-\\frac{R}{L} i d t \\tag{7.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nRecognizing the left-hand side of Eq. 7.2 as a differential change in the current \\( i \\), we divide through by \\( i \\) to get\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{d i}{i}=-\\frac{R}{L} d t \\tag{7.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nBy integrating both sides of Eq. 7.3, we obtain an explicit expression for \\( i \\) as a function of \\( t \\). Using \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) as variables of integration leads to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\int_{i\\left(t_{0}\\right)}^{i(t)} \\frac{d x}{x}=-\\frac{R}{L} \\int_{t_{0}}^{t} d y \\tag{7.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere \\( i\\left(t_{0}\\right) \\) is the current at time \\( t_{0} \\), and \\( i(t) \\) is the current at time \\( t \\). Here, \\( t_{0}=0 \\). Carrying out the integration yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\ln \\frac{i(t)}{i(0)}=-\\frac{R}{L} t \\tag{7.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nBased on the definition of the natural logarithm, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni(t)=i(0) e^{-(R / L) t} \\tag{7.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nRecall that an instantaneous change of current cannot occur in an inductor. Therefore, in the first instant after the switch is opened, the current in the inductor remains the same. If we denote the time just before switching as \\( 0^{-} \\) and the time immediately after switching as \\( 0^{+} \\), then\n\n$$\ni\\left(0^{-}\\right)=i\\left(0^{+}\\right)=I_{0}\n$$\n\nwhere \\( I_{0} \\) represents the initial current in the inductor, as shown in Fig. 7.1. The initial current in the inductor flows in the same direction as the reference direction of \\( i \\). Thus, Eq. 7.6 becomes\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni(t)=I_{0} e^{-(R / L) t}, \\quad t \\geq 0 \\tag{7.7}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nindicating that the current starts from an initial value \\( I_{0} \\) and decreases exponentially towards zero as \\( t \\) increases. This behavior is illustrated in Fig. 7.5.\n\nWe derive the voltage across the resistor in Fig. 7.4 using Ohm's law:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv=i R=I_{0} R e^{-(R / L) t}, \\quad t \\geq 0^{+} \\tag{7.8}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nNote that, unlike the expression for the current shown in Eq. 7.7, the voltage is defined only for \\( t>0 \\), not at \\( t=0 \\). The reason is that a step change occurs in the voltage at zero. For \\( t<0 \\), the derivative of the current is zero, so the voltage is also zero. (This follows from \\( v=L d i / d t=0 \\)). Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& v\\left(0^{-}\\right)=0  \\tag{7.9}\\\\\n& v\\left(0^{+}\\right)=I_{0} R \\tag{7.10}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere \\( v\\left(0^{+}\\right) \\) is obtained from Eq. 7.8 with \\( t=0^{+} \\). With this step change at an instant in time, the value of the voltage at \\( t=0 \\) is unknown. Thus, we use \\( t \\geq 0^{+} \\) in defining the region of validity for these solutions.\n\nWe can derive the power dissipated in the resistor using any of the following expressions:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np=v i, \\quad p=i^{2} R, \\quad \\text { or } \\quad p=\\frac{v^{2}}{R} \\tag{7.11}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nRegardless of the form used, the resulting expression can be simplified to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np=I_{0}^{2} R e^{-2(R / L) t}, \\quad t \\geq 0^{+} \\tag{7.12}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe energy delivered to the resistor during any time interval after the switch is opened is\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nw & =\\int_{0}^{t} p d x=\\int_{0}^{t} I_{0}^{2} R e^{-2(R / L) x} d x \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{2(R / L)} I_{0}^{2} R\\left(1-e^{-2(R / L) t}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{2} L I_{0}^{2}\\left(1-e^{-2(R / L) t}\\right), \\quad t \\geq 0 \\tag{7.13}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nAs \\( t \\) approaches infinity, the energy dissipated in the resistor approaches the initial energy stored in the inductor, as indicated by Eq. 7.13.\n\nThe expressions for \\( i(t) \\) (Eq. 7.7) and \\( v(t) \\) (Eq. 7.8) include a term of the form \\( e^{-(R / L) t} \\). The coefficient of \\( t \\)-namely, \\( R / L \\)-determines the rate at which the current or voltage approaches zero. The reciprocal of this ratio is the time constant of the circuit, denoted\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\tau=\\text { time constant }=\\frac{L}{R} \\tag{7.14}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nUsing the time-constant concept, we can rewrite the expressions for current, voltage, power, and energy as\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ni(t) & =I_{0} e^{-t / \\tau}, \\quad t \\geq 0  \\tag{7.15}\\\\\nv(t) & =I_{0} R e^{-t / \\tau}, \\quad t \\geq 0^{+}  \\tag{7.16}\\\\\np & =I_{0}^{2} R e^{-2 t / \\tau}, \\quad t \\geq 0^{+}  \\tag{7.17}\\\\\nw & =\\frac{1}{2} L I_{0}^{2}\\left(1-e^{-2 t / \\tau}\\right), \\quad t \\geq 0 \\tag{7.18}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe time constant is a crucial parameter for first-order circuits. It is convenient to consider the time elapsed after switching in terms of integral multiples of \\( \\tau \\). One time constant after the inductor starts releasing its stored energy to the resistor, the current has decreased to \\( e^{-1} \\), or approximately 0.37 of its initial value.\n\nTable 7.1 provides the value of \\( e^{-t / \\tau} \\) for integral multiples of \\( \\tau \\) from 1 to 10. When the elapsed time exceeds five time constants, the current is less than 1% of its initial value. Thus, we often say that five time constants after switching has occurred, the currents and voltages have, for most practical purposes, reached their final values. For single time-constant circuits (first-order circuits) with 1% accuracy, the phrase \"a long time\" implies that five or more time constants have elapsed. Therefore, the existence of current in the RL circuit shown in Fig. 7.1(a) is a momentary event and is referred to as the transient response of the circuit. The response that exists a long time after the switching has taken place is called the steady-state response. The phrase \"a long time\" then also refers to the time it takes the circuit to reach its steady-state value.\n\nAny first-order circuit is characterized, in part, by the value of its time constant. If we have no method for calculating the time constant of such a circuit (perhaps because we don't know the values of its components), we can determine its value from a plot of the circuit's natural response. Another important characteristic of the time constant is that it gives the time required for the current to reach its final value if the current continues to change at its initial rate. To illustrate, we evaluate \\( d i / d t \\) at \\( 0^{+} \\) and assume that the current continues to change at this rate:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{d i}{d t}\\left(0^{+}\\right)=-\\frac{R}{L} I_{0}=-\\frac{I_{0}}{\\tau} \\tag{7.19}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nNow, if \\( i \\) starts as \\( I_{0} \\) and decreases at a constant rate of \\( I_{0} / \\tau \\) amperes per second, the expression for \\( i \\) becomes\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni=I_{0}-\\frac{I_{0}}{\\tau} t . \\tag{7.20}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation 7.20 indicates that \\( i \\) would reach its final value of zero in \\( \\tau \\) seconds. Figure 7.6 shows how this graphical interpretation is useful in estimating the time constant of a circuit from a plot of its natural response. Such a plot could be generated on an oscilloscope measuring output current. Drawing the tangent to the natural response plot at \\( t=0 \\) and reading the value at which the tangent intersects the time axis gives the value of \\( \\tau \\).\n\nCalculating the natural response of an RL circuit can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Determine the initial current \\( I_{0} \\) through the inductor.\n2. Find the time constant of the circuit, \\( \\tau=L / R \\).\n3. Use Eq. 7.15, \\( I_{0} e^{-t / \\tau} \\), to generate \\( i(t) \\) from \\( I_{0} \\) and \\( \\tau \\).\n\nAll other calculations of interest follow from knowing \\( i(t) \\). Examples 7.1 and 7.2 demonstrate the numerical calculations associated with the natural response of an RL circuit.\n\nTable 7.1 provides the value of \\( e^{-t / \\tau} \\) for \\( t \\) equal to integral multiples of \\( \\tau \\).\n\nFigure 7.6 visually represents the natural response of an RL circuit, plotting current \\( i \\) on the vertical axis against time \\( t \\) on the horizontal axis. The graph is an exponential decay curve representing the current \\( i(t) \\) in an RL circuit after a switch has been opened, showing the behavior of the current over time as it decreases from its initial value \\( I_0 \\).\n\nThe graph is annotated with the exponential decay equation \\( i = I_0 e^{-t/\\tau} \\) and its linear approximation \\( i = I_0 - (I_0/\\tau)t \\)."

Thus, the equation can also be described as an ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients.\n\nTo solve Eq. 7.1, we divide by \\( L \\), transpose the term involving \\( i \\) to the right-hand side, and then multiply both sides by a differential time \\( d t \\). The result is\n\n$$\n\\frac{d i}{d t} d t=-\\frac{R}{L} i d t \\tag{7.2}\n$$\n\nNext, we recognize the left-hand side of Eq. 7.2 as a differential change in the current \\( i \\), that is, \\( d i \\). We now divide through by \\( i \\), getting\n\n$$\n\\frac{d i}{i}=-\\frac{R}{L} d t \\tag{7.3}\n$$\n\nWe obtain an explicit expression for \\( i \\) as a function of \\( t \\) by integrating both sides of Eq. 7.3. Using \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) as variables of integration yields\n\n$$\n\\int_{i\\left(t_{0}\\right)}^{i(t)} \\frac{d x}{x}=-\\frac{R}{L} \\int_{t_{0}}^{t} d y \\tag{7.4}\n$$\n\nwhere \\( i\\left(t_{0}\\right) \\) is the current corresponding to time \\( t_{0} \\), and \\( i(t) \\) is the current corresponding to time \\( t \\). Here, \\( t_{0}=0 \\). Therefore, carrying out the indicated integration gives\n\n$$\n\\ln \\frac{i(t)}{i(0)}=-\\frac{R}{L} t \\tag{7.5}\n$$\n\nBased on the definition of the natural logarithm,\n\n$$\ni(t)=i(0) e^{-(R / L) t} \\tag{7.6}\n$$\n\nRecall from Chapter 6 that an instantaneous change of current cannot occur in an inductor. Therefore, in the first instant after the switch is opened, the current in the inductor remains unchanged. If we use \\( 0^{-} \\) to denote the time just before switching, and \\( 0^{+} \\) for the time immediately after switching, then\n\n$$\ni\\left(0^{-}\\right)=i\\left(0^{+}\\right)=I_{0}\n$$\n\nwhere, as in Fig. 7.1, \\( I_{0} \\) denotes the initial current in the inductor. The initial current in the inductor is oriented in the same direction as the reference direction of \\( i \\). Hence, Eq. 7.6 becomes\n\n$$\ni(t)=I_{0} e^{-(R / L) t}, \\quad t \\geq 0 \\tag{7.7}\n$$\n\nThis shows that the current starts from an initial value \\( I_{0} \\) and decreases exponentially towards zero as \\( t \\) increases. Figure 7.5 illustrates this response.\n\nWe derive the voltage across the resistor in Fig. 7.4 using Ohm's law:\n\n$$\nv=i R=I_{0} R e^{-(R / L) t}, \\quad t \\geq 0^{+} \\tag{7.8}\n$$\n\nNote that in contrast to the expression for the current shown in Eq. 7.7, the voltage is defined only for \\( t>0 \\), not at \\( t=0 \\). The reason is that a step change occurs in the voltage at zero. Note that for \\( t<0 \\), the derivative of the current is zero, so the voltage is also zero. (This result follows from \\( v=L d i / d t=0 \\).) Thus\n\n$$\nv\\left(0^{-}\\right)=0  \\tag{7.9}\\\\\nv\\left(0^{+}\\right)=I_{0} R \\tag{7.10}\n$$\n\nwhere \\( v\\left(0^{+}\\right) \\) is obtained from Eq. 7.8 with \\( t=0^{+} \\). With this step change at an instant in time, the value of the voltage at \\( t=0 \\) is unknown. Thus, we use \\( t \\geq 0^{+} \\) in defining the region of validity for these solutions.\n\nThe power dissipated in the resistor can be derived from any of the following expressions:\n\n$$\np=v i, \\quad p=i^{2} R, \\quad \\text { or } \\quad p=\\frac{v^{2}}{R} \\tag{7.11}\n$$\n\nWhichever form is used, the resulting expression can be reduced to\n\n$$\np=I_{0}^{2} R e^{-2(R / L) t}, \\quad t \\geq 0^{+} \\tag{7.12}\n$$\n\nThe energy delivered to the resistor during any interval of time after the switch has been opened is\n\n$$\nw =\\int_{0}^{t} p d x=\\int_{0}^{t} I_{0}^{2} R e^{-2(R / L) x} d x \\\\\n= \\frac{1}{2(R / L)} I_{0}^{2} R\\left(1-e^{-2(R / L) t}\\right) \\\\\n= \\frac{1}{2} L I_{0}^{2}\\left(1-e^{-2(R / L) t}\\right), \\quad t \\geq 0 \\tag{7.13}\n$$\n\nNote from Eq. 7.13 that as \\( t \\) becomes infinite, the energy dissipated in the resistor approaches the initial energy stored in the inductor.\n\nThe Significance of the Time Constant\n\nThe expressions for \\( i(t) \\) (Eq. 7.7) and \\( v(t) \\) (Eq. 7.8) include a term of the form \\( e^{-(R / L) t} \\). The coefficient of \\( t \\)-namely, \\( R / L \\)-determines the rate at which the current or voltage approaches zero. The reciprocal of this ratio is the time constant of the circuit, denoted\n\n$$\n\\tau=\\text { time constant }=\\frac{L}{R} \\tag{7.14}\n$$\n\nUsing the time-constant concept, we write the expressions for current, voltage, power, and energy as\n\n$$\ni(t) =I_{0} e^{-t / \\tau}, \\quad t \\geq 0  \\tag{7.15}\\\\\nv(t) =I_{0} R e^{-t / \\tau}, \\quad t \\geq 0^{+}  \\tag{7.16}\\\\\np =I_{0}^{2} R e^{-2 t / \\tau}, \\quad t \\geq 0^{+}  \\tag{7.17}\\\\\nw =\\frac{1}{2} L I_{0}^{2}\\left(1-e^{-2 t / \\tau}\\right), \\quad t \\geq 0 \\tag{7.18}\n$$\n\nThe time constant is an important parameter for first-order circuits, so mentioning several of its characteristics is worthwhile. First, it is convenient to think of the time elapsed after switching in terms of integral multiples of \\( \\tau \\). Thus, one time constant after the inductor has started to release its stored energy to the resistor, the current has been reduced to \\( e^{-1} \\), or approximately 0.37 of its initial value.\n\nTable 7.1 gives the value of \\( e^{-t / \\tau} \\) for integral multiples of \\( \\tau \\) from 1 to 10. Note that when the elapsed time exceeds five time constants, the current is less than 1% of its initial value. Thus, we sometimes say that five time constants after switching has occurred, the currents and voltages have, for most practical purposes, reached their final values. For single time-constant circuits (first-order circuits) with 1% accuracy, the phrase a long time implies that five or more time constants have elapsed. Thus, the existence of current in the RL circuit shown in Fig. 7.1(a) is a momentary event and is referred to as the transient response of the circuit. The response that exists a long time after the switching has taken place is called the steady-state response. The phrase a long time then also means the time it takes the circuit to reach its steady-state value.\n\nAny first-order circuit is characterized, in part, by the value of its time constant. If we have no method for calculating the time constant of such a circuit (perhaps because we don't know the values of its components), we can determine its value from a plot of the circuit's natural response. That's because another important characteristic of the time constant is that it gives the time required for the current to reach its final value if the current continues to change at its initial rate. To illustrate, we evaluate \\( d i / d t \\) at \\( 0^{+} \\) and assume that the current continues to change at this rate:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d i}{d t}\\left(0^{+}\\right)=-\\frac{R}{L} I_{0}=-\\frac{I_{0}}{\\tau} \\tag{7.19}\n$$\n\nNow, if \\( i \\) starts as \\( I_{0} \\) and decreases at a constant rate of \\( I_{0} / \\tau \\) amperes per second, the expression for \\( i \\) becomes\n\n$$\ni=I_{0}-\\frac{I_{0}}{\\tau} t . \\tag{7.20}\n$$\n\nEquation 7.20 indicates that \\( i \\) would reach its final value of zero in \\( \\tau \\) seconds. Figure 7.6 shows how this graphic interpretation is useful in estimating the time constant of a circuit from a plot of its natural response. Such a plot could be generated on an oscilloscope measuring output current. Drawing the tangent to the natural response plot at \\( t=0 \\) and reading the value at which the tangent intersects the time axis gives the value of \\( \\tau \\).\n\nCalculating the natural response of an RL circuit can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Find the initial current, \\( I_{0} \\), through the inductor.\n2. Find the time constant of the circuit, \\( \\tau=L / R \\).\n3.

We assume that the independent current source generates a constant current of $I_{s} \\mathrm{~A}$, and that the switch has been in a closed position for a long time. We define the phrase a long time more accurately later in this section. For now it means that all currents and voltages have reached a constant value. Thus only constant, or dc, currents can exist in the circuit just prior to the switch's being opened, and therefore the inductor appears as a short circuit $(L d i / d t=0)$ prior to the release of the stored energy.\n\nBecause the inductor appears as a short circuit, the voltage across the inductive branch is zero, and there can be no current in either $R_{0}$ or $R$. Therefore, all the source current $I_{s}$ appears in the inductive branch. Finding the natural response requires finding the voltage and current at the terminals of the resistor after the switch has been opened, that is, after the source has been disconnected and the inductor begins releasing energy. If we let $t=0$ denote the instant when the switch is opened, the problem becomes one of finding $v(t)$ and $i(t)$ for $t \\geq 0$. For $t \\geq 0$, the circuit shown in Fig. 7.3 reduces to the one shown in Fig. 7.4.\n\nDeriving the Expression for the Current\n\nTo find $i(t)$, we use Kirchhoff's voltage law to obtain an expression involving $i, R$, and $L$. Summing the voltages around the closed loop gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nL \\frac{d i}{d t}+R i=0 \\tag{7.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere we use the passive sign convention. Equation 7.1 is known as a firstorder ordinary differential equation, because it contains terms involving the ordinary derivative of the unknown, that is, $d i / d t$. The highest order derivative appearing in the equation is 1 ; hence the term first-order.\n\nWe can go one step further in describing this equation. The coefficients in the equation, $R$ and $L$, are constants; that is, they are not functions of either the dependent variable $i$ or the independent variable $t$. Thus the equation can also be described as an ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients.\n\nTo solve Eq. 7.1, we divide by $L$, transpose the term involving $i$ to the right-hand side, and then multiply both sides by a differential time $d t$. The result is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{d i}{d t} d t=-\\frac{R}{L} i d t \\tag{7.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nNext, we recognize the left-hand side of Eq. 7.2 as a differential change in the current $i$, that is, $d i$. We now divide through by $i$, getting\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{d i}{i}=-\\frac{R}{L} d t \\tag{7.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWe obtain an explicit expression for $i$ as a function of $t$ by integrating both sides of Eq. 7.3. Using $x$ and $y$ as variables of integration yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\int_{i\\left(t_{0}\\right)}^{i(t)} \\frac{d x}{x}=-\\frac{R}{L} \\int_{t_{0}}^{t} d y \\tag{7.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nin which $i\\left(t_{0}\\right)$ is the current corresponding to time $t_{0}$, and $i(t)$ is the current corresponding to time $t$. Here, $t_{0}=0$. Therefore, carrying out the indicated integration gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\ln \\frac{i(t)}{i(0)}=-\\frac{R}{L} t \\tag{7.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nBased on the definition of the natural logarithm,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni(t)=i(0) e^{-(R / L) t} \\tag{7.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nRecall from Chapter 6 that an instantaneous change of current cannot occur in an inductor. Therefore, in the first instant after the switch has been opened, the current in the inductor remains unchanged. If we use $0^{-}$ to denote the time just prior to switching, and $0^{+}$for the time immediately following switching, then\n\n$$\ni\\left(0^{-}\\right)=i\\left(0^{+}\\right)=I_{0}\n$$\n\nwhere, as in Fig. 7.1, $I_{0}$ denotes the initial current in the inductor. The initial current in the inductor is oriented in the same direction as the reference direction of $i$. Hence Eq. 7.6 becomes\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni(t)=I_{0} e^{-(R / L) t}, \\quad t \\geq 0 \\tag{7.7}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhich shows that the current starts from an initial value $I_{0}$ and decreases exponentially toward zero as $t$ increases. Figure 7.5 shows this response.\n\nWe derive the voltage across the resistor in Fig. 7.4 from a direct application of Ohm's law:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv=i R=I_{0} R e^{-(R / L) t}, \\quad t \\geq 0^{+} \\tag{7.8}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nNote that in contrast to the expression for the current shown in Eq. 7.7, the voltage is defined only for $t>0$, not at $t=0$. The reason is that a step change occurs in the voltage at zero. Note that for $t<0$, the derivative of the current is zero, so the voltage is also zero. (This result follows from $v=L d i / d t=0$.) Thus\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& v\\left(0^{-}\\right)=0  \\tag{7.9}\\\\\n& v\\left(0^{+}\\right)=I_{0} R \\tag{7.10}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere $v\\left(0^{+}\\right)$is obtained from Eq. 7.8 with $t=0^{+} .{ }^{1}$ With this step change at an instant in time, the value of the voltage at $t=0$ is unknown. Thus we use $t \\geq 0^{+}$in defining the region of validity for these solutions.\n\n[^0]Initial inductor current\n\nNatural response of an RL circuit\nimage_name:Figure 7.5\ndescription:The graph in Figure 7.5 is a time-domain waveform representing the natural response of the current in an RL circuit. The horizontal axis is labeled \\( t \\), representing time, and the vertical axis is labeled \\( i(t) \\), representing the current in the circuit. The units for time and current are not specified, but the context suggests they are in seconds and amperes, respectively.\n\nThe graph begins at \\( t = 0 \\) with the current at its maximum value \\( I_0 \\). This initial condition is consistent with the current in an inductor at the moment a switch is opened or a sudden change occurs in the circuit.\n\nThe overall behavior of the graph shows an exponential decay of the current over time, characteristic of the natural response of an RL circuit. As time progresses, the current decreases gradually, approaching zero asymptotically. This indicates that the energy stored in the inductor is being dissipated through the resistor.\n\nKey features of the graph include the initial current value \\( I_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) and the exponential decay trend. There are no oscillations or fluctuations, which is typical for an RL circuit without additional reactive components. The decay rate is determined by the time constant \\( \\tau = \\frac{L}{R} \\), although this specific value is not marked on the graph.\n\nThere are no additional annotations or specific data points marked on the graph, but it visually represents the theoretical behavior described by the equation \\( i(t) = I_0 e^{-\\frac{R}{L} t} \\).\n\n\nFigure 7.5 $\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}$ The current response for the circuit shown in Fig. 7.4.\n\nWe derive the power dissipated in the resistor from any of the following expressions:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np=v i, \\quad p=i^{2} R, \\quad \\text { or } \\quad p=\\frac{v^{2}}{R} \\tag{7.11}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWhichever form is used, the resulting expression can be reduced to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np=I_{0}^{2} R e^{-2(R / L) t}, \\quad t \\geq 0^{+} \\tag{7.12}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe energy delivered to the resistor during any interval of time after the switch has been opened is\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nw & =\\int_{0}^{t} p d x=\\int_{0}^{t} I_{0}^{2} R e^{-2(R / L) x} d x \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{2(R / L)} I_{0}^{2} R\\left(1-e^{-2(R / L) t}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{2} L I_{0}^{2}\\left(1-e^{-2(R / L) t}\\right), \\quad t \\geq 0 \\tag{7.13}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nNote from Eq. 7.13 that as $t$ becomes infinite, the energy dissipated in the resistor approaches the initial energy stored in the inductor.\n\nThe Significance of the Time Constant\n\nThe expressions for $i(t)$ (Eq. 7.7) and $v(t)$ (Eq. 7.8) include a term of the form $e^{-(R / L) t}$. The coefficient of $t$-namely, $R / L-$ determines the rate at which the current or voltage approaches zero. The reciprocal of this ratio is the time constant of the circuit, denoted\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\tau=\\text { time constant }=\\frac{L}{R} \\tag{7.14}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nUsing the time-constant concept, we write the expressions for current, voltage, power, and energy as\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ni(t) & =I_{0} e^{-t / \\tau}, \\quad t \\geq 0  \\tag{7.15}\\\\\nv(t) & =I_{0} R e^{-t / \\tau}, \\quad t \\geq 0^{+}  \\tag{7.16}\\\\\np & =I_{0}^{2} R e^{-2 t / \\tau}, \\quad t \\geq 0^{+}  \\tag{7.17}\\\\\nw & =\\frac{1}{2} L I_{0}^{2}\\left(1-e^{-2 t / \\tau}\\right), \\quad t \\geq 0 \\tag{7.18}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe time constant is an important parameter for first-order circuits, so mentioning several of its characteristics is worthwhile. First, it is convenient to think of the time elapsed after switching in terms of integral multiples of $\\tau$. Thus one time constant after the inductor has begun to release its stored energy to the resistor, the current has been reduced to $e^{-1}$, or approximately 0.37 of its initial value.\n\nTable 7.1 gives the value of $e^{-t / \\tau}$ for integral multiples of $\\tau$ from 1 to 10. Note that when the elapsed time exceeds five time constants, the current is less than $1 \\%$ of its initial value. Thus we sometimes say that five time constants after switching has occurred, the currents and voltages have, for most practical purposes, reached their final values. For single time-constant circuits (first-order circuits) with $1 \\%$ accuracy, the phrase a long time implies that five or more time constants have elapsed. Thus the existence of current in the $R L$ circuit shown in Fig. 7.1(a) is a momentary event and is referred to as the transient response of the circuit. The response that exists a long time after the switching has taken place is called the steady-state response. The phrase a long time then also means the time it takes the circuit to reach its steady-state value.\n\nAny first-order circuit is characterized, in part, by the value of its time constant.

    "text": "The behavior of an RL circuit's natural response can be illuminated by examining the circuit illustrated in Fig. 7.3. Here, we postulate that a constant current $I_{s}$, in amperes, is produced by an independent current source, and the switch has remained closed for an extended period, a duration we will define more precisely later in this section. For now, it implies that the circuit's currents and voltages have stabilized at constant levels. Consequently, the circuit is characterized by direct current (dc) only immediately before the switch is opened, rendering the inductor indistinguishable from a short circuit $(L d i / d t=0)$ until the energy stored within is released.\n\nSince the inductor behaves as a short circuit, the voltage across it is negligible, precluding any current flow through $R_{0}$ or $R$. Thus, the entire source current $I_{s}$ courses through the inductive branch. The task of determining the natural response involves ascertaining the voltage and current values at the resistor's terminals post-switch opening—i.e., after the source is disconnected and the inductor initiates energy release. If we denote the moment of switch opening as $t=0$, our challenge is to calculate $v(t)$ and $i(t)$ for all $t \\geq 0$. Post-switch opening, the circuit depicted in Fig. 7.3 simplifies to that shown in Fig. 7.4.\n\nDerivation of the Current Expression\n\nTo calculate $i(t)$, we apply Kirchhoff's voltage law to derive an equation relating $i$, $R$, and $L$. Summing voltages in the loop yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nL \\frac{d i}{d t}+R i=0 \\tag{7.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis is according to the passive sign convention. Equation 7.1 is recognized as a first-order ordinary differential equation due to its inclusion of the unknown's ordinary derivative, $d i / d t$, with the highest derivative order being 1.\n\nWe can elaborate on this equation's nature. The coefficients $R$ and $L$ are constants, independent of the dependent variable $i$ or the independent variable $t$. Thus, the equation is also classified as an ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients.\n\nTo solve Equation 7.1, we divide by $L$, move the term involving $i$ to the right-hand side, and multiply both sides by $d t$. This leads to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{d i}{d t} d t=-\\frac{R}{L} i d t \\tag{7.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nNext, we acknowledge the left-hand side of Equation 7.2 as representing the differential change in current $i$, or $d i$. By dividing through by $i$, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{d i}{i}=-\\frac{R}{L} d t \\tag{7.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWe derive an explicit expression for $i$ as a function of $t$ by integrating both sides of Equation 7.3. Employing $x$ and $y$ as variables of integration gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\int_{i\\left(t_{0}\\right)}^{i(t)} \\frac{d x}{x}=-\\frac{R}{L} \\int_{t_{0}}^{t} d y \\tag{7.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHere, $i\\left(t_{0}\\right)$ represents the current at time $t_{0}$, while $i(t)$ is the current at time $t$. Given that $t_{0}=0$, performing the integration results in\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\ln \\frac{i(t)}{i(0)}=-\\frac{R}{L} t \\tag{7.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nUtilizing the natural logarithm's definition, we arrive at\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni(t)=i(0) e^{-(R / L) t} \\tag{7.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAs discussed in Chapter 6, an instantaneous current change cannot occur in an inductor. Hence, the instant following the switch's opening, the inductor's current remains unaltered. Denoting the moment just before switching as $0^{-}$ and the instant after as $0^{+}$, we have\n\n$$\ni\\left(0^{-}\\right)=i\\left(0^{+}\\right)=I_{0}\n$$\n\nHere, $I_{0}$ signifies the initial current in the inductor, aligning with the reference direction of $i$.

Essentially, this signifies that the currents and voltages in the circuit have stabilized. Consequently, only direct current (dc) is present immediately before the switch is opened, rendering the inductor electrically equivalent to a short circuit (\\( L \\frac{d i}{d t} = 0 \\)) before it begins to dissipate stored energy.\n\nOwing to the inductor's short-circuit-like behavior, the voltage across it is zero, precluding any current flow through \\( R_{0} \\) or \\( R \\).

One time constant after the inductor starts dissipating energy, the current is reduced to \\( e^{-1} \\), or about 0.37 of its initial value. After five time constants, the current is less than 1% of its initial value, implying that for most practical purposes, the circuit has reached its final values.\n\nThe time constant also indicates how quickly the current reaches its final value if it continues to change at its initial rate.

    "text": "To understand the inherent behavior of an RL circuit, we can refer to the diagram depicted in Fig. 7.3. We consider an independent current source providing a steady current of \\( I_{s} \\) amperes and assume the switch has been closed for an extended period, a concept we will define more precisely later. For the moment, it indicates that all currents and voltages have stabilized. Consequently, the circuit only contains direct current (dc) before the switch is opened, causing the inductor to act as a short circuit since \\( L \\frac{d i}{d t}=0 \\) until the energy stored is released.\n\nAs the inductor behaves like a short circuit, the voltage across it is zero, precluding any current flow through \\( R_{0} \\) or \\( R \\). Consequently, the full source current \\( I_{s} \\) flows through the inductive branch.

With this instantaneous step change, the voltage's value at \\( t=0 \\) is indeterminate. Hence, we define the validity of these solutions for \\( t \\geq 0^{+} \\).\n\n[^0]Initial inductor current\n\nNatural response of an RL circuit\n\nThe graph in Fig. 7.5 represents the natural response of the current in an RL circuit over time. The horizontal axis, labeled \\( t \\), denotes time, while the vertical axis, labeled \\( i(t) \\), represents the circuit's current. Although the units for time and current are not explicitly stated, the context suggests seconds and amperes, respectively.\n\nThe graph starts at \\( t = 0 \\) with the current at its peak value \\( I_0 \\), reflecting the current in an inductor at the moment of switch opening or a sudden circuit change. The overall trend shows an exponential decrease in current over time, characteristic of an RL circuit's natural response. As time elapses, the current gradually diminishes, approaching zero asymptotically, indicating that the inductor's stored energy is dissipating through the resistor.\n\nKey aspects of the graph include the initial current value \\( I_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) and the exponential decay trend. The decay rate is governed by the time constant \\( \\tau = \\frac{L}{R} \\), which is not marked on the graph.\n\nFigure 7.5 $\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}$ The current response for the circuit shown in Fig. 7.4.\n\nThe power dissipated in the resistor can be derived from any of the following expressions:\n\n$$\np=v i, \\quad p=i^{2} R, \\quad \\text { or } \\quad p=\\frac{v^{2}}{R} \\tag{7.11}\n$$\n\nAll these forms can be simplified to:\n\n$$\np=I_{0}^{2} R e^{-2(R / L) t}, \\quad t \\geq 0^{+} \\tag{7.12}\n$$\n\nThe energy delivered to the resistor over any time interval after the switch has been opened is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nw & =\\int_{0}^{t} p d x=\\int_{0}^{t} I_{0}^{2} R e^{-2(R / L) x} d x \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{2(R / L)} I_{0}^{2} R\\left(1-e^{-2(R / L) t}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{2} L I_{0}^{2}\\left(1-e^{-2(R / L) t}\\right), \\quad t \\geq 0 \\tag{7.13}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIt is evident from Eq. 7.13 that as \\( t \\) approaches infinity, the energy dissipated in the resistor converges to the initial energy stored in the inductor.\n\nThe Importance of the Time Constant\n\nThe expressions for \\( i(t) \\) (Eq. 7.7) and \\( v(t) \\) (Eq. 7.8) include the term \\( e^{-(R / L) t} \\). The coefficient of \\( t \\), \\( R / L \\), dictates the rate at which the current or voltage diminishes towards zero. The reciprocal of this ratio is the circuit's time constant, denoted as:\n\n$$\n\\tau=\\text { time constant }=\\frac{L}{R} \\tag{7.14}\n$$\n\nUsing the time-constant concept, we can rewrite the expressions for current, voltage, power, and energy as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ni(t) & =I_{0} e^{-t / \\tau}, \\quad t \\geq 0  \\tag{7.15}\\\\\nv(t) & =I_{0} R e^{-t / \\tau}, \\quad t \\geq 0^{+}  \\tag{7.16}\\\\\np & =I_{0}^{2} R e^{-2 t / \\tau}, \\quad t \\geq 0^{+}  \\tag{7.17}\\\\\nw & =\\frac{1}{2} L I_{0}^{2}\\left(1-e^{-2 t / \\tau}\\right), \\quad t \\geq 0 \\tag{7.18}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe time constant is a crucial parameter for first-order circuits. It is convenient to consider the time elapsed after switching in terms of integral multiples of \\( \\tau \\). Thus, after one time constant, the current is reduced to \\( e^{-1} \\), or approximately 0.37 of its initial value.\n\nTable 7.1 provides the values of \\( e^{-t / \\tau} \\) for integral multiples of \\( \\tau \\) from 1 to 10. It shows that after five time constants, the current is less than 1% of its initial value. Therefore, we often consider that after five time constants, the currents and voltages have essentially reached their final values for most practical purposes. For first-order circuits with 1% accuracy, \"a long time\" implies that five or more time constants have passed. Hence, the presence of current in the RL circuit shown in Fig. 7.1(a) is a transient event, referred to as the transient response of the circuit. The response that persists after a long time is known as the steady-state response. \"A long time\" also refers to the duration required for the circuit to attain its steady-state value.\n\nThe time constant is a defining characteristic of first-order circuits. If we cannot calculate a circuit's time constant analytically (perhaps due to unknown component values), we can determine it graphically from the circuit's natural response. This is because the time constant also represents the time needed for the current to reach its final value if it continues to change at its initial rate. To demonstrate, we evaluate \\( \\frac{d i}{d t} \\) at \\( 0^{+} \\) and assume the current continues to change at this rate:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d i}{d t}\\left(0^{+}\\right)=-\\frac{R}{L} I_{0}=-\\frac{I_{0}}{\\tau} \\tag{7.19}\n$$\n\nIf \\( i \\) starts at \\( I_{0} \\) and decreases at a constant rate of \\( I_{0} / \\tau \\) amperes per second, the expression for \\( i \\) becomes:\n\n$$\ni=I_{0}-\\frac{I_{0}}{\\tau} t . \\tag{7.20}\n$$\n\nEq. 7.20 suggests that \\( i \\) would reach zero in \\( \\tau \\) seconds. Fig. 7.6 visually represents this interpretation, which is useful for estimating the time constant of a circuit from its natural response plot.\n\nCalculating an RL circuit's natural response can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Determine the initial current \\( I_{0} \\) through the inductor.\n2. Calculate the circuit's time constant \\( \\tau=L / R \\).\n3.

The initial current direction aligns with the reference direction of \\( i \\). Hence, Eq. 7.6 becomes\n\n$$\ni(t) = I_0 e^{-(R / L) t}, \\quad t \\geq 0 \\tag{7.7}\n$$\n\nThis indicates that the current starts at \\( I_0 \\) and exponentially decays towards zero as \\( t \\) increases. Figure 7.5 depicts this response.\n\nWe derive the voltage across the resistor in Fig. 7.4 using Ohm's law:\n\n$$\nv = i R = I_0 R e^{-(R / L) t}, \\quad t \\geq 0^+ \\tag{7.8}\n$$\n\nUnlike the current expression in Eq. 7.7, the voltage is defined only for \\( t > 0 \\), not at \\( t = 0 \\). This is because the voltage undergoes a step change at zero. For \\( t < 0 \\), the current derivative is zero, making the voltage zero as well (from \\( v = L \\frac{d i}{d t} = 0 \\)). Thus\n\n$$\nv(0^-) = 0  \\tag{7.9}\n$$\n$$\nv(0^+) = I_0 R \\tag{7.10}\n$$\n\nwhere \\( v(0^+) \\) is obtained from Eq. 7.8 with \\( t = 0^+ \\). With this step change at an instant, the voltage at \\( t = 0 \\) is undefined. Hence, we use \\( t \\geq 0^+ \\) to define the validity of these solutions.\n\n[^0] Initial inductor current\n\nNatural response of an RL circuit\nimage_name:Figure 7.5\ndescription:Figure 7.5 presents a time-domain waveform depicting the natural response of the current in an RL circuit. The horizontal axis, labeled \\( t \\), represents time, while the vertical axis, labeled \\( i(t) \\), represents the circuit current. Although the units for time and current are unspecified, the context suggests seconds and amperes, respectively.\n\nThe graph starts at \\( t = 0 \\) with the current at its peak value \\( I_0 \\), reflecting the inductor current at the moment a switch is opened or a sudden circuit change occurs.\n\nThe graph exhibits an exponential decay of the current over time, characteristic of the RL circuit's natural response. As time elapses, the current decreases gradually, approaching zero asymptotically, indicating that the inductor's stored energy is dissipating through the resistor.\n\nKey features of the graph include the initial current value \\( I_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) and the exponential decay trend. There are no oscillations or fluctuations, typical for an RL circuit without additional reactive elements. The decay rate is governed by the time constant \\( \\tau = \\frac{L}{R} \\), though this specific value is not marked on the graph.\n\nNo additional annotations or specific data points are marked, but the graph visually represents the theoretical behavior described by the equation \\( i(t) = I_0 e^{-\\frac{R}{L} t} \\).\n\nFigure 7.5 $\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}$ The current response for the circuit shown in Fig. 7.4.\n\nWe derive the power dissipated in the resistor using any of the following expressions:\n\n$$\np = v i, \\quad p = i^2 R, \\quad \\text{or} \\quad p = \\frac{v^2}{R} \\tag{7.11}\n$$\n\nRegardless of the form used, the resulting expression simplifies to\n\n$$\np = I_0^2 R e^{-2(R / L) t}, \\quad t \\geq 0^+ \\tag{7.12}\n$$\n\nThe energy supplied to the resistor during any time interval after the switch opening is\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nw & = \\int_0^t p d x = \\int_0^t I_0^2 R e^{-2(R / L) x} d x \\\\\n& = \\frac{1}{2(R / L)} I_0^2 R \\left(1 - e^{-2(R / L) t}\\right) \\\\\n& = \\frac{1}{2} L I_0^2 \\left(1 - e^{-2(R / L) t}\\right), \\quad t \\geq 0 \\tag{7.13}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nEq. 7.13 shows that as \\( t \\) approaches infinity, the energy dissipated in the resistor converges to the initial energy stored in the inductor.\n\nThe Importance of the Time Constant\n\nThe expressions for \\( i(t) \\) (Eq. 7.7) and \\( v(t) \\) (Eq. 7.8) include a term of the form \\( e^{-(R / L) t} \\). The coefficient of \\( t \\), \\( R / L \\), governs the rate at which the current or voltage diminishes towards zero. The reciprocal of this ratio is the circuit's time constant, denoted as\n\n$$\n\\tau = \\text{time constant} = \\frac{L}{R} \\tag{7.14}\n$$\n\nUsing the time-constant concept, we express the current, voltage, power, and energy as\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ni(t) & = I_0 e^{-t / \\tau}, \\quad t \\geq 0  \\tag{7.15}\\\\\nv(t) & = I_0 R e^{-t / \\tau}, \\quad t \\geq 0^+  \\tag{7.16}\\\\\np & = I_0^2 R e^{-2 t / \\tau}, \\quad t \\geq 0^+  \\tag{7.17}\\\\\nw & = \\frac{1}{2} L I_0^2 \\left(1 - e^{-2 t / \\tau}\\right), \\quad t \\geq 0 \\tag{7.18}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe time constant is a crucial parameter for first-order circuits. It is convenient to consider the time elapsed after switching in terms of integral multiples of \\( \\tau \\). One time constant after the inductor starts releasing its stored energy to the resistor, the current has dropped to \\( e^{-1} \\), or approximately 0.37 of its initial value.\n\nTable 7.1 lists the value of \\( e^{-t / \\tau} \\) for integral multiples of \\( \\tau \\) from 1 to 10. When the elapsed time exceeds five time constants, the current is less than 1% of its initial value. Thus, after five time constants, the currents and voltages have, for practical purposes, reached their final values. For single time-constant circuits (first-order circuits) with 1% accuracy, \"a long time\" implies that five or more time constants have passed. Hence, the presence of current in the RL circuit shown in Fig. 7.1(a) is a transient event, referred to as the transient response of the circuit. The response that persists after a long time is known as the steady-state response. \"A long time\" also signifies the duration required for the circuit to attain its steady-state value.\n\nThe time constant is a defining characteristic of first-order circuits. If we lack a method to calculate the time constant of such a circuit (perhaps due to unknown component values), we can deduce it from a plot of the circuit's natural response. Another key aspect of the time constant is that it represents the time needed for the current to reach its final value if it continues to change at its initial rate. To illustrate, we evaluate \\( \\frac{d i}{d t} \\) at \\( 0^+ \\) and assume the current continues to change at this rate:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d i}{d t}(0^+) = -\\frac{R}{L} I_0 = -\\frac{I_0}{\\tau} \\tag{7.19}\n$$\n\nIf \\( i \\) starts at \\( I_0 \\) and decreases at a constant rate of \\( I_0 / \\tau \\) amperes per second, the expression for \\( i \\) becomes\n\n$$\ni = I_0 - \\frac{I_0}{\\tau} t \\tag{7.20}\n$$\n\nEq. 7.20 shows that \\( i \\) would reach zero in \\( \\tau \\) seconds. Figure 7.6 demonstrates how this graphical interpretation aids in estimating the time constant from a plot of the natural response.\n\nCalculating the natural response of an RL circuit involves the following steps:\n\n1. Determine the initial current, \\( I_0 \\), through the inductor.\n2. Calculate the circuit's time constant, \\( \\tau = L / R \\).\n3. Use Eq. 7.15, \\( I_0 e^{-t / \\tau} \\), to derive \\( i(t) \\) from \\( I_0 \\) and \\( \\tau \\).\n\nAll subsequent calculations of interest stem from knowing \\( i(t) \\).

We can easily find $v(t)$ by reducing the circuit shown in Fig. 7.8 to the equivalent form shown in Fig. 7.9. The parallel inductors simplify to an equivalent inductance of 4 H, carrying an initial current of 12 A. The resistive network reduces to a single resistance of $8 \\Omega$. Thus, the initial value of $i(t)$ is 12 A, and the time constant is $4 / 8$, or 0.5 s. Therefore,\n\n$$\ni(t)=12 e^{-2 t} \\mathrm{~A}, \\quad t \\geq 0\n$$\n\nNow, $v(t)$ is simply the product $8 i$, so\n\n$$\nv(t)=96 e^{-2 t} \\mathrm{~V}, \\quad t \\geq 0^{+}\n$$\n\nThe circuit shows that $v(t)=0$ at $t=0^{-}$, making the expression for $v(t)$ valid for $t \\geq 0^{+}$. After obtaining $v(t)$, we can calculate $i_{1}, i_{2}$, and $i_{3}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ni_{1} & =\\frac{1}{5} \\int_{0}^{t} 96 e^{-2 x} d x-8 \\\\\n& =1.6-9.6 e^{-2 t} \\mathrm{~A}, \\quad t \\geq 0 \\\\\ni_{2} & =\\frac{1}{20} \\int_{0}^{t} 96 e^{-2 x} d x-4\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& =-1.6-2.4 e^{-2 t} \\mathrm{~A}, \\quad t \\geq 0 \\\\\ni_{3} & =\\frac{v(t)}{10} \\frac{15}{25}=5.76 e^{-2 t} \\mathrm{~A}, \\quad t \\geq 0^{+}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNote that the expressions for the inductor currents $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$ are valid for $t \\geq 0$, whereas the expression for the resistor current $i_{3}$ is valid for $t \\geq 0^{+}$.\n\nFigure 7.9: A simplification of the circuit shown in Fig. 7.8.\n\nb) The initial energy stored in the inductors is\n\n$$\nw=\\frac{1}{2}(5)(64)+\\frac{1}{2}(20)(16)=320 \\mathrm{~J}\n$$\n\nc) As $t \\rightarrow \\infty, \\quad i_{1} \\rightarrow 1.6 \\mathrm{~A}$ and $i_{2} \\rightarrow-1.6 \\mathrm{~A}$.

    "text": "As outlined in Section 7.1, the inherent response of an RC circuit parallels that of an RL circuit. As a result, we do not delve into the specifics of the RC circuit as deeply as we did with the RL circuit.\n\nWe derive the inherent response of an RC circuit from the configuration depicted in Fig. 7.10. We commence by postulating that the switch has been in position a for an extended period, enabling the loop consisting of the DC voltage source \\( V_g \\), resistor \\( R_1 \\), and capacitor \\( C \\) to achieve a steady state. As discussed in Chapter 6, a capacitor acts as an open circuit when exposed to a constant voltage. Thus, the voltage source is unable to maintain a current, causing the source voltage to appear across the capacitor terminals. In Section 7.3, we will explore how the capacitor voltage gradually rises to the steady-state level of the DC voltage source. However, the crucial point here is that when the switch is shifted from position a to position b (at \\( t=0 \\)), the voltage across the capacitor is \\( V_g \\). Since the voltage at the terminals of a capacitor cannot change instantaneously, the problem simplifies to solving the circuit shown in Fig. 7.11.\n\n## Deriving the Expression for Voltage\n\nWe can readily determine the voltage \\( v(t) \\) by considering node voltages. By designating the lower node between \\( R \\) and \\( C \\) as the reference node and summing the currents away from the upper node between \\( R \\) and \\( C \\), we obtain:\n\n\\[\nC \\frac{d v}{d t} + \\frac{v}{R} = 0 \\tag{7.21}\n\\]\n\nBy comparing Eq. 7.21 with Eq. 7.1, it becomes evident that the same mathematical methods can be applied to derive the solution for \\( v(t) \\). It is left as an exercise to demonstrate that:\n\n\\[\nv(t) = v(0) e^{-t / R C}, \\quad t \\geq 0 \\tag{7.22}\n\\]\n\nAs previously noted, the initial voltage on the capacitor equals the voltage source voltage \\( V_g \\), or:\n\n\\[\nv(0^-) = v(0) = v(0^+) = V_g = V_0 \\tag{7.23}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( V_0 \\) represents the initial voltage on the capacitor. The time constant for the RC circuit is the product of the resistance and capacitance, expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\tau = R C \\tag{7.24}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting Eqs. 7.23 and 7.24 into Eq. 7.22 yields:\n\n\\[\nv(t) = V_0 e^{-t / \\tau}, \\quad t \\geq 0 \\tag{7.25}\n\\]\n\nThis indicates that the inherent response of an RC circuit is an exponential decay of the initial voltage. The time constant \\( RC \\) dictates the decay rate. Figure 7.12 illustrates the plot of Eq. 7.25 and provides a graphical interpretation of the time constant.\n\nOnce \\( v(t) \\) is established, we can readily derive the expressions for \\( i \\), \\( p \\), and \\( w \\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ni(t) &= \\frac{v(t)}{R} = \\frac{V_0}{R} e^{-t / \\tau}, \\quad t \\geq 0^+ \\tag{7.26} \\\\\np &= v i = \\frac{V_0^2}{R} e^{-2 t / \\tau}, \\quad t \\geq 0^+ \\tag{7.27} \\\\\nw &= \\int_0^t p dx = \\int_0^t \\frac{V_0^2}{R} e^{-2 x / \\tau} dx \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} C V_0^2 \\left(1 - e^{-2 t / \\tau}\\right), \\quad t \\geq 0 \\tag{7.28}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n## Initial Capacitor Voltage and Time Constant for RC Circuit\n\nThe initial capacitor voltage and the time constant for an RC circuit are pivotal aspects in understanding the circuit's natural response. These parameters help in calculating the voltage decay over time, which is essential for various applications.\n\n## Natural Response of an RC Circuit\n\nThe process of calculating the natural response of an RC circuit can be outlined as follows:\n\n1. Determine the initial voltage \\( V_0 \\) across the capacitor.\n2. Calculate the time constant of the circuit, \\( \\tau = RC \\).\n3. Utilize Eq. 7.25, \\( v(t) = V_0 e^{-t / \\tau} \\), to derive \\( v(t) \\) from \\( V_0 \\) and \\( \\tau \\).\n\nAll subsequent calculations of interest stem from knowing \\( v(t) \\). Examples 7.3 and 7.4 provide practical illustrations of the numerical computations associated with the natural response of an RC circuit.\n\n### Example 7.3: Determining the Natural Response of an RC Circuit\n\nConsider the circuit depicted in Fig. 7.13, where the switch has been in position x for an extended period. At \\( t=0 \\), the switch moves instantaneously to position y. The task is to find:\n\na) \\( v_C(t) \\) for \\( t \\geq 0 \\),\nb) \\( v_o(t) \\) for \\( t \\geq 0^+ \\),\nc) \\( i_o(t) \\) for \\( t \\geq 0^+ \\), and\nd) The total energy dissipated in the 60 kΩ resistor.\n\n#### Solution\n\na) Given that the switch has been in position x for a long time, the 0.5 μF capacitor charges to 100 V and is positive at the upper terminal. At \\( t=0^+ \\), the resistive network connected to the capacitor can be replaced with an equivalent resistance of 80 kΩ. Thus, the time constant of the circuit is \\( (0.5 \\times 10^{-6})(80 \\times 10^3) \\) or 40 ms. Consequently,\n\n\\[\nv_C(t) = 100 e^{-25 t} \\text{ V}, \\quad t \\geq 0\n\\]\n\nb) The most straightforward way to determine \\( v_o(t) \\) is to recognize that the resistive circuit forms a voltage divider across the capacitor terminals. Therefore,\n\n\\[\nv_o(t) = \\frac{48}{80} v_C(t) = 60 e^{-25 t} \\text{ V}, \\quad t \\geq 0^+\n\\]\n\nThis expression for \\( v_o(t) \\) holds for \\( t \\geq 0^+ \\) because \\( v_o(0^-) \\) is zero, indicating an instantaneous change in voltage across the 240 kΩ resistor.\n\nc) The current \\( i_o(t) \\) can be found using Ohm's law:\n\n\\[\ni_o(t) = \\frac{v_o(t)}{60 \\times 10^3} = e^{-25 t} \\text{ mA}, \\quad t \\geq 0^+\n\\]\n\nd) The power dissipated in the 60 kΩ resistor is:\n\n\\[\np_{60 \\text{ k}\\Omega}(t) = i_o^2(t)(60 \\times 10^3) = 60 e^{-50 t} \\text{ mW}, \\quad t \\geq 0^+\n\\]\n\nThe total energy dissipated is:\n\n\\[\nw_{60 \\text{ k}\\Omega} = \\int_0^\\infty i_o^2(t)(60 \\times 10^3) dt = 1.2 \\text{ mJ}\n\\]\n\n### Example 7.4: Determining the Natural Response of an RC Circuit with Series Capacitors\n\nIn the circuit shown in Fig. 7.14, the initial voltages on capacitors \\( C_1 \\) and \\( C_2 \\) are established by sources not depicted. The switch is closed at \\( t=0 \\). The objectives are to:\n\na) Find \\( v_1(t) \\), \\( v_2(t) \\), and \\( v(t) \\) for \\( t \\geq 0 \\) and \\( i(t) \\) for \\( t \\geq 0^+ \\),\nb) Calculate the initial energy stored in capacitors \\( C_1 \\) and \\( C_2 \\),\nc) Determine the energy stored in the capacitors as \\( t \\rightarrow \\infty \\),\nd) Show that the total energy delivered to the 250 kΩ resistor is the difference between the results obtained in (b) and (c).\n\n#### Solution\n\na) Once \\( v(t) \\) is known, \\( i(t) \\) can be derived from Ohm's law. After obtaining \\( i(t) \\), \\( v_1(t) \\) and \\( v_2(t) \\) can be calculated, as the voltage across a capacitor depends on the capacitor current. To find \\( v(t) \\), the series-connected capacitors are replaced with an equivalent capacitor with a capacitance of 4 μF and charged to a voltage of 20 V. Hence, the circuit in Fig. 7.14 simplifies to the one shown in Fig. 7.15, revealing that the initial value of \\( v(t) \\) is 20 V and the time constant of the circuit is \\( (4)(250) \\times 10^{-3} \\) or 1 s.

    "text": "As previously discussed in Section 7.1, the inherent response of an RC circuit is similar to that of an RL circuit. Thus, we won't delve into the RC circuit's details as much as we did with the RL circuit.\n\nThe inherent response of an RC circuit is derived from the circuit depicted in Fig. 7.10. Our analysis starts with the assumption that the switch has been in position a for an extended period, enabling the loop consisting of the dc voltage source \\( V_g \\), resistor \\( R_1 \\), and capacitor \\( C \\) to stabilize at a steady state. From Chapter 6, we know that a capacitor acts as an open circuit when a constant voltage is present. Consequently, the voltage source cannot maintain a current, and hence the voltage source appears across the capacitor's terminals. In Section 7.3, we'll explore how the capacitor voltage actually reaches the steady-state value of the dc voltage source. However, the critical point for now is that when the switch is shifted from position a to position b (at \\( t=0 \\)), the capacitor's voltage is \\( V_g \\). Since there can be no instantaneous change in the voltage at the terminals of a capacitor, the task is simplified to solving the circuit illustrated in Fig. 7.11.\n\n## Deriving the Expression for the Voltage\n\nWe can determine the voltage \\( v(t) \\) by considering node voltages.

The initial voltage across the capacitor is 100 V, and the resistive network can be replaced by an equivalent resistance of 80 kΩ at \\( t=0+ \\).\n\n#### Solution\n\na) Since the switch has been in position x for an extended period, the 0.5 mF capacitor will charge to 100 V and be positive at the upper terminal. We can replace the resistive network connected to the capacitor at \\( t=0^{+} \\) with an equivalent resistance of \\( 80 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega \\).

Thus, we do not examine the RC circuit as meticulously as we did the RL circuit.\n\nThe inherent behavior of an RC circuit is based on the circuit shown in Fig. 7.10. We start by assuming that the switch has been at position a for an extended period, allowing the loop formed by the dc voltage source \\( V_g \\), resistor \\( R_1 \\), and capacitor \\( C \\) to reach a stable state. From Chapter 6, we know that a capacitor acts as an open circuit in the presence of a constant voltage. Therefore, the voltage source cannot sustain a current, and the source voltage appears across the capacitor terminals. In Section 7.3, we will discuss how the capacitor voltage actually rises to the steady-state value of the dc voltage source, but for now, the key point is that when the switch is moved from position a to position b (\\( t=0 \\)), the voltage on the capacitor is \\( V_g \\). Since there can be no instantaneous change in the voltage at the terminals of a capacitor, the problem simplifies to solving the circuit shown in Fig. 7.11.\n\nDeriving the Voltage Expression\n\nWe can easily find the voltage \\( v(t) \\) by considering node voltages. Using the lower junction between \\( R \\) and \\( C \\) as the reference node and summing the currents away from the upper junction between \\( R \\) and \\( C \\) gives:\n\n$$\nC \\frac{d v}{d t} + \\frac{v}{R} = 0 \\tag{7.21}\n$$\n\nComparing Eq. 7.21 with Eq. 7.1 shows that the same mathematical techniques can be used to obtain the solution for \\( v(t) \\). You can verify that:\n\n$$\nv(t) = v(0) e^{-t / R C}, \\quad t \\geq 0 \\tag{7.22}\n$$\n\nAs we have already noted, the initial voltage on the capacitor equals the voltage source voltage \\( V_g \\), or:\n\n$$\nv\\left(0^{-}\\right) = v(0) = v\\left(0^{+}\\right) = V_{g} = V_{0}, \\tag{7.23}\n$$\n\nwhere \\( V_0 \\) denotes the initial voltage on the capacitor. The time constant for the RC circuit is the product of the resistance and capacitance, given by:\n\n$$\n\\tau = R C \\tag{7.24}\n$$\n\nSubstituting Eqs. 7.23 and 7.24 into Eq. 7.22 yields:\n\n$$\nv(t) = V_{0} e^{-t / \\tau}, \\quad t \\geq 0 \\tag{7.25}\n$$\n\nThis indicates that the inherent behavior of an RC circuit is an exponential decay of the initial voltage. The time constant \\( RC \\) determines the decay rate. Figure 7.12 shows the graph of Eq. 7.25 and provides a graphical interpretation of the time constant.\n\nAfter determining \\( v(t) \\), we can easily derive the expressions for \\( i \\), \\( p \\), and \\( w \\):\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ni(t) & = \\frac{v(t)}{R} = \\frac{V_{0}}{R} e^{-t / \\tau}, \\quad t \\geq 0^{+}  \\tag{7.26}\\\\\np & = v i = \\frac{V_{0}^{2}}{R} e^{-2 t / \\tau}, \\quad t \\geq 0^{+}  \\tag{7.27}\\\\\nw & = \\int_{0}^{t} p d x = \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{V_{0}^{2}}{R} e^{-2 x / \\tau} d x \\\\\n& = \\frac{1}{2} C V_{0}^{2}\\left(1-e^{-2 t / \\tau}\\right), \\quad t \\geq 0 \\tag{7.28}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nInitial capacitor voltage\n\nTime constant for RC circuit\n\nInherent behavior of an RC circuit\nImage description: The graph in Figure 7.12 represents the inherent behavior of an RC circuit, specifically showing the voltage across the capacitor, \\( v(t) \\), as a function of time, \\( t \\).\n\n1. **Graph and Function Type:**\n   - This graph illustrates an exponential decay over time.\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units:**\n   - The horizontal axis measures time, \\( t \\), usually in seconds.\n   - The vertical axis measures voltage, \\( v(t) \\), in volts.\n   - Both axes use a linear scale.\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n   - The voltage \\( v(t) \\) commences at an initial value \\( V_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) and decreases exponentially towards zero as time progresses.\n   - The decay adheres to the equation \\( v(t) = V_0 e^{-t/\\tau} \\), where \\( \\tau \\) is the circuit's time constant.\n   - The curve displays a rapid initial drop, which slows down as \\( t \\) increases, hallmarking the exponential decay.\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details:**\n   - The point \\( \\tau \\) on the time axis is marked, indicating the time constant, which is the point where the voltage has dropped to roughly 36.8% of its initial value \\( V_0 \\).\n   - Another line on the graph, \\( v(t) = V_0 - \\frac{V_0}{\\tau}t \\), represents a linear approximation of the initial decay.\n\n5. **Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n   - The graph features annotations for the exponential decay equation \\( v(t) = V_0 e^{-t/\\tau} \\) and the linear approximation \\( v(t) = V_0 - \\frac{V_0}{\\tau}t \\).\n   - The initial voltage \\( V_0 \\) is clearly indicated on the vertical axis at \\( t = 0 \\).\n\nFigure 7.12 $\\triangle$ The inherent behavior of an RC circuit.\n\nComputing the inherent behavior of an RC circuit involves:\n\n1.

The reaction of a circuit to the abrupt introduction of a constant voltage or current source is known as the step response. In our explanation of the step response, we demonstrate how the circuit behaves when energy is accumulated in the inductor or capacitor. We initiate with the step response of an RL circuit.\n\nThe Step Response of an RL Circuit\n\nInitially, we alter the first-order circuit depicted in Fig. 7.2(a) by incorporating a switch. We employ the resulting circuit, displayed in Fig. 7.16, in our discussion of the step response of an RL circuit. The energy stored in the inductor at the moment the switch is activated is quantified by a nonzero initial current i(0). Our objective is to establish the expressions for the current within the circuit and the voltage across the inductor following the closure of the switch. The methodology remains the same as that outlined in Section 7.1; we employ circuit analysis to derive the differential equation that portrays the circuit in terms of the variable of interest, and subsequently, we apply basic calculus to solve the equation.\n\nOnce the switch in Fig. 7.16 is closed, Kirchhoff's voltage law necessitates that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{s}=R i+L \\frac{d i}{d t} \\tag{7.29}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhich can be resolved for the current by segregating the variables i and t and then integrating. The initial step in this process is to solve Eq. 7.29 for the derivative d i / d t :\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{d i}{d t}=\\frac{-R i+V_{s}}{L}=\\frac{-R}{L}\\left(i-\\frac{V_{s}}{R}\\right) \\tag{7.30}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nNext, we multiply both sides of Eq. 7.30 by a differential time d t. This action simplifies the left-hand side of the equation to a differential adjustment in the current. Thus\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{d i}{d t} d t=\\frac{-R}{L}\\left(i-\\frac{V_{s}}{R}\\right) d t \\tag{7.31}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nd i=\\frac{-R}{L}\\left(i-\\frac{V_{s}}{R}\\right) d t\n$$\n\nWe now isolate the variables in Eq. 7.31 to obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{d i}{i-\\left(V_{s} / R\\right)}=\\frac{-R}{L} d t \\tag{7.32}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand then integrate both sides of Eq. 7.32. Utilizing x and y as variables for the integration, we derive\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\int_{I_{0}}^{i(t)} \\frac{d x}{x-\\left(V_{s} / R\\right)}=\\frac{-R}{L} \\int_{0}^{t} d y \\tag{7.33}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere I_{0} represents the current at t=0 and i(t) denotes the current at any t>0. The integration called for in Eq. 7.33 yields the expression\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\ln \\frac{i(t)-\\left(V_{s} / R\\right)}{I_{0}-\\left(V_{s} / R\\right)}=\\frac{-R}{L} t \\tag{7.34}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nfrom which\n\n$$\n\\frac{i(t)-\\left(V_{s} / R\\right)}{I_{0}-\\left(V_{s} / R\\right)}=e^{-(R / L) t}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni(t)=\\frac{V_{s}}{R}+\\left(I_{0}-\\frac{V_{s}}{R}\\right) e^{-(R / L) t} \\tag{7.35}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nStep response of RL circuit\n\nWhen the initial energy in the inductor is negligible, I_{0} is zero. Hence, Eq. 7.35 simplifies to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni(t)=\\frac{V_{s}}{R}-\\frac{V_{s}}{R} e^{-(R / L) t} \\tag{7.36}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation 7.36 reveals that after the switch is closed, the current escalates exponentially from zero to a terminal value of V_{s} / R. The time constant of the circuit, L / R, dictates the rate of escalation. One time image_name:Figure 7.17\ndescription:The graph in Figure 7.17 illustrates the step response of an RL circuit with the initial inductor current I_0 = 0. It is a time-domain waveform plot depicting the current i(t) on the vertical axis and time t on the horizontal axis. The vertical axis is annotated with current values, initiating from 0 up to V_{s} / R, with a significant marker at 0.632 V_{s} / R. The horizontal axis is demarcated in terms of time constants, τ, ranging from 0 to 5τ.\n\nThe graph exhibits an exponential escalation in current from zero, asymptotically approaching its terminal steady-state value of V_{s} / R. At t = τ, the current attains approximately 63.2% of its terminal value, which is emblematic of first-order systems.\n\nThe curve is delineated by the function i(t) = V_{s} / R - V_{s} / R e^{-t/τ}, depicting an initial rapid escalation that progressively slows as it approaches the terminal value. A dashed line at V_{s} / R signifies the terminal steady-state current, and another dashed line at 0.632 V_{s} / R highlights the current value at one time constant τ.\n\nA tangent line at t=0 with a slope of V_{s} / L signifies the initial rate of change of current, indicating how promptly the current commences to ascend immediately after the switch is closed.\n\n\nFigure $7.17 \\triangle$ The step response of the RL circuit depicted in Fig. 7.16 when I_{0}=0.\nimage_name:Figure 7.18\ndescription:The graph in Figure 7.18 is a time-domain waveform depicting the voltage across an inductor in an RL circuit. The x-axis represents time, labeled t, and is denoted in increments of τ (the time constant of the circuit). The y-axis represents voltage, labeled v, with units in volts.\n\nThe graph exhibits an exponential decay of the inductor voltage over time. Initially, at t = 0, the voltage is at its maximum value, V_{s}. As time elapses, the voltage diminishes exponentially towards zero.\n\nKey Features and Technical Details:\n- **Initial Voltage:** At t = 0, the voltage is V_{s}.\n- **Exponential Decay:** The voltage decays according to the equation v = V_{s} e^{-(R/L)t}, showcasing a characteristic exponential decay behavior.\n- **Tangent Line:** A tangent line at t = 0 with the equation v = V_{s} - (R/L)V_{s} t indicates the initial rate of change of the voltage.\n- **Voltage at One Time Constant (τ):** At t = τ, the voltage plunges to approximately 0.368 V_{s}, accentuated by a dashed horizontal line.\n\nAnnotations and Specific Data Points:\n- **Equation Annotations:** The graph includes annotations displaying the exponential decay equation v = V_{s} e^{-(R/L)t} and the tangent line equation.\n- **Voltage Level at τ:** A dashed line marks the voltage level at 0.368 V_{s} at t = τ.\n\nThe graph effectively portrays the transient response of the inductor voltage in an RL circuit, emphasizing the exponential decay and initial rate of change at the moment the switch is closed.\n\n\nFigure 7.18 $\\triangle$ Inductor voltage versus time.\nconstant after the switch is closed, the current will have achieved approximately 63% of its terminal value, or\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni(\\tau)=\\frac{V_{s}}{R}-\\frac{V_{s}}{R} e^{-1} \\approx 0.6321 \\frac{V_{s}}{R} \\tag{7.37}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIf the current were to persist in increasing at its initial rate, it would reach its terminal value at t=τ; that is, because\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{d i}{d t}=\\frac{-V_{s}}{R}\\left(\\frac{-1}{\\tau}\\right) e^{-t / \\tau}=\\frac{V_{s}}{L} e^{-t / \\tau} \\tag{7.38}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nthe initial rate at which i(t) increases is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{d i}{d t}(0)=\\frac{V_{s}}{L} \\tag{7.39}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIf the current were to persist in increasing at this rate, the expression for i would be\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni=\\frac{V_{s}}{L} t \\tag{7.40}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nfrom which, at t=τ,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni=\\frac{V_{s}}{L} \\frac{L}{R}=\\frac{V_{s}}{R} \\tag{7.41}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquations 7.36 and 7.40 are plotted in Fig. 7.17. The values provided by Eqs. 7.37 and 7.41 are also depicted in this figure.\n\nThe voltage across an inductor is L d i / d t, so from Eq. 7.35, for t ≥ 0^{+},\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv=L\\left(\\frac{-R}{L}\\right)\\left(I_{0}-\\frac{V_{s}}{R}\\right) e^{-(R / L) t}=\\left(V_{s}-I_{0} R\\right) e^{-(R / L) t} \\tag{7.42}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe voltage across the inductor is zero prior to the switch being closed. Equation 7.42 indicates that the inductor voltage surges to V_{s}-I_{0} R at the instant the switch is closed and then decays exponentially to zero.\n\nDoes the value of v at t=0^{+} make sense? Because the initial current is I_{0} and the inductor inhibits an instantaneous change in current, the current is I_{0} in the instant after the switch is closed. The voltage drop across the resistor is I_{0} R, and the voltage impressed across the inductor is the source voltage minus the voltage drop, that is, V_{s}-I_{0} R.\n\nWhen the initial inductor current is zero, Eq. 7.42 simplifies to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv=V_{s} e^{-(R / L) t} \\tag{7.43}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIf the initial current is zero, the voltage across the inductor surges to V_{s}. We also anticipate the inductor voltage to approach zero as t increases, because the current in the circuit is approaching the constant value of V_{s} / R. Figure 7.18 exhibits the plot of Eq. 7.43 and the relationship between the time constant and the initial rate at which the inductor voltage is diminishing.\n\nIf there is an initial current in the inductor, Eq. 7.35 provides the solution for it. The algebraic sign of I_{0} is positive if the initial current is in the same direction as i; otherwise, I_{0} carries a negative sign. Example 7.5 exemplifies the application of Eq. 7.35 to a specific circuit.\n\n#### Example 7.5 Determining the Step Response of an RL Circuit\n\nThe switch in the circuit depicted in Fig. 7.19 has been in position a for an extended duration.

Consequently, the inductor sustains an initial current of 8 A. This current is oriented opposite to the reference direction for i; thus I_{0} is -8 A. When the switch is in position b, the final value of i will be 24 / 2, or 12 A. The time constant of the circuit is 200 / 2, or 100 ms. Substituting these values into Eq. 7.35 yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ni & =12+(-8-12) e^{-t / 0.1} \\\\\n& =12-20 e^{-10 t} \\mathrm{~A}, \\quad t \\geq 0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nb) The voltage across the inductor is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nv & =L \\frac{d i}{d t} \\\\\n& =0.2\\left(200 e^{-10 t}\\right) \\\\\n& =40 e^{-10 t} \\mathrm{~V}, \\quad t \\geq 0^{+}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe initial inductor voltage is\n\n$$\nv\\left(0^{+}\\right)=40 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nc) Yes; in the instant after the switch transitions to position b, the inductor sustains a current of 8 A counterclockwise around the newly formed closed path.

Consequently, Eq. 7.35 simplifies to\n\n$$\ni(t) = \\frac{V_{s}}{R} - \\frac{V_{s}}{R} e^{-(R / L) t} \\tag{7.36}\n$$\n\nEq. 7.36 reveals that after the switch has been activated, the current increases exponentially from zero to a final value of \\(V_{s} / R\\). The circuit's time constant, \\(L / R\\), governs the rate of this increase. After one time constant has elapsed since the switch was closed, the current will have climbed to roughly 63% of its ultimate value, or\n\n$$\ni(\\tau) = \\frac{V_{s}}{R} - \\frac{V_{s}}{R} e^{-1} \\approx 0.6321 \\frac{V_{s}}{R} \\tag{7.37}\n$$\n\nIf the current were to sustain its initial rate of increase, it would attain its final value at \\(t = \\tau\\); that is, since\n\n$$\n\\frac{d i}{d t} = \\frac{-V_{s}}{R} \\left(\\frac{-1}{\\tau}\\right) e^{-t / \\tau} = \\frac{V_{s}}{L} e^{-t / \\tau} \\tag{7.38}\n$$\n\nthe initial rate at which \\(i(t)\\) rises is\n\n$$\n\\frac{d i}{d t}(0) = \\frac{V_{s}}{L} \\tag{7.39}\n$$\n\nShould the current continue to rise at this rate, the expression for \\(i\\) would be\n\n$$\ni = \\frac{V_{s}}{L} t \\tag{7.40}\n$$\n\nfrom which, at \\(t = \\tau\\),\n\n$$\ni = \\frac{V_{s}}{L} \\frac{L}{R} = \\frac{V_{s}}{R} \\tag{7.41}\n$$\n\nEqs. 7.36 and 7.40 are plotted in Fig. 7.17. The values given by Eqs. 7.37 and 7.41 are also depicted in this figure.\n\nThe voltage across an inductor is \\(L d i / d t\\), so from Eq. 7.35, for \\(t \\geq 0^{+}\\),\n\n$$\nv = L \\left(\\frac{-R}{L}\\right) \\left(I_{0} - \\frac{V_{s}}{R}\\right) e^{-(R / L) t} = \\left(V_{s} - I_{0} R\\right) e^{-(R / L) t} \\tag{7.42}\n$$\n\nPrior to the switch being closed, the voltage across the inductor is zero. Eq. 7.42 indicates that the inductor voltage surges to \\(V_{s} - I_{0} R\\) at the instant the switch is activated and then decays exponentially to zero.\n\nThe value of \\(v\\) at \\(t = 0^{+}\\) is logical because the initial current is \\(I_{0}\\) and the inductor inhibits an instantaneous change in current, meaning the current remains \\(I_{0}\\) in the instant following the switch being closed. The voltage drop across the resistor is \\(I_{0} R\\), and the voltage imposed across the inductor is the source voltage minus this voltage drop, i.e., \\(V_{s} - I_{0} R\\).\n\nWhen the initial inductor current is zero, Eq. 7.42 simplifies to\n\n$$\nv = V_{s} e^{-(R / L) t} \\tag{7.43}\n$$\n\nIf the initial current is zero, the voltage across the inductor spikes to \\(V_{s}\\). Additionally, we anticipate the inductor voltage to diminish towards zero as \\(t\\) increases, since the current in the circuit is approaching the constant value of \\(V_{s} / R\\). Fig. 7.18 portrays the plot of Eq. 7.43 and the relationship between the time constant and the initial rate at which the inductor voltage is diminishing.\n\nIf there is an initial current in the inductor, Eq. 7.35 provides the solution for it. The algebraic sign of \\(I_{0}\\) is positive if the initial current aligns with the direction of \\(i\\); otherwise, \\(I_{0}\\) is negative. Example 7.5 demonstrates the application of Eq. 7.35 to a specific circuit.\n\n#### Example 7.5 Determining the Step Response of an RL Circuit\n\nThe switch in the circuit depicted in Fig. 7.19 has been in position a for an extended period.

Thus, the inductor sustains an initial current of 8 A. This current flows in the opposite direction to the reference direction for \\(i\\); hence \\(I_{0}\\) is -8 A. When the switch is in position b, the ultimate value of \\(i\\) will be \\(24 / 2\\), or 12 A. The circuit's time constant is \\(200 / 2\\), or 100 ms.

This current induces a 16 V drop across the \\(2 \\Omega\\) resistor. This voltage drop combines with the source voltage drop, resulting in a 40 V drop across the inductor.\nd) We find the time at which the inductor voltage equals 24 V by solving the expression\n\n$$\n24 = 40 e^{-10 t}\n$$\n\nfor \\(t\\):\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nt & = \\frac{1}{10} \\ln \\frac{40}{24} \\\\\n& = 51.08 \\times 10^{-3} \\\\\n& = 51.08 \\mathrm{~ms}.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\ne) Fig. 7.20 displays the graphs of \\(i(t)\\) and \\(v(t)\\) versus \\(t\\).

We commence by observing that the voltage across the resistor is the difference between the source voltage and the inductor voltage. We write\n\n$$\ni(t) = \\frac{V_{s}}{R} - \\frac{v(t)}{R} \\tag{7.44}\n$$\n\nwhere \\(V_{s}\\) is a constant. Differentiating both sides with respect to time yields\n\n$$\n\\frac{d i}{d t} = -\\frac{1}{R} \\frac{d v}{d t} \\tag{7.45}\n$$\n\nThen, multiplying each side of Eq. 7.45 by the inductance \\(L\\), we derive an expression for the voltage across the inductor on the left-hand side, or\n\n$$\nv = -\\frac{L}{R} \\frac{d v}{d t} \\tag{7.46}\n$$\n\nReformulating Eq. 7.46 into standard form yields\n\n$$\n\\frac{d v}{d t} + \\frac{R}{L} v = 0 \\tag{7.47}\n$$\n\nYou should verify (in Problem 7.38) that the solution to Eq. 7.47 is identical to that given in Eq. 7.42.\n\nAt this juncture, a general observation about the step response of an RL circuit is pertinent. (This observation will prove beneficial later.) When we derived the differential equation for the inductor current, we arrived at Eq. 7.29. We now rewrite Eq. 7.29 as\n\n$$\n\\frac{d i}{d t} + \\frac{R}{L} i = \\frac{V_{s}}{L} \\tag{7.48}\n$$\n\nNote that Eqs. 7.47 and 7.48 share the same form. Specifically, each equates the sum of the first derivative of the variable and a constant times the variable to a constant value. In Eq. 7.47, the constant on the right-hand side is zero; thus this equation assumes the same form as the natural response equations in Section 7.1. In both Eq. 7.47 and Eq. 7.48, the constant multiplying the dependent variable is the reciprocal of the time constant, i.e., \\(R / L = 1 / \\tau\\). We encounter a similar scenario in the derivations for the step response of an RC circuit. In Section 7.4, we will leverage these observations to develop a general approach to finding the natural and step responses of RL and"

The initial step in this approach is to solve Eq. 7.29 for the derivative \\( \\frac{d i}{d t} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d i}{d t} = \\frac{-R i + V_s}{L} = \\frac{-R}{L} \\left( i - \\frac{V_s}{R} \\right) \\tag{7.30}\n\\]\n\nNext, we multiply both sides of Eq. 7.30 by a differential time \\( d t \\).

Because the initial current is \\( I_0 \\) and the inductor prevents an instantaneous change in current, the current is \\( I_0 \\) in the instant after the switch has been closed.

    "text": "We are now set to delve into the challenge of calculating the currents and voltages that emerge in first-order \\( RL \\) and \\( RC \\) circuits upon the abrupt application of either a DC voltage or current source. This reaction of the circuit to the sudden introduction of a constant voltage or current is known as the step response. In illustrating the step response, we demonstrate how the circuit behaves as energy is accumulated within the inductor or capacitor. We initiate our exploration with the step response of an \\( RL \\) circuit.\n\n### The Step Response of an RL Circuit\n\nOur initial step is to adapt the first-order circuit depicted in Fig. 7.2(a) by incorporating a switch. This modified circuit, as shown in Fig. 7.16, serves as the foundation for our analysis of the step response of an \\( RL \\) circuit. The energy stored within the inductor at the moment the switch is activated is characterized by a non-zero initial current \\( i(0) \\). Our goal is to derive expressions for the current flowing through the circuit and the voltage across the inductor subsequent to the closure of the switch. The methodology we employ is consistent with that outlined in Section 7.1; we leverage circuit analysis to formulate the differential equation that encapsulates the circuit's behavior with respect to the variable of interest, subsequently resolving the equation via elementary calculus.\n\nOnce the switch in Fig. 7.16 is activated, Kirchhoff's voltage law necessitates that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_{s}=R i+L \\frac{d i}{d t} \\tag{7.29}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis equation can be solved for the current by separating the variables \\( i \\) and \\( t \\) and subsequently integrating. The initial phase in this approach involves solving Eq. 7.29 for the derivative \\( \\frac{d i}{d t} \\):\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{d i}{d t}=\\frac{-R i+V_{s}}{L}=\\frac{-R}{L}\\left(i-\\frac{V_{s}}{R}\\right) \\tag{7.30}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSubsequently, we multiply both sides of Eq. 7.30 by a differential time \\( d t \\). This step simplifies the left-hand side of the equation to a differential change in the current. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{d i}{d t} d t=\\frac{-R}{L}\\left(i-\\frac{V_{s}}{R}\\right) d t \\tag{7.31}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nd i=\\frac{-R}{L}\\left(i-\\frac{V_{s}}{R}\\right) d t\n$$\n\nWe proceed to separate the variables in Eq. 7.31 to obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{d i}{i-\\left(V_{s} / R\\right)}=\\frac{-R}{L} d t \\tag{7.32}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nUpon integrating both sides of Eq. 7.32, using \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) as variables for the integration, we arrive at\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\int_{I_{0}}^{i(t)} \\frac{d x}{x-\\left(V_{s} / R\\right)}=\\frac{-R}{L} \\int_{0}^{t} d y \\tag{7.33}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHere, \\( I_{0} \\) represents the current at \\( t=0 \\), and \\( i(t) \\) denotes the current at any \\( t>0 \\). The integration process outlined in Eq. 7.33 yields the expression\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\ln \\frac{i(t)-\\left(V_{s} / R\\right)}{I_{0}-\\left(V_{s} / R\\right)}=\\frac{-R}{L} t \\tag{7.34}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nfrom which we derive\n\n$$\n\\frac{i(t)-\\left(V_{s} / R\\right)}{I_{0}-\\left(V_{s} / R\\right)}=e^{-(R / L) t}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni(t)=\\frac{V_{s}}{R}+\\left(I_{0}-\\frac{V_{s}}{R}\\right) e^{-(R / L) t} \\tag{7.35}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n### Step Response of RL Circuit\n\nWhen the initial energy in the inductor is negligible, \\( I_{0} \\) is zero. Thus, Eq. 7.35 simplifies to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni(t)=\\frac{V_{s}}{R}-\\frac{V_{s}}{R} e^{-(R / L) t} \\tag{7.36}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis equation reveals that following the activation of the switch, the current exhibits an exponential rise from zero, asymptotically approaching a final value of \\( \\frac{V_{s}}{R} \\). The time constant of the circuit, \\( L/R \\), governs the rate of this increase. After a period equivalent to one time constant, the current will have achieved approximately \\( 63\\% \\) of its ultimate value, or\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni(\\tau)=\\frac{V_{s}}{R}-\\frac{V_{s}}{R} e^{-1} \\approx 0.6321 \\frac{V_{s}}{R} \\tag{7.37}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nIf the current were to sustain its initial rate of increase, it would attain its final value at \\( t=\\tau \\); that is, because\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{d i}{d t}=\\frac{-V_{s}}{R}\\left(\\frac{-1}{\\tau}\\right) e^{-t / \\tau}=\\frac{V_{s}}{L} e^{-t / \\tau} \\tag{7.38}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nthe initial rate of increase of \\( i(t) \\) is\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{d i}{d t}(0)=\\frac{V_{s}}{L} \\tag{7.39}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nShould the current continue to increase at this rate, the expression for \\( i \\) would be\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni=\\frac{V_{s}}{L} t \\tag{7.40}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nfrom which, at \\( t=\\tau \\),\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni=\\frac{V_{s}}{L} \\frac{L}{R}=\\frac{V_{s}}{R} \\tag{7.41}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquations 7.36 and 7.40 are illustrated in Fig. 7.17. The values derived from Eqs. 7.37 and 7.41 are also depicted in this figure.\n\nGiven that the voltage across an inductor is \\( L \\frac{d i}{d t} \\), from Eq. 7.35, for \\( t \\geq 0^{+} \\),\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv=L\\left(\\frac{-R}{L}\\right)\\left(I_{0}-\\frac{V_{s}}{R}\\right) e^{-(R / L) t}=\\left(V_{s}-I_{0} R\\right) e^{-(R / L) t} \\tag{7.42}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe voltage across the inductor is negligible before the switch is activated. Eq. 7.42 indicates that the inductor voltage surges to \\( V_{s}-I_{0} R \\) at the instant the switch is closed and then undergoes exponential decay towards zero.\n\nThe initial voltage \\( v \\) at \\( t=0^{+} \\) aligns with our expectations because the initial current is \\( I_{0} \\), and the inductor opposes any instantaneous change in current. Consequently, the current remains \\( I_{0} \\) in the instant following the closure of the switch. The voltage drop across the resistor is \\( I_{0} R \\), and the voltage induced across the inductor is the source voltage minus the voltage drop, i.e., \\( V_{s}-I_{0} R \\).\n\nIn the scenario where the initial inductor current is zero, Eq. 7.42 simplifies to\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv=V_{s} e^{-(R / L) t} \\tag{7.43}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nWhen the initial current is zero, the voltage across the inductor spikes to \\( V_{s} \\). We also anticipate that the inductor voltage will diminish towards zero as \\( t \\) increases, since the current in the circuit is approaching the constant value of \\( V_{s} / R \\). Figure 7.18 presents the plot of Eq. 7.43 and elucidates the relationship between the time constant and the initial rate of decrease of the inductor voltage.\n\nIf an initial current is present in the inductor, Eq. 7.35 provides the solution. The algebraic sign of \\( I_{0} \\) is positive if the initial current aligns with the direction of \\( i \\); otherwise, \\( I_{0} \\) assumes a negative sign. Example 7.5 showcases the application of Eq. 7.35 to a specific circuit.\n\n#### Example 7.5 Determining the Step Response of an RL Circuit\n\nThe switch in the circuit depicted in Fig. 7.19 has been in position 'a' for an extended duration. At \\( t=0 \\), the switch transitions from position 'a' to position 'b'. This switch is of the make-before-break type; hence, the connection at position 'b' is established prior to the disconnection at position 'a', ensuring uninterrupted current flow through the inductor.\na) Determine the expression for \\( i(t) \\) for \\( t \\geq 0 \\).\nb) Calculate the initial voltage across the inductor immediately following the switch's movement to position 'b'.\nc) Determine the time, in milliseconds, required for the inductor voltage to reach 24 V after the switch has been shifted.\nd) Assess whether this initial voltage is consistent with the expected circuit behavior.\ne) Plot both \\( i(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) versus \\( t \\).\n\nThe circuit in Fig. 7.19 features a switch SW1 that alters its position at \\( t=0 \\), modifying the current path through the inductor L1. Initially, the inductor current is 8 A, opposing the reference direction for \\( i \\). The final current value is 12 A, with a time constant of 100 ms.\n\n#### Solution\n\na) With the switch positioned at 'a' for a prolonged period, the 200 mH inductor behaves as a short circuit across the 8 A current source. Consequently, the inductor sustains an initial current of 8 A. This current is oriented opposite to the reference direction for \\( i \\); hence, \\( I_{0} \\) is -8 A. When the switch is in position 'b', the final value of \\( i \\) will be \\( 24 / 2 \\) or 12 A. The time constant of the circuit is \\( 200 / 2 \\) or 100 ms. Substituting these values into Eq. 7.35 yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ni & =12+(-8-12) e^{-t / 0.1} \\\\\n& =12-20 e^{-10 t} \\mathrm{~A}, \\quad t \\geq 0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nb) The voltage across the inductor is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nv & =L \\frac{d i}{d t} \\\\\n& =0.2\\left(200 e^{-10 t}\\right) \\\\\n& =40 e^{-10 t} \\mathrm{~V}, \\quad t \\geq 0^{+}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe initial inductor voltage is\n\n$$\nv\\left(0^{+}\\right)=40 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nc) Yes; immediately after the switch is moved to position 'b', the inductor maintains a current of 8 A, flowing counterclockwise around the newly formed closed path. This current generates a 16 V drop across the \\( 2 \\Omega \\) resistor. This voltage drop combines with the source voltage, resulting in a 40 V drop across the inductor.\nd) To find the time at which the inductor voltage equals 24 V, we solve the equation\n\n$$\n24=40 e^{-10 t}\n$$\n\nfor \\( t \\):\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nt & =\\frac{1}{10} \\ln \\frac{40}{24} \\\\\n& =51.08 \\times 10^{-3} \\\\\n& =51.08 \\mathrm{~ms} .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\ne) Figure 7.20 exhibits the graphs of \\( i(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) versus \\( t \\). Note that the instance when the current equals zero corresponds to the moment when the inductor voltage equals the source voltage of 24 V, as predicted by Kirchhoff's voltage law.\n\nThe graph in Figure 7.20 depicts the time-domain waveforms illustrating the behavior of current \\( i(t) \\) and voltage \\( v(t) \\) across an inductor over time \\( t \\), measured in milliseconds (ms). The horizontal axis represents time, ranging from 0 to 500 ms, while the vertical axis features two scales: voltage \\( v \\) in volts (V) on the left, and current \\( i \\) in amperes (A) on the right.\n\nThe voltage \\( v(t) \\), depicted by the black curve, commences at 40 V at \\( t = 0 \\) and exhibits an exponential decay towards zero as time progresses. Notably, the voltage reaches 24 V at approximately 51.08 ms, which aligns with the calculated time when the inductor voltage equals the source voltage.\n\nThe current \\( i(t) \\), represented by the blue curve, begins at -8 A at \\( t = 0 \\) and increases exponentially towards zero as time increases. This behavior is consistent with the step response of an RL circuit, where the current eventually stabilizes.\n\nKey features include the zero-crossing point of the current, which coincides with the voltage reaching the source voltage of 24 V, as predicted by Kirchhoff's voltage law. The graph visually demonstrates the transient response of an RL circuit, highlighting the interplay between voltage and current over time.\n\nASSESSMENT PROBLEM\n\nObjective 2-Be able to determine the step response of both RL and RC circuits\n\n7.5 Assume that the switch in the circuit shown in Fig. 7.19 has been in position 'b' for an extended duration, and at \\( t=0 \\) it shifts to position 'a'.

Utilizing \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) as variables for the integration, we arrive at\n\n$$\n\\int_{I_{0}}^{i(t)} \\frac{d x}{x - \\left( \\frac{V_{s}}{R} \\right)} = \\frac{-R}{L} \\int_{0}^{t} d y\n$$\n\nwhere \\( I_{0} \\) denotes the current at \\( t = 0 \\) and \\( i(t) \\) represents the current at any \\( t > 0 \\). Carrying out the integration specified in Eq. 7.33 yields the expression\n\n$$\n\\ln \\frac{i(t) - \\left( \\frac{V_{s}}{R} \\right)}{I_{0} - \\left( \\frac{V_{s}}{R} \\right)} = \\frac{-R}{L} t\n$$\n\nfrom which\n\n$$\n\\frac{i(t) - \\left( \\frac{V_{s}}{R} \\right)}{I_{0} - \\left( \\frac{V_{s}}{R} \\right)} = e^{-(R / L) t}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\ni(t) = \\frac{V_{s}}{R} + \\left( I_{0} - \\frac{V_{s}}{R} \\right) e^{-(R / L) t}\n$$\n\nStep Response of RL Circuit\n\nIn the event that the initial energy in the inductor is nil, \\( I_{0} \\) is zero. Consequently, Eq. 7.35 simplifies to\n\n$$\ni(t) = \\frac{V_{s}}{R} - \\frac{V_{s}}{R} e^{-(R / L) t}\n$$\n\nThis equation signifies that following the closure of the switch, the current escalates exponentially from zero to a final value of \\( V_{s} / R \\). The time constant of the circuit, \\( L / R \\), governs the rate of this escalation. After one time constant has elapsed since the switch was closed, the current will have ascended to roughly 63% of its ultimate value, or\n\n$$\ni(\\tau) = \\frac{V_{s}}{R} - \\frac{V_{s}}{R} e^{-1} \\approx 0.6321 \\frac{V_{s}}{R}\n$$\n\nShould the current persist in increasing at its initial rate, it would attain its final value at \\( t = \\tau \\); that is, since\n\n$$\n\\frac{d i}{d t} = \\frac{-V_{s}}{R} \\left( \\frac{-1}{\\tau} \\right) e^{-t / \\tau} = \\frac{V_{s}}{L} e^{-t / \\tau}\n$$\n\nthe initial rate at which \\( i(t) \\) ascends is\n\n$$\n\\frac{d i}{d t}(0) = \\frac{V_{s}}{L}\n$$\n\nIf the current were to continue rising at this rate, the expression for \\( i \\) would be\n\n$$\ni = \\frac{V_{s}}{L} t\n$$\n\nfrom which, at \\( t = \\tau \\),\n\n$$\ni = \\frac{V_{s}}{L} \\frac{L}{R} = \\frac{V_{s}}{R}\n$$\n\nEquations 7.36 and 7.40 are depicted in Fig. 7.17. The values yielded by Eqs. 7.37 and 7.41 are also presented in this figure.\n\nThe voltage across an inductor is \\( L \\frac{d i}{d t} \\), so from Eq. 7.35, for \\( t \\geq 0^{+} \\),\n\n$$\nv = L \\left( \\frac{-R}{L} \\right) \\left( I_{0} - \\frac{V_{s}}{R} \\right) e^{-(R / L) t} = \\left( V_{s} - I_{0} R \\right) e^{-(R / L) t}\n$$\n\nThe voltage across the inductor is null prior to the switch being closed. Equation 7.42 suggests that the inductor voltage surges to \\( V_{s} - I_{0} R \\) at the precise moment the switch is closed and subsequently decays exponentially to zero.\n\nDoes the value of \\( v \\) at \\( t = 0^{+} \\) hold logical significance? Given that the initial current is \\( I_{0} \\) and the inductor prohibits an instantaneous change in current, the current remains \\( I_{0} \\) in the instant following the closure of the switch. The voltage drop across the resistor is \\( I_{0} R \\), and the voltage imposed across the inductor is the source voltage minus this voltage drop, i.e., \\( V_{s} - I_{0} R \\).\n\nWhen the initial inductor current is zero, Eq. 7.42 simplifies to\n\n$$\nv = V_{s} e^{-(R / L) t}\n$$\n\nIf the initial current is zero, the voltage across the inductor spikes to \\( V_{s} \\). We also anticipate that the inductor voltage will diminish towards zero as \\( t \\) increases, since the current in the circuit is approaching the constant value of \\( V_{s} / R \\). Figure 7.18 portrays the plot of Eq. 7.43 and the relationship between the time constant and the initial rate at which the inductor voltage is diminishing.\n\nIf an initial current exists in the inductor, Eq. 7.35 provides the solution for it. The algebraic sign of \\( I_{0} \\) is positive if the initial current aligns with the direction of \\( i \\); otherwise, \\( I_{0} \\) assumes a negative sign. Example 7.5 exemplifies the application of Eq. 7.35 to a particular circuit.\n\n#### Example 7.5 Determining the Step Response of an RL Circuit\n\nThe switch in the circuit depicted in Fig. 7.19 has remained in position a for an extended duration.

When the switch shifts to position b, the ultimate value of \\( i \\) will be \\( 24 / 2 \\), or 12 A. The time constant of the circuit is \\( 200 / 2 \\), or 100 ms. Substituting these values into Eq. 7.35 yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ni & = 12 + (-8 - 12) e^{-t / 0.1} \\\\\n& = 12 - 20 e^{-10 t} \\mathrm{~A}, \\quad t \\geq 0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nb) The voltage across the inductor is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nv & = L \\frac{d i}{d t} \\\\\n& = 0.2 \\left( 200 e^{-10 t} \\right) \\\\\n& = 40 e^{-10 t} \\mathrm{~V}, \\quad t \\geq 0^{+}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe initial inductor voltage is\n\n$$\nv(0^{+}) = 40 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nc) Indeed; in the instant after the switch is shifted to position b, the inductor sustains a current of 8 A flowing counterclockwise around the newly formed closed path.

The circuit's reaction to the sudden onset of a constant voltage or current source is known as the step response. In depicting the step response, we illustrate the circuit's reaction when energy is accumulating in the inductor or capacitor. We initiate our discussion with the step response of an RL circuit.\n\nThe Step Response of an RL Circuit\n\nWe commence by modifying the first-order circuit depicted in Fig. 7.2(a) by incorporating a switch. The resultant circuit, as shown in Fig. 7.16, is utilized in developing the step response of an RL circuit. The energy stored in the inductor at the moment the switch is activated is expressed in terms of a non-zero initial current \\( i(0) \\). The objective is to derive the expressions for the current within the circuit and the voltage across the inductor following the closure of the switch. The method is consistent with that employed in Section 7.1; we employ circuit analysis to derive the differential equation that characterizes the circuit in terms of the variable of interest, subsequently employing elementary calculus to solve the equation.\n\nUpon the closure of the switch in Fig. 7.16, Kirchhoff's voltage law necessitates that\n\n$$\nV_{s} = R i + L \\frac{d i}{d t} \\tag{7.29}\n$$\n\nwhich can be resolved for the current by segregating the variables \\( i \\) and \\( t \\) and subsequently integrating. The initial step in this approach is to solve Eq. 7.29 for the derivative \\( \\frac{d i}{d t} \\):\n\n$$\n\\frac{d i}{d t} = \\frac{-R i + V_{s}}{L} = \\frac{-R}{L} \\left( i - \\frac{V_{s}}{R} \\right) \\tag{7.30}\n$$\n\nSubsequently, we multiply both sides of Eq. 7.30 by a differential time \\( d t \\). This step diminishes the left-hand side of the equation to a differential change in the current. Thus\n\n$$\n\\frac{d i}{d t} d t = \\frac{-R}{L} \\left( i - \\frac{V_{s}}{R} \\right) d t \\tag{7.31}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nd i = \\frac{-R}{L} \\left( i - \\frac{V_{s}}{R} \\right) d t\n$$\n\nWe now segregate the variables in Eq. 7.31 to obtain\n\n$$\n\\frac{d i}{i - \\left( V_{s} / R \\right)} = \\frac{-R}{L} d t \\tag{7.32}\n$$\n\nand then integrate both sides of Eq. 7.32.

Consequently, Eq. 7.35 simplifies to\n\n$$\ni(t) = \\frac{V_{s}}{R} - \\frac{V_{s}}{R} e^{-(R / L) t} \\tag{7.36}\n$$\n\nEq. 7.36 signifies that following the closure of the switch, the current escalates exponentially from zero to a terminal value of \\( V_{s} / R \\). The circuit's time constant, \\( L / R \\), dictates the rate of escalation. After one time constant has elapsed since the switch has been closed, the current will have achieved approximately 63% of its terminal value, or\n\n$$\ni(\\tau) = \\frac{V_{s}}{R} - \\frac{V_{s}}{R} e^{-1} \\approx 0.6321 \\frac{V_{s}}{R} \\tag{7.37}\n$$\n\nIf the current were to persist in escalating at its initial rate, it would attain its terminal value at \\( t = \\tau \\); that is, because\n\n$$\n\\frac{d i}{d t} = \\frac{-V_{s}}{R} \\left( \\frac{-1}{\\tau} \\right) e^{-t / \\tau} = \\frac{V_{s}}{L} e^{-t / \\tau} \\tag{7.38}\n$$\n\nthe initial rate at which \\( i(t) \\) escalates is\n\n$$\n\\frac{d i}{d t}(0) = \\frac{V_{s}}{L} \\tag{7.39}\n$$\n\nIf the current were to persist in escalating at this rate, the expression for \\( i \\) would be\n\n$$\ni = \\frac{V_{s}}{L} t \\tag{7.40}\n$$\n\nfrom which, at \\( t = \\tau \\),\n\n$$\ni = \\frac{V_{s}}{L} \\frac{L}{R} = \\frac{V_{s}}{R} \\tag{7.41}\n$$\n\nEqs. 7.36 and 7.40 are illustrated in Fig. 7.17. The values provided by Eqs. 7.37 and 7.41 are also depicted in this figure.\n\nThe voltage across an inductor is \\( L \\frac{d i}{d t} \\), hence from Eq. 7.35, for \\( t \\geq 0^{+} \\),\n\n$$\nv = L \\left( \\frac{-R}{L} \\right) \\left( I_{0} - \\frac{V_{s}}{R} \\right) e^{-(R / L) t} = \\left( V_{s} - I_{0} R \\right) e^{-(R / L) t} \\tag{7.42}\n$$\n\nThe voltage across the inductor is zero prior to the closure of the switch. Eq. 7.42 indicates that the inductor voltage surges to \\( V_{s} - I_{0} R \\) at the instant the switch is closed and then decays exponentially to zero.\n\nDoes the value of \\( v \\) at \\( t = 0^{+} \\) make sense? Because the initial current is \\( I_{0} \\) and the inductor impedes an instantaneous change in current, the current remains \\( I_{0} \\) in the instant after the switch has been closed.

We also anticipate the inductor voltage to diminish towards zero as \\( t \\) increases, since the current in the circuit is approaching the constant value of \\( V_{s} / R \\). Fig. 7.18 exhibits the plot of Eq. 7.43 and the relationship between the time constant and the initial rate at which the inductor voltage is diminishing.\n\nIf there exists an initial current in the inductor, Eq. 7.35 furnishes the solution for it.

Integrating Eq. 7.33 yields the expression\n\n$$\n\\ln \\frac{i(t) - \\left( V_{s} / R \\right)}{I_{0} - \\left( V_{s} / R \\right)} = \\frac{-R}{L} t \\tag{7.34}\n$$\n\nfrom which we derive\n\n$$\n\\frac{i(t) - \\left( V_{s} / R \\right)}{I_{0} - \\left( V_{s} / R \\right)} = e^{-(R / L) t}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\ni(t) = \\frac{V_{s}}{R} + \\left( I_{0} - \\frac{V_{s}}{R} \\right) e^{-(R / L) t} \\tag{7.35}\n$$\n\nWhen the inductor's initial energy is negligible, \\( I_{0} \\) equals zero. Consequently, Eq. 7.35 simplifies to\n\n$$\ni(t) = \\frac{V_{s}}{R} - \\frac{V_{s}}{R} e^{-(R / L) t} \\tag{7.36}\n$$\n\nEq. 7.36 indicates that after the switch is activated, the current escalates exponentially from zero, asymptotically approaching a final value of \\( V_{s} / R \\). The circuit's time constant, \\( L / R \\), governs the rate of this increase. At one time constant after the switch closure, the current will have ascended to roughly 63% of its ultimate value, or\n\n$$\ni(\\tau) = \\frac{V_{s}}{R} - \\frac{V_{s}}{R} e^{-1} \\approx 0.6321 \\frac{V_{s}}{R} \\tag{7.37}\n$$\n\nIf the current were to persist in increasing at its initial rate, it would attain its final value at \\( t = \\tau \\); this is because\n\n$$\n\\frac{d i}{d t} = \\frac{-V_{s}}{R} \\left( \\frac{-1}{\\tau} \\right) e^{-t / \\tau} = \\frac{V_{s}}{L} e^{-t / \\tau} \\tag{7.38}\n$$\n\nthe initial rate of increase for \\( i(t) \\) is\n\n$$\n\\frac{d i}{d t}(0) = \\frac{V_{s}}{L} \\tag{7.39}\n$$\n\nShould the current continue to rise at this rate, the expression for \\( i \\) would be\n\n$$\ni = \\frac{V_{s}}{L} t \\tag{7.40}\n$$\n\nand thus, at \\( t = \\tau \\),\n\n$$\ni = \\frac{V_{s}}{L} \\frac{L}{R} = \\frac{V_{s}}{R} \\tag{7.41}\n$$\n\nEqs. 7.36 and 7.40 are depicted in Fig. 7.17. The values provided by Eqs. 7.37 and 7.41 are also depicted in this figure.\n\nThe voltage across the inductor is \\( L d i / d t \\), hence from Eq. 7.35, for \\( t \\geq 0^{+} \\),\n\n$$\nv = L \\left( \\frac{-R}{L} \\right) \\left( I_{0} - \\frac{V_{s}}{R} \\right) e^{-(R / L) t} = \\left( V_{s} - I_{0} R \\right) e^{-(R / L) t} \\tag{7.42}\n$$\n\nThe voltage across the inductor is null before the switch is activated. Eq. 7.42 reveals that the inductor voltage surges to \\( V_{s} - I_{0} R \\) at the instant the switch is closed and then exponentially decays to zero.\n\nThe voltage value at \\( t = 0^{+} \\) is logically consistent. Since the initial current is \\( I_{0} \\) and the inductor resists instantaneous current changes, the current remains \\( I_{0} \\) immediately after the switch closure. The voltage drop across the resistor is \\( I_{0} R \\), and the voltage imposed across the inductor is the source voltage minus this voltage drop, i.e., \\( V_{s} - I_{0} R \\).\n\nWhen the initial inductor current is zero, Eq. 7.42 simplifies to\n\n$$\nv = V_{s} e^{-(R / L) t} \\tag{7.43}\n$$\n\nIf the initial current is zero, the voltage across the inductor spikes to \\( V_{s} \\). Additionally, we anticipate that the inductor voltage will approach zero as \\( t \\) increases, since the current within the circuit is converging towards the constant value of \\( V_{s} / R \\). Fig. 7.18 exhibits the plot of Eq. 7.43, elucidating the relationship between the time constant and the initial rate of inductor voltage decline.\n\nIf an initial current exists in the inductor, Eq. 7.35 provides the solution for it. The algebraic sign of \\( I_{0} \\) is positive if the initial current aligns with the direction of \\( i \\); conversely, \\( I_{0} \\) assumes a negative sign. Example 7.5 exemplifies the application of Eq. 7.35 to a specific circuit.\n\n### Example 7.5: Determining the Step Response of an RL Circuit\n\nThe switch in the circuit depicted in Fig. 7.19 has remained in position a for an extended duration. At \\( t = 0 \\), the switch transitions from position a to position b. This switch is of the make-before-break type, meaning the connection at position b is established prior to the disconnection at position a, thereby ensuring uninterrupted current flow through the inductor.\n\n#### Solution\n\n(a) With the switch in position a for a prolonged period, the 200 mH inductor behaves as a short circuit across the 8 A current source. Consequently, the inductor sustains an initial current of 8 A. This current flows in opposition to the reference direction for \\( i \\); hence \\( I_{0} \\) is -8 A. When the switch is in position b, the final current value, \\( i \\), will be \\( 24 / 2 \\) or 12 A. The circuit's time constant is \\( 200 / 2 \\) or 100 ms. Substituting these values into Eq. 7.35 yields\n\n$$\ni = 12 + (-8 - 12) e^{-t / 0.1} = 12 - 20 e^{-10 t} \\mathrm{~A}, \\quad t \\geq 0\n$$\n\n(b) The voltage across the inductor is given by\n\n$$\nv = L \\frac{d i}{d t} = 0.2 \\left( 200 e^{-10 t} \\right) = 40 e^{-10 t} \\mathrm{~V}, \\quad t \\geq 0^{+}\n$$\n\nThe initial inductor voltage is\n\n$$\nv(0^{+}) = 40 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\n(c) Yes; immediately after the switch shifts to position b, the inductor maintains a current of 8 A, circulating counterclockwise around the newly formed closed path. This current induces a 16 V drop across the \\( 2 \\Omega \\) resistor. This voltage drop is added to the source voltage drop, resulting in a 40 V drop across the inductor.\n\n(d) The time at which the inductor voltage reaches 24 V is determined by solving the equation\n\n$$\n24 = 40 e^{-10 t}\n$$\n\nfor \\( t \\):\n\n$$\nt = \\frac{1}{10} \\ln \\frac{40}{24} = 51.08 \\times 10^{-3} = 51.08 \\mathrm{~ms}\n$$\n\n(e) Fig. 7.20 portrays the graphs of \\( i(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) versus \\( t \\). It is observed that the instance when the current is zero corresponds to the moment when the inductor voltage equals the source voltage of 24 V, as predicted by Kirchhoff's voltage law.\n\n### The Step Response of an RC Circuit\n\nWe can determine the step response of a first-order RC circuit by examining the circuit depicted in Fig. 7.21. For mathematical expedience, we select the Norton equivalent of the network connected to the equivalent capacitor. By summing the currents flowing away from the top node in Fig. 7.21, we derive the differential equation\n\n$$\nC \\frac{d v_{C}}{d t} + \\frac{v_{C}}{R} = I_{s} \\tag{7.49}\n$$\n\nDividing Eq. 7.49 by \\( C \\) yields\n\n$$\n\\frac{d v_{C}}{d t} + \\frac{v_{C}}{R C} = \\frac{I_{s}}{C} \\tag{7.50}\n$$\n\nA comparison of Eq. 7.50 with Eq. 7.48 reveals that the solution form for \\( v_{C} \\) is analogous to that for the current in the inductive circuit, specifically Eq. 7.35. Hence, by substituting the pertinent variables and coefficients, we can directly write the solution for \\( v_{C} \\). This substitution necessitates replacing \\( I_{s} \\) with \\( V_{s} \\), \\( C \\) with \\( L \\), \\( 1 / R \\) with \\( R \\), and \\( V_{0} \\) with \\( I_{0} \\). The resulting solution for \\( v_{C} \\) is\n\n$$\nv_{C} = I_{s} R + \\left( V_{0} - I_{s} R \\right) e^{-t / R C}, \\quad t \\geq 0 \\tag{7.51}\n$$\n\nA similar derivation for the current in the capacitor yields the differential equation\n\n$$\n\\frac{d i}{d t} + \\frac{1}{R C} i = 0 \\tag{7.52}\n$$\n\nEq. 7.52 shares the same form as Eq. 7.47, implying that the solution for \\( i \\) can be obtained using the same substitutions applied to the solution of Eq. 7.50. Thus,\n\n$$\ni = \\left( I_{s} - \\frac{V_{0}}{R} \\right) e^{-t / R C}, \\quad t \\geq 0^{+} \\tag{7.53}\n$$\n\nwhere \\( V_{0} \\) is the initial voltage across the capacitor.\n\nWe arrived at Eqs. 7.51 and 7.53 by drawing a mathematical analogy to the solution for the step response of the inductive circuit. Let's examine whether these solutions for the RC circuit are consistent with known circuit behavior. From Eq. 7.51, it is evident that the initial capacitor voltage is \\( V_{0} \\), the final capacitor voltage is \\( I_{s} R \\), and the circuit's time constant is \\( R C \\). Additionally, the solution for \\( v_{C} \\) is valid for \\( t \\geq 0 \\). These observations align with the behavior of a capacitor in parallel with a resistor when driven by a constant current source.\n\nEq. 7.53 predicts that the capacitor current at \\( t = 0^{+} \\) is \\( I_{s} - V_{0} / R \\). This prediction is logical because the capacitor voltage cannot alter instantaneously, and thus the initial current in the resistor is \\( V_{0} / R \\). The capacitor branch current shifts instantaneously from zero at \\( t = 0^{-} \\) to \\( I_{s} - V_{0} / R \\) at \\( t = 0^{+} \\). The capacitor current diminishes to zero at \\( t = \\infty \\). Additionally, the final voltage value is \\( v = I_{s} R \\).\n\nExample 7.6 demonstrates how to apply Eqs. 7.51 and 7.53 to ascertain the step response of a first-order RC circuit.\n\n### Example 7.6: Determining the Step Response of an RC Circuit\n\nThe switch in the circuit illustrated in Fig. 7.22 has been in position 1 for an extended duration. At \\( t = 0 \\), the switch moves to position 2. Determine\n\n(a) \\( v_{o}(t) \\) for \\( t \\geq 0 \\) and\n\n(b) \\( i_{o}(t) \\) for \\( t \\geq 0^{+} \\).\n\n#### Solution\n\n(a) With the switch in position 1 for a prolonged period, the initial \\( v_{o} \\) value is \\( 40(60 / 80) \\) or 30 V. To leverage Eqs. 7.51 and 7.53, we find the Norton equivalent with respect to the capacitor terminals for \\( t \\geq 0 \\). We initiate this process by calculating the open-circuit voltage, which is determined by the -75 V source divided across the \\( 40 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega \\) and \\( 160 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega \\) resistors:\n\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{oc}} = \\frac{160 \\times 10^{3}}{(40+160) \\times 10^{3}}(-75) = -60 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the Thévenin resistance, as observed to the right of the capacitor, by short-circuiting the -75 V source and making series and parallel combinations of the resistors:\n\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{Th}} = 8000 + 40,000 \\| 160,000 = 40 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega\n$$\n\nThe Norton current source value is the ratio of the open-circuit voltage to the Thévenin resistance, or \\( -60 / (40 \\times 10^{3}) = -1.5 \\mathrm{~mA} \\). The resulting Norton equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 7.23. From Fig. 7.23, \\( I_{s} R = -60 \\mathrm{~V} \\) and \\( R C = 10 \\mathrm{~ms} \\). We have already identified that \\( v_{o}(0) = 30 \\mathrm{~V} \\), so the solution for \\( v_{o} \\) is\n\n$$\nv_{o} = -60 + [30 - (-60)] e^{-100 t} = -60 + 90 e^{-100 t} \\mathrm{~V}, \\quad t \\geq 0\n$$\n\n(b) We directly derive the solution for \\( i_{o} \\) from Eq. 7.53, noting that \\( I_{s} = -1.5 \\mathrm{~mA} \\) and \\( V_{0} / R = (30 / 40) \\times 10^{-3} \\) or 0.75 mA:\n\n$$\ni_{o} = -2.25 e^{-100 t} \\mathrm{~mA}, \\quad t \\geq 0^{+}\n$$\n\nWe verify the consistency of the solutions for \\( v_{o} \\) and \\( i_{o} \\) by"

After one time constant has elapsed since the switch has been closed, the current will have reached approximately 63% of its final value, or\n\n\\[\ni(\\tau) = \\frac{V_{s}}{R} - \\frac{V_{s}}{R} e^{-1} \\approx 0.6321 \\frac{V_{s}}{R} \\tag{7.37}\n\\]\n\nIf the current were to continue to rise at its initial rate, it would attain its final value at \\(t = \\tau\\); that is, since\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d i}{d t} = \\frac{-V_{s}}{R} \\left(\\frac{-1}{\\tau}\\right) e^{-t / \\tau} = \\frac{V_{s}}{L} e^{-t / \\tau} \\tag{7.38}\n\\]\n\nthe initial rate of increase of \\(i(t)\\) is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d i}{d t}(0) = \\frac{V_{s}}{L} \\tag{7.39}\n\\]\n\nIf the current were to continue to rise at this rate, the expression for \\(i\\) would be\n\n\\[\ni = \\frac{V_{s}}{L} t \\tag{7.40}\n\\]\n\nfrom which, at \\(t = \\tau\\),\n\n\\[\ni = \\frac{V_{s}}{L} \\frac{L}{R} = \\frac{V_{s}}{R} \\tag{7.41}\n\\]\n\nEqs. 7.36 and 7.40 are graphed in Fig. 7.17. The values given by Eqs. 7.37 and 7.41 are also depicted in this figure.\n\nThe voltage across an inductor is \\(L d i / d t\\), so from Eq. 7.35, for \\(t \\geq 0^{+}\\),\n\n\\[\nv = L \\left(\\frac{-R}{L}\\right) \\left(I_{0} - \\frac{V_{s}}{R}\\right) e^{-(R / L) t} = \\left(V_{s} - I_{0} R\\right) e^{-(R / L) t} \\tag{7.42}\n\\]\n\nThe voltage across the inductor is null before the switch is closed. Eq. 7.42 indicates that the inductor voltage surges to \\(V_{s} - I_{0} R\\) at the instant the switch is closed and then decays exponentially to zero.\n\nDoes the value of \\(v\\) at \\(t = 0^{+}\\) make sense? Because the initial current is \\(I_{0}\\) and the inductor prohibits an instantaneous change in current, the current remains \\(I_{0}\\) in the instant after the switch has been closed. The voltage drop across the resistor is \\(I_{0} R\\), and the voltage impressed across the inductor is the source voltage minus the voltage drop, that is, \\(V_{s} - I_{0} R\\).\n\nWhen the initial inductor current is zero, Eq. 7.42 simplifies to\n\n\\[\nv = V_{s} e^{-(R / L) t} \\tag{7.43}\n\\]\n\nIf the initial current is zero, the voltage across the inductor spikes to \\(V_{s}\\). We also anticipate the inductor voltage to diminish towards zero as \\(t\\) increases, because the current in the circuit is approaching the constant value of \\(V_{s} / R\\). Fig. 7.18 illustrates the plot of Eq. 7.43 and the relationship between the time constant and the initial rate at which the inductor voltage is diminishing.\n\nIf there is an initial current in the inductor, Eq. 7.35 provides the solution for it. The algebraic sign of \\(I_{0}\\) is positive if the initial current aligns with the direction of \\(i\\); otherwise, \\(I_{0}\\) assumes a negative sign. Example 7.5 demonstrates the application of Eq. 7.35 to a specific circuit.\n\n#### Example 7.5 Determining the Step Response of an RL Circuit\n\nThe switch in the circuit depicted in Fig. 7.19 has remained in position a for an extended duration.

Initially, the inductor current is 8 A, opposing the reference direction for \\(i\\). The final current value is 12 A, with a time constant of 100 ms.\n\nFigure 7.19 A The circuit for Example 7.5.\n\n#### Solution\n\na) The switch has been in position a for a prolonged period, rendering the 200 mH inductor a short circuit across the 8 A current source. Hence, the inductor sustains an initial current of 8 A. This current is oriented opposite to the reference direction for \\(i\\); thus, \\(I_{0}\\) is -8 A. When the switch is in position b, the ultimate value of \\(i\\) will be \\(24 / 2\\), or 12 A. The circuit's time constant is \\(200 / 2\\), or 100 ms. Substituting these values into Eq. 7.35 yields\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ni & = 12 + (-8 - 12) e^{-t / 0.1} \\\\\n& = 12 - 20 e^{-10 t} \\mathrm{~A}, \\quad t \\geq 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nb) The voltage across the inductor is\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nv & = L \\frac{d i}{d t} \\\\\n& = 0.2 \\left(200 e^{-10 t}\\right) \\\\\n& = 40 e^{-10 t} \\mathrm{~V}, \\quad t \\geq 0^{+}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nThe initial inductor voltage is\n\n\\[\nv(0^{+}) = 40 \\mathrm{~V}\n\\]\n\nc) Indeed; in the instant after the switch has been shifted to position b, the inductor maintains a current of 8 A counterclockwise around the newly formed closed path. This current induces a 16 V drop across the \\(2 \\Omega\\) resistor. This voltage drop adds to the drop across the source, generating a 40 V drop across the inductor.\nd) We ascertain the time at which the inductor voltage equals 24 V by solving the expression\n\n\\[\n24 = 40 e^{-10 t}\n\\]\n\nfor \\(t\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nt & = \\frac{1}{10} \\ln \\frac{40}{24} \\\\\n& = 51.08 \\times 10^{-3} \\\\\n& = 51.08 \\mathrm{~ms} .\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\ne) Fig. 7.20 presents the graphs of \\(i(t)\\) and \\(v(t)\\) versus \\(t\\). Note that the instant of time when the current equals zero corresponds to the instant of time when the inductor voltage equals the source voltage of 24 V, as predicted by Kirchhoff's voltage law.\nimage_name:Figure 7.20\ndescription:\nThe graph in Figure 7.20 is a time-domain waveform depicting the behavior of current \\(i(t)\\) and voltage \\(v(t)\\) across an inductor over time \\(t\\), measured in milliseconds (ms).

Specifically, each equates the sum of the first derivative of the variable and a constant times the variable to a constant value. In Eq. 7.47, the constant on the right-hand side incidentally is zero; hence this equation assumes the same form as the natural response equations in Section 7.1. In both Eq. 7.47 and Eq. 7.48, the constant multiplying the dependent variable is the reciprocal of the time constant, that is, \\(R / L = 1 / \\tau\\).

    "text": "We are set to delve into the challenge of calculating the currents and voltages produced within first-order \\(RL\\) and \\(RC\\) circuits upon the abrupt application of either a direct current (dc) voltage or a current source. This response of the circuit to a sudden input of a constant voltage or current is known as the step response. We will exhibit how the circuit reacts when energy is accumulating in the inductor or capacitor, commencing with the step response of an \\(RL\\) circuit.\n\n**The Step Response of an RL Circuit**\n\nInitially, we adjust the first-order circuit depicted in Fig. 7.2(a) by incorporating a switch. We utilize this modified circuit, as displayed in Fig. 7.16, to derive the step response of an \\(RL\\) circuit. The energy stored in the inductor at the moment the switch is activated is expressed as a non-zero initial current \\(i(0)\\). Our goal is to determine the expressions for the current flowing through the circuit and the voltage across the inductor after the switch is activated. The methodology is consistent with that employed in Section 7.1; we employ circuit analysis to derive the differential equation that portrays the circuit in terms of the variable of interest, subsequently solving the equation using basic calculus.\n\nOnce the switch in Fig. 7.16 is activated, Kirchhoff's voltage law necessitates that:\n\n\\[\nV_s = R i + L \\frac{d i}{d t} \\tag{7.29}\n\\]\n\nThis equation can be resolved for the current by separating the variables \\(i\\) and \\(t\\) and then integrating. The initial step in this process is to solve Eq. 7.29 for the derivative \\(\\frac{d i}{d t}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d i}{d t} = \\frac{-R i + V_s}{L} = \\frac{-R}{L} \\left(i - \\frac{V_s}{R}\\right) \\tag{7.30}\n\\]\n\nSubsequently, we multiply both sides of Eq. 7.30 by a differential time \\(d t\\). This step converts the left-hand side of the equation into a differential change in the current. Thus:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d i}{d t} d t = \\frac{-R}{L} \\left(i - \\frac{V_s}{R}\\right) d t \\tag{7.31}\n\\]\n\nor\n\n\\[\nd i = \\frac{-R}{L} \\left(i - \\frac{V_s}{R}\\right) d t\n\\]\n\nWe now isolate the variables in Eq. 7.31 to obtain:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d i}{i - \\left(V_s / R\\right)} = \\frac{-R}{L} d t \\tag{7.32}\n\\]\n\nand then integrate both sides of Eq. 7.32. Utilizing \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) as variables for the integration, we derive:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{I_0}^{i(t)} \\frac{d x}{x - \\left(V_s / R\\right)} = \\frac{-R}{L} \\int_{0}^{t} d y \\tag{7.33}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(I_0\\) is the current at \\(t = 0\\) and \\(i(t)\\) is the current at any \\(t > 0\\). Carrying out the integration required by Eq. 7.33 yields the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\ln \\frac{i(t) - \\left(V_s / R\\right)}{I_0 - \\left(V_s / R\\right)} = \\frac{-R}{L} t \\tag{7.34}\n\\]\n\nfrom which\n\n\\[\n\\frac{i(t) - \\left(V_s / R\\right)}{I_0 - \\left(V_s / R\\right)} = e^{-(R / L) t}\n\\]\n\nor\n\n\\[\ni(t) = \\frac{V_s}{R} + \\left(I_0 - \\frac{V_s}{R}\\right) e^{-(R / L) t} \\tag{7.35}\n\\]\n\n**Step Response of RL Circuit**\n\nWhen the initial energy in the inductor is null, \\(I_0\\) is zero. Consequently, Eq. 7.35 simplifies to:\n\n\\[\ni(t) = \\frac{V_s}{R} - \\frac{V_s}{R} e^{-(R / L) t} \\tag{7.36}\n\\]\n\nEq. 7.36 indicates that after the switch has been activated, the current escalates exponentially from zero to a final value of \\(V_s / R\\). The circuit's time constant, \\(L / R\\), dictates the rate of escalation. After one time constant, the current will have achieved roughly 63% of its ultimate value, or\n\n\\[\ni(\\tau) = \\frac{V_s}{R} - \\frac{V_s}{R} e^{-1} \\approx 0.6321 \\frac{V_s}{R} \\tag{7.37}\n\\]\n\nIf the current were to persist in increasing at its initial rate, it would attain its final value at \\(t = \\tau\\); that is, because\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d i}{d t} = \\frac{-V_s}{R} \\left(\\frac{-1}{\\tau}\\right) e^{-t / \\tau} = \\frac{V_s}{L} e^{-t / \\tau} \\tag{7.38}\n\\]\n\nthe initial rate at which \\(i(t)\\) increases is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d i}{d t}(0) = \\frac{V_s}{L} \\tag{7.39}\n\\]\n\nIf the current were to continue to increase at this rate, the expression for \\(i\\) would be\n\n\\[\ni = \\frac{V_s}{L} t \\tag{7.40}\n\\]\n\nfrom which, at \\(t = \\tau\\),\n\n\\[\ni = \\frac{V_s}{L} \\frac{L}{R} = \\frac{V_s}{R} \\tag{7.41}\n\\]\n\nEqs. 7.36 and 7.40 are depicted in Fig. 7.17. The values given by Eqs. 7.37 and 7.41 are also exhibited in this figure.\n\nThe voltage across an inductor is \\(L \\frac{d i}{d t}\\), so from Eq. 7.35, for \\(t \\geq 0^+\\),\n\n\\[\nv = L \\left(\\frac{-R}{L}\\right) \\left(I_0 - \\frac{V_s}{R}\\right) e^{-(R / L) t} = \\left(V_s - I_0 R\\right) e^{-(R / L) t} \\tag{7.42}\n\\]\n\nThe voltage across the inductor is null before the switch is activated. Eq. 7.42 indicates that the inductor voltage surges to \\(V_s - I_0 R\\) at the instant the switch is activated and then decays exponentially to zero.\n\nThe value of \\(v\\) at \\(t = 0^+\\) makes logical sense. Since the initial current is \\(I_0\\) and the inductor impedes an instantaneous change in current, the current remains \\(I_0\\) in the instant following the switch's activation. The voltage drop across the resistor is \\(I_0 R\\), and the voltage impressed across the inductor is the source voltage minus this drop, i.e., \\(V_s - I_0 R\\).\n\nWhen the initial inductor current is zero, Eq. 7.42 simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nv = V_s e^{-(R / L) t} \\tag{7.43}\n\\]\n\nIf the initial current is zero, the voltage across the inductor spikes to \\(V_s\\). Furthermore, the inductor voltage is anticipated to approach zero as \\(t\\) increases, since the current in the circuit is approaching the constant value of \\(V_s / R\\). Fig. 7.18 displays the plot of Eq. 7.43 and the relationship between the time constant and the initial rate at which the inductor voltage is diminishing.\n\nIf an initial current is present in the inductor, Eq. 7.35 provides the solution for it. The algebraic sign of \\(I_0\\) is positive if the initial current aligns with the direction of \\(i\\); otherwise, \\(I_0\\) assumes a negative sign. Example 7.5 exemplifies the application of Eq. 7.35 to a specific circuit.\n\n**Example 7.5: Determining the Step Response of an RL Circuit**\n\nThe switch in the circuit depicted in Fig. 7.19 has been in position \\(a\\) for an extended duration. At \\(t = 0\\), the switch shifts from position \\(a\\) to position \\(b\\).

Consequently, the inductor sustains an initial current of 8 A. This current is oriented opposite to the reference direction for \\(i\\); hence \\(I_0\\) is -8 A. When the switch is in position \\(b\\), the final value of \\(i\\) will be \\(24 / 2\\), or 12 A. The circuit's time constant is \\(200 / 2\\), or 100 ms. Substituting these values into Eq. 7.35 yields:\n\n\\[\ni = 12 + (-8 - 12) e^{-t / 0.1} = 12 - 20 e^{-10 t} \\text{ A}, \\quad t \\geq 0\n\\]\n\nb) The voltage across the inductor is:\n\n\\[\nv = L \\frac{d i}{d t} = 0.2 \\left(200 e^{-10 t}\\right) = 40 e^{-10 t} \\text{ V}, \\quad t \\geq 0^+\n\\]\n\nThe initial inductor voltage is:\n\n\\[\nv(0^+) = 40 \\text{ V}\n\\]\n\nc) Yes; in the instant after the switch transitions to position \\(b\\), the inductor sustains a current of 8 A counterclockwise around the newly formed closed path. This current induces a 16 V drop across the \\(2 \\Omega\\) resistor. This voltage drop adds to the drop across the source, resulting in a 40 V drop across the inductor.\n\nd) We determine the time at which the inductor voltage equals 24 V by solving the expression:\n\n\\[\n24 = 40 e^{-10 t}\n\\]\n\nfor \\(t\\):\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{1}{10} \\ln \\frac{40}{24} = 51.08 \\times 10^{-3} = 51.08 \\text{ ms}\n\\]\n\ne) Fig. 7.20 portrays the graphs of \\(i(t)\\) and \\(v(t)\\) versus \\(t\\).

We commence by noting that the voltage across the resistor is the discrepancy between the source voltage and the inductor voltage. We write:\n\n\\[\ni(t) = \\frac{V_s}{R} - \\frac{v(t)}{R} \\tag{7.44}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(V_s\\) is a constant. Differentiating both sides with respect to time yields:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d i}{d t} = -\\frac{1}{R} \\frac{d v}{d t} \\tag{7.45}\n\\]\n\nThen, if we multiply each side of Eq. 7.45 by the inductance \\(L\\), we obtain an expression for the voltage across the inductor on the left-hand side, or:\n\n\\[\nv = -\\frac{L}{R} \\frac{d v}{d t} \\tag{7.46}\n\\]\n\nRearranging Eq. 7.46 into standard form yields:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d v}{d t} + \\frac{R}{L} v = 0 \\tag{7.47}\n\\]\n\nYou should verify (in Problem 7.38) that the solution to Eq. 7.47 is identical to that given in Eq. 7.42.\n\nAt this juncture, a general observation regarding the step response of an \\(RL\\) circuit is pertinent. (This observation will prove beneficial later.) When we derived the differential equation for the inductor current, we obtained Eq. 7.29. We now rewrite Eq. 7.29 as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d i}{d t} + \\frac{R}{L} i = \\frac{V_s}{L} \\tag{7.48}\n\\]\n\nObserve that Eqs. 7.47 and 7.48 exhibit the same form. Specifically, each equates the sum of the first derivative of the variable and a constant times the variable to a constant value. In Eq. 7.47, the constant on the right-hand side happens to be zero; hence this equation assumes the same form as the natural response equations in Section 7.1. In both Eq. 7.47 and Eq. 7.48, the constant multiplying the dependent variable is the reciprocal of the time constant, i.e., \\(R / L = 1 / \\tau\\). We encounter a similar scenario in the derivations for the step response of an \\(RC\\) circuit. In Section 7.4, we will utilize these observations to develop a general approach to finding the natural and step responses of \\(RL\\) and \\(RC\\) circuits.\n\n**The Step Response of an RC Circuit**\n\nWe can determine the step response of a first-order \\(RC\\) circuit by analyzing the circuit depicted in Fig. 7.21. For mathematical convenience, we opt for the Norton equivalent of the network connected to the equivalent capacitor. Summing the currents departing from the top node in Fig. 7.21 generates the differential equation:\n\n\\[\nC \\frac{d v_C}{d t} + \\frac{v_C}{R} = I_s \\tag{7.49}\n\\]\n\nDividing Eq. 7.49 by \\(C\\) yields:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d v_C}{d t} + \\frac{v_C}{R C} = \\frac{I_s}{C} \\tag{7.50}\n\\]\n\nComparing Eq. 7.50 with Eq. 7.48 reveals that the form of the solution for \\(v_C\\) is analogous to that for the current in the inductive circuit, specifically, Eq. 7.35. Therefore, by simply substituting the pertinent variables and coefficients, we can directly write the solution for \\(v_C\\).

    "text": "We are prepared to explore the challenge of determining the currents and voltages produced in first-order RL and RC circuits upon the abrupt application of either direct current (dc) voltage or current sources. This circuit reaction to the sudden onset of a constant voltage or current source is known as the step response. In demonstrating the step response, we exhibit how the circuit reacts when energy is accumulating in either the inductor or capacitor. We initiate with the step response of an RL circuit.\n\nThe Step Response of an RL Circuit\n\nInitially, we adjust the first-order circuit depicted in Fig. 7.2(a) by incorporating a switch. We employ this modified circuit, as shown in Fig. 7.16, to develop the step response of an RL circuit. The energy stored in the inductor at the moment the switch is activated is quantified by a non-zero initial current, \\(i(0)\\). Our objective is to determine the expressions for the current flowing through the circuit and the voltage across the inductor following the closure of the switch. The method employed is consistent with that outlined in Section 7.1; we utilize circuit analysis to derive the differential equation that characterizes the circuit in terms of the variable of interest, subsequently applying fundamental calculus to solve the equation.\n\nPost the activation of the switch in Fig. 7.16, Kirchhoff's voltage law necessitates that\n\n$$\nV_{s} = R i + L \\frac{d i}{d t} \\tag{7.29}\n$$\n\nThis equation can be resolved for the current by isolating the variables \\(i\\) and \\(t\\) and subsequently integrating. The initial step in this method involves solving Eq. 7.29 for the derivative \\(\\frac{d i}{d t}\\) :\n\n$$\n\\frac{d i}{d t} = \\frac{-R i + V_{s}}{L} = \\frac{-R}{L} \\left(i - \\frac{V_{s}}{R}\\right) \\tag{7.30}\n$$\n\nSubsequently, we multiply both sides of Eq. 7.30 by a differential time \\(d t\\). This action simplifies the left-hand side of the equation to a differential change in the current. Hence,\n\n$$\n\\frac{d i}{d t} d t = \\frac{-R}{L} \\left(i - \\frac{V_{s}}{R}\\right) d t \\tag{7.31}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nd i = \\frac{-R}{L} \\left(i - \\frac{V_{s}}{R}\\right) d t\n$$\n\nWe then segregate the variables in Eq. 7.31 to derive\n\n$$\n\\frac{d i}{i - \\left(V_{s} / R\\right)} = \\frac{-R}{L} d t \\tag{7.32}\n$$\n\nand proceed to integrate both sides of Eq. 7.32. Using \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) as variables for the integration, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\int_{I_{0}}^{i(t)} \\frac{d x}{x - \\left(V_{s} / R\\right)} = \\frac{-R}{L} \\int_{0}^{t} d y \\tag{7.33}\n$$\n\nHere, \\(I_{0}\\) represents the current at \\(t = 0\\) and \\(i(t)\\) denotes the current at any \\(t > 0\\). Carrying out the integration required by Eq. 7.33 yields the expression\n\n$$\n\\ln \\frac{i(t) - \\left(V_{s} / R\\right)}{I_{0} - \\left(V_{s} / R\\right)} = \\frac{-R}{L} t \\tag{7.34}\n$$\n\nfrom which\n\n$$\n\\frac{i(t) - \\left(V_{s} / R\\right)}{I_{0} - \\left(V_{s} / R\\right)} = e^{-(R / L) t}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\ni(t) = \\frac{V_{s}}{R} + \\left(I_{0} - \\frac{V_{s}}{R}\\right) e^{-(R / L) t} \\tag{7.35}\n$$\n\nStep Response of RL Circuit\n\nIn the scenario where the initial energy in the inductor is nil, \\(I_{0}\\) is zero. Consequently, Eq. 7.35 simplifies to\n\n$$\ni(t) = \\frac{V_{s}}{R} - \\frac{V_{s}}{R} e^{-(R / L) t} \\tag{7.36}\n$$\n\nEq. 7.36 suggests that following the closure of the switch, the current escalates exponentially from zero to a terminal value of \\(V_{s} / R\\). The circuit's time constant, \\(L / R\\), dictates the rate of this escalation. After one time constant has elapsed since the switch was closed, the current will have achieved roughly 63% of its terminal value, or\n\n$$\ni(\\tau) = \\frac{V_{s}}{R} - \\frac{V_{s}}{R} e^{-1} \\approx 0.6321 \\frac{V_{s}}{R} \\tag{7.37}\n$$\n\nShould the current persist in increasing at its initial rate, it would attain its terminal value at \\(t = \\tau\\); that is, because\n\n$$\n\\frac{d i}{d t} = \\frac{-V_{s}}{R} \\left(\\frac{-1}{\\tau}\\right) e^{-t / \\tau} = \\frac{V_{s}}{L} e^{-t / \\tau} \\tag{7.38}\n$$\n\nthe initial rate at which \\(i(t)\\) ascends is\n\n$$\n\\frac{d i}{d t}(0) = \\frac{V_{s}}{L} \\tag{7.39}\n$$\n\nIf the current were to sustain this rate of increase, the expression for \\(i\\) would be\n\n$$\ni = \\frac{V_{s}}{L} t \\tag{7.40}\n$$\n\nfrom which, at \\(t = \\tau\\),\n\n$$\ni = \\frac{V_{s}}{L} \\frac{L}{R} = \\frac{V_{s}}{R} \\tag{7.41}\n$$\n\nEqs. 7.36 and 7.40 are represented graphically in Fig. 7.17. The values yielded by Eqs. 7.37 and 7.41 are also depicted in this figure.\n\nThe voltage across an inductor is \\(L \\frac{d i}{d t}\\), thus from Eq. 7.35, for \\(t \\geq 0^{+}\\),\n\n$$\nv = L \\left(\\frac{-R}{L}\\right) \\left(I_{0} - \\frac{V_{s}}{R}\\right) e^{-(R / L) t} = \\left(V_{s} - I_{0} R\\right) e^{-(R / L) t} \\tag{7.42}\n$$\n\nThe voltage across the inductor is null prior to the switch being closed. Eq. 7.42 indicates that the inductor voltage surges to \\(V_{s} - I_{0} R\\) at the instant the switch is closed and then decays exponentially to zero.\n\nDoes the value of \\(v\\) at \\(t = 0^{+}\\) hold logical consistency? Given that the initial current is \\(I_{0}\\) and the inductor precludes an instantaneous change in current, the current remains \\(I_{0}\\) in the instant after the switch has been closed. The voltage drop across the resistor is \\(I_{0} R\\), and the voltage imposed across the inductor is the source voltage minus this voltage drop, i.e., \\(V_{s} - I_{0} R\\).\n\nWhen the initial inductor current is zero, Eq. 7.42 simplifies to\n\n$$\nv = V_{s} e^{-(R / L) t} \\tag{7.43}\n$$\n\nIf the initial current is zero, the voltage across the inductor spikes to \\(V_{s}\\). It is also anticipated that the inductor voltage will diminish towards zero as \\(t\\) increases, since the current in the circuit is approaching the constant value of \\(V_{s} / R\\). Fig. 7.18 illustrates the plot of Eq. 7.43 and the correlation between the time constant and the initial rate at which the inductor voltage is diminishing.\n\nIf an initial current exists in the inductor, Eq. 7.35 provides the solution for it. The algebraic sign of \\(I_{0}\\) is positive if the initial current aligns with the direction of \\(i\\); otherwise, \\(I_{0}\\) assumes a negative sign. Example 7.5 exemplifies the application of Eq. 7.35 to a specific circuit.\n\n#### Example 7.5 Determining the Step Response of an RL Circuit\n\nThe switch in the circuit depicted in Fig. 7.19 has remained in position 'a' for an extended duration. At \\(t = 0\\), the switch transitions from position 'a' to 'b'. The switch is of the make-before-break type; thus, the connection at position 'b' is established prior to the disconnection at position 'a', ensuring uninterrupted current flow through the inductor.\n\na) Derive the expression for \\(i(t)\\) for \\(t \\geq 0\\).\nb) Determine the initial voltage across the inductor immediately following the switch's relocation to position 'b'.\nc) Calculate how many milliseconds elapse after the switch is moved before the inductor voltage attains 24 V.\nd) Assess whether this initial voltage is consistent with the circuit's behavior.\ne) Plot both \\(i(t)\\) and \\(v(t)\\) against \\(t\\).\n\n#### Solution\n\na) With the switch situated at 'a' for a prolonged period, the 200 mH inductor behaves as a short circuit across the 8 A current source. Consequently, the inductor sustains an initial current of 8 A. This current is directed counter to the reference direction for \\(i\\); hence, \\(I_{0}\\) is -8 A. When the switch is at 'b', the terminal value of \\(i\\) will be \\(24 / 2\\), or 12 A. The circuit's time constant is \\(200 / 2\\), or 100 ms. Substituting these values into Eq. 7.35 yields\n\n$$\ni = 12 + (-8 - 12) e^{-t / 0.1} = 12 - 20 e^{-10 t} \\text{ A}, \\quad t \\geq 0\n$$\n\nb) The voltage across the inductor is\n\n$$\nv = L \\frac{d i}{d t} = 0.2 (200 e^{-10 t}) = 40 e^{-10 t} \\text{ V}, \\quad t \\geq 0^{+}\n$$\n\nThe initial inductor voltage is\n\n$$\nv(0^{+}) = 40 \\text{ V}\n$$\n\nc) The calculation for the time at which the inductor voltage reaches 24 V involves solving the expression\n\n$$\n24 = 40 e^{-10 t}\n$$\n\nfor \\(t\\):\n\n$$\nt = \\frac{1}{10} \\ln \\frac{40}{24} = 51.08 \\times 10^{-3} = 51.08 \\text{ ms}\n$$\n\nd) Yes; in the instant after the switch has been moved to position 'b', the inductor sustains a current of 8 A circulating counterclockwise around the newly formed closed path. This current induces a 16 V drop across the \\(2 \\Omega\\) resistor. This voltage drop, in conjunction with the source voltage, results in a 40 V drop across the inductor.\ne) Fig. 7.20 portrays the graphs of \\(i(t)\\) and \\(v(t)\\) versus \\(t\\). Note that the instant when the current equals zero corresponds to the instant when the inductor voltage equals the source voltage of 24 V, in accordance with Kirchhoff's voltage law.\n\n#### Assessment Problem\n\nObjective 2 - Be proficient in determining the step response of both RL and RC circuits.\n\n7.5 Suppose the switch in the circuit depicted in Fig. 7.19 has been in position 'b' for an extended duration, and at \\(t = 0\\) it shifts to position 'a'. Determine\na) \\(i(0^{+})\\);\nb) \\(v(0^{+})\\);\nc) \\(\\tau, t > 0\\);\nd) \\(i(t), t \\geq 0\\);\nand e) \\(v(t), t \\geq 0^{+}\\).\n\nAnswer: a) 12 A;\nb) -200 V;\nc) 20 ms;\nd) \\(-8 + 20 e^{-50 t}\\text{ A}, t \\geq 0\\);\ne) \\(-200 e^{-50 t}\\text{ V}, t \\geq 0^{+}\\).\n\n#### The Step Response of an RC Circuit\n\nWe can ascertain the step response of a first-order RC circuit by examining the circuit shown in Fig. 7.21. For mathematical expedience, we opt for the Norton equivalent of the network connected to the equivalent capacitor. Summing the currents exiting the top node in Fig. 7.21 yields the differential equation\n\n$$\nC \\frac{d v_{C}}{d t} + \\frac{v_{C}}{R} = I_{s} \\tag{7.49}\n$$\n\nDividing Eq. 7.49 by \\(C\\) results in\n\n$$\n\\frac{d v_{C}}{d t} + \\frac{v_{C}}{R C} = \\frac{I_{s}}{C} \\tag{7.50}\n$$\n\nA comparison of Eq. 7.50 with Eq. 7.48 reveals that the solution form for \\(v_{C}\\) mirrors that for the current in the inductive circuit, specifically, Eq. 7.35. Thus, by simply substituting the pertinent variables and coefficients, we can directly formulate the solution for \\(v_{C}\\). The substitution necessitates replacing \\(I_{s}\\) with \\(V_{s}\\), \\(C\\) with \\(L\\), \\(1 / R\\) with \\(R\\), and \\(V_{0}\\) with \\(I_{0}\\). This yields\n\n$$\nv_{C} = I_{s} R + \\left(V_{0} - I_{s} R\\right) e^{-t / R C}, \\quad t \\geq 0 \\tag{7.51}\n$$\n\nA parallel derivation for the current in the capacitor yields the differential equation\n\n$$\n\\frac{d i}{d t} + \\frac{1}{R C} i = 0 \\tag{7.52}\n$$\n\nEq. 7.52 shares the same form as Eq. 7.47, hence the solution for \\(i\\) is derived using the same substitutions applied to the solution of Eq. 7.50. Thus\n\n$$\ni = \\left(I_{s} - \\frac{V_{0}}{R}\\right) e^{-t / R C}, \\quad t \\geq 0^{+} \\tag{7.53}\n$$\n\nwhere \\(V_{0}\\) is the initial value of \\(v_{C}\\), the voltage across the capacitor.\n\nWe derived Eqs. 7.51 and 7.53 by drawing a mathematical parallel to the solution for the step response of the inductive circuit. Let us now assess whether these solutions for the RC circuit align with our understanding of circuit behavior. From Eq. 7.51, observe that the initial voltage across the capacitor is \\(V_{0}\\), the terminal voltage across the capacitor is \\(I_{s} R\\), and the circuit's time constant is \\(R C\\). Additionally, note that the solution for \\(v_{C}\\) is valid for \\(t \\geq 0\\). These observations correspond with the behavior of a capacitor in parallel with a resistor when driven by a constant current source.\n\nEq. 7.53 predicts that the current in the capacitor at \\(t = 0^{+}\\) is \\(I_{s} - V_{0} / R\\). This prediction is logical because the capacitor voltage cannot alter instantaneously, and thus the initial current in the resistor is \\(V_{0} / R\\). The capacitor branch current undergoes an instantaneous shift from zero at \\(t = 0^{-}\\) to \\(I_{s} - V_{0} / R\\) at \\(t = 0^{+}\\). The capacitor current diminishes to zero at \\(t = \\infty\\). Also note that the terminal voltage value is \\(v = I_{s} R\\).\n\nExample 7.6 exemplifies the application of Eqs. 7.51 and 7.53 to determine the step response of a first-order RC circuit.\n\n#### Example 7.6 Determining the Step Response of an RC Circuit\n\nThe switch in the circuit depicted in Fig. 7.22 has been in position 1 for an extended duration. At \\(t = 0\\), the switch shifts to position 2. Determine\na) \\(v_{o}(t)\\) for \\(t \\geq 0\\)\nand\nb) \\(i_{o}(t)\\) for \\(t \\geq 0^{+}\\).\n\n#### Solution\n\na) With the switch in position 1 for a prolonged period, the initial value of \\(v_{o}\\) is \\(40(60 / 80)\\), or 30 V. To leverage Eqs. 7.51 and 7.53, we determine the Norton equivalent with respect to the terminals of the capacitor for \\(t \\geq 0\\). We commence by calculating the open-circuit voltage, which is given by the -75 V source divided across the \\(40 \\text{k}\\Omega\\) and \\(160 \\text{k}\\Omega\\) resistors:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text{oc}} = \\frac{160 \\times 10^{3}}{(40 + 160) \\times 10^{3}}(-75) = -60 \\text{ V}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the Thévenin resistance, as observed to the right of the capacitor, by short-circuiting the -75 V source and making series and parallel combinations of the resistors:\n\n$$\nR_{\\text{Th}} = 8000 + 40,000 || 160,000 = 40 \\text{k}\\Omega\n$$\n\nThe value of the Norton current source is the ratio of the open-circuit voltage to the Thévenin resistance, i.e., \\(-60 / (40 \\times 10^{3}) = -1.5 \\text{ mA}\\).

    "text": "To determine the natural or step responses of the first-order \\( RL \\) and \\( RC \\) circuits depicted in Fig. 7.24, we rely on the similarity of their differential equations (compare Eq. 7.48 and Eq. 7.50). For a comprehensive solution to the four possible circuits, we denote the unknown quantity as \\( x(t) \\), which can take on four different values, representing either the current or voltage at the terminals of an inductor or a capacitor. From Eqs. 7.47, 7.48, 7.50, and 7.52, it is evident that the differential equation for any of the four circuits in Fig. 7.24 follows the form\n\n$$\n\\frac{d x}{d t} + \\frac{x}{\\tau} = K \\tag{7.54}\n$$\n\nwhere \\( K \\) is a constant that can be zero. Since the circuit sources are constant voltages and/or currents, \\( x \\) will stabilize to a constant value; this means that the final value must adhere to Eq. 7.54, and when \\( x \\) reaches this final value, the derivative \\( \\frac{d x}{d t} \\) must be zero. Thus,\n\n$$\nx_f = K \\tau \\tag{7.55}\n$$\n\nwhere \\( x_f \\) denotes the final value of the variable. We solve Eq. 7.54 by separating the variables, starting with solving for the first derivative:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d x}{d t} = \\frac{-x}{\\tau} + K = \\frac{-(x - K \\tau)}{\\tau} = \\frac{-(x - x_f)}{\\tau} \\tag{7.56}\n$$\n\nFor part (b), specify the time interval during which the expression derived in part (a) holds true.\n\nAnswer:\n(a) \\( -60 + 72 e^{-100 t} \\text{ V} \\);\n(b) \\( t \\geq 0^+ \\).\n\nGeneral solution for natural and step responses of \\( RL \\) and \\( RC \\) circuits —\n\nCalculating the natural or step response of \\( RL \\) or \\( RC \\) circuits\n\nIn deriving Eq. 7.56, we utilized Eq. 7.55 to substitute \\( x_f \\) for \\( K \\tau \\). We now multiply both sides of Eq. 7.56 by \\( d t \\) and divide by \\( x - x_f \\) to get\n\n$$\n\\frac{d x}{x - x_f} = \\frac{-1}{\\tau} d t \\tag{7.57}\n$$\n\nNext, we integrate Eq. 7.57. To obtain the most general solution, we set \\( t_0 \\) as the lower limit and \\( t \\) as the upper limit for the integration. The time \\( t_0 \\) corresponds to the moment of switching or any other change. Although we previously set \\( t_0 = 0 \\), this modification allows for the switching to occur at any time. Using \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) as symbols for integration, we have\n\n$$\n\\int_{x(t_0)}^{x(t)} \\frac{d u}{u - x_f} = -\\frac{1}{\\tau} \\int_{t_0}^{t} d v \\tag{7.58}\n$$\n\nPerforming the integration required by Eq. 7.58 yields\n\n$$\nx(t) = x_f + [x(t_0) - x_f] e^{-(t - t_0) / \\tau} \\tag{7.59}\n$$\n\nThe significance of Eq. 7.59 is clear when expressed in words:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{lr}\n\\text{the unknown} & \\text{the final} \\\\\n\\text{variable as a} & = \\text{value of the} \\\\\n\\text{function of time} & \\text{variable} \\\\\n+ \\left[\\begin{array}{rr}\n\\text{the initial} & \\text{the final} \\\\\n\\text{value of the} & - \\text{value of the} \\\\\n\\text{variable} & \\text{variable}\n\\end{array}\\right] \\times e^{-[t - \\text{(time of switching)}] / \\text{(time constant)}} \\tag{7.60}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nIn many instances, the switching time, i.e., \\( t_0 \\), is zero. When calculating the step and natural responses of circuits, it may be beneficial to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the variable of interest for the circuit. For \\( RC \\) circuits, it is most practical to select the capacitive voltage; for \\( RL \\) circuits, the inductive current is the best choice.\n2. Determine the initial value of the variable, which is its value at \\( t_0 \\). Note that if you opt for capacitive voltage or inductive current as the variable of interest, it is unnecessary to differentiate between \\( t = t_0^- \\) and \\( t = t_0^+ \\). This is because both are continuous variables. If you choose another variable, you must remember that its initial value is defined at \\( t = t_0^+ \\).\n3. Calculate the final value of the variable, which is its value as \\( t \\rightarrow \\infty \\).\n4. Calculate the time constant for the circuit.\n\nWith these quantities, you can employ Eq. 7.60 to formulate an equation depicting the variable of interest as a function of time. You can then derive equations for other circuit variables using the circuit analysis techniques introduced in Chapters 3 and 4 or by repeating the aforementioned steps for those variables.\n\nExamples 7.7-7.9 demonstrate how to apply Eq. 7.60 to find the step response of an \\( RC \\) or \\( RL \\) circuit.\n\n[^1]\n#### Example 7.7 Using the General Solution Method to Find an RC Circuit's Step Response\n\nThe switch in the circuit depicted in Fig. 7.25 has been in position a for an extended period. At \\( t = 0 \\), the switch is shifted to position b.\na) What is the initial value of \\( v_C \\)?\nb) What is the final value of \\( v_C \\)?\nc) What is the time constant of the circuit when the switch is in position b?\nd) What is the expression for \\( v_C(t) \\) when \\( t \\geq 0 \\)?\ne) What is the expression for \\( i(t) \\) when \\( t \\geq 0^+ \\)?\nf) How long after the switch is in position b does the capacitor voltage reach zero?\ng) Plot \\( v_C(t) \\) and \\( i(t) \\) versus \\( t \\).\n\n#### Solution\n\na) The switch has been in position a for a long time, causing the capacitor to behave as an open circuit. Consequently, the voltage across the capacitor equals the voltage across the \\( 60 \\Omega \\) resistor. Using the voltage divider rule, the voltage across the \\( 60 \\Omega \\) resistor is \\( 40 \\times \\frac{60}{60+20} \\), or 30 V. Since the reference for \\( v_C \\) is positive at the capacitor's upper terminal, we have \\( v_C(0) = -30 \\text{ V} \\).\nb) After the switch has been in position b for a long time, the capacitor will act as an open circuit with respect to the 90 V source. Thus, the final capacitor voltage is +90 V.\nc) The time constant is\n\n$$\n\\tau = RC = (400 \\times 10^3)(0.5 \\times 10^{-6}) = 0.2 \\text{ s}\n$$\n\nd) Substituting the appropriate values for \\( v_f \\), \\( v(0) \\), and \\( t \\) into Eq. 7.60 gives\n\n$$\nv_C(t) = 90 + (-30 - 90) e^{-5 t} = 90 - 120 e^{-5 t} \\text{ V}, \\quad t \\geq 0\n$$\n\ne) The value for \\( \\tau \\) remains unchanged. Therefore, we only need to determine the initial and final values for the current in the capacitor. When finding the initial value, we must find \\( i(0^+) \\) because the current in the capacitor can change instantaneously. This current is equal to the current in the resistor, which, according to Ohm's law, is \\( \\frac{90 - (-30)}{400 \\times 10^3} = 300 \\mu \\text{ A} \\). Note that when applying Ohm's law, we recognized that the capacitor voltage cannot change instantaneously.

    "text": "The methodology for determining the natural or step response of first-order RL and RC circuits, as depicted in Fig. 7.24, hinges on the similarity of their differential equations (compare Eq. 7.48 and Eq. 7.50). For a comprehensive solution applicable to all four configurations, we denote the unknown quantity as \\( x(t) \\), which can assume one of four values, signifying either the current or voltage across an inductor or a capacitor. Deriving from Eqs. 7.47, 7.48, 7.50, and 7.52, the differential equation that governs any of the circuits in Fig. 7.24 is structured as\n\n$$\n\\frac{d x}{d t} + \\frac{x}{\\tau} = K \\tag{7.54}\n$$\n\nwhere the constant \\( K \\) can be zero. Given that the circuit elements are subjected to constant voltages and/or currents, \\( x \\) will stabilize at a constant value; this final value must adhere to Eq. 7.54, and when \\( x \\) reaches this constant, its derivative \\( \\frac{d x}{d t} \\) must be zero. Thus,\n\n$$\nx_f = K \\tau \\tag{7.55}\n$$\n\nwhere \\( x_f \\) denotes the final value of the variable. We resolve Eq. 7.54 by isolating variables, commencing with resolving the first derivative:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d x}{d t} = \\frac{-x}{\\tau} + K = \\frac{-(x - K \\tau)}{\\tau} = \\frac{-(x - x_f)}{\\tau} \\tag{7.56}\n$$\n\n(b) Define the time span for which the derived expression from (a) holds true.\n\nResponse:\n(a) \\( -60 + 72 e^{-100 t} \\text{ V} \\);\n(b) \\( t \\geq 0^+ \\).\n\nGeneral solution for the natural and step responses of RL and RC circuits—\n\nDeriving the natural or step response of RL or RC circuits\n\nIn formulating Eq. 7.56, we substituted \\( x_f \\) for \\( K \\tau \\) using Eq. 7.55. We proceed by multiplying both sides of Eq. 7.56 by \\( d t \\) and dividing by \\( x - x_f \\) to derive\n\n$$\n\\frac{d x}{x - x_f} = \\frac{-1}{\\tau} d t \\tag{7.57}\n$$\n\nSubsequently, we integrate Eq. 7.57. To acquire the most general solution, we set \\( t_0 \\) as the lower limit and \\( t \\) as the upper limit for integration. The time \\( t_0 \\) marks the moment of switching or any alteration. Although we initially assumed \\( t_0 = 0 \\), this modification permits the switching to occur at any moment. Using \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) as symbols for integration, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\int_{x(t_0)}^{x(t)} \\frac{d u}{u - x_f} = -\\frac{1}{\\tau} \\int_{t_0}^{t} d v \\tag{7.58}\n$$\n\nThe integration required by Eq. 7.58 yields\n\n$$\nx(t) = x_f + [x(t_0) - x_f] e^{-(t - t_0) / \\tau} \\tag{7.59}\n$$\n\nThe significance of Eq. 7.59 is elucidated when expressed in words:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{lr}\n\\text{the unknown} & \\text{the final} \\\\\n\\text{variable as a} & = \\text{value of the} \\\\\n\\text{function of time} & \\text{variable} \\\\\n+ \\left[\\begin{array}{rr}\n\\text{the initial} & \\text{the final} \\\\\n\\text{value of the} & - \\text{value of the} \\\\\n\\text{variable} & \\text{variable}\n\\end{array}\\right] \\times e^{-[t - \\text{(time of switching)}] / \\text{(time constant)}} \\tag{7.60}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nFrequently, the switching time—that is, \\( t_0 \\)—is zero. When calculating the step and natural responses of circuits, adhering to these steps may facilitate the process:\n\n1. Ascertain the variable of interest for the circuit. For RC circuits, the capacitive voltage is typically the most convenient choice; for RL circuits, the inductive current is preferable.\n2. Establish the initial value of the variable, which is its value at \\( t_0 \\). If the capacitive voltage or inductive current is selected, it is unnecessary to differentiate between \\( t = t_0^- \\) and \\( t = t_0^+ \\) since they both represent continuous variables. For other variables, it is essential to remember that their initial value is defined at \\( t = t_0^+ \\).\n3. Compute the final value of the variable, which is its value as \\( t \\rightarrow \\infty \\).\n4. Calculate the time constant of the circuit.\n\nArmed with these values, Eq. 7.60 can be employed to formulate an equation depicting the variable of interest as a function of time. Thereafter, equations for other circuit variables can be derived using circuit analysis techniques from Chapters 3 and 4 or by repeating the aforementioned steps for the additional variables.\n\nExamples 7.7-7.9 exemplify the application of Eq. 7.60 in determining the step response of an RC or RL circuit.\n\n[^1]\n#### Example 7.7 Utilizing the General Solution Method to Determine an RC Circuit's Step Response\n\nIn the circuit depicted in Fig. 7.25, the switch has been in position a indefinitely.

Consequently, the voltage across the capacitor is equivalent to the voltage across the \\( 60 \\Omega \\) resistor. Applying the voltage divider rule, the voltage across the \\( 60 \\Omega \\) resistor is \\( 40 \\times \\frac{60}{60 + 20} \\), or 30 V. As the reference for \\( v_C \\) is positive at the capacitor's upper terminal, we have \\( v_C(0) = -30 \\text{ V} \\).\nb) After the switch has been in position b for a considerable time, the capacitor will act as an open circuit relative to the 90 V source. Thus, the final capacitor voltage is +90 V.\nc) The time constant is calculated as\n\n$$\n\\tau = R C = (400 \\times 10^3)(0.5 \\times 10^{-6}) = 0.2 \\text{ s}\n$$\n\nd) By substituting the appropriate values for \\( v_f \\), \\( v(0) \\), and \\( t \\) into Eq. 7.60, we obtain\n\n$$\nv_C(t) = 90 + (-30 - 90) e^{-5 t} = 90 - 120 e^{-5 t} \\text{ V}, \\quad t \\geq 0\n$$\n\ne) Since the time constant \\( \\tau \\) remains unchanged, we only need to determine the initial and final values for the current through the capacitor. When calculating the initial value, we must find \\( i(0^+) \\), as the capacitor current can alter instantaneously. This current equals the current in the resistor, which, according to Ohm's law, is \\( \\frac{90 - (-30)}{400 \\times 10^3} = 300 \\mu \\text{ A} \\). Applying Ohm's law, we acknowledge that the capacitor voltage cannot change instantaneously. The final current value \\( i(t) = 0 \\), so\n\n$$\ni(t) = 0 + (300 - 0) e^{-5 t} = 300 e^{-5 t} \\mu \\text{ A}, \\quad t \\geq 0^+\n$$\n\nAn alternative approach to finding \\( i(t) \\) is to differentiate the solution in (d) and multiply by the capacitance. This method also预示了在 \\( t = 0 \\) 的不连续性.\nf) To determine how long the switch must remain in position b before the capacitor voltage reaches zero, we solve the equation derived in (d) for the time when \\( v_C(t) = 0 \\) :\n\n$$\n120 e^{-5 t} = 90 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad e^{5 t} = \\frac{120}{90}\n$$\n\ntherefore\n\n$$\nt = \\frac{1}{5} \\ln \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right) = 57.54 \\text{ ms}\n$$\n\nWhen \\( v_C = 0 \\), \\( i = 225 \\mu \\text{ A} \\) and the voltage drop across the \\( 400 \\text{ k} \\Omega \\) resistor is 90 V.\ng) Figure 7.26 illustrates the plots of \\( v_C(t) \\) and \\( i(t) \\) versus \\( t \\).\n\n#### Example 7.8 Applying the General Solution Method with Zero Initial Conditions\n\nIn the circuit depicted in Fig. 7.27, the switch has been open for a prolonged period, and the initial capacitor charge is zero.

Hence, \\( i_f = 0 \\).

With the switch closed, the time constant is \\( 80 / 1 \\), or 80 ms. Using Eq. 7.60, we express \\( v(t) \\) as\n\n$$\nv(t) = 0 + (15 - 0) e^{-t / 80 \\times 10^{-3}} = 15 e^{-12.5 t} \\text{ V}, \\quad t \\geq 0^+\n$$\n\nb) The initial value of the inductor current is 5 A.

When calculating the step and natural responses of circuits, it may be beneficial to adhere to these steps:\n\n1. Identify the variable of interest for the circuit. For \\(RC\\) circuits, it is most convenient to select the capacitive voltage; for \\(RL\\) circuits, it is preferable to choose the inductive current.\n2. Ascertain the initial value of the variable, which is its value at \\(t_0\\). Note that if you opt for capacitive voltage or inductive current as your variable of interest, it is unnecessary to differentiate between \\(t=t\n= t_0^{-}\\) and \\(t = t_0^{+}\\). This is because they both represent continuous variables. If you opt for another variable, you must remember that its initial value is defined at \\(t = t_0^{+}\\).\n3. Calculate the final value of the variable, which is its value as \\(t \\rightarrow \\infty\\).\n4. Calculate the time constant for the circuit.\n\nWith these quantities\nquantities, you can employ Eq. 7.60 to formulate an equation depicting the variable of interest as a function of time. You can then derive equations for other circuit variables using the circuit analysis techniques introduced in Chapters 3 and 4 or by repeating the preceding steps for the other variables.\n\nExamples 7.7-7.9 illustrate\ndemonstrate how to apply Eq. 7.60 to find the step response of an \\(RC\\) or \\(RL\\) circuit.\n\n[^1]\n#### Example 7.7 Utilizing the General Solution Method to Find an RC Circuit's Step Response\n\nThe switch in the circuit depicted in Fig. 7.25 has been in position a for an extended duration. At \\(t = 0\\), the switch is shifted to position b.\na) What is the initial value of \\(v_C\\)?\nb) What is the final value of \\(v_C\\)?\nc) What is the time constant of the circuit when the switch is in position b?\nd) What is the expression for \\(v_C(t)\\) when \\(t \\geq 0\\)?\ne) What is the expression for \\(i(t)\\) when \\(t \\geq 0^{+}\\)?\nf) How long after the switch is in position b does the capacitor voltage reach zero?\ng) Plot \\(v_C(t)\\) and \\(i(t)\\) versus \\(t\\).\n\n#### Solution\n\na) With the switch stationed\npositioned in a for a prolonged period, the capacitor behaves as an open circuit. Consequently, the voltage across the capacitor equals\nis equivalent to the voltage across the \\(60 \\Omega\\) resistor. Utilizing the voltage divider rule, the voltage across the \\(60 \\Omega\\) resistor is calculated40 \\times \\frac{60}{60+20}\\), which equals\namounts to 30 V. Since the reference for \\(v_C\\) is positive at the upper terminal of the capacitor, we have \\(v_C(0) = -30 \\mathrm{~V}\\).\nb) Following an extended period with the switch in position b, the capacitor will resemble an open circuit with respect to the 90 V source. Thus, the final value of the capacitor voltage is +90 V.\nc) The time constant is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\tau = R C = (400 \\times 10^{3})(0.5 \\times 10^{-6}) = 0.2 \\mathrm{~s}\n\\]\n\nd) By substituting the appropriate values for \\(v_f\\), \\(v(0)\\), and \\(t\\) into Eq. 7.60, we obtain:\n\n\\[\nv_C(t) = 90 + (-30 - 90) e^{-5 t} = 90 - 120 e^{-5 t} \\mathrm{~V}, \\quad t \\geq 0\n\\]\n\ne) The time constant remains unchanged here. Thus, we need only to determine the initial and final values for the current through the capacitor. When ascertaining the initial value, we must find \\(i(0^{+})\\), as the current in the capacitor can alter instantaneously. This current is equal to the current in the resistor, which, according to Ohm's law, is \\(\\frac{90 - (-30)}{400 \\times 10^{3}} = 300 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}\\). It is important to note that when applying Ohm's law, we recognize that the capacitor voltage cannot change instantaneously. The final value of \\(i(t)\\) is 0, so:\n\n\\[\ni(t) = 0 + (300 - 0) e^{-5 t} = 300 e^{-5 t} \\mu \\mathrm{~A}, \\quad t \\geq 0^{+}\n\\]\n\nThis solution could also have been derived by differentiating the solution in (d) and multiplying by the capacitance. You may wish to verify this for yourself. Note that this alternative approach to finding \\(i(t)\\) also accounts for the discontinuity at \\(t = 0\\).\nf) To determine how long the switch must remain in position b before the capacitor voltage becomes to zero, we solve the equation derived in (d) for the time when \\(v_C(t) = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n120 e^{-5 t} = 90 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad e^{5 t} = \\frac{120}{90}\n\\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{1}{5} \\ln \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right) = 57.54 \\mathrm{~ms}\n\\]\n\nIt is worth noting that when \\(v_C = 0\\), \\(i = 225 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}\\) and the voltage drop across the \\(400 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega\\) resistor is 90 V.\ng) Figure 7.26 presents the graphs of \\(v_C(t)\\) and \\(i(t)\\) versus \\(t\\).\n\nimage_name:Figure 7.26\ndescription:The graph in Figure 7.26 presents two waveforms: the capacitor voltage \\(v_C(t)\\) in volts and the current \\(i(t)\\) in microamperes, both plotted against time \\(t\\) in milliseconds.\n\n**Type of Graph and Function:**\nThis is a time-domain waveform graph depicting the exponential decay of current and the corresponding rise of voltage across a capacitor over time.\n\n**Axes Labels and Units:**\n- The horizontal axis represents time \\(t\\) in milliseconds (ms).\n- The left vertical axis represents the current \\(i\\) in microamperes (µA), ranging from -20 µA to 300 µA.\n- The right vertical axis represents the capacitor voltage \\(v_C\\) in volts (V), ranging from -30 V to 120 V.\n\n**Overall Behavior and Trends:**\n- The current \\(i(t)\\) starts at a high value around 225 µA and exponentially decays towards zero as time progresses.\n- The capacitor voltage \\(v_C(t)\\) starts at zero and increases exponentially, approaching a maximum value of 120 V.\n- Both waveforms exhibit typical exponential behavior, characteristic of charging and discharging in RC circuits.\n\n**Key Features and Technical Details:**\n- The current \\(i(t)\\) crosses the zero line at approximately 57.54 ms, which is consistent with the time calculated for the capacitor voltage to reach zero.\n- The voltage \\(v_C(t)\\) rises steadily and approaches its final value asymptotically, indicating the capacitor is charging over time.\n\n**Annotations and Specific Data Points:**\n- The graph includes reference lines for current and voltage, showing their respective scales.\n- The intersection of the current line with the zero line is a critical point, marking the time when the capacitor voltage becomes zero, which is approximately 57.54 ms.\n\nFigure 7.26 $\\triangle$ The current and voltage waveforms for Example 7.7."

To solve Eq. 7.54, we start by resolving the first derivative:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d x}{d t}=\\frac{-x}{\\tau}+K=\\frac{-(x-K \\tau)}{\\tau}=\\frac{-\\left(x-x_{f}\\right)}{\\tau} \\tag{7.56}\n$$\n\nFor part (b), specify the time interval for which the derived expression in part (a) holds true.\n\nThe answers are:\n(a) $-60+72 e^{-100 t} \\mathrm{~V}$;\n(b) $t \\geq 0^{+}$.\n\nThe general solution for the natural and step responses of $R L$ and $R C$ circuits involves the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the variable of interest for the circuit. For $R C$ circuits, choose the capacitive voltage; for $R L$ circuits, select the inductive current.\n2. Determine the initial value of the variable at $t_{0}$.\n3. Calculate the final value of the variable as $t \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n4. Compute the time constant for the circuit.\n\nUsing these values, Eq. 7.60 can be applied to formulate an equation describing the variable of interest as a function of time. Other circuit variables can then be found using techniques from Chapters 3 and 4 or by repeating the process for those variables.\n\nExamples 7.7-7.9 demonstrate the application of Eq. 7.60 to find the step response of an $R C$ or $R L$ circuit.\n\n[^1]\n#### Example 7.7 Finding an RC Circuit's Step Response Using the General Solution Method\n\nIn the circuit of Fig. 7.25, the switch has been in position a for an extended period. At $t=0$, the switch is shifted to position b.\na) What is the initial value of $v_{C}$ ?\nb) What is the final value of $v_{C}$ ?\nc) What is the time constant of the circuit when the switch is in position b?\nd) What is the expression for $v_{C}(t)$ when $t \\geq 0$ ?\ne) What is the expression for $i(t)$ when $t \\geq 0^{+}$?\nf) How long after the switch is in position b does the capacitor voltage equal zero?\ng) Plot $v_{C}(t)$ and $i(t)$ versus $t$.\n\n#### Solution\n\na) With the switch in position a for a long time, the capacitor behaves as an open circuit. Thus, the voltage across the capacitor equals the voltage across the $60 \\Omega$ resistor, which is $30 \\mathrm{~V}$ using the voltage divider rule. The reference for $v_{C}$ is positive at the capacitor's upper terminal, so $v_{C}(0)=-30 \\mathrm{~V}$.\nb) After the switch is in position b for a long time, the capacitor will have the voltage of the $90 \\mathrm{~V}$ source, hence $v_{C}(\\infty)=+90 \\mathrm{~V}$.\nc) The time constant is\n\n$$\n\\tau =R C =0.2 \\mathrm{~s}\n$$\n\nd) Substituting the appropriate values into Eq. 7.60 gives\n\n$$\nv_{C}(t)=90-120 e^{-5 t} \\mathrm{~V}, \\quad t \\geq 0\n$$\n\ne) The initial and final values for the current in the capacitor are required. The initial current is $300 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$, and the final value is $0$. Thus,\n\n$$\ni(t)=300 e^{-5 t} \\mu \\mathrm{~A}, \\quad t \\geq 0^{+}\n$$\n\nf) To find when the capacitor voltage is zero, solve\n\n$$\n120 e^{-5 t}=90\n$$\n\nwhich gives\n\n$$\nt=57.54 \\mathrm{~ms}\n$$\n\ng) Figure 7.26 illustrates the waveforms for $v_{C}(t)$ and $i(t)$ versus $t$.\n\n#### Example 7.8 Using the General Solution Method with Zero Initial Conditions\n\nIn the circuit of Fig. 7.27, the switch has been open for a long time, and the capacitor is initially uncharged. At $t=0$, the switch is closed. Find the expressions for\na) $i(t)$ for $t \\geq 0^{+}$and\nb) $v(t)$ when $t \\geq 0^{+}$.\n\n#### Solution\n\na) The initial current in the $30 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$ branch is $3 \\mathrm{~mA}$. The final value of the capacitor current is zero. The time constant is $5 \\mathrm{~ms}$. Therefore,\n\n$$\ni(t)=3 e^{-200 t} \\mathrm{~mA}, \\quad t \\geq 0^{+}\n$$\n\nb) The voltage $v(t)$ is the sum of the capacitor voltage and the voltage across the $30 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$ resistor. The capacitor voltage has an initial value of zero and a final value of $150 \\mathrm{~V}$. The time constant is $5 \\mathrm{~ms}$. Hence,\n\n$$\nv(t)=150-60 e^{-200 t} \\mathrm{V}, \\quad t \\geq 0^{+}\n$$\n\n#### Example 7.9 Using the General Solution Method to Find an RL Circuit's Step Response\n\nIn the circuit of Fig. 7.28, the switch has been open for a long time. At $t=0$, the switch is closed. Find the expressions for\na) $v(t)$ when $t \\geq 0^{+}$and\nb) $i(t)$ when $t \\geq 0$.\n\n#### Solution\n\na) The initial current in the inductor is $5 \\mathrm{~A}$. Immediately after the switch closes, the initial voltage across the inductor is $15 \\mathrm{~V}$. The final inductor voltage is $0 \\mathrm{~V}$. The time constant is $80 \\mathrm{~ms}$. Thus,\n\n$$\nv(t)=15 e^{-12.5 t} \\mathrm{~V}, \\quad t \\geq 0^{+}\n$$\n\nb) The initial inductor current is $5 \\mathrm{~A}$. The final inductor current is $20 \\mathrm{~A}$. The circuit time constant is $80 \\mathrm{~ms}$. Hence,\n\n$$\ni(t)=20-15 e^{-12.5 t} \\mathrm{A}, \\quad t \\geq 0\n$$\n\n#### Example 7.10 Determining Step Response of a Circuit with Magnetically Coupled Coils\n\nAt the time the switch is closed in the circuit of Fig. 7.29, no energy is stored.\na) Find the solutions for $i_{o}, v_{o}, i_{1}$, and $i_{2}$.\nb) Verify that the solutions from (a) align with known circuit behavior.\n\n#### Solution\n\na) The magnetically coupled coils in Fig. 7.29 can be replaced by an equivalent inductor of $1.5 \\mathrm{H}$. The initial current $i_{o}$ is zero. The final current $i_{o}$ is $16 \\mathrm{~A}$. The time constant is $0.2 \\mathrm{~s}$. Therefore,\n\n$$\ni_{o}=16-16 e^{-5 t} \\mathrm{~A}, \\quad t \\geq 0\n$$\n\nThe voltage $v_{o}$ is given by\n\n$$\nv_{o}=120 e^{-5 t} \\mathrm{~V}, \\quad t \\geq 0^{+}\n$$\n\nFrom the circuit relationships, we derive\n\n$$\ni_{2}=-8+8 e^{-5 t} \\mathrm{~A}, \\quad t \\geq 0\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\ni_{1}=24-24 e^{-5 t} \\mathrm{~A}, \\quad t \\geq 0\n$$\n\nb) The initial conditions for $i_{o}, i_{1}$, and $i_{2}$ are zero, consistent with the circuit having no stored energy at the time the switch is closed. The initial voltage $v_{o}(0^{+})=120 \\mathrm{~V}$ aligns with the zero initial current condition. The solutions for $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$ are consistent with the solution for $v_{o}$ and the known behavior of the circuit.\n\nThe final values of $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$ can be confirmed using flux linkages, which show that the final flux in either coil is $24 \\mathrm{~Wb}$-turns. These values are consistent with the solutions for $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$ and the behavior of the circuit as described by the equations.\n\nAssess your understanding of the general solution method by attempting Chapter Problems 7.51, 7.53, 7.68, and 7.71."
