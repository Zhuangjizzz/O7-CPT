Be capable of determining the natural and step responses of parallel $R L C$ circuits.\n2. Be capable of determining the natural and step responses of series RLC circuits.\n\n**Natural and Step Responses of RLC Circuits**\n\nThis chapter focuses on the natural and step responses of circuits that include both inductors and capacitors, specifically examining two straightforward configurations: the parallel $R L C$ circuit and the series $R L C$ circuit. The natural response of a parallel $R L C$ circuit involves determining the voltage generated across the parallel branches due to the release of energy stored in the inductor, capacitor, or both. This task is illustrated using the circuit depicted in Fig. 8.1 on page 266. The initial voltage on the capacitor, $V_{0}$, signifies the initial energy stored in the capacitor, while the initial current through the inductor, $I_{0}$, represents the initial energy stored in the inductor. If the individual branch currents are of interest, they can be determined once the terminal voltage is known.\n\nThe step response of a parallel $R L C$ circuit is derived using Fig. 8.2 on page 266. The focus is on the voltage that appears across the parallel branches following the sudden application of a dc current source. The circuit may or may not have stored energy when the current source is applied.\n\nFor a series $R L C$ circuit, the natural response entails finding the current produced in the series-connected elements by the release of initially stored energy in the inductor, capacitor, or both. This is defined by the circuit shown in Fig. 8.3 on page 266. As previously mentioned, the initial inductor current, $I_{0}$, and the initial capacitor voltage, $V_{0}$, represent the initially stored energy. If any individual element voltages are of interest, they can be determined after calculating the current.\n\nThe step response of a series $R L C$ circuit is described using the circuit in Fig. 8.4 on page 266. The interest lies in the current resulting from the sudden application of a dc voltage source. The circuit may or may not have stored energy when the switch is closed.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with ordinary differential equations, understanding the derivation of the natural and step responses of parallel and series $R L C$ circuits might be challenging. Nevertheless, the results are crucial and warrant presentation at this stage. We start with the natural response of a parallel $R L C$ circuit, covering this material in two sections: one addressing the solution of the differential equation describing the circuit and the other presenting the three distinct forms the solution can take.\n\n**Practical Perspective**\n\n**Clock for Computer Timing**\n\nDigital circuits in most computers require a timing signal to synchronize their operations. Consider a laptop computer with a processor speed of 2 GHz, meaning its central processing unit can execute approximately $2 \\times 10^{9}$ simple operations per second.\n\nThe timing signal, generated by a clock generator chip, is typically a square wave at the required clock frequency. This square wave is derived from a sinusoidal wave at the same frequency. Usually, the sinusoidal wave is produced by a precisely-cut quartz crystal subjected to an applied voltage, yielding a highly stable frequency ideal for synchronizing digital circuits.\n\nAlternatively, a sinusoidal wave can be generated using a circuit with an inductor and a capacitor. By selecting appropriate values for inductance and capacitance, a sinusoid with a specific frequency can be created. We will explore such a design after presenting the fundamental concepts of second-order circuits.\n\n**Image Descriptions**\n\n**Image: Scanrail / fotolia**\n**Description:**\nThe image portrays a set of three electronic devices: a laptop, a smartphone, and a tablet, all displaying the same interface on their screens.

This square wave is derived from a sinusoidal wave at the same frequency. Often, this sinusoidal wave is generated by a precisely-cut quartz crystal subjected to an applied voltage, producing a stable frequency ideal for digital circuit synchronization.\n\nAlternatively, a sinusoidal wave can be generated using a circuit with an inductor and a capacitor. By selecting appropriate inductance and capacitance values, a sinusoid of a specific frequency can be created.

Considering that $I_{0}$ is a constant, we arrive at:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{R} \\frac{d v}{d t}+\\frac{v}{L}+C \\frac{d^{2} v}{d t^{2}}=0 \\tag{8.2}\n$$\n\nWe then divide Eq. 8.2 by the capacitance $C$ and rearrange the derivatives in descending order:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2} v}{d t^{2}}+\\frac{1}{R C} \\frac{d v}{d t}+\\frac{v}{L C}=0 \\tag{8.3}\n$$\n\nComparing Eq. 8.3 with the differential equations from Chapter 7, we observe a distinction due to the presence of the term involving the second derivative. Equation 8.3 represents an ordinary, second-order differential equation with constant coefficients. Given that the circuits in this chapter include both inductors and capacitors, the resulting differential equation is of the second order, leading to these circuits being termed second-order circuits.\n\nIn addressing the General Solution of the Second-Order Differential Equation, we cannot apply the variable separation method as done with first-order equations in Chapter 7. Instead, we adopt the classical approach of assuming an exponential solution form for the voltage:\n\n$$\nv=A e^{s t} \\tag{8.4}\n$$\n\nwhere $A$ and $s$ are constants yet to be determined.\n\nBefore demonstrating how this assumption leads to the solution of Eq. 8.3, we must first justify its validity. The strongest argument in favor of Eq. 8.4 is that the second derivative of the solution, plus a constant times the first derivative, plus a constant times the solution itself, must sum to zero for all values of $t$. This can only be true if higher-order derivatives of the solution share the same form as the solution itself, a characteristic satisfied by the exponential function. Another argument is that the solutions to all first-order equations derived in Chapter 7 were exponential, suggesting that the solution to the second-order equation should also involve the exponential function.\n\nIf Eq. 8.4 is a solution of Eq. 8.3, it must hold true for all values of $t$. Substituting Eq. 8.4 into Eq. 8.3 yields:\n\n$$\nA s^{2} e^{s t}+\\frac{A s}{R C} e^{s t}+\\frac{A e^{s t}}{L C}=0\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nA e^{s t}\\left(s^{2}+\\frac{s}{R C}+\\frac{1}{L C}\\right)=0 \\tag{8.5}\n$$\n\nThis equation can only be satisfied for all values of $t$ if $A$ is zero or the parenthetical term is zero, as $e^{s t} \\neq 0$ for any finite values of $s t$. We cannot use $A=0$ as a general solution since it implies that the voltage is zero at all times, which is physically impossible if energy is stored in either the inductor or capacitor. Therefore, for Eq. 8.4 to be a solution of Eq. 8.3, the parenthetical term in Eq. 8.5 must be zero:\n\n$$\ns^{2}+\\frac{s}{R C}+\\frac{1}{L C}=0 \\tag{8.6}\n$$\n\nEquation 8.6 is known as the characteristic equation of the differential equation, as the roots of this quadratic equation define the mathematical nature of $v(t)$.\n\nThe two roots of Eq. 8.6 are:\n\n$$\ns_{1}=-\\frac{1}{2 R C}+\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{2 R C}\\right)^{2}-\\frac{1}{L C}}  \\tag{8.7}\\\\\ns_{2}=-\\frac{1}{2 R C}-\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{2 R C}\\right)^{2}-\\frac{1}{L C}} \\tag{8.8}\n$$\n\nSubstituting either root into Eq. 8.4 yields a solution that satisfies the given differential equation, Eq. 8.3. This result holds regardless of the value of $A$. Therefore, both:\n\n$$\nv=A_{1} e^{s_{1} t} \\text { and } v=A_{2} e^{s_{2} t}\n$$\n\nsatisfy Eq. 8.3. Denoting these two solutions $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$, respectively, their sum is also a solution. Specifically, if we let:\n\n$$\nv=v_{1}+v_{2}=A_{1} e^{s_{1} t}+A_{2} e^{s_{2} t} \\tag{8.9}\n$$\n\nthen:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d v}{d t}=A_{1} s_{1} e^{s_{1} t}+A_{2} s_{2} e^{s_{2} t}  \\tag{8.10}\\\\\n\\frac{d^{2} v}{d t^{2}}=A_{1} s_{1}^{2} e^{s_{1} t}+A_{2} s_{2}^{2} e^{s_{2} t} \\tag{8.11}\n$$\n\nSubstituting Eqs. 8.9-8.11 into Eq. 8.3 gives:\n\n$$\nA_{1} e^{s_{1} t}\\left(s_{1}^{2}+\\frac{1}{R C} s_{1}+\\frac{1}{L C}\\right)+A_{2} e^{s_{2} t}\\left(s_{2}^{2}+\\frac{1}{R C} s_{2}+\\frac{1}{L C}\\right)=0 \\tag{8.12}\n$$\n\nBut each parenthetical term is zero because $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ are, by definition, roots of the characteristic equation. Hence, the natural response of the parallel $R L C$ circuit shown in Fig. 8.1 is of the form:\n\n$$\nv=A_{1} e^{s_{1} t}+A_{2} e^{s_{2} t} \\tag{8.13}\n$$\n\nEquation 8.13 reaffirms the assumption made in Eq. 8.9. We have shown that $v_{1}$, $v_{2}$, and their sum $v_{1}+v_{2}$ are all solutions. Thus, the general solution of Eq. 8.3 is as given in Eq. 8.13. The roots of the characteristic equation ($s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$) are determined by the circuit parameters $R, L$, and $C$, while the initial conditions dictate the values of the constants $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$. Note that Eq. 8.13 must be adjusted if the roots $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ are equal, a scenario we will address when discussing the critically damped voltage response in Section 8.2.\n\nThe behavior of $v(t)$ depends on the values of $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$. Therefore, the first step in finding the natural response is to determine the roots of the characteristic equation. We revisit Eqs. 8.7 and 8.8 and rewrite them using a notation commonly employed in the literature:\n\n$$\ns_{1}=-\\alpha+\\sqrt{\\alpha^{2}-\\omega_{0}^{2}}  \\tag{8.14}\\\\\ns_{2}=-\\alpha-\\sqrt{\\alpha^{2}-\\omega_{0}^{2}} \\tag{8.15}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n\n$$\n\\alpha=\\frac{1}{2 R C} \\tag{8.16}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\omega_{0}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{L C}} \\tag{8.17}\n$$\n\nThese results are summarized in Table 8.1.\n\nTABLE 8.1 Natural Response Parameters of the Parallel RLC Circuit\n\n| Parameter | Terminology | Value In Natural Response |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $s_{1}, s_{2}$ | Characteristic roots | $s_{1}=-\\alpha+\\sqrt{\\alpha^{2}-\\omega_{0}^{2}}$ |\n|  |  | $s_{2}=-\\alpha-\\sqrt{\\alpha^{2}-\\omega_{0}^{2}}$ |\n| $\\alpha$ | Neper frequency | $\\alpha=\\frac{1}{2 R C}$ |\n| $\\omega_{0}$ | Resonant radian frequency | $\\omega_{0}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{L C}}$ |\n\nThe exponent of $e$ must be dimensionless, so both $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ (and hence $\\alpha$ and $\\omega_{0}$) must have the dimension of the reciprocal of time, or frequency. To differentiate among the frequencies $s_{1}, s_{2}, \\alpha$, and $\\omega_{0}$, we use the following terminology: $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ are referred to as complex frequencies, $\\alpha$ is called the neper frequency, and $\\omega_{0}$ is the resonant radian frequency. The full significance of this terminology unfolds as we progress through the remaining chapters of this book. All these frequencies are specified using the unit radians per second ($\\mathrm{rad} / \\mathrm{s}$). The nature of the roots $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ depends on the values of $\\alpha$ and $\\omega_{0}$. There are three possible outcomes. First, if $\\omega_{0}^{2}<\\alpha^{2}$, both roots will be real and distinct, and the voltage response is said to be overdamped. Second, if $\\omega_{0}^{2}>\\alpha^{2}$, both $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ will be complex and conjugates of each other, resulting in an underdamped voltage response. The third possibility is $\\omega_{0}^{2}=\\alpha^{2}$, where $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ are real and equal, leading to a critically damped voltage response. Damping affects how the voltage response reaches its final (or steady-state) value, a topic discussed separately in Section 8.2.\n\nExample 8.1 illustrates how the numerical values of $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ are determined by the values of $R, L$, and $C$."

Thus, for Equation 8.4 to solve Equation 8.3, the expression in parentheses in Equation 8.5 must be zero, leading to:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ns^{2}+\\frac{s}{R C}+\\frac{1}{L C}=0 \\tag{8.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEquation 8.6 is termed the characteristic equation of the differential equation, as its roots dictate the mathematical nature of $v(t)$.\n\nThe roots of Equation 8.6 are given by:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& s_{1}=-\\frac{1}{2 R C}+\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{2 R C}\\right)^{2}-\\frac{1}{L C}}  \\tag{8.7}\\\\\n& s_{2}=-\\frac{1}{2 R C}-\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{2 R C}\\right)^{2}-\\frac{1}{L C}} \\tag{8.8}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSubstituting either root into Equation 8.4 yields a solution that satisfies the differential equation, Equation 8.3.

We have established that $v_{1}$ is a solution, $v_{2}$ is a solution, and their sum, $v_{1}+v_{2}$, is also a solution. Thus, the general solution to Equation 8.3 follows the form stated in Equation 8.13. The roots of the characteristic equation ($s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$) are dictated by the circuit parameters $R, L$, and $C$. Initial conditions dictate the values of the constants $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$. If the roots $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ are equal, the form of Equation 8.13 must be altered, which we address in Section 8.2 when discussing the critically damped voltage response.\n\nThe behavior of $v(t)$ hinges on the values of $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$. Therefore, the initial step in ascertaining the natural response is to determine the roots of the characteristic equation. Referring back to Equations 8.7 and 8.8, we recast them using a notation prevalent in the literature:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& s_{1}=-\\alpha+\\sqrt{\\alpha^{2}-\\omega_{0}^{2}}  \\tag{8.14}\\\\\n& s_{2}=-\\alpha-\\sqrt{\\alpha^{2}-\\omega_{0}^{2}} \\tag{8.15}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\nNeper frequency, parallel RLC circuit\n\nResonant radian frequency, parallel RLC circuit\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\alpha=\\frac{1}{2 R C} \\tag{8.16}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\omega_{0}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{L C}} \\tag{8.17}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThese findings are summarized in Table 8.1.\n\nTABLE 8.1 Natural Response Parameters of the Parallel RLC Circuit\n\n| Parameter | Terminology | Value In <br> Natural Response |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $s_{1}, s_{2}$ | Characteristic roots | $s_{1}=-\\alpha+\\sqrt{\\alpha^{2}-\\omega_{0}^{2}}$ |\n|  |  | $s_{2}=-\\alpha-\\sqrt{\\alpha^{2}-\\omega_{0}^{2}}$ |\n| $\\alpha$ | Neper frequency | $\\alpha=\\frac{1}{2 R C}$ |\n| $\\omega_{0}$ | Resonant radian frequency | $\\omega_{0}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{L C}}$ |\n\nGiven that the exponent of $e$ must be dimensionless, both $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ (and by extension, $\\alpha$ and $\\omega_{0}$) must possess the dimensions of the reciprocal of time, or frequency.

    "text": "---[Rephrased Text]---\n\nThe process of determining the natural response of the circuit depicted in Fig. 8.1 begins with formulating the differential equation the voltage $v$ needs to adhere to. We initially focus on the voltage since it remains consistent across all components. Subsequently, the branch current can be calculated by leveraging the specific current-voltage relationship of the respective branch component. The differential equation for the voltage is derived by summing the currents leaving the top node, with each current expressed as a function of the unknown voltage $v$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{v}{R}+\\frac{1}{L} \\int_{0}^{t} v d \\tau+I_{0}+C \\frac{d v}{d t}=0 \\tag{8.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nTo eliminate the integral from Eq. 8.1, we differentiate once with respect to $t$, considering that $I_{0}$ is a constant, resulting in:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{1}{R} \\frac{d v}{d t}+\\frac{v}{L}+C \\frac{d^{2} v}{d t^{2}}=0 \\tag{8.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nNext, we divide Eq. 8.2 by the capacitance $C$ and reorder the derivatives from highest to lowest order:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{d^{2} v}{d t^{2}}+\\frac{1}{R C} \\frac{d v}{d t}+\\frac{v}{L C}=0 \\tag{8.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nUpon comparing Eq. 8.3 with the differential equations from Chapter 7, the distinction lies in the presence of a term involving the second derivative. Eq. 8.3 represents an ordinary, second-order differential equation with constant coefficients. The circuits in this chapter, incorporating both inductors and capacitors, yield a second-order differential equation, leading to these circuits being termed second-order circuits.\n\nIn addressing the general solution of the second-order differential equation, we cannot employ the variable separation and integration method as we did with first-order equations in Chapter 7. The traditional method involves assuming an exponential solution form for the voltage:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv=A e^{s t} \\tag{8.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $A$ and $s$ are constants yet to be determined. To justify this assumption, we argue that the second derivative of the solution, combined with a constant multiple of the first derivative and the solution itself, must sum to zero across all $t$. This holds true only if higher-order derivatives of the solution mirror the solution form, a property exhibited by the exponential function. Furthermore, the solutions to all first-order equations in Chapter 7 were exponential, suggesting the same for the second-order equation.\n\nTo confirm that Eq. 8.4 is a solution to Eq. 8.3, it must hold for all $t$. Substituting Eq. 8.4 into Eq. 8.3 yields:\n\n$$\nA s^{2} e^{s t}+\\frac{A s}{R C} e^{s t}+\\frac{A e^{s t}}{L C}=0\n$$\n\nor simplified to:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nA e^{s t}\\left(s^{2}+\\frac{s}{R C}+\\frac{1}{L C}\\right)=0 \\tag{8.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor this equation to hold for all $t$, either $A$ must be zero or the expression in parentheses must be zero, as $e^{s t}$ is never zero for finite $s t$. The assumption of $A=0$ leads to a voltage of zero at all times, which contradicts the presence of energy storage in the inductor or capacitor. Therefore, for Eq. 8.4 to be valid, the expression in parentheses in Eq. 8.5 must be zero, leading to:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ns^{2}+\\frac{s}{R C}+\\frac{1}{L C}=0 \\tag{8.6}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nEq. 8.6, known as the characteristic equation, determines the mathematical nature of $v(t)$ through its roots. The two roots of Eq. 8.6 are:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& s_{1}=-\\frac{1}{2 R C}+\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{2 R C}\\right)^{2}-\\frac{1}{L C}}  \\tag{8.7}\\\\\n& s_{2}=-\\frac{1}{2 R C}-\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{2 R C}\\right)^{2}-\\frac{1}{L C}} \\tag{8.8}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSubstituting either root into Eq. 8.4 results in a solution that satisfies Eq. 8.3, regardless of the value of $A$. Consequently, both $v=A_{1} e^{s_{1} t}$ and $v=A_{2} e^{s_{2} t}$ are solutions to Eq. 8.3. Denoting these solutions as $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ respectively, their sum is also a solution. Specifically, if:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv=v_{1}+v_{2}=A_{1} e^{s_{1} t}+A_{2} e^{s_{2} t} \\tag{8.9}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nthen:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{d v}{d t} & =A_{1} s_{1} e^{s_{1} t}+A_{2} s_{2} e^{s_{2} t}  \\tag{8.10}\\\\\n\\frac{d^{2} v}{d t^{2}} & =A_{1} s_{1}^{2} e^{s_{1} t}+A_{2} s_{2}^{2} e^{s_{2} t} \\tag{8.11}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSubstituting Eqs. 8.9-8.11 into Eq. 8.3 results in:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nA_{1} e^{s_{1} t}\\left(s_{1}^{2}+\\frac{1}{R C} s_{1}+\\frac{1}{L C}\\right)+A_{2} e^{s_{2} t}\\left(s_{2}^{2}+\\frac{1}{R C} s_{2}+\\frac{1}{L C}\\right)=0 \\tag{8.12}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ are roots of the characteristic equation, each parenthetical term is zero. Thus, the natural response of the parallel $R L C$ circuit depicted in Fig. 8.1 takes the form:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv=A_{1} e^{s_{1} t}+A_{2} e^{s_{2} t} \\tag{8.13}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis reiterates the assumption made in Eq. 8.9. We've shown that $v_{1}$, $v_{2}$, and their sum $v_{1}+v_{2}$ are solutions. Hence, the general solution to Eq. 8.3 is given by Eq. 8.13. The roots of the characteristic equation ($s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$) are dictated by the circuit parameters $R, L$, and $C$, while the initial conditions dictate the constants $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$. It's noted that Eq. 8.13 must be adjusted if $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ are equal, a scenario we'll address when discussing the critically damped voltage response in Section 8.2.\n\nThe behavior of $v(t)$ hinges on the values of $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$. Thus, the initial step in determining the natural response involves identifying the roots of the characteristic equation.

    "text": "To initiate the process of determining the natural response of the circuit depicted in Fig. 8.1, it is necessary to formulate the differential equation that governs the voltage \\( v \\). Our initial focus is on the voltage since it remains consistent across all components. Subsequently, the branch current can be ascertained by applying the branch component's current-voltage relationship. By summing the currents emanating from the top node, where each current is defined in terms of the unknown voltage \\( v \\), we can readily establish the differential equation for the voltage:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{v}{R}+\\frac{1}{L} \\int_{0}^{t} v d \\tau+I_{0}+C \\frac{d v}{d t}=0 \\tag{8.1}\n\\]\n\nSubsequent to removing the integral from Eq. 8.1 through differentiation with respect to \\( t \\), and recognizing that \\( I_{0} \\) is a constant, we derive\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{R} \\frac{d v}{d t}+\\frac{v}{L}+C \\frac{d^{2} v}{d t^{2}}=0 \\tag{8.2}\n\\]\n\nUpon dividing Eq. 8.2 by the capacitance \\( C \\) and arranging the derivatives in descending order, we obtain\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d^{2} v}{d t^{2}}+\\frac{1}{R C} \\frac{d v}{d t}+\\frac{v}{L C}=0 \\tag{8.3}\n\\]\n\nContrasting Eq. 8.3 with the differential equations discussed in Chapter 7 reveals a distinction due to the term involving the second derivative. Eq. 8.3 represents an ordinary, second-order differential equation featuring constant coefficients. Given that the circuits in this chapter encompass both inductors and capacitors, the resulting differential equation describing these circuits is of the second order, leading to the moniker \"second-order circuits.\"\n\nThe General Solution of the Second-Order Differential Equation\n\nEq. 8.3 cannot be solved by the variable separation and integration method, which was applicable to first-order equations in Chapter 7. The traditional method for solving Eq. 8.3 involves postulating a solution of exponential form, implying that the voltage takes the shape\n\n\\[\nv=A e^{s t} \\tag{8.4}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( A \\) and \\( s \\) are constants yet to be determined.\n\nPrior to demonstrating how this hypothesis yields a solution to Eq. 8.3, it is essential to validate its reasonableness. The most compelling argument in favor of Eq. 8.4 stems from Eq. 8.3, which stipulates that the sum of the solution's second derivative, a constant multiple of the first derivative, and a constant multiple of the solution itself must be zero for all \\( t \\). This condition is only met if the higher-order derivatives of the solution resemble the solution itself, a characteristic exhibited by the exponential function. A further argument for Eq. 8.4 is that all solutions to the first-order equations derived in Chapter 7 were exponential, suggesting that a second-order equation's solution is likely to involve the exponential function as well.\n\nFor Eq. 8.4 to be a solution to Eq. 8.3, it must adhere to Eq. 8.3 for all \\( t \\). Substituting Eq. 8.4 into Eq. 8.3 yields\n\n\\[\nA s^{2} e^{s t}+\\frac{A s}{R C} e^{s t}+\\frac{A e^{s t}}{L C}=0\n\\]\n\nor\n\n\\[\nA e^{s t}\\left(s^{2}+\\frac{s}{R C}+\\frac{1}{L C}\\right)=0 \\tag{8.5}\n\\]\n\nThis equation can only hold for all \\( t \\) if \\( A \\) is zero or the term in parentheses is zero, considering that \\( e^{s t} \\neq 0 \\) for any finite \\( s t \\). We reject \\( A=0 \\) as a general solution since it implies a zero voltage at all times, which is physically unrealistic if energy is stored in the inductor or capacitor. Consequently, for Eq. 8.4 to solve Eq. 8.3, the term in parentheses in Eq. 8.5 must be zero, or\n\n\\[\ns^{2}+\\frac{s}{R C}+\\frac{1}{L C}=0 \\tag{8.6}\n\\]\n\nEq. 8.6 is known as the characteristic equation of the differential equation, as its roots dictate the mathematical nature of \\( v(t) \\).\n\nThe two roots of Eq. 8.6 are\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n& s_{1}=-\\frac{1}{2 R C}+\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{2 R C}\\right)^{2}-\\frac{1}{L C}}  \\tag{8.7}\\\\\n& s_{2}=-\\frac{1}{2 R C}-\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{2 R C}\\right)^{2}-\\frac{1}{L C}} \\tag{8.8}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting either root into Eq. 8.4 results in a solution that satisfies the differential equation, Eq. 8.3. Note that this conclusion is independent of \\( A \\)'s value. Hence, both\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& v=A_{1} e^{s_{1} t} \\text { and } \\\\\n& v=A_{2} e^{s_{2} t}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nsatisfy Eq. 8.3. Denoting these solutions \\( v_{1} \\) and \\( v_{2} \\), respectively, their sum is also a solution.

Therefore, the natural response of the parallel \\( R L C \\) circuit depicted in Fig. 8.1 assumes the form\n\n\\[\nv=A_{1} e^{s_{1} t}+A_{2} e^{s_{2} t} \\tag{8.13}\n\\]\n\nEq. 8.13 reiterates the assumption made in Eq. 8.9. We have demonstrated that \\( v_{1} \\) is a solution, \\( v_{2} \\) is a solution, and their sum \\( v_{1}+v_{2} \\) is also a solution. Thus, the general solution of Eq. 8.3 is represented by Eq. 8.13. The roots of the characteristic equation \\( (s_{1} \\) and \\( s_{2}) \\) are dictated by the circuit parameters \\( R, L, \\) and \\( C \\), while the initial conditions ascertain the constants \\( A_{1} \\) and \\( A_{2} \\). It is important to note that the form of Eq. 8.13 must be adjusted if the roots \\( s_{1} \\) and \\( s_{2} \\) are equal, a scenario we will explore in Section 8.2 regarding the critically damped voltage response.\n\nThe behavior of \\( v(t) \\) hinges on the values of \\( s_{1} \\) and \\( s_{2} \\). Therefore, the initial step in finding the natural response is to determine the roots of the characteristic equation. We revisit Eqs. 8.7 and 8.8 and rephrase them using a notation prevalent in the literature:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n& s_{1}=-\\alpha+\\sqrt{\\alpha^{2}-\\omega_{0}^{2}}  \\tag{8.14}\\\\\n& s_{2}=-\\alpha-\\sqrt{\\alpha^{2}-\\omega_{0}^{2}} \\tag{8.15}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\n\\alpha=\\frac{1}{2 R C} \\tag{8.16}\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\omega_{0}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{L C}} \\tag{8.17}\n\\]\n\nThese findings are summarized in Table 8.1.\n\nThe exponent of \\( e \\) must be dimensionless, implying that \\( s_{1} \\) and \\( s_{2} \\) (and consequently \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\omega_{0} \\)) must possess the dimensions of the reciprocal of time, or frequency.

Note that Eq. 8.13 requires modification if the roots \\( s_{1} \\) and \\( s_{2} \\) are equal, a scenario we address in Section 8.2 when discussing the critically damped voltage response.\n\nThe behavior of \\( v(t) \\) hinges on the values of \\( s_{1} \\) and \\( s_{2} \\). Thus, the initial step in finding the natural response is to ascertain the roots of the characteristic equation. We revisit Eqs. 8.7 and 8.8 and rewrite them using a notation commonly employed in the literature:\n\n$$\ns_{1}=-\\alpha+\\sqrt{\\alpha^{2}-\\omega_{0}^{2}}  \\tag{8.14}\n$$\n\n$$\ns_{2}=-\\alpha-\\sqrt{\\alpha^{2}-\\omega_{0}^{2}} \\tag{8.15}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n\n$$\n\\alpha=\\frac{1}{2 R C} \\tag{8.16}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\omega_{0}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{L C}} \\tag{8.17}\n$$\n\nThese results are summarized in Table 8.1.\n\nTABLE 8.1 Natural Response Parameters of the Parallel RLC Circuit\n\n| Parameter | Terminology | Value In <br> Natural Response |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| \\( s_{1}, s_{2} \\) | Characteristic roots | \\( s_{1}=-\\alpha+\\sqrt{\\alpha^{2}-\\omega_{0}^{2}} \\) |\n|  |  | \\( s_{2}=-\\alpha-\\sqrt{\\alpha^{2}-\\omega_{0}^{2}} \\) |\n| \\( \\alpha \\) | Neper frequency | \\( \\alpha=\\frac{1}{2 R C} \\) |\n| \\( \\omega_{0} \\) | Resonant radian frequency | \\( \\omega_{0}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{L C}} \\) |\n\nSince the exponent of \\( e \\) must be dimensionless, \\( s_{1} \\) and \\( s_{2} \\) (and consequently \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\omega_{0} \\)) must have the dimension of the reciprocal of time, or frequency. To differentiate among the frequencies \\( s_{1}, s_{2}, \\alpha \\), and \\( \\omega_{0} \\), we employ the following terminology: \\( s_{1} \\) and \\( s_{2} \\) are termed complex frequencies, \\( \\alpha \\) is known as the neper frequency, and \\( \\omega_{0} \\) is the resonant radian frequency. The significance of this terminology will become clearer as we progress through the subsequent chapters. All these frequencies are measured in radians per second ( \\( \\mathrm{rad} / \\mathrm{s} \\)). The nature of the roots \\( s_{1} \\) and \\( s_{2} \\) depends on the values of \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\omega_{0} \\), yielding three potential outcomes. If \\( \\omega_{0}^{2}<\\alpha^{2} \\), both roots will be real and distinct, and the voltage response is described as overdamped. If \\( \\omega_{0}^{2}>\\alpha^{2} \\), \\( s_{1} \\) and \\( s_{2} \\) will be complex and conjugates, characterizing an underdamped response. Finally, if \\( \\omega_{0}^{2}=\\alpha^{2} \\), \\( s_{1} \\) and \\( s_{2} \\) will be real and equal, indicating a critically damped response.

This is achieved by matching the solution for the natural response to the initial conditions imposed by the circuit, which include the initial current (or voltage) and the initial value of the first derivative of the current (or voltage). These same initial conditions, along with the final value of the variable, are also required when determining the step response of a second-order circuit.\n\nThis section examines the natural response form for each of the three damping types, starting with the overdamped response. As we will observe, the response equations and those for evaluating the unknown coefficients differ slightly for each of the three damping configurations. This is why it is essential to determine at the outset whether the response is over-, under-, or critically damped.\n\nThe Overdamped Voltage Response\n\nWhen the roots of the characteristic equation are real and distinct, the voltage response of a parallel RLC circuit is considered overdamped. The solution for the voltage is given by\n\n$$\nv(t)=A₁ e^{s₁ t}+A₂ e^{s₂ t}\n$$\n\nwhere s₁ and s₂ are the roots of the characteristic equation. The constants A₁ and A₂ are determined by the initial conditions, specifically the values of v(0⁺) and dv(0⁺)/dt, which are derived from the initial voltage on the capacitor, V₀, and the initial current in the inductor, I₀.\n\nNext, we demonstrate how to use the initial voltage on the capacitor and the initial current in the inductor to find A₁ and A₂. First, we note from Eq. 8.18 that A₁ and A₂ can be found by:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv(0⁺) & =A₁+A₂ \\\\\n\\frac{dv(0⁺)}{dt} & =s₁ A₁+s₂ A₂\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nWith s₁ and s₂ known, finding A₁ and A₂ involves determining v(0⁺) and dv(0⁺)/dt. The value of v(0⁺) is the initial voltage on the capacitor V₀. We obtain the initial value of dv/dt by first finding the current in the capacitor branch at t=0⁺. Then,\n\n$$\n\\frac{dv(0⁺)}{dt}=\\frac{i_C(0⁺)}{C}\n$$\n\nWe apply Kirchhoff's current law to find the initial current in the capacitor branch. We know that the sum of the three branch currents at t=0⁺ must be zero. The current in the resistive branch at t=0⁺ is the initial voltage V₀ divided by the resistance, and the current in the inductive branch is I₀. Using the reference system depicted in Fig. 8.5, we obtain\n\n$$\ni_C(0⁺)=\\frac{-V₀}{R}-I₀\n$$\n\nAfter finding the numerical value of i_C(0⁺), we use Eq. 8.21 to find the initial value of dv/dt.\n\nWe can summarize the process for finding the overdamped response, v(t), as follows:\n\n1. Find the roots of the characteristic equation, s₁ and s₂, using the values of R, L, and C.\n2. Find v(0⁺) and dv(0⁺)/dt using circuit analysis.\n3. Find the values of A₁ and A₂ by solving Eqs. 8.23 and 8.24 simultaneously:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv(0⁺) & =A₁+A₂ \\\\\n\\frac{dv(0⁺)}{dt} & =\\frac{i_C(0⁺)}{C}=s₁ A₁+s₂ A₂\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\n4. Substitute the values for s₁, s₂, A₁, and A₂ into Eq. 8.18 to determine the expression for v(t) for t ≥ 0.\n\nExamples 8.2 and 8.3 illustrate how to find the overdamped response of a parallel RLC circuit.\n\n#### Example 8.2 Finding the Overdamped Natural Response of a Parallel RLC Circuit\n\nFor the circuit in Fig. 8.6, v(0⁺)=12 V and i_L(0⁺)=30 mA.\n\na) Find the initial current in each branch of the circuit.\nb) Find the initial value of dv/dt.\nc) Find the expression for v(t).\nd) Sketch v(t) in the interval 0 ≤ t ≤ 250 ms.\n\n#### Solution\n\na) The inductor prevents an instantaneous change in its current, so the initial value of the inductor current is 30 mA:\n\n$$\ni_L(0⁻)=i_L(0)=i_L(0⁺)=30 mA\n$$\n\nThe capacitor holds the initial voltage across the parallel elements to 12 V. Thus the initial current in the resistive branch, i_R(0⁺), is 12/200, or 60 mA. Kirchhoff's current law requires the sum of the currents leaving the top node to equal zero at every instant. Hence,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ni_C(0⁺) & =-i_L(0⁺)-i_R(0⁺) \\\\\n& =-90 mA\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNote that if we assumed the inductor current and capacitor voltage had reached their dc values at the instant that energy begins to be released, i_C(0⁻)=0. In other words, there is an instantaneous change in the capacitor current at t=0.\n\nb) Because i_C=C(dv/dt),\n\n$$\n\\frac{dv(0⁺)}{dt}=\\frac{-90 \\times 10^{-3}}{0.2 \\times 10^{-6}}=-450 kV/s\n$$\n\nc) The roots of the characteristic equation come from the values of R, L, and C. For the values specified and from Eqs. 8.14 and 8.15 along with 8.16 and 8.17,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ns₁ & =-1.25 \\times 10^{4}+\\sqrt{1.5625 \\times 10^{8}-10^{8}} \\\\\n& =-12,500+7500=-5000 rad/s \\\\\ns₂ & =-1.25 \\times 10^{4}-2 \\sqrt{1.5625 \\times 10^{8}-10^{8}} \\\\\n& =-12,500-7500=-20,000 rad/s\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBecause the roots are real and distinct, we know that the response is overdamped and hence has the form of Eq. 8.18.

    "text": "To analyze the natural response of a parallel RLC circuit, we first need to calculate the roots of the characteristic equation, which depend on the circuit parameters R, L, and C. These roots, s1 and s2, determine the nature of the response, whether it is overdamped, underdamped, or critically damped.\n\nFor an overdamped response, where the roots are real and distinct, the voltage across the capacitor is given by:\n\nv(t) = A1 * e^(s1 * t) + A2 * e^(s2 * t)\n\nHere, A1 and A2 are constants determined by the initial conditions, specifically the initial voltage across the capacitor (V0) and the initial current through the inductor (I0).

    "text": "To determine the natural response of a second-order RLC circuit, we must calculate the roots of the characteristic equation, which are denoted as $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$.

These same initial conditions, along with the final value of the variable, are crucial for determining the step response of a second-order circuit.\n\nIn this section, we examine the natural response forms for each of the three damping types, starting with the overdamped response. The response equations and those for calculating the unknown coefficients vary slightly for each damping configuration. Hence, it's important to identify at the outset whether the response is over-, under-, or critically damped.\n\n### Overdamped Voltage Response\n\nAn RL C circuit's voltage response is deemed overdamped when the characteristic equation's roots are real and distinct. The voltage solution takes the form:\n\n\\[\nv = A_1 e^{s_1 t} + A_2 e^{s_2 t}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(s_1\\) and \\(s_2\\) are the characteristic equation's roots. The constants \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\) are determined by the initial conditions, specifically the values of \\(v(0^+)\\) and \\(\\frac{dv(0^+)}{dt}\\), which are derived from the initial capacitor voltage \\(V_0\\) and the initial inductor current \\(I_0\\).\n\nNext, we illustrate how to use the initial capacitor voltage and the initial inductor current to find \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\). First, from Equation 8.18, we note that:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nv(0^+) &= A_1 + A_2 \\\\\n\\frac{dv(0^+)}{dt} &= s_1 A_1 + s_2 A_2\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nWith \\(s_1\\) and \\(s_2\\) known, the task of finding \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\) simplifies to determining \\(v(0^+)\\) and \\(\\frac{dv(0^+)}{dt}\\). The value of \\(v(0^+)\\) is the initial capacitor voltage \\(V_0\\). The initial rate of change of \\(v\\) is found by first determining the capacitor branch current at \\(t=0^+\\). Thus:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dv(0^+)}{dt} = \\frac{i_C(0^+)}{C}\n\\]\n\nWe apply Kirchhoff's current law to find the initial current in the capacitor branch. The sum of the three branch currents at \\(t=0^+\\) must be zero. The current in the resistive branch at \\(t=0^+\\) is the initial voltage \\(V_0\\) divided by the resistance, and the current in the inductive branch is \\(I_0\\). Using the reference system depicted in Fig. 8.5, we get:\n\n\\[\ni_C(0^+) = \\frac{-V_0}{R} - I_0\n\\]\n\nAfter finding the numerical value of \\(i_C(0^+)\\), we use Equation 8.21 to find the initial rate of change of \\(v\\).\n\nThe process for finding the overdamped response, \\(v(t)\\), can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the characteristic equation's roots, \\(s_1\\) and \\(s_2\\), using \\(R\\), \\(L\\), and \\(C\\).\n2. Determine \\(v(0^+)\\) and \\(\\frac{dv(0^+)}{dt}\\) using circuit analysis.\n3. Solve Equations 8.23 and 8.24 simultaneously to find the values of \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nv(0^+) &= A_1 + A_2 \\\\\n\\frac{dv(0^+)}{dt} &= \\frac{i_C(0^+)}{C} = s_1 A_1 + s_2 A_2\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n4. Substitute the values for \\(s_1\\), \\(s_2\\), \\(A_1\\), and \\(A_2\\) into Equation 8.18 to determine \\(v(t)\\) for \\(t \\geq 0\\). Examples 8.2 and 8.3 demonstrate how to find the overdamped response of a parallel RL C circuit.\n\n### Example 8.2: Finding the Overdamped Natural Response of a Parallel RL C Circuit\n\nFor the circuit in Fig. 8.6, \\(v(0^+) = 12\\) V and \\(i_L(0^+) = 30\\) mA.\na) Determine the initial current in each branch of the circuit.\nb) Find the initial value of \\(\\frac{dv}{dt}\\).\nc) Derive the expression for \\(v(t)\\).\nd) Sketch \\(v(t)\\) in the interval \\(0 \\leq t \\leq 250\\) ms.\n\n#### Solution\n\na) The inductor prevents an instantaneous change in its current, so the initial inductor current is 30 mA:\n\n\\[\ni_L(0^-) = i_L(0) = i_L(0^+) = 30 \\text{ mA}\n\\]\n\nThe capacitor holds the initial voltage across the parallel elements to 12 V. Thus, the initial current in the resistive branch, \\(i_R(0^+)\\), is \\(12 / 200\\), or 60 mA. Kirchhoff's current law requires the sum of the currents leaving the top node to equal zero at every instant. Hence:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ni_C(0^+) &= -i_L(0^+) - i_R(0^+) \\\\\n&= -90 \\text{ mA}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nNote that if we assumed the inductor current and capacitor voltage had reached their DC values at the instant energy begins to be released, \\(i_C(0^-) = 0\\). In other words, there is an instantaneous change in the capacitor current at \\(t=0\\).\n\nb) Since \\(i_C = C\\frac{dv}{dt}\\),\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dv(0^+)}{dt} = \\frac{-90 \\times 10^{-3}}{0.2 \\times 10^{-6}} = -450 \\text{ kV/s}\n\\]\n\nc) The characteristic equation's roots are derived from the values of \\(R\\), \\(L\\), and \\(C\\). For the specified values and from Equations 8.14 and 8.15 along with 8.16 and 8.17,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ns_1 &= -1.25 \\times 10^4 + \\sqrt{1.5625 \\times 10^8 - 10^8} \\\\\n&= -12,500 + 7500 = -5000 \\text{ rad/s} \\\\\ns_2 &= -1.25 \\times 10^4 - \\sqrt{1.5625 \\times 10^8 - 10^8} \\\\\n&= -12,500 - 7500 = -20,000 \\text{ rad/s}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nThe circuit in Fig. 8.6 is an RL C series circuit with a capacitor, inductor, and resistor all connected in parallel to the ground. The voltages across each component are labeled as \\(V_0\\), and the currents through each component are labeled as \\(i_C\\), \\(i_L\\), and \\(i_R\\), respectively.\n\nSince the roots are real and distinct, we know that the response is overdamped and hence has the form of Equation 8.18. We find the coefficients \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\) from Equations 8.23 and 8.24. We've already determined \\(s_1\\), \\(s_2\\), \\(v(0^+)\\), and \\(\\frac{dv(0^+)}{dt}\\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n12 = A_1 + A_2 \\\\\n-450 \\times 10^3 = -5000 A_1 - 20,000 A_2\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\n\nSolving these equations for \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\) yields \\(A_1 = -14\\) V and \\(A_2 = 26\\) V. Substituting these values into Equation 8.18 gives the overdamped voltage response:\n\n\\[\nv(t) = (-14 e^{-5000 t} + 26 e^{-20,000 t}) \\text{ V}, \\quad t \\geq 0\n\\]\n\nAs a check on these calculations, we note that the solution yields \\(v(0) = 12\\) V and \\(\\frac{dv(0^+)}{dt} = -450,000\\) V/s.\n\nd) Figure 8.7 shows a plot of \\(v(t)\\) versus \\(t\\) over the interval \\(0 \\leq t \\leq 250\\) ms.\n\nThe graph in Figure 8.7 represents the time-domain waveform of voltage, \\(v(t)\\), plotted against time, \\(t\\), for the first 250 microseconds after the stored energy is released in a system. The graph is a plot of the function \\(v(t) = (-14 e^{-5000 t} + 26 e^{-20,000 t})\\) volts, which describes an overdamped exponential response.\n\n1. **Type of Graph and Function**:\n- This is a time-domain waveform graph showing the voltage response over time.\n\n2. **Axes Labels and Units**:\n- The horizontal axis represents time, \\(t\\), measured in milliseconds (ms).\n- The vertical axis represents the voltage, \\(v(t)\\), measured in volts (V).\n- The graph uses a linear scale for both axes.\n\n3. **Overall Behavior and Trends**:\n- The waveform shows an overdamped exponential response, starting at 12 V at \\(t = 0\\).\n- The voltage rapidly decreases, crossing the zero voltage line around 50 μs, reaching a minimum of approximately -6 V.\n- After reaching this minimum, the voltage begins to increase again but does not return to its initial value within the observed time frame.\n- The overall behavior shows a rapid initial decrease followed by a gradual increase, characteristic of an overdamped response in an RL C circuit.\n\n4. **Key Features and Technical Details**:\n- The initial voltage of 12 V, the zero-crossing point around 50 μs, and the minimum voltage of approximately -6 V.\n- The graph visually confirms the calculated response of the system as described in the context.\n\nFigure 8.7 \\(\\triangle\\) The voltage response for Example 8.2.\n\n### Example 8.3: Calculating Branch Currents in the Natural Response of a Parallel RL C Circuit\n\nDerive the expressions that describe the three branch currents \\(i_R\\), \\(i_L\\), and \\(i_C\\) in Example 8.2 (Fig. 8.6) during the time the stored energy is being released.\n\n#### Solution\n\nWe know the voltage across the three branches from the solution in Example 8.2, namely:\n\n\\[\nv(t) = (-14 e^{-5000 t} + 26 e^{-20,000 t}) \\text{ V}, \\quad t \\geq 0\n\\]\n\nThe current in the resistive branch is then:\n\n\\[\ni_R(t) = \\frac{v(t)}{200} = (-70 e^{-5000 t} + 130 e^{-20,000 t}) \\text{ mA}, \\quad t \\geq 0\n\\]\n\nThere are two ways to find the current in the inductive branch. One way is to use the integral relationship that exists between the current and the voltage at the terminals of an inductor:\n\n\\[\ni_L(t) = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_0^t v_L(x) \\, dx + I_0\n\\]\n\nA second approach is to find the current in the capacitive branch first and then use the fact that \\(i_R + i_L + i_C = 0\\). Let's use this approach. The current in the capacitive branch is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ni_C(t) &= C \\frac{dv}{dt} \\\\\n&= 0.2 \\times 10^{-6} (70,000 e^{-5000 t} - 520,000 e^{-20,000 t}) \\\\\n&= (14 e^{-5000 t} - 104 e^{-20,000 t}) \\text{ mA}, \\quad t \\geq 0^+\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nNote that \\(i_C(0^+) = -90\\) mA, which agrees with the result in Example 8.2.\n\nNow we obtain the inductive branch current from the relationship:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ni_L(t) &= -i_R(t) - i_C(t) \\\\\n&= (56 e^{-5000 t} - 26 e^{-20,000 t}) \\text{ mA}, \\quad t \\geq 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nWe leave it to you, in Assessment Problem 8.2, to show that the integral relation alluded to leads to the same result.

The value of \\(v(0^+)\\) is the initial capacitor voltage \\(V_0\\). The initial rate of change of \\(v\\) is found by first determining the capacitor branch current at \\(t=0^+\\). Thus:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dv(0^+)}{dt} = \\frac{i_C(0^+)}{C}\n\\]\n\nWe apply Kirchhoff's current law to find the initial current in the capacitor branch. The sum"

Consequently, to determine the natural response, it is necessary to calculate these values and ascertain whether the response is over-, under-, or critically damped.\n\nDescribing the natural response involves identifying two unknown coefficients, such as $A_1$ and $A_2$ in Equation 8.13. This process is based on aligning the solution for the natural response with the initial conditions imposed by the circuit, which include the initial current (or voltage) and the initial value of the first derivative of the current (or voltage). Additionally, these same initial conditions, along with the final value of the variable, are required when determining the step response of a second-order circuit.\n\nIn this section, we examine the natural response for each of the three damping types, commencing with the overdamped response. The response equations and the equations for calculating the unknown coefficients vary slightly for each damping configuration, which is why it is crucial to identify the type of damping response at the outset of the problem.\n\nWhen the roots of the characteristic equation are real and distinct, the voltage response of a parallel RLC circuit is considered overdamped. The solution for the voltage takes the form:\n\n$$\nv(t) = A_1 e^{s_1 t} + A_2 e^{s_2 t}\n$$\n\nwhere $s_1$ and $s_2$ are the roots of the characteristic equation. The constants $A_1$ and $A_2$ are determined by the initial conditions, particularly from the values of $v(0^+)$ and $\\frac{dv(0^+)}{dt}$, which are derived from the initial voltage on the capacitor, $V_0$, and the initial current in the inductor, $I_0$.\n\nThe process for determining the overdamped response, $v(t)$, can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Determine the roots of the characteristic equation, $s_1$ and $s_2$, using the values of $R$, $L$, and $C$.\n2. Calculate $v(0^+)$ and $\\frac{dv(0^+)}{dt}$ using circuit analysis.\n3. Find the values of $A_1$ and $A_2$ by simultaneously solving equations for $v(0^+)$ and $\\frac{dv(0^+)}{dt}$.\n4. Substitute the values for $s_1$, $s_2$, $A_1$, and $A_2$ into the voltage equation to determine the expression for $v(t)$ for $t \\geq 0$.\n\nExamples 8.2 and 8.3 demonstrate how to find the overdamped response of a parallel RLC circuit.\n\nFor a parallel RLC circuit, when $\\omega_0^2 > \\alpha^2$, the roots of the characteristic equation are complex, and the response is underdamped. The underdamped voltage response is given by:\n\n$$\nv(t) = B_1 e^{-\\alpha t} \\cos \\omega_d t + B_2 e^{-\\alpha t} \\sin \\omega_d t\n$$\n\nwhere $\\omega_d = \\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 - \\alpha^2}$ is the damped radian frequency. The constants $B_1$ and $B_2$ are determined by the initial energy stored in the circuit.\n\nThe underdamped response has several notable characteristics. As the dissipative losses in the circuit decrease, the duration of the oscillations increases, and the frequency of the oscillations approaches $\\omega_0$. In an underdamped system, the response oscillates about its final value, a behavior referred to as ringing. In contrast, an overdamped system approaches its final value without ringing, in a manner described as sluggish.\n\nThe second-order circuit is critically damped when $\\omega_0^2 = \\alpha^2$, or $\\omega_0 = \\alpha$. When a circuit is critically damped, the response is on the verge of oscillating, and the two roots of the characteristic equation are real and equal. The voltage response in this case is given by:\n\n$$\nv(t) = D_1 t e^{-\\alpha t} + D_2 e^{-\\alpha t}\n$$\n\nwhere $D_1$ and $D_2$ are determined by the initial values of the voltage and its derivative.\n\nIn summary, the first step in finding the natural response of a parallel RLC circuit is to calculate the roots of the characteristic equation, which immediately indicate whether the response is overdamped, underdamped, or critically damped. The voltage response equations and the methods for calculating the unknown coefficients differ for each damping configuration, but the general approach remains consistent."

    "text": "Determining the step response of a parallel RLC circuit involves calculating the voltage across its parallel branches or the current through its individual branches in response to a sudden application of a direct current source. The circuit may or may not have stored energy at the moment the current source is applied, as depicted in Fig. 8.11. To develop a general method for finding the step response of a second-order circuit, our focus is on determining the current through the inductive branch (i_L). This current is particularly noteworthy as it does not decay to zero with time. Instead, after the switch has been open for an extended period, the inductor current matches the direct current source current I. For the purpose of illustrating the technique to find the step response, we assume there is no initial energy stored in the circuit. This simplifies the calculations without changing the fundamental process involved. Example 8.10 will illustrate how the presence of initially stored energy factors into the general procedure.\n\nTo calculate the inductor current i_L, we must solve a second-order differential equation that relates to the forcing function I, derived as follows. Applying Kirchhoff's current law yields:\n\ni_L + i_R + i_C = I\n\nor\n\ni_L + v/R + C * dv/dt = I\n\nSince\n\nv = L * di_L/dt\n\nwe obtain\n\ndv/dt = L * d^2i_L/dt^2\n\nSubstituting the equations for v into the equation for i_L gives:\n\ni_L + L/R * di_L/dt + LC * d^2i_L/dt^2 = I\n\nFor convenience, we divide by LC and rearrange terms:\n\nd^2i_L/dt^2 + 1/(RC) * di_L/dt + i_L/(LC) = I/(LC)\n\nComparing this equation with a previous equation reveals that the presence of a non-zero term on the right-hand side modifies the task. Before demonstrating how to solve this equation directly, we first solve it indirectly. Understanding the indirect solution will facilitate explaining the direct approach.\n\nThe Indirect Approach\n\nWe can indirectly solve for i_L by first determining the voltage v. This is done using the techniques introduced in Section 8.2, as the differential equation that v must satisfy is the same as the previous equation. To see this, we revisit the equation for i_L and express it as a function of v:\n\n1/L * ∫_0^t v dτ + v/R + C * dv/dt = I\n\nDifferentiating this equation once with respect to t eliminates the constant I. Thus:\n\nv/L + 1/R * dv/dt + C * d^2v/dt^2 = 0\n\nor\n\nd^2v/dt^2 + 1/(RC) * dv/dt + v/(LC) = 0\n\nAs discussed in Section 8.2, the solution for v depends on the roots of the characteristic equation. The three possible solutions are:\n\nv = A_1 * e^(s_1 * t) + A_2 * e^(s_2 * t)\nv = B_1 * e^(-α * t) * cos(ω_d * t) + B_2 * e^(-α * t) * sin(ω_d * t)\nv = D_1 * t * e^(-α * t) + D_2 * e^(-α * t)\n\nA word of caution: Due to the presence of a source in the circuit for t > 0, you must consider the source current's value at t = 0^+ when evaluating the coefficients in these equations.\n\nTo find the three possible solutions for i_L, we substitute the equations for v into the equation for i_L. After doing so, the three solutions for i_L are:\n\ni_L = I + A_1' * e^(s_1 * t) + A_2' * e^(s_2 * t)\ni_L = I + B_1' * e^(-α * t) * cos(ω_d * t) + B_2' * e^(-α * t) * sin(ω_d * t)\ni_L = I + D_1' * t * e^(-α * t) + D_2' * e^(-α * t)\n\nwhere A_1', A_2', B_1', B_2', D_1', and D_2' are arbitrary constants. In each case, the primed constants can be indirectly determined in terms of the arbitrary constants associated with the voltage solution, although this method is cumbersome.\n\nThe Direct Approach\n\nIt is more straightforward to find the primed constants directly in terms of the initial values of the response function. For the circuit in question, we would determine the primed constants from i_L(0) and di_L(0)/dt.\n\nThe solution for a second-order differential equation with a constant forcing function is the sum of the forced response and a response function identical in form to the natural response. Therefore, we can always express the step response solution in the form:\n\ni = I_f + {function of the same form as the natural response}\nv = V_f + {function of the same form as the natural response}\n\nwhere I_f and V_f represent the final value of the response function. The final value may be zero, as was the case with the voltage v in the circuit in Fig. 8.8.\n\nExamples 8.6-8.10 demonstrate the technique for finding the step response of a parallel RLC circuit using the direct approach."

Now, because \\( v = L \\frac{di_L}{dt} \\),\n\n\\[ \\frac{di_L}{dt}(0^+) = 0 \\]\n\nc) From the circuit elements, we obtain\n\n\\[ \\omega_0^2 = \\frac{1}{LC} = \\frac{10^{12}}{(25)(25)} = 16 \\times 10^8 \\]\n\\[ \\alpha = \\frac{1}{2RC} = \\frac{10^9}{(2)(400)(25)} = 5 \\times 10^4 \\, \\text{rad/s} \\]\n\nor\n\n\\[ \\alpha^2 = 25 \\times 10^8 \\]\n\nBecause \\( \\omega_0^2 < \\alpha^2 \\), the roots of the characteristic equation are real and distinct.

Thus \\( i_L(t) \\) takes the form of Eq. 8.47, namely,\n\n\\[ i_L = I_f + A_1' e^{s_1 t} + A_2' e^{s_2 t} \\]\n\nHence, from this solution, the two simultaneous equations that determine \\( A_1' \\) and \\( A_2' \\) are\n\n\\[ i_L(0) = I_f + A_1' + A_2' = 0 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{di_L}{dt}(0) = s_1 A_1' + s_2 A_2' = 0 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( A_1' \\) and \\( A_2' \\) gives\n\n\\[ A_1' = -32 \\, \\text{mA} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad A_2' = 8 \\, \\text{mA} \\]\n\nThe numerical solution for \\( i_L(t) \\) is\n\n\\[ i_L(t) = (24 - 32 e^{-20,000 t} + 8 e^{-80,000 t}) \\, \\text{mA}, \\quad t \\geq 0 \\]\n\n#### Example 8.7 Finding the Underdamped Step Response of a Parallel RLC Circuit\n\nThe resistor in the circuit in Example 8.6 (Fig. 8.12) is increased to \\( 625 \\Omega \\). Find \\( i_L(t) \\) for \\( t \\geq 0 \\).\n\n#### Solution\n\nBecause \\( L \\) and \\( C \\) remain fixed, \\( \\omega_0^2 \\) has the same value as in Example 8.6; that is, \\( \\omega_0^2 = 16 \\times 10^8 \\). Increasing \\( R \\) to \\( 625 \\Omega \\) decreases \\( \\alpha \\) to \\( 3.2 \\times 10^4 \\, \\text{rad/s} \\). With \\( \\omega_0^2 > \\alpha^2 \\), the roots of the characteristic equation are complex. Hence\n\n\\[ s_1 = -3.2 \\times 10^4 + j 2.4 \\times 10^4 \\, \\text{rad/s} \\]\n\\[ s_2 = -3.2 \\times 10^4 - j 2.4 \\times 10^4 \\, \\text{rad/s} \\]\n\nThe current response is now underdamped and given by Eq. 8.48:\n\n\\[ i_L(t) = I_f + B_1' e^{-\\alpha t} \\cos \\omega_d t + B_2' e^{-\\alpha t} \\sin \\omega_d t \\]\n\nHere, \\( \\alpha \\) is \\( 32,000 \\, \\text{rad/s} \\), \\( \\omega_d \\) is \\( 24,000 \\, \\text{rad/s} \\), and \\( I_f \\) is 24 mA.\n\nAs in Example 8.6, \\( B_1' \\) and \\( B_2' \\) are determined from the initial conditions. Thus the two simultaneous equations are\n\n\\[ i_L(0) = I_f + B_1' = 0 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{di_L}{dt}(0) = \\omega_d B_2' - \\alpha B_1' = 0 \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ B_1' = -24 \\, \\text{mA} \\]\n\nand\n\n\\[ B_2' = -32 \\, \\text{mA} \\]\n\nThe numerical solution for \\( i_L(t) \\) is\n\n\\[ i_L(t) = (24 - 24 e^{-32,000 t} \\cos 24,000 t - 32 e^{-32,000 t} \\sin 24,000 t) \\, \\text{mA}, \\quad t \\geq 0 \\]\n\n#### Example 8.8 Finding the Critically Damped Step Response of a Parallel RLC Circuit\n\nThe resistor in the circuit in Example 8.6 (Fig. 8.12) is set at \\( 500 \\Omega \\). Find \\( i_L \\) for \\( t \\geq 0 \\).\n\n#### Solution\n\nWe know that \\( \\omega_0^2 \\) remains at \\( 16 \\times 10^8 \\). With \\( R \\) set at \\( 500 \\Omega \\), \\( \\alpha \\) becomes \\( 4 \\times 10^4 \\, \\text{s}^{-1} \\), which corresponds to critical damping. Therefore, the solution for \\( i_L(t) \\) takes the form of Eq. 8.49:\n\n\\[ i_L(t) = I_f + D_1' t e^{-\\alpha t} + D_2' e^{-\\alpha t} \\]\n\nAgain, \\( D_1' \\) and \\( D_2' \\) are computed from initial conditions, or\n\n\\[ i_L(0) = I_f + D_2' = 0 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{di_L}{dt}(0) = D_1' - \\alpha D_2' = 0 \\]\n\nThus\n\n\\[ D_1' = -960,000 \\, \\text{mA/s} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad D_2' = -24 \\, \\text{mA} \\]\n\nThe numerical expression for \\( i_L(t) \\) is\n\n\\[ i_L(t) = (24 - 960,000 t e^{-40,000 t} - 24 e^{-40,000 t}) \\, \\text{mA}, t \\geq 0 \\]\n\n#### Example 8.9 Comparing the Three-Step Response Forms\n\na) Plot on a single graph, over a range from 0 to \\( 220 \\mu \\text{s} \\), the overdamped, underdamped, and critically damped responses derived in Examples 8.6-8.8.\nb) Use the plots of (a) to find the time required for \\( i_L \\) to reach \\( 90\\% \\) of its final value.\nc) Based on the results obtained in (b), which response would you specify in a design that prioritizes reaching \\( 90\\% \\) of the final value of the output in the shortest time?\nd) Which response would you specify in a design that must ensure that the final value of the current is never exceeded?\n\n#### Solution\n\na) See Fig. 8.13.\nb) The final value of \\( i_L \\) is 24 mA, so we can read the times off the plots corresponding to \\( i_L = 21.6 \\, \\text{mA} \\). Thus \\( t_{od} = 130 \\mu \\text{s} \\), \\( t_{cd} = 97 \\mu \\text{s} \\), and \\( t_{ud} = 74 \\mu \\text{s} \\).\nc) The underdamped response reaches \\( 90\\% \\) of the final value in the fastest time, so it is the desired response type when speed is the most important design specification.\nimage_name: Figure 8.13\ndescription: The graph shown is a time-domain waveform depicting the current, denoted as \\( i_L \\), measured in milliamperes (mA) over time \\( t \\), measured in microseconds (\\( \\mu s \\)). The graph illustrates the response of an electrical circuit to different damping conditions: underdamped, critically damped, and overdamped.\n\nd) From the plot, you can see that the underdamped response exceeds the final value of current, whereas neither the critically damped nor the overdamped response produces currents exceeding 24 mA. Although specifying either of the latter two responses would meet the design specification, it is best to use the overdamped response. It would be impractical to require a design to achieve the exact component values that ensure a critically damped response.\n\n#### Example 8.10 Finding Step Response of a Parallel RLC Circuit with Initial Stored Energy\n\nEnergy is stored in the circuit in Example 8.8 (Fig. 8.12, with \\( R = 500 \\Omega \\)) at the instant the DC current source is applied. The initial current in the inductor is 29 mA, and the initial voltage across the capacitor is 50 V. Find (a) \\( i_L(0) \\); (b) \\( \\frac{di_L(0)}{dt} \\); (c) \\( i_L(t) \\) for \\( t \\geq 0 \\); (d) \\( v(t) \\) for \\( t \\geq 0^+ \\).\n\n#### Solution\n\na) There cannot be an instantaneous change of current in an inductor, so the initial value of \\( i_L \\) in the first instant after the DC current source has been applied must be 29 mA.\nb) The capacitor holds the initial voltage across the inductor to 50 V. Therefore\n\n\\[ L \\frac{di_L}{dt}(0^+) = 50 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{di_L}{dt}(0^+) = \\frac{50}{25} \\times 10^3 = 2000 \\, \\text{A/s} \\]\n\nc) From the solution of Example 8.8, we know that the current response is critically damped.

It is uncertain whether energy is pre-stored in the circuit at the time of current source application. This scenario is depicted in Fig. 8.11. For a systematic method to derive the step response of a second-order circuit, we concentrate on the current flowing through the inductive branch, denoted as \\( i_L \\). This current is noteworthy as it does not diminish to zero as time \\( t \\) progresses. Instead, after the switch has been open for an extended period, the inductor current becomes equal to the DC source current \\( I \\). For our focus on the methodology to determine the step response, we consider the initial energy within the circuit to be zero.

Before demonstrating how to solve this equation directly, we first find the solution indirectly. Once we have the solution for this equation, explaining the direct approach will be clearer.\n\nIndirect Approach\n\nWe can find \\( i_L \\) indirectly by first determining the voltage \\( v \\). This is achieved using techniques introduced in Section 8.2, since the differential equation that \\( v \\) must satisfy is identical to equation 8.3. To see this, we revisit equation 8.37 and express \\( i_L \\) as a function of \\( v \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{L} \\int_0^t v d\\tau + \\frac{v}{R} + C \\frac{dv}{dt} = I \\]\n\nDifferentiating this equation once with respect to \\( t \\) results in the right-hand side being zero because \\( I \\) is a constant:\n\n\\[ \\frac{v}{L} + \\frac{1}{R} \\frac{dv}{dt} + C \\frac{d^2v}{dt^2} = 0 \\]\n\nor\n\n\\[ \\frac{d^2v}{dt^2} + \\frac{1}{RC} \\frac{dv}{dt} + \\frac{v}{LC} = 0 \\]\n\nAs discussed in Section 8.2, the solution for \\( v \\) depends on the roots of the characteristic equation. Thus, the three potential solutions are:\n\n\\[ v = A_1 e^{s_1 t} + A_2 e^{s_2 t} \\]\n\\[ v = B_1 e^{-\\alpha t} \\cos \\omega_d t + B_2 e^{-\\alpha t} \\sin \\omega_d t \\]\n\\[ v = D_1 t e^{-\\alpha t} + D_2 e^{-\\alpha t} \\]\n\nCaution: Due to the presence of a source in the circuit for \\( t > 0 \\), you must consider the source current's value at \\( t = 0^+ \\) when evaluating the coefficients in these equations.\n\nTo find the three potential solutions for \\( i_L \\), we substitute these equations into equation 8.37. After doing so, it can be verified that the three solutions for \\( i_L \\) will be:\n\n\\[ i_L = I + A_1' e^{s_1 t} + A_2' e^{s_2 t} \\]\n\\[ i_L = I + B_1' e^{-\\alpha t} \\cos \\omega_d t + B_2' e^{-\\alpha t} \\sin \\omega_d t \\]\n\\[ i_L = I + D_1' t e^{-\\alpha t} + D_2' e^{-\\alpha t} \\]\n\nwhere \\( A_1', A_2', B_1', B_2', D_1', D_2' \\) are arbitrary constants. In each case, these primed constants can be found indirectly in terms of the arbitrary constants associated with the voltage solution, although this method is somewhat awkward.\n\nDirect Approach\n\nA more straightforward method is to find the primed constants directly in terms of the initial values of the response function.

The circuit may or may not contain stored energy upon the application of the current source. The associated task is illustrated in Figure 8.11. To establish a general method for calculating the step response of a second-order circuit, we concentrate on determining the current through the inductive branch ($i_{L}$). This current is significant because it does not decay to zero as time ($t$) progresses. Eventually, after the switch has been open for a considerable duration, the inductor current becomes equal to the direct current source current ($I$). In order to concentrate on the method for determining the step response, we assume that the circuit starts with zero stored energy. This assumption streamlines the calculations without altering the fundamental process. We will see in Example 8.10 how the presence of initially stored energy affects the general procedure.\n\nTo determine the inductor current ($i_{L}$), one must solve a second-order differential equation set equal to the forcing function ($I$), which we derive as follows. According to Kirchhoff's current law, we have\n\n$$\ni_{L}+i_{R}+i_{C}=I\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{L}+\\frac{v}{R}+C \\frac{d v}{d t}=I \\tag{8.37}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv=L \\frac{d i_{L}}{d t} \\tag{8.38}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwe obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{d v}{d t}=L \\frac{d^{2} i_{L}}{d t^{2}} \\tag{8.39}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSubstituting Eqs. 8.38 and 8.39 into Eq. 8.37 yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{L}+\\frac{L}{R} \\frac{d i_{L}}{d t}+L C \\frac{d^{2} i_{L}}{d t^{2}}=I \\tag{8.40}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nTo facilitate calculations, we divide the equation by $L C$ and reorganize the terms:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{d^{2} i_{L}}{d t^{2}}+\\frac{1}{R C} \\frac{d i_{L}}{d t}+\\frac{i_{L}}{L C}=\\frac{I}{L C} \\tag{8.41}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nComparing Eq. 8.41 with Eq. 8.3 demonstrates that the presence of a non-zero term on the right-hand side of the equation changes the nature of the task. Before presenting the direct method for solving Eq. 8.41, we obtain the solution indirectly. Once we know the solution to Eq. 8.41, explaining the direct method will be more straightforward.\n\nThe Indirect Method\n\nWe can find $i_{L}$ indirectly by first calculating the voltage ($v$). We do this using the techniques introduced in Section 8.2, as the differential equation that $v$ must satisfy is identical to Eq. 8.3. To see this, we simply return to Eq. 8.37 and express $i_{L}$ in terms of $v$; hence\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{1}{L} \\int_{0}^{t} v d \\tau+\\frac{v}{R}+C \\frac{d v}{d t}=I \\tag{8.42}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nDifferentiating Eq. 8.42 with respect to $t$ once eliminates the right-hand side because $I$ is constant. Therefore\n\n$$\n\\frac{v}{L}+\\frac{1}{R} \\frac{d v}{d t}+C \\frac{d^{2} v}{d t^{2}}=0\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{d^{2} v}{d t^{2}}+\\frac{1}{R C} \\frac{d v}{d t}+\\frac{v}{L C}=0 \\tag{8.43}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAs discussed in Section 8.2, the solution for $v$ depends on the roots of the characteristic equation. Therefore, the three possible solutions are\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& v=A_{1} e^{s_{1} t}+A_{2} e^{s_{2} t}  \\tag{8.44}\\\\\n& v=B_{1} e^{-\\alpha t} \\cos \\omega_{d} t+B_{2} e^{-\\alpha t} \\sin \\omega_{d} t  \\tag{8.45}\\\\\n& v=D_{1} t e^{-\\alpha t}+D_{2} e^{-\\alpha t} \\tag{8.46}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nA note of caution: Due to the presence of a source in the circuit after $t>0$, you must consider the source current's value at $t=0^{+}$ when evaluating the coefficients in Eqs. 8.44-8.46.\n\nTo find the three possible solutions for $i_{L}$, we substitute Eqs. 8.44-8.46 into Eq. 8.37. You should be able to verify that the three solutions for $i_{L}$ will be\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& i_{L}=I+A_{1}^{\\prime} e^{s_{1} t}+A_{2}^{\\prime} e^{s_{2} t}  \\tag{8.47}\\\\\n& i_{L}=I+B_{1}^{\\prime} e^{-\\alpha t} \\cos \\omega_{d} t+B_{2}^{\\prime} e^{-\\alpha t} \\sin \\omega_{d} t  \\tag{8.48}\\\\\n& i_{L}=I+D_{1}^{\\prime} t e^{-\\alpha t}+D_{2}^{\\prime} e^{-\\alpha t} \\tag{8.49}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere $A_{1}^{\\prime}, A_{2}^{\\prime}, B_{1}^{\\prime}, B_{2}^{\\prime}, D_{1}^{\\prime}$, and $D_{2}^{\\prime}$ are arbitrary constants. In each case, the primed constants can be found indirectly in terms of the arbitrary constants associated with the voltage solution, although this method is complicated.\n\nThe Direct Method\n\nFinding the primed constants directly in relation to the initial values of the response function is much easier. For the circuit being considered, we determine the primed constants from $i_{L}(0)$ and $\\frac{d i_{L}}{d t}(0)$.\n\nThe solution for a second-order differential equation with a constant forcing function is the sum of the forced response and a response function identical in form to the natural response. Therefore, we can always express the solution for the step response in the form\n\n$$\ni=I_{f}+\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text { function of the same form }  \\tag{8.50}\\\\\n\\text { as the natural response }\n\\end{array}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nv=V_{f}+\\left\\{\\begin{array}{r}\n\\text { function of the same form }  \\tag{8.51}\\\\\n\\text { as the natural response }\n\\end{array}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nwhere $I_{f}$ and $V_{f}$ denote the final value of the response function. The final value may be zero, as was the case with the voltage $v$ in the circuit depicted in Figure 8.8.\n\nExamples 8.6-8.10 demonstrate the technique of finding the step response of a parallel $R L C$ circuit using the direct method.\n\n#### Example 8.6 Finding the Overdamped Step Response of a Parallel RLC Circuit\n\nThe circuit in Figure 8.12 has zero stored energy before the application of the direct current source at $t=0$. A 24 mA direct current source is connected to the circuit.

The resistor has a value of 400 Ω.\nFigure 8.12 A The circuit for Example 8.6.\n\n#### Solution\n\na) No energy is stored in the circuit before the application of the direct current source, so the initial current in the inductor is zero. The inductor prevents an immediate change in inductor current; thus $i_{L}(0)=0$ right after the switch is opened.\nb) The initial voltage on the capacitor is zero before the switch is opened; therefore, it remains zero right after. Now, because $v=L \\frac{d i_{L}}{d t}$,\n\n$$\n\\frac{d i_{L}}{d t}\\left(0^{+}\\right)=0\n$$\n\nc) From the circuit elements, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\omega_{0}^{2} & =\\frac{1}{L C}=\\frac{10^{12}}{(25)(25)}=16 \\times 10^{8} \\\\\n\\alpha & =\\frac{1}{2 R C}=\\frac{10^{9}}{(2)(400)(25)}=5 \\times 10^{4} \\mathrm{rad} / \\mathrm{s}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\alpha^{2}=25 \\times 10^{8}\n$$\n\nBecause $\\omega_{0}^{2}<\\alpha^{2}$, the roots of the characteristic equation are real and distinct. Thus\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& s_{1}=-5 \\times 10^{4}+3 \\times 10^{4}=-20,000 \\mathrm{rad} / \\mathrm{s} \\\\\n& s_{2}=-5 \\times 10^{4}-3 \\times 10^{4}=-80,000 \\mathrm{rad} / \\mathrm{s}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nd) Since the roots of the characteristic equation are real and distinct, the inductor current response will be overdamped. Therefore, $i_{L}(t)$ follows the form of Eq. 8.47, which is\n\n$$\ni_{L}=I_{f}+A_{1}^{\\prime} e^{s_{1} t}+A_{2}^{\\prime} e^{s_{2} t}\n$$\nInductor current in overdamped parallel RLC circuit step response\n\nHence, the two simultaneous equations that determine $A_{1}^{\\prime}$ and $A_{2}^{\\prime}$ are\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ni_{L}(0) & =I_{f}+A_{1}^{\\prime}+A_{2}^{\\prime}=0 \\\\\n\\frac{d i_{L}}{d t}(0) & =s_{1} A_{1}^{\\prime}+s_{2} A_{2}^{\\prime}=0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSolving for $A_{1}^{\\prime}$ and $A_{2}^{\\prime}$ gives\n\n$$\nA_{1}^{\\prime}=-32 \\mathrm{~mA} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad A_{2}^{\\prime}=8 \\mathrm{~mA}\n$$\n\nThe numerical solution for $i_{L}(t)$ is\n\n$$\ni_{L}(t)=\\left(24-32 e^{-20,000 t}+8 e^{-80,000 t}\\right) \\mathrm{mA}, \\quad t \\geq 0\n```\n\nThe rephrased text:\n```\nDetermining the step response of a parallel $R L C$ circuit entails identifying the voltage across the parallel segments or the current through each segment in response to a sudden injection of a direct current source. The circuit may or may not have energy stored at the moment the current source is activated. The pertinent task is depicted in Figure 8.11. To establish a general approach for computing the step response of a second-order circuit, we focus on identifying the current in the inductive branch ($i_{L}$). This current holds importance since it does not diminish to zero with the passage of time ($t$). Eventually, following a prolonged period with the switch open, the inductor current matches the direct current source current ($I$). To concentrate on the methodology for ascertaining the step response, we premise the circuit to have zero initial energy stored. This premise simplifies the computation without compromising the essential process. We will illustrate in Example 8.10 how the presence of initially stored energy impacts the overall process.\n\nTo ascertain the inductor current ($i_{L}$), one must resolve a second-order differential equation equated to the forcing function ($I$), which we derive as follows.

    "text": "Determining the step response of a parallel $R L C$ circuit requires calculating the voltage across each parallel branch or the current through the individual branches following the abrupt application of a direct current source. It's possible that the circuit may or may not have stored energy at the moment the current source is activated. The analysis pertains to the circuit depicted in Fig. 8.11. To establish a universal method for calculating the step response of a second-order circuit, we concentrate on the current flowing through the inductive branch, $i_{L}$, as it does not diminish to zero over time. Eventually, after the switch has been open for an extended period, the inductor current stabilizes at the current source's value, $I$. Assuming that no initial energy is stored in the circuit simplifies our calculations without altering the fundamental process. Example 8.10 will demonstrate how initial stored energy affects the overall procedure.\n\nTo calculate the inductor current, $i_{L}$, it's necessary to solve a second-order differential equation that equates to the driving function $I$. We derive this equation as follows. By Kirchhoff's current law, we have\n\n$$\ni_{L}+i_{R}+i_{C}=I\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{L}+\\frac{v}{R}+C \\frac{d v}{d t}=I \\tag{8.37}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nGiven that\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv=L \\frac{d i_{L}}{d t} \\tag{8.38}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwe derive\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{d v}{d t}=L \\frac{d^{2} i_{L}}{d t^{2}} \\tag{8.39}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSubstituting Eqs. 8.38 and 8.39 into Eq. 8.37 yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{L}+\\frac{L}{R} \\frac{d i_{L}}{d t}+L C \\frac{d^{2} i_{L}}{d t^{2}}=I \\tag{8.40}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor convenience, we divide through by $L C$ and rearrange terms to obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{d^{2} i_{L}}{d t^{2}}+\\frac{1}{R C} \\frac{d i_{L}}{d t}+\\frac{i_{L}}{L C}=\\frac{I}{L C} \\tag{8.41}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nComparing Eq. 8.41 with Eq. 8.3 reveals that the non-zero term on the right-hand side modifies the equation. Before explaining how to solve Eq. 8.41 directly, we'll first find the solution indirectly, making the direct method clearer once the indirect solution is known.\n\nThe Indirect Approach\n\nThe inductor current, $i_{L}$, can be found indirectly by first determining the voltage, $v$. We employ the techniques introduced in Section 8.2 because the differential equation $v$ must satisfy is the same as Eq. 8.3. To illustrate this, we refer back to Eq. 8.37 and express $i_{L}$ in terms of $v$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{1}{L} \\int_{0}^{t} v d \\tau+\\frac{v}{R}+C \\frac{d v}{d t}=I \\tag{8.42}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nDifferentiating Eq. 8.42 once with respect to $t$ results in the right-hand side being zero because $I$ is constant. Therefore, we have\n\n$$\n\\frac{v}{L}+\\frac{1}{R} \\frac{d v}{d t}+C \\frac{d^{2} v}{d t^{2}}=0\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{d^{2} v}{d t^{2}}+\\frac{1}{R C} \\frac{d v}{d t}+\\frac{v}{L C}=0 \\tag{8.43}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAs discussed in Section 8.2, the solution for $v$ depends on the roots of the characteristic equation. Thus, the three possible solutions are\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& v=A_{1} e^{s_{1} t}+A_{2} e^{s_{2} t}  \\tag{8.44}\\\\\n& v=B_{1} e^{-\\alpha t} \\cos \\omega_{d} t+B_{2} e^{-\\alpha t} \\sin \\omega_{d} t  \\tag{8.45}\\\\\n& v=D_{1} t e^{-\\alpha t}+D_{2} e^{-\\alpha t} \\tag{8.46}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nCaution: Since there is a source in the circuit for $t>0$, the value of the source current at $t=0^{+}$ must be considered when evaluating the coefficients in Eqs. 8.44-8.46.\n\nTo find the three possible solutions for $i_{L}$, we substitute Eqs. 8.44-8.46 into Eq. 8.37. It can be confirmed that the three solutions for $i_{L}$ are\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& i_{L}=I+A_{1}^{\\prime} e^{s_{1} t}+A_{2}^{\\prime} e^{s_{2} t}  \\tag{8.47}\\\\\n& i_{L}=I+B_{1}^{\\prime} e^{-\\alpha t} \\cos \\omega_{d} t+B_{2}^{\\prime} e^{-\\alpha t} \\sin \\omega_{d} t  \\tag{8.48}\\\\\n& i_{L}=I+D_{1}^{\\prime} t e^{-\\alpha t}+D_{2}^{\\prime} e^{-\\alpha t} \\tag{8.49}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere $A_{1}^{\\prime}, A_{2}^{\\prime}, B_{1}^{\\prime}, B_{2}^{\\prime}, D_{1}^{\\prime}$, and $D_{2}^{\\prime}$ are arbitrary constants. In each case, the primed constants can be found indirectly in terms of the arbitrary constants associated with the voltage solution, though this method is tedious.\n\nThe Direct Approach\n\nA more straightforward method is to find the primed constants directly in terms of the initial values of the response function. For the circuit under discussion, these constants would be determined from $i_{L}(0)$ and $\\frac{d i_{L}(0)}{d t}$.\n\nThe solution for a second-order differential equation with a constant forcing function is the sum of the forced response and a response function identical in form to the natural response. Hence, we can always represent the step response solution in the form\n\n$$\ni=I_{f}+\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text { function of the same form }  \\tag{8.50}\\\\\n\\text { as the natural response }\n\\end{array}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nv=V_{f}+\\left\\{\\begin{array}{r}\n\\text { function of the same form }  \\tag{8.51}\\\\\n\\text { as the natural response }\n\\end{array}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nwhere $I_{f}$ and $V_{f}$ denote the final values of the response function. The final value might be zero, as was the case with the voltage $v$ in the circuit of Fig. 8.8.\n\nExamples 8.6-8.10 demonstrate the technique for finding the step response of a parallel $R L C$ circuit using the direct approach.\n\n#### Example 8.6 Finding the Overdamped Step Response of a Parallel RLC Circuit\n\nIn the circuit of Fig. 8.12, no energy is stored before the application of the dc current source. At $t=0$, a 24 mA dc current source is activated. The resistor's value is $400 \\Omega$.\na) What is the initial value of $i_{L}$ ?\nb) What is the initial value of $\\frac{d i_{L}}{d t}$ ?\nc) What are the roots of the characteristic equation?\nd) What is the numerical expression for $i_{L}(t)$ when $t \\geq 0$ ?\n\nFigure 8.12 A depicts the circuit for Example 8.6.\n\n#### Solution\n\na) Since no energy is stored in the circuit before the dc current source is applied, the initial current through the inductor is zero. The inductor prevents an instantaneous change in current; hence, $i_{L}(0)=0$ immediately after the switch is opened.\nb) The initial voltage across the capacitor is zero before the switch is opened, so it remains zero immediately after. Since $v=L \\frac{d i_{L}}{d t}$,\n\n$$\n\\frac{d i_{L}}{d t}\\left(0^{+}\\right)=0\n$$\n\nc) From the circuit elements, we derive\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\omega_{0}^{2} & =\\frac{1}{L C}=\\frac{10^{12}}{(25)(25)}=16 \\times 10^{8} \\\\\n\\alpha & =\\frac{1}{2 R C}=\\frac{10^{9}}{(2)(400)(25)}=5 \\times 10^{4} \\mathrm{rad} / \\mathrm{s}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\alpha^{2}=25 \\times 10^{8}\n$$\n\nAs $\\omega_{0}^{2}<\\alpha^{2}$, the characteristic equation's roots are real and distinct. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& s_{1}=-5 \\times 10^{4}+3 \\times 10^{4}=-20,000 \\mathrm{rad} / \\mathrm{s} \\\\\n& s_{2}=-5 \\times 10^{4}-3 \\times 10^{4}=-80,000 \\mathrm{rad} / \\mathrm{s}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nd) With real and distinct roots, the inductor current response is overdamped. Thus, $i_{L}(t)$ follows the form of Eq. 8.47:\n\n$$\ni_{L}=I_{f}+A_{1}^{\\prime} e^{s_{1} t}+A_{2}^{\\prime} e^{s_{2} t}\n$$\n\nThe simultaneous equations to determine $A_{1}^{\\prime}$ and $A_{2}^{\\prime}$ are\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ni_{L}(0) & =I_{f}+A_{1}^{\\prime}+A_{2}^{\\prime}=0 \\\\\n\\frac{d i_{L}}{d t}(0) & =s_{1} A_{1}^{\\prime}+s_{2} A_{2}^{\\prime}=0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSolving for $A_{1}^{\\prime}$ and $A_{2}^{\\prime}$ yields\n\n$$\nA_{1}^{\\prime}=-32 \\mathrm{~mA} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad A_{2}^{\\prime}=8 \\mathrm{~mA}\n$$\n\nHence, the numerical solution for $i_{L}(t)$ is\n\n$$\ni_{L}(t)=\\left(24-32 e^{-20,000 t}+8 e^{-80,000 t}\\right) \\mathrm{mA}, \\quad t \\geq 0\n$$\n\n#### Example 8.7 Finding the Underdamped Step Response of a Parallel RLC Circuit\n\nThe resistor in the circuit of Example 8.6 (Fig. 8.12) is increased to $625 \\Omega$. Find $i_{L}(t)$ for $t \\geq 0$.\n\n#### Solution\n\nWith $L$ and $C$ unchanged, $\\omega_{0}^{2}$ remains the same as in Example 8.6, i.e., $\\omega_{0}^{2}=16 \\times 10^{8}$. Increasing $R$ to $625 \\Omega$ reduces $\\alpha$ to $3.2 \\times 10^{4} \\mathrm{rad} / \\mathrm{s}$. Since $\\omega_{0}^{2}>\\alpha^{2}$, the characteristic equation's roots are complex. Thus,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& s_{1}=-3.2 \\times 10^{4}+j 2.4 \\times 10^{4} \\mathrm{rad} / \\mathrm{s} \\\\\n& s_{2}=-3.2 \\times 10^{4}-j 2.4 \\times 10^{4} \\mathrm{rad} / \\mathrm{s}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe current response is now underdamped and follows Eq. 8.48:\n\n$$\ni_{L}(t)=I_{f}+B_{1}^{\\prime} e^{-\\alpha t} \\cos \\omega_{d} t+B_{2}^{\\prime} e^{-\\alpha t} \\sin \\omega_{d} t\n$$\n\nHere, $\\alpha$ is $32,000 \\mathrm{rad} / \\mathrm{s}$, $\\omega_{d}$ is $24,000 \\mathrm{rad} / \\mathrm{s}$, and $I_{f}$ is 24 mA.\n\nSimilar to Example 8.6, $B_{1}^{\\prime}$ and $B_{2}^{\\prime}$ are determined from the initial conditions. The simultaneous equations are\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\ni_{L}(0)=I_{f}+B_{1}^{\\prime}=0 \\\\\n\\frac{d i_{L}}{d t}(0)=\\omega_{d} B_{2}^{\\prime}-\\alpha B_{1}^{\\prime}=0\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\nB_{1}^{\\prime}=-24 \\mathrm{~mA}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nB_{2}^{\\prime}=-32 \\mathrm{~mA}\n$$\n\nThe numerical solution for $i_{L}(t)$ is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ni_{L}(t)= & \\left(24-24 e^{-32,000 t} \\cos 24,000 t\\right. \\\\\n& \\left.-32 e^{-32,000 t} \\sin 24,000 t\\right) \\mathrm{mA}, \\quad t \\geq 0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n#### Example 8.8 Finding the Critically Damped Step Response of a Parallel RLC Circuit\n\nThe resistor in the circuit of Example 8.6 (Fig. 8.12) is set at $500 \\Omega$. Find $i_{L}$ for $t \\geq 0$.\n\n#### Solution\n\n$\\omega_{0}^{2}$ remains at $16 \\times 10^{8}$ as in Example 8.6. With $R$ set at $500 \\Omega$, $\\alpha$ becomes $4 \\times 10^{4} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$, corresponding to critical damping. Therefore, the solution for $i_{L}(t)$ follows the form of Eq. 8.49:\n\n$$\ni_{L}(t)=I_{f}+D_{1}^{\\prime} t e^{-\\alpha t}+D_{2}^{\\prime} e^{-\\alpha t}\n$$\n\nAgain, $D_{1}^{\\prime}$ and $D_{2}^{\\prime}$ are calculated from the initial conditions:\n\n$$\ni_{L}(0)=I_{f}+D_{2}^{\\prime}=0\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{d i_{L}}{d t}(0)=D_{1}^{\\prime}-\\alpha D_{2}^{\\prime}=0\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\nD_{1}^{\\prime}=-960,000 \\mathrm{~mA} / \\mathrm{s} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad D_{2}^{\\prime}=-24 \\mathrm{~mA}\n$$\n\nThe numerical expression for $i_{L}(t)$ is\n\n$$\ni_{L}(t)=\\left(24-960,000 t e^{-40,000 t}-24 e^{-40,000 t}\\right) \\mathrm{mA}, t \\geq 0\n$$\n\n#### Example 8.9 Comparing the Three-Step Response Forms\n\na) Plot on a single graph, over a range from 0 to $220 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$, the overdamped, underdamped, and critically damped responses derived in Examples 8.6-8.8.\nb) Use the plots of (a) to find the time required for $i_{L}$ to reach $90 \\%$ of its final value.\nc) Based on the results from (b), which response would you choose for a design prioritizing reaching $90 \\%$ of the final value in the shortest time?\nd) Which response would you choose for a design that must ensure the final current value is never exceeded?\n\n#### Solution\n\na) See Fig. 8.13.\nb) The final value of $i_{L}$ is 24 mA, so we can read the times off the plots corresponding to $i_{L}=21.6 \\mathrm{~mA}$. Thus, $t_{o d}=130 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$, $t_{c d}=97 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$, and $t_{u d}=74 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$.\nc) The underdamped response reaches $90 \\%$ of the final value most quickly, making it the preferred choice when speed is the primary design consideration.\nd) The underdamped response overshoots the final value, whereas neither the critically damped nor the overdamped response exceeds 24 mA. Although either of the latter responses would meet the design specification, the overdamped response is more practical, as achieving the precise component values required for a critically damped response is often impractical.\n\n#### Example 8.10 Finding Step Response of a Parallel RLC Circuit with Initial Stored Energy\n\nIn the circuit of Example 8.8 (Fig. 8.12, with $R="

    "text": "To determine the step response of a parallel RLC circuit, we need to calculate the voltage across the parallel branches or the current through each branch due to the sudden application of a DC current source. The circuit may or may not have energy stored at the time the current source is applied. The problem is illustrated by the circuit shown in Fig. 8.11. To establish a general method for finding the step response of a second-order circuit, we concentrate on determining the current through the inductive branch (i_L). This current is particularly significant because it does not decay to zero as time increases. Instead, after the switch has been open for a long time, the inductor current equals the DC source current I. Since we are focusing on the method for finding the step response, we assume that there is no initial energy stored in the circuit. This simplifies the calculations without changing the fundamental process. In Example 8.10, we will see how the presence of initially stored energy fits into the general procedure.\n\nTo find the inductor current i_L, we must solve a second-order differential equation equated to the forcing function I, which we derive as follows. According to Kirchhoff's current law, we have\n\n$$\ni_L + i_R + i_C = I\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\ni_L + \\frac{v}{R} + C \\frac{dv}{dt} = I \\tag{8.37}\n$$\n\nBecause\n\n$$\nv = L \\frac{di_L}{dt} \\tag{8.38}\n$$\n\nwe get\n\n$$\n\\frac{dv}{dt} = L \\frac{d^2i_L}{dt^2} \\tag{8.39}\n$$\n\nSubstituting Eqs. 8.38 and 8.39 into Eq. 8.37 gives\n\n$$\ni_L + \\frac{L}{R} \\frac{di_L}{dt} + LC \\frac{d^2i_L}{dt^2} = I \\tag{8.40}\n$$\n\nFor convenience, we divide through by LC and rearrange terms:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d^2i_L}{dt^2} + \\frac{1}{RC} \\frac{di_L}{dt} + \\frac{i_L}{LC} = \\frac{I}{LC} \\tag{8.41}\n$$\n\nComparing Eq. 8.41 with Eq. 8.3 shows that the presence of a nonzero term on the right-hand side of the equation changes the problem. Before showing how to solve Eq. 8.41 directly, we first obtain the solution indirectly. Once we know the solution to Eq. 8.41, explaining the direct approach will be easier.\n\nThe Indirect Approach\n\nWe can solve for i_L indirectly by first finding the voltage v. We do this with the techniques introduced in Section 8.2, because the differential equation that v must satisfy is the same as Eq. 8.3. To see this, we simply return to Eq. 8.37 and express i_L as a function of v; thus\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{L} \\int_0^t v d\\tau + \\frac{v}{R} + C \\frac{dv}{dt} = I \\tag{8.42}\n$$\n\nDifferentiating Eq. 8.42 once with respect to t reduces the right-hand side to zero because I is a constant.

    "text": "In order to determine the step response of a parallel $R L C$ circuit, it's necessary to calculate the voltage across the parallel branches or the current within each branch when a direct current source is abruptly activated. The circuit may or may not have stored energy at the moment the current source is activated. The representation of this task is depicted in Fig. 8.11. To establish a universal methodology for determining the step response of a second-order circuit, we concentrate on calculating the current in the inductive branch, $\\left(i_{L}\\right)$. This current is significant as it does not diminish to zero as time ($t$) progresses. Instead, after the switch has been open for an extended period, the inductor current becomes equivalent to the direct current source current $I$. To focus on the methodology for finding the step response, we assume that the initial energy stored in the circuit is zero. This simplifies the calculations without changing the fundamental process involved. In Example 8.10, we will see how the presence of initially stored energy fits into the general procedure.\n\nTo calculate the inductor current $i_{L}$, we need to solve a second-order differential equation that equates to the forcing function $I$. We derive this as follows, starting with Kirchhoff's current law:\n\n$$\ni_{L}+i_{R}+i_{C}=I\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{L}+\\frac{v}{R}+C \\frac{d v}{d t}=I \\tag{8.37}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nSince\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nv=L \\frac{d i_{L}}{d t} \\tag{8.38}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwe obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{d v}{d t}=L \\frac{d^{2} i_{L}}{d t^{2}} \\tag{8.39}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nBy substituting Eqs. 8.38 and 8.39 into Eq. 8.37, we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\ni_{L}+\\frac{L}{R} \\frac{d i_{L}}{d t}+L C \\frac{d^{2} i_{L}}{d t^{2}}=I \\tag{8.40}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nFor convenience, we divide through by $L C$ and rearrange terms:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{d^{2} i_{L}}{d t^{2}}+\\frac{1}{R C} \\frac{d i_{L}}{d t}+\\frac{i_{L}}{L C}=\\frac{I}{L C} \\tag{8.41}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nBy comparing Eq. 8.41 with Eq. 8.3, we see that the presence of a nonzero term on the right-hand side of the equation modifies the task. Before demonstrating how to solve Eq. 8.41 directly, we first obtain the solution indirectly. Once we have the solution of Eq. 8.41, explaining the direct approach will be clearer.\n\nThe Indirect Approach\n\nWe can solve for $i_{L}$ indirectly by initially finding the voltage $v$. We use the techniques introduced in Section 8.2, as the differential equation that $v$ must satisfy is the same as Eq. 8.3. To see this, we revisit Eq. 8.37 and express $i_{L}$ as a function of $v$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{1}{L} \\int_{0}^{t} v d \\tau+\\frac{v}{R}+C \\frac{d v}{d t}=I \\tag{8.42}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nDifferentiating Eq. 8.42 once with respect to $t$ eliminates the right-hand side because $I$ is a constant. Hence\n\n$$\n\\frac{v}{L}+\\frac{1}{R} \\frac{d v}{d t}+C \\frac{d^{2} v}{d t^{2}}=0\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{d^{2} v}{d t^{2}}+\\frac{1}{R C} \\frac{d v}{d t}+\\frac{v}{L C}=0 \\tag{8.43}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAs discussed in Section 8.2, the solution for $v$ depends on the roots of the characteristic equation. Therefore, the three possible solutions are\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& v=A_{1} e^{s_{1} t}+A_{2} e^{s_{2} t}  \\tag{8.44}\\\\\n& v=B_{1} e^{-\\alpha t} \\cos \\omega_{d} t+B_{2} e^{-\\alpha t} \\sin \\omega_{d} t  \\tag{8.45}\\\\\n& v=D_{1} t e^{-\\alpha t}+D_{2} e^{-\\alpha t} \\tag{8.46}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nA word of caution: Due to the presence of a source in the circuit for $t>0$, you must consider the value of the source current at $t=0^{+}$ when evaluating the coefficients in Eqs. 8.44-8.46.\n\nTo find the three possible solutions for $i_{L}$, we substitute Eqs. 8.44-8.46 into Eq. 8.37. After doing this, you should be able to confirm that the three solutions for $i_{L}$ will be\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& i_{L}=I+A_{1}^{\\prime} e^{s_{1} t}+A_{2}^{\\prime} e^{s_{2} t}  \\tag{8.47}\\\\\n& i_{L}=I+B_{1}^{\\prime} e^{-\\alpha t} \\cos \\omega_{d} t+B_{2}^{\\prime} e^{-\\alpha t} \\sin \\omega_{d} t  \\tag{8.48}\\\\\n& i_{L}=I+D_{1}^{\\prime} t e^{-\\alpha t}+D_{2}^{\\prime} e^{-\\alpha t} \\tag{8.49}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere $A_{1}^{\\prime}, A_{2}^{\\prime}, B_{1}^{\\prime}, B_{2}^{\\prime}, D_{1}^{\\prime}$, and $D_{2}^{\\prime}$ are arbitrary constants. In each case, the primed constants can be found indirectly in terms of the arbitrary constants associated with the voltage solution. However, this approach is cumbersome.\n\nThe Direct Approach\n\nA more straightforward method is to find the primed constants directly in terms of the initial values of the response function. For the circuit in question, we would determine the primed constants from $i_{L}(0)$ and $d i_{L}(0) / d t$.\n\nThe solution for a second-order differential equation with a constant forcing function is the sum of the forced response and a response function identical in form to the natural response. Thus, we can always express the solution for the step response as\n\n$$\ni=I_{f}+\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text { function of the same form }  \\tag{8.50}\\\\\n\\text { as the natural response }\n\\end{array}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nv=V_{f}+\\left\\{\\begin{array}{r}\n\\text { function of the same form }  \\tag{8.51}\\\\\n\\text { as the natural response }\n\\end{array}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nwhere $I_{f}$ and $V_{f}$ represent the final value of the response function. The final value may be zero, as was the case with the voltage $v$ in the circuit in Fig. 8.8.\n\nExamples 8.6-8.10 demonstrate the technique of finding the step response of a parallel $R L C$ circuit using the direct approach.\n\n#### Example 8.6: Finding the Overdamped Step Response of a Parallel RLC Circuit\n\nThe initial energy stored in the circuit in Fig. 8.12 is zero.

The switch SW1 is initially open. The initial energy stored in the circuit is zero. The resistor has a value of 400 Ω.\nFigure 8.12 A The circuit for Example 8.6.\n\n#### Solution\n\na) With no energy stored in the circuit before the application of the dc current source, the initial current in the inductor is zero. The inductor prevents an instantaneous change in inductor current; thus $i_{L}(0)=0$ immediately after the switch is opened.\nb) The initial voltage across the capacitor is zero before the switch is opened; hence it remains zero immediately after. Now, because $v=L d i_{L} / d t$,\n\n$$\n\\frac{d i_{L}}{d t}\\left(0^{+}\\right)=0\n$$\n\nc) From the circuit elements, we calculate\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\omega_{0}^{2} & =\\frac{1}{L C}=\\frac{10^{12}}{(25)(25)}=16 \\times 10^{8} \\\\\n\\alpha & =\\frac{1}{2 R C}=\\frac{10^{9}}{(2)(400)(25)}=5 \\times 10^{4} \\mathrm{rad} / \\mathrm{s}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\alpha^{2}=25 \\times 10^{8}\n$$\n\nSince $\\omega_{0}^{2}<\\alpha^{2}$, the roots of the characteristic equation are real and distinct.

Find $i_{L}(t)$ for $t \\geq 0$.\n\n#### Solution\n\nWith $L$ and $C$ unchanged, $\\omega_{0}^{2}$ retains the same value as in Example 8.6; that is, $\\omega_{0}^{2}=16 \\times 10^{8}$. Increasing $R$ to $625 \\Omega$ reduces $\\alpha$ to $3.2 \\times 10^{4} \\mathrm{rad} / \\mathrm{s}$. Since $\\omega_{0}^{2}>\\alpha^{2}$, the roots of the characteristic equation are complex.

The circuit may contain stored energy at the time the current source is activated. This task is illustrated by the circuit depicted in Fig. 8.11. To create a general method for finding the step response of a second-order circuit, the focus is on calculating the current in the inductive branch, $\\left(i_{L}\\right)$. This current is notable because it does not decrease to zero as time ($t$) increases. After the switch has been open for a considerable time, the inductor current matches the direct current source current $I$. For the purpose of understanding the method to find the step response, we assume that the initial energy stored in the circuit is zero. This assumption streamlines the calculations without altering the fundamental process.

In each case, the primed constants can be indirectly determined in terms of the arbitrary constants associated with the voltage solution. However, this method is cumbersome.\n\nThe Direct Approach\n\nIt is much simpler to find the primed constants directly in terms of the initial values of the response function. For the circuit under discussion, we would determine the primed constants from \\( i_L(0) \\) and \\( \\frac{di_L(0)}{dt} \\).\n\nThe solution for a second-order differential equation with a constant driving function is the sum of the forced response and a response function identical in form to the natural response. Thus, we can always express the solution for the step response in the form:\n\n\\[ i = I_f + \\left\\{ \\text{function of the same form as the natural response} \\right\\} \\]\n\nor\n\n\\[ v = V_f + \\left\\{ \\text{function of the same form as the natural response} \\right\\} \\]\n\nwhere \\( I_f \\) and \\( V_f \\) represent the final value of the response function. The final value may be zero, as was the case with the voltage \\( v \\) in the circuit in Fig. 8.8.\n\nExamples 8.6-8.10 demonstrate the method for finding the step response of a parallel RLC circuit using the direct approach.\n\n### Example 8.6: Finding the Overdamped Step Response of a Parallel RLC Circuit\n\nThe initial energy stored in the circuit in Fig. 8.12 is zero. At \\( t = 0 \\), a DC current source of 24 mA is applied to the circuit. The value of the resistor is \\( 400 \\Omega \\).\n\n#### Solution\n\na) Since no energy is stored in the circuit prior to the application of the DC current source, the initial current in the inductor is zero. The inductor prevents an instantaneous change in inductor current; hence \\( i_L(0) = 0 \\) immediately after the switch is opened.\nb) The initial voltage across the capacitor is zero before the switch is opened; therefore, it remains zero immediately after. Now, because \\( v = L \\frac{di_L}{dt} \\),\n\n\\[ \\frac{di_L}{dt}(0^+) = 0 \\]\n\nc) From the circuit elements, we derive\n\n\\[ \\omega_0^2 = \\frac{1}{LC} = \\frac{10^{12}}{(25)(25)} = 16 \\times 10^8 \\]\n\\[ \\alpha = \\frac{1}{2RC} = \\frac{10^9}{(2)(400)(25)} = 5 \\times 10^4 \\text{ rad/s} \\]\n\nor\n\n\\[ \\alpha^2 = 25 \\times 10^8 \\]\n\nBecause \\( \\omega_0^2 < \\alpha^2 \\), the roots of the characteristic equation are real and distinct. Thus\n\n\\[ s_1 = -5 \\times 10^4 + 3 \\times 10^4 = -20,000 \\text{ rad/s} \\]\n\\[ s_2 = -5 \\times 10^4 - 3 \\times 10^4 = -80,000 \\text{ rad/s} \\]\n\nd) Since the roots of the characteristic equation are real and distinct, the inductor current response will be overdamped. Thus \\( i_L(t) \\) takes the form of the equation for \\( i_L \\) with \\( s_1 \\) and \\( s_2 \\), namely,\n\n\\[ i_L = I_f + A_1' e^{s_1 t} + A_2' e^{s_2 t} \\]\n\nHence, from this solution, the two simultaneous equations that determine \\( A_1' \\) and \\( A_2' \\) are\n\n\\[ i_L(0) = I_f + A_1' + A_2' = 0 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{di_L}{dt}(0) = s_1 A_1' + s_2 A_2' = 0 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( A_1' \\) and \\( A_2' \\) gives\n\n\\[ A_1' = -32 \\text{ mA} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad A_2' = 8 \\text{ mA} \\]\n\nThe numerical solution for \\( i_L(t) \\) is\n\n\\[ i_L(t) = (24 - 32 e^{-20,000 t} + 8 e^{-80,000 t}) \\text{ mA}, \\quad t \\geq 0 \\]\n\n### Example 8.7: Finding the Underdamped Step Response of a Parallel RLC Circuit\n\nThe resistor in the circuit in Example 8.6 (Fig. 8.12) is increased to \\( 625 \\Omega \\). Find \\( i_L(t) \\) for \\( t \\geq 0 \\).\n\n#### Solution\n\nSince \\( L \\) and \\( C \\) remain constant, \\( \\omega_0^2 \\) retains the same value as in Example 8.6; that is, \\( \\omega_0^2 = 16 \\times 10^8 \\). Increasing \\( R \\) to \\( 625 \\Omega \\) decreases \\( \\alpha \\) to \\( 3.2 \\times 10^4 \\text{ rad/s} \\). With \\( \\omega_0^2 > \\alpha^2 \\), the roots of the characteristic equation are complex. Hence\n\n\\[ s_1 = -3.2 \\times 10^4 + j 2.4 \\times 10^4 \\text{ rad/s} \\]\n\\[ s_2 = -3.2 \\times 10^4 - j 2.4 \\times 10^4 \\text{ rad/s} \\]\n\nThe current response is now underdamped and follows the equation for \\( i_L \\) with complex roots:\n\n\\[ i_L(t) = I_f + B_1' e^{-\\alpha t} \\cos \\omega_d t + B_2' e^{-\\alpha t} \\sin \\omega_d t \\]\n\nHere, \\( \\alpha \\) is \\( 32,000 \\text{ rad/s} \\), \\( \\omega_d \\) is \\( 24,000 \\text{ rad/s} \\), and \\( I_f \\) is 24 mA.\n\nAs in Example 8.6, \\( B_1' \\) and \\( B_2' \\) are determined from the initial conditions. Thus, the two simultaneous equations are\n\n\\[ i_L(0) = I_f + B_1' = 0 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{di_L}{dt}(0) = \\omega_d B_2' - \\alpha B_1' = 0 \\]\n\nSolving these gives\n\n\\[ B_1' = -24 \\text{ mA} \\]\n\\[ B_2' = -32 \\text{ mA} \\]\n\nThe numerical solution for \\( i_L(t) \\) is\n\n\\[ i_L(t) = (24 - 24 e^{-32,000 t} \\cos 24,000 t - 32 e^{-32,000 t} \\sin 24,000 t) \\text{ mA}, \\quad t \\geq 0 \\]\n\n### Example 8.8: Finding the Critically Damped Step Response of a Parallel RLC Circuit\n\nThe resistor in the circuit in Example 8.6 (Fig. 8.12) is set at \\( 500 \\Omega \\). Find \\( i_L \\) for \\( t \\geq 0 \\).\n\n#### Solution\n\nWe know that \\( \\omega_0^2 \\) remains at \\( 16 \\times 10^8 \\). With \\( R \\) set at \\( 500 \\Omega \\), \\( \\alpha \\) becomes \\( 4 \\times 10^4 \\text{ s}^{-1} \\), which corresponds to critical damping. Therefore, the solution for \\( i_L(t) \\) takes the form of the equation for \\( i_L \\) with critical damping:\n\n\\[ i_L(t) = I_f + D_1' t e^{-\\alpha t} + D_2' e^{-\\alpha t} \\]\n\nAgain, \\( D_1' \\) and \\( D_2' \\) are computed from the initial conditions, or\n\n\\[ i_L(0) = I_f + D_2' = 0 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{di_L}{dt}(0) = D_1' - \\alpha D_2' = 0 \\]\n\nSolving these gives\n\n\\[ D_1' = -960,000 \\text{ mA/s} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad D_2' = -24 \\text{ mA} \\]\n\nThe numerical expression for \\( i_L(t) \\) is\n\n\\[ i_L(t) = (24 - 960,000 t e^{-40,000 t} - 24 e^{-40,000 t}) \\text{ mA}, \\quad t \\geq 0 \\]\n\n### Example 8.9: Comparing the Three-Step Response Forms\n\na) Plot on a single graph, over a range from 0 to \\( 220 \\mu \\text{s} \\), the overdamped, underdamped, and critically damped responses derived in Examples 8.6-8.8.\nb) Use the plots of (a) to find the time required for \\( i_L \\) to reach 90% of its final value.\nc) Based on the results obtained in (b), which response would you specify in a design that prioritizes reaching 90% of the final value of the output in the shortest time?\nd) Which response would you specify in a design that must ensure that the final value of the current is never exceeded?\n\n#### Solution\n\na) See Fig. 8.13.\nb) The final value of \\( i_L \\) is 24 mA, so we can read the times off the plots corresponding to \\( i_L = 21.6 \\text{ mA} \\). Thus \\( t_{od} = 130 \\mu \\text{s} \\), \\( t_{cd} = 97 \\mu \\text{s} \\), and \\( t_{ud} = 74 \\mu \\text{s} \\).\nc) The underdamped response reaches 90% of the final value in the fastest time, so it is the preferred response type when speed is the primary design consideration.\nd) The underdamped response overshoots the final value of current, whereas neither the critically damped nor the overdamped response produces currents exceeding 24 mA. Although either of the latter two responses would satisfy the design specification, the overdamped response is the most practical choice. It would be unrealistic to require a design to achieve the exact component values that ensure a critically damped response.\n\n### Example 8.10: Finding Step Response of a Parallel RLC Circuit with Initial Stored Energy\n\nEnergy is stored in the circuit in Example 8.8 (Fig. 8.12, with \\( R = 500 \\Omega \\)) at the instant the DC current source is applied. The initial current in the inductor is 29 mA, and the initial voltage across the capacitor is 50 V.

Therefore,\n\n\\[ L \\frac{di_L}{dt}(0^+) = 50 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{di_L}{dt}(0^+) = \\frac{50}{25} \\times 10^3 = 2000 \\text{ A/s} \\]\n\nc) From the solution of Example 8.8, we know that the current response is critically damped.

    "text": "Determining the step response of a parallel RLC circuit entails calculating the voltage across the parallel branches or the current through each branch due to a sudden application of a DC current source. It is uncertain whether energy is stored in the circuit when the current source is activated. This task is illustrated by the circuit depicted in Fig. 8.11. To establish a general method for finding the step response of a second-order circuit, we concentrate on determining the current through the inductive branch (i_L). This current is particularly noteworthy as it does not diminish to zero as time (t) progresses. Instead, after the switch has been open for an extended period, the inductor current matches the DC source current (I). To focus on the methodology for finding the step response, we assume that the initial energy stored in the circuit is negligible. This assumption simplifies the computations without altering the fundamental process. In Example 8.10, we will explore how the presence of initially stored energy influences the general procedure.\n\nTo calculate the inductor current (i_L), we must solve a second-order differential equation related to the forcing function (I), which we derive as follows. According to Kirchhoff's current law, we have:\n\ni_L + i_R + i_C = I\n\nor\n\ni_L + (v/R) + C * (dv/dt) = I\n\nSince\n\nv = L * (di_L/dt)\n\nwe obtain\n\ndv/dt = L * (d^2i_L/dt^2)\n\nSubstituting the above equations into the initial equation yields:\n\ni_L + (L/R) * (di_L/dt) + L * C * (d^2i_L/dt^2) = I\n\nFor convenience, we divide through by L * C and rearrange terms:\n\n(d^2i_L/dt^2) + (1/(R*C)) * (di_L/dt) + (i_L/(L*C)) = I/(L*C)\n\nComparing the above equation with Eq. 8.3 indicates that the presence of a non-zero term on the right-hand side of the equation modifies the task. Before demonstrating how to solve this equation directly, we will first find the solution indirectly. Understanding the solution to this equation will facilitate explaining the direct approach.\n\nThe Indirect Approach\n\nWe can find i_L indirectly by first determining the voltage (v). We utilize the techniques introduced in Section 8.2 because the differential equation that v must satisfy is the same as Eq. 8.3. To see this, we revisit Eq. 8.37 and express i_L as a function of v:\n\n(1/L) * ∫_0^t v dτ + (v/R) + C * (dv/dt) = I\n\nDifferentiating the above equation once with respect to t reduces the right-hand side to zero since I is constant. Thus:\n\n(v/L) + (1/R) * (dv/dt) + C * (d^2v/dt^2) = 0\n\nor\n\n(d^2v/dt^2) + (1/(R*C)) * (dv/dt) + (v/(L*C)) = 0\n\nAs discussed in Section 8.2, the solution for v depends on the roots of the characteristic equation. Therefore, the three possible solutions are:\n\nv = A_1 * e^(s_1 * t) + A_2 * e^(s_2 * t)\nv = B_1 * e^(-α * t) * cos(ω_d * t) + B_2 * e^(-α * t) * sin(ω_d * t)\nv = D_1 * t * e^(-α * t) + D_2 * e^(-α * t)\n\nA word of caution: Since there is a source in the circuit for t > 0, you must consider the value of the source current at t = 0+ when evaluating the coefficients in the above equations.\n\nTo find the three possible solutions for i_L, we substitute the equations for v into Eq. 8.37. You should be able to verify that the three solutions for i_L will be:\n\ni_L = I + A_1' * e^(s_1 * t) + A_2' * e^(s_2 * t)\ni_L = I + B_1' * e^(-α * t) * cos(ω_d * t) + B_2' * e^(-α * t) * sin(ω_d * t)\ni_L = I + D_1' * t * e^(-α * t) + D_2' * e^(-α * t)\n\nwhere A_1', A_2', B_1', B_2', D_1', and D_2' are arbitrary constants. In each case, the primed constants can be found indirectly in terms of the arbitrary constants associated with the voltage solution. However, this method is cumbersome.\n\nThe Direct Approach\n\nIt is much more to find the primed constants directly in terms of the initial values of the response function. For the circuit in question, we would determine the primed constants from i_L(0) and di_L(0)/dt.\n\nThe solution for a second-order differential equation with a constant forcing function equals the forced response plus a response function identical in form to the natural response. Thus, we can always represent the solution for the step response as:\n\ni = I_f + {function of the same form as the natural response}\nv = V_f + {function of the same form as the natural response}\n\nwhere I_f and V_f represent the final value of the response function. The final value may be zero, as was the case with the voltage v in the circuit in Fig. 8.8.\n\nExamples 8.6-8.10 demonstrate the technique of finding the step response of a parallel RLC circuit using the direct approach.\n\n#### Example 8.6: Finding the Overdamped Step Response of a Parallel RLC Circuit\n\nThe initial energy stored in the circuit in Fig. 8.12 is zero. At t = 0, a DC current source of 24 mA is applied to the circuit. The value of the resistor is 400 Ω.\na) What is the initial value of i_L?\nb) What is the initial value of di_L/dt?\nc) What are the roots of the characteristic equation?\nd) What is the numerical expression for i_L(t) when t ≥ 0?\n\nFigure 8.12: The circuit for Example 8.6.\n\n#### Solution\n\na) No energy is stored in the circuit prior to the application of the DC current source, so the initial current in the inductor is zero. The inductor prevents an instantaneous change in inductor current; therefore, i_L(0) = 0 immediately after the switch has been opened.\nb) The initial voltage across the capacitor is zero before the switch is opened; hence, it will be zero immediately after. Now, since v = L * (di_L/dt),\n\n(di_L/dt)(0+) = 0\n\nc) From the circuit elements, we obtain:\n\nω_0^2 = 1/(L * C) = 10^12/(25 * 25) = 16 * 10^8\nα = 1/(2 * R * C) = 10^9/(2 * 400 * 25) = 5 * 10^4 rad/s\n\nor\n\nα^2 = 25 * 10^8\n\nSince ω_0^2 < α^2, the roots of the characteristic equation are real and distinct. Thus:\n\ns_1 = -5 * 10^4 + 3 * 10^4 = -20,000 rad/s\ns_2 = -5 * 10^4 - 3 * 10^4 = -80,000 rad/s\n\nd) As the roots of the characteristic equation are real and distinct, the inductor current response will be overdamped. Thus, i_L(t) takes the form of Eq. 8.47, namely:\n\ni_L = I_f + A_1' * e^(s_1 * t) + A_2' * e^(s_2 * t)\n\nHence, from this solution, the two simultaneous equations that determine A_1' and A_2' are:\n\ni_L(0) = I_f + A_1' + A_2' = 0\n(di_L/dt)(0) = s_1 * A_1' + s_2 * A_2' = 0\n\nSolving for A_1' and A_2' gives:\n\nA_1' = -32 mA and A_2' = 8 mA\n\nThe numerical solution for i_L(t) is:\n\ni_L(t) = (24 - 32 * e^(-20,000 * t) + 8 * e^(-80,000 * t)) mA, t ≥ 0\n\n#### Example 8.7: Finding the Underdamped Step Response of a Parallel RLC Circuit\n\nThe resistor in the circuit in Example 8.6 (Fig. 8.12) is increased to 625 Ω. Find i_L(t) for t ≥ 0.\n\n#### Solution\n\nSince L and C remain unchanged, ω_0^2 retains the same value as in Example 8.6; that is, ω_0^2 = 16 * 10^8. Increasing R to 625 Ω decreases α to 3.2 * 10^4 rad/s. With ω_0^2 > α^2, the roots of the characteristic equation are complex. Therefore:\n\ns_1 = -3.2 * 10^4 + j * 2.4 * 10^4 rad/s\ns_2 = -3.2 * 10^4 - j * 2.4 * 10^4 rad/s\n\nThe current response is now underdamped and given by Eq. 8.48:\n\ni_L(t) = I_f + B_1' * e^(-α * t) * cos(ω_d * t) + B_2' * e^(-α * t) * sin(ω_d * t)\n\nHere, α is 32,000 rad/s, ω_d is 24,000 rad/s, and I_f is 24 mA.\n\nAs in Example 8.6, B_1' and B_2' are determined from the initial conditions. Thus, the two simultaneous equations are:\n\ni_L(0) = I_f + B_1' = 0\n(di_L/dt)(0) = ω_d * B_2' - α * B_1' = 0\n\nThen:\n\nB_1' = -24 mA\nB_2' = -32 mA\n\nThe numerical solution for i_L(t) is:\n\ni_L(t) = (24 - 24 * e^(-32,000 * t) * cos(24,000 * t) - 32 * e^(-32,000 * t) * sin(24,000 * t)) mA, t ≥ 0\n\n#### Example 8.8: Finding the Critically Damped Step Response of a Parallel RLC Circuit\n\nThe resistor in the circuit in Example 8.6 (Fig. 8.12) is set at 500 Ω. Find i_L for t ≥ 0.\n\n#### Solution\n\nWe know that ω_0^2 remains at 16 * 10^8. With R set at 500 Ω, α becomes 4 * 10^4 s^-1, corresponding to critical damping. Thus, the solution for i_L(t) takes the form of Eq. 8.49:\n\ni_L(t) = I_f + D_1' * t * e^(-α * t) + D_2' * e^(-α * t)\n\nAgain, D_1' and D_2' are computed from initial conditions, or:\n\ni_L(0) = I_f + D_2' = 0\n(di_L/dt)(0) = D_1' - α * D_2' = 0\n\nThus:\n\nD_1' = -960,000 mA/s and D_2' = -24 mA\n\nThe numerical expression for i_L(t) is:\n\ni_L(t) = (24 - 960,000 * t * e^(-40,000 * t) - 24 * e^(-40,000 * t)) mA, t ≥ 0\n\n#### Example 8.9: Comparing the Three Step Response Forms\n\na) Plot on a single graph, over a range from 0 to 220 μs, the overdamped, underdamped, and critically damped responses derived in Examples 8.6-8.8.\nb) Use the plots of (a) to find the time required for i_L to reach 90% of its final value.\nc) Based on the results obtained in (b), which response would you specify in a design that prioritizes reaching 90% of the final value of the output in the shortest time?\nd) Which response would you specify in a design that must ensure that the final value of the current is never exceeded?\n\n#### Solution\n\na) See Fig. 8.13.\nb) The final value of i_L is 24 mA, so we can read the times off the plots corresponding to i_L = 21.6 mA. Thus, t_od = 130 μs, t_cd = 97 μs, and t_ud = 74 μs.\nc) The underdamped response reaches 90% of the final value in the fastest time, so it is the preferred response type when speed is the most critical design specification.\nd) From the plot, you can see that the underdamped response exceeds the final value of current, whereas neither the critically damped nor the overdamped response produces currents exceeding 24 mA. Although specifying either of the latter two responses would meet the design specification, it is best to use the overdamped response. It would be impractical to require a design to achieve the exact component values that ensure a critically damped response.\n\n#### Example 8.10: Finding Step Response of a Parallel RLC Circuit with Initial Stored Energy\n\nEnergy is stored in the circuit in Example 8.8 (Fig. 8.12, with R = 500 Ω) at the instant the DC current source is applied. The initial current in the inductor is 29 mA, and the initial voltage across the capacitor is 50 V. Find:\na) i_L(0)\nb) di_L(0)/dt\nc) i_L(t) for t ≥ 0\nd) v(t) for t ≥ 0^+\n\n#### Solution\n\na) There cannot be an instantaneous change in current in an inductor, so the initial value of i_L in the first instant after the DC current source has been applied must be 29 mA.\nb) The capacitor holds the initial voltage across the inductor to 50 V. Therefore:\n\nL * (di_L/dt)(0+) = 50\n(di_L/dt)(0+) = 50/(25 * 10^-3) * 10^3 = 2000 A/s\n\nc) From the solution of Example 8.8, we know that the current response is critically damped.

Initially charged to 100V, the capacitor discharges through the inductor and resistor.\n\n#### Solution\n\na) To find $i(t)$, we first calculate the roots of the characteristic equation. Given the element values,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\omega_{0}^{2} & =\\frac{1}{L C} \\\\\n& =\\frac{\\left(10^{3}\\right)\\left(10^{6}\\right)}{(100)(0.1)}=10^{8}, \\\\\n\\alpha & =\\frac{R}{2 L} \\\\\n& =\\frac{560}{2(100)} \\times 10^{3} \\\\\n& =2800 \\mathrm{rad} / \\mathrm{s}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nComparing $\\omega_{0}^{2}$ to $\\alpha^{2}$, we observe that $\\omega_{0}^{2}>\\alpha^{2}$, since\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\alpha^{2} & =7.84 \\times 10^{6} \\\\\n& =0.0784 \\times 10^{8} .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis indicates an underdamped response, and the solution for $i(t)$ is\n\n$$\ni(t)=B_{1} e^{-\\alpha t} \\cos \\omega_{d} t+B_{2} e^{-\\alpha t} \\sin \\omega_{d} t\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha=2800 \\mathrm{rad} / \\mathrm{s}$ and $\\omega_{d}=9600 \\mathrm{rad} / \\mathrm{s}$. The coefficients $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$ are derived from the initial conditions. The inductor current is zero before the switch closes, and thus remains zero immediately after. Hence,\n\n$$\ni(0)=0=B_{1}\n$$\n\nTo find $B_{2}$, we evaluate $d i\\left(0^{+}\\right) / d t$. From the circuit, we note that, since $i(0)=0$ immediately after the switch closes, there is no voltage drop across the resistor.

Find $v_{C}(t)$ for $t \\geq 0$.\n\nThe circuit of Fig. 8.17 is an RLC series circuit with a voltage source, switch, inductor, resistor, and capacitor. The voltage across the capacitor is denoted as $v_{C}$.\n\n#### Solution\n\nThe roots of the characteristic equation are\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ns_{1} & =-\\frac{280}{0.2}+\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{280}{0.2}\\right)^{2}-\\frac{10^{6}}{(0.1)(0.4)}} \\\\\n& =(-1400+j 4800) \\mathrm{rad} / \\mathrm{s} \\\\\ns_{2} & =(-1400-j 4800) \\mathrm{rad} / \\mathrm{s}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe presence of complex roots indicates an underdamped voltage response.

To illustrate the natural response, we examine the series RLC circuit depicted in Figure 8.14.
